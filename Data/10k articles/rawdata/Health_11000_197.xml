An ongoing [[food safety]] crisis in which numerous [[punnet]]s of [[strawberry|strawberries]] grown in [[Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]] were found to be contaminated with needles began in September 2018. [[Queensland Police]] reported that by November 2018, there had been 186 reports of contamination nationally.

==Contamination==
On 9 September 2018, several days prior to any official announcement of contamination, a [[Facebook]] user posted a warning about Berry Obsession strawberries purchased from [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] [[Strathpine Centre]] in [[Moreton Bay Regional Council|Moreton Bay]], north of [[Brisbane]]. The user reported that his friend had swallowed part of a needle and was in the [[emergency department]] at hospital. A second victim had called Woolworths on 11 September. The affected strawberries were not withdrawn and the contamination first publicly reported until 12 September. In the following days, dozens of contaminated punnets of strawberries grown in Queensland and Western Australia were discovered in NSW, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/annastacia-palaszczuk-pledges-1m-for-strawberry-growers-as-vision-emerges-of-dumped-berries/news-story/cabbecbb53cbd3c71d5d1edb5eb857c1|title=Student ‘lies’ about strawberry injury as Annastacia Palaszczuk promises $1m for growers|last=Owens|first=Jared|last2=McKenna|first2=Michael|date=18 September 2018|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-18|subscription=yes|last3=Taylor|first3=Paige}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases are believed to be hoaxes. A South Australian man was arrested on September 21 after faking a contamination,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/adelaide-man-charged-over-strawberry-contamination-claim/news-story/07df1a7705958e2850df4ea663212ccc |title=Adelaide man charged over strawberry contamination claim |access-date=2018-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921113444/https://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/adelaide-man-charged-over-strawberry-contamination-claim/news-story/07df1a7705958e2850df4ea663212ccc |archive-date=2018-09-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will face court in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adelaide man stands by needle in strawberry claim |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-24/sa-man-in-court-over-false-strawberry-needle-report/10423036 |accessdate=24 October 2018 |work=ABC News |date=24 October 2018 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affected brands==
As of 16 September 2018, the following brands have been identified by authorities as being involved in the contamination:

Strawberries grown in Queensland:
*Donnybrook Berries
*Love Berry
*Delightful Strawberries
*Oasis brands
*Berry Obsession
*Berry Licious

Strawberries grown in Western Australia:
*Mal's Black Label 
*Australian Choice

Police and state health authorities have recommend consumers either dispose of affected brands or return to place of purchase. They also recommend consumers cut up other brands before eating. Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young stated that "If they do have any strawberries it would be safest to dispose of them."

Both Coles and Aldi removed all strawberries from their shelves, but planned to restock after 18 September. Woolworths had removed affected brands only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/strawberry-fund-set-up-for-farmers-qld-premier-says/10262804|title=Strawberry growers plead for common sense, accuse authorities of mishandling issue|last=Bavas|first=Josh|date=2018-09-18|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918163445/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/strawberry-fund-set-up-for-farmers-qld-premier-says/10262804|archive-date=2018-09-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Woolworths later removed sewing needles from sale as a temporary measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woolworths to stop selling sewing needles amid fruit contamination scare |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-20/woolworths-dumps-needle-sales-due-to-fruit-contamination/10285368 |accessdate=20 September 2018 |work=ABC News |date=20 September 2018 |language=en-AU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921022150/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-20/woolworths-dumps-needle-sales-due-to-fruit-contamination/10285368 |archive-date=2018-09-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 September, needles were found in "Australian Choice" brand strawberries sold in Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australian strawberries pulled from New Zealand shelves after needles found |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/23/australian-strawberries-pulled-from-new-zealand-shelves-after-needles-found |work=the Guardian |date=23 September 2018 |language=en |access-date=2018-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923105125/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/23/australian-strawberries-pulled-from-new-zealand-shelves-after-needles-found |archive-date=2018-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
===Investigation===
The Queensland Strawberry Growers Association initially stated they had "reason to suspect" a "disgruntled" former packing employee was responsible for the contamination.&lt;ref name="Strawberry recall"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vujkovic |first1=Melanie |last2=Horn |first2=Allyson |date=13 September 2018 |title=Strawberry recall: Disgruntled ex-employee believed to be behind sewing needles in strawberries |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-12/strawberry-investigation-after-sewing-needles-found-inside/10237954 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location= |access-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915153134/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-12/strawberry-investigation-after-sewing-needles-found-inside/10237954 |archive-date=2018-09-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queensland Police]] Acting Chief Superintendent Terry Lawrence subsequently cast doubt upon that theory, stating "This was an earlier comment by the Strawberry Growers Association, it's something we don't subscribe to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Strawberry contamination prompts $100,000 reward in search for culprit |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-15/strawberry-contamination-prompts-100000-reward/10250876 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location= |date=13 September 2018 |access-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915143939/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-15/strawberry-contamination-prompts-100000-reward/10250876 |archive-date=2018-09-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Schultz, the vice-president of the Queensland Strawberry Growers Association described the contamination as an act of "commercial terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Siddique |first=Haroon |date=17 September 2018 |title=Strawberry needle sabotage scare spreads to all six Australian states |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/17/australian-police-say-needle-found-in-banana-as-strawberry-sabotage-spreads |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[Sydney]] |access-date=18 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917171250/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/17/australian-police-say-needle-found-in-banana-as-strawberry-sabotage-spreads |archive-date=2018-09-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Holl, a strawberry grower from Western Australia told the ABC that he believed someone had a "vendetta" against the strawberry industry, suggesting otherwise the contamination could be a "terrorist act".&lt;ref name="ABC metal detectors"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weber |first1=David |last2=Prendergast |first2=Jo |date=17 September 2018 |title=Strawberry needle scare: Growers to look to metal detectors to contain contamination crisis|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-17/wa-drawn-into-strawberry-contamination-scare/10254746 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location= |access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] reported on Thursday that "Police believe they have contained the threat and assured consumers would be able to safely buy strawberries again from Thursday, when stock is replaced."&lt;ref name="Strawberry recall"/&gt;

As of 19 September, [[Queensland Police]] have more than 100 officers, including 60 detectives, working on the investigation into the contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caldwell |first=Felicity |date=19 September 2018 |title=Strawberry copycats are wasting police time, says Queensland Premier |url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/strawberry-copycats-are-wasting-police-time-says-queensland-premier-20180919-p504ms.html |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |location=[[Brisbane]] |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923235049/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/strawberry-copycats-are-wasting-police-time-says-queensland-premier-20180919-p504ms.html |archive-date=2018-09-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 15 October [[Queensland Police]] scaled this back to one full time detective amid a lack of clear leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/queensland-police-scale-back-strawberry-probe-to-one-full-time-detective-20181015-p509ti.html|title=Queensland police scale back strawberry probe to one full-time detective|first=Mark|last=Solomons|date=15 October 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government response===
On 15 September 2018, Queensland Premier [[Annastacia Palaszczuk]] announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for the sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crockford |first=Toby |date=15 September 2018 |title=Queensland Premier puts $100,000 bounty on strawberry saboteur |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/queensland/queensland-premier-puts-100-000-bounty-on-strawberry-saboteur-20180915-p503y4.html |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=[[Sydney]] |access-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915054601/https://www.smh.com.au/national/queensland/queensland-premier-puts-100-000-bounty-on-strawberry-saboteur-20180915-p503y4.html |archive-date=2018-09-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September, Palaszczuk announced a $1 million assistance package for the strawberry industry in the state, telling State Parliament that "This past week, Queensland has been the victim of an ugly, calculated and despicable crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Govt funding for Qld strawberry industry |url=https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/09/18/17/21/govt-funding-for-qld-strawberry-industry |work=[[Nine News]] |location= |date=18 September 2018 |access-date=18 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918103823/https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/09/18/17/21/govt-funding-for-qld-strawberry-industry |archive-date=2018-09-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2018/9/18/palaszczuk-government-commits-1-million-to-strawberry-farmers|title=Palaszczuk Government commits $1 million to strawberry farmers|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918160841/http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2018/9/18/palaszczuk-government-commits-1-million-to-strawberry-farmers|archive-date=2018-09-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 18 September, Premier of Western Australia [[Mark McGowan]] announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to a prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Colvin |first=Ali |date=18 September 2018 |title=Strawberry needle scare: WA Government offers $100k reward for information |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/strawberry-needle-scare-contamination-reward-western-australia/10264502 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location= |access-date=18 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918163507/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/strawberry-needle-scare-contamination-reward-western-australia/10264502 |archive-date=2018-09-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two largest food retailers in [[New Zealand]], [[Woolworths NZ]] and [[Foodstuffs]] announced they would be removing Australian-grown strawberries from their shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title='Commercial terrorism' has brought strawberry industry to its knees - NZ supermarket chains stop Aussie imports over needle concerns |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/commercial-terrorism-has-brought-strawberry-industry-its-knees-nz-supermarket-chains-stop-aussie-imports-over-needle-concerns |work=[[TVNZ]] |location= |date=17 September 2018 |access-date=18 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917224630/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/commercial-terrorism-has-brought-strawberry-industry-its-knees-nz-supermarket-chains-stop-aussie-imports-over-needle-concerns |archive-date=2018-09-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 18 September 2018, Senator [[Bridget McKenzie]], the Minister for Regional Services, issued a media statement, describing the contamination as "deliberate sabotage" and urging consumers to "exercise caution and cut up their fruit before consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2018-mckenzie062.htm|title=Media Statement – Strawberries|first=McKenzie, Bridget.

====Criticism of response====
As of 17 September 2018, a consumer-level food recall of any affected brands has yet to be issued. Instead, only a "trade recall" has been issued. [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] describes a trade recall as a recall "conducted when the food has not been sold directly to consumers. It involves recovery of the product from distribution centres and wholesalers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/industry/foodrecalls/recalls/pages/whatisafoodrecall.aspx|title=What is a food recall|website=www.foodstandards.gov.au|accessdate=16 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916235806/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/industry/foodrecalls/recalls/pages/whatisafoodrecall.aspx|archive-date=2018-09-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Melissa Fitzgerald, a food safety expert at the [[University of Queensland]], told the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] she was "surprised" there had not been a consumer-level recall given the products had been sold to individual customers. The recall was not mentioned on supermarket or government food safety websites—something Professor Fitzgerald would have expected. Professor Fitzgerald said "I would expect people to go to the websites for information...People may be quite surprised not to find any information on the websites where they normally would." Professor Fitzgerald criticised the delay between the first incident on 9 September and the public warning on 12 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gartry |first=Laura |date=14 September 2018 |title=Needles in strawberries: Food expert says Government's recall response not appropriate |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-14/safety-response-to-strawberry-tampered-with-needles-not-enough/10242700 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location= |access-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915165336/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-14/safety-response-to-strawberry-tampered-with-needles-not-enough/10242700 |archive-date=2018-09-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queensland Strawberry Industry Development Officer Jennifer Rowling accused "some authoritative spokespeople" of mishandling the response to the incident. She also criticised a "sometimes hysterical media" and accused them of costing agricultural businesses millions of dollars. Rowling insisted only three brands had been affected and said "All other reported cases have either been copycats or unsubstantiated claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bavas |first=Josh |date=18 September 2018 |title=Strawberry needle tampering crisis: Queensland growers call for 'calm and common sense' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/strawberry-fund-set-up-for-farmers-qld-premier-says/10262804 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location= |access-date=18 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918163445/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/strawberry-fund-set-up-for-farmers-qld-premier-says/10262804 |archive-date=2018-09-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grower measures and responses ===
On 15 September, Suncoast Harvest farm of the Sunshine Coast announced on Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thesuncoastharvest/posts/444593375947193?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAxnBa6hBvO2KaTpeAKgo3xr0cUeYOwC8m6D9hJMqBleAAcnWKxJ1OBX3BEkmEXIuF805LYTaPDc8fdcq7C-tVDD3_JCpy1sSHzMzc3rW1WmcTyj9WaID1yD1NARurwn5qFv8kID1xIitBkxrKWk_XE3GYGum0DT5fRM6dfg226yv9ObEVu&amp;__tn__=-R|title=Suncoast Harvest|last=|first=|date=15 September 2018|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they were ceasing growing strawberries for the remainder of the year, resulting in job losses for 100 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Strawberry sabotage leaves 100 out of work|last=|first=|date=19 September 2018|work=Sunshine Coast Daily|access-date=|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some growers started ordering and installing [[metal detector]]s to protect their strawberries from contamination.&lt;ref name="ABC metal detectors"/&gt;

Some farms have had to dispose of strawberries in response to the crisis.

[[File:Gillespie 1810 PresBook.jpg|thumb]]
'''Alexander Gillespie''' [[FRSE]], FRCSEd (21 March 1776 – 1 September 1859) was a Scottish surgeon. He is one of the few persons to have served two non-consecutive periods  as President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]]. He was President from 1810 to 1812 and again from 1818 to 1820.

==Early life and education==
Alexander Gillespie was born in Ayr, the son of Dr Thomas Gillespie, an Ayrshire physician, and his wife Jean Gillespie (née Thomson).&lt;ref&gt;Scotland's People. Old Parish Registers births, 578/40178 Ayr https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/view-image/nrs_opr_records/3773706?image=178&lt;/ref&gt;  He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1794 and a Fellow in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. (1874). List of Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from ... 1581 to ... 1873. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He obtained the degree of MD from the [[University of St Andrews Medical School]] in 1822, some 28 years after he began to practise medicine. This was common practice at this time with the St Andrews degrees being conferred on the basis of a written testimonial and payment of a fee, without the need for the candidate visiting St Andrews&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, JA. Medical Teaching in St. Andrews University 1413-1972. British Medical Journal, 1972;3:38-41. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1788514/pdf/brmedj02211-0050.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Like many practitioners of his day he combined surgery with general practice. He had appointments as surgeon to a number of institutions including the Lock Hospital in Surgeons' Square, the Edinburgh Lunatic Asylum and Gillespie's Hospital for the Elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Directory for Scotland, London, John Churchill, 1859 p31.&lt;/ref&gt;  
He was surgeon to Donaldson's Hospital, a school which had family connections. His sister Jane Gillespie (1770&amp;ndash;1828)&lt;ref&gt;The Edinburgh Magazine, Or Literary Miscellany,(1792) Edinburgh. Volume 16 p 359. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B183AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA350&amp;lpg=PA350&amp;q=jane+gillespie+donaldson+edinburgh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4snJR2Iur5&amp;sig=dg6q98J64G1fxIwx7iWnbKbdAAM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjM3sPJgcHXAhUD2RoKHXTFDUoQ6AEIVTAO#v=onepage&amp;q=jane%20gillespie%20donaldson%20edinburgh&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; married [[James Donaldson (publisher)|James Donaldson]] (1751&amp;ndash;1830), who bequeathed a large part of his estate to establish [[Donaldson's Hospital]], founded to maintain and educate poor children.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, James. (ed) ''Donaldson's Hospital'' in Titan: a monthly magazine.Edinburgh, James Hogg, Vol 4, 1850. p103. https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=i7ERAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;pg=GBS.PP103&lt;/ref&gt; There is an insight into Alexander Gillespie's practice in his son's obituary which observes that Alexander Gillespie 'worked his easy largely aristocratic practice with a light hand...'&lt;ref&gt;Obituary. Dr James Donaldson Gillespie. Edinburgh Medical Journal. January 1892 p674&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership of societies==
In 1806 he is listed as a member of the Royal Highland Agricultural Society.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Directory for Scotland, London, John Churchill, 1859 p31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Thomas Allan]], [[James Russell (surgeon)|James Russell]] and [[Ninian Imrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and family==
In 1818 he was living at 30 York Place in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New Town]], a handsome Georgian terraced townhouse. Post Office Directories continue to show him here for many years but his given occupation changes from surgeon to doctor in 1834, suggesting that he had given up surgery in favour of general practice.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directories 1818 to 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Edinburgh on 1 September 1859 at 45 Castle Street and is buried in [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Scotland's People Statutory Register of deaths 1859  652/2411  https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/view-image/nrs_stat_deaths/298042&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 1812 he had married Eliza Mary Shirriff. &lt;ref&gt;Scots Magazine 1812, Vol 75, p478.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cT4zAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA478&amp;lpg=PA478&amp;dq=Eliza+Mary+Shiriff&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GHFa_AGi5G&amp;sig=JLeZuuTi6oc-Tc0gVXwb8zjyTZY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiur_eXysHXAhVDFMAKHSERBccQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Eliza%20Mary%20Shiriff&amp;f=false &lt;/ref&gt;
Their son, James Donaldson Gillespie (1824-1891) graduated MD from the University of Edinburgh, gained the FRCSEd diploma, became a surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and was President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh between 1869 and 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary.

==Mental Health Recovery Star==

In 2008 The Association, with Triangle Consulting, worked with [[Mental health consumer|service users]] and The Association's members to develop the Mental Health Recovery Star,&lt;ref name="Outcomes Star"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.outcomesstar.org.uk/using-the-star/see-the-stars/recovery-star/ | title=Recovery Star: The Outcomes Star for adults managing their mental health | publisher=Triangle Consulting Social Enterprise Limited  | accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was recommended by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] [[New Horizons (strategy)|New Horizons]] programme and has been developed for use in adult mental health services. The Recovery Star is a [[Care Programme Approach|key-working]] tool that enables staff to support individuals they work with to understand their recovery and plot their progress.

'''Bratsk Reservoir''' ({{lang-ru|Бра́тское водохрани́лище}}, ''Bratskoye Reservoir'') is a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] on the [[Angara River]], located in [[Irkutsk Oblast]],&lt;ref&gt;Partly in the [[Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]]. It is named after the city of [[Bratsk]], the largest city adjacent to the reservoir. It has a surface area of {{convert|5470|km2}} and a maximum volume of 169.27 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;  litres  (37.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;  gallons).&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', entry on [http://dict.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00010/11400.htm&amp;encpage=bse&amp;mrkp=http%3A//hghltd.yandex.com/yandbtm%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//encycl.yandex.ru/texts/bse/00010/11400.htm%26text%3D%25E1%25F0%25E0%25F2%25F1%25EA%25EE%25E5%2B%25E2%25EE%25E4%25EE%25F5%25F0%25E0%25ED%25E8%25EB%25E8%25F9%25E5%26reqtext%3D%2528%25E1%25F0%25E0%25F2%25F1%25EA%25EE%25E5%253A%253A235820%2B%2526%2B%25E2%25EE%25E4%25EE%25F5%25F0%25E0%25ED%25E8%25EB%25E8%25F9%25E5%253A%253A349237%2529//6%26%26isu%3D2 Братское водохранилище]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[concrete]] dam of the [[Bratsk hydroelectric plant]] was completed in 1967. It is {{convert|125|m|ft|0}} high and {{convert|4417|m|ft|0}} long. The [[Baikal Amur Mainline]] railroad runs along the top of the dam. At the time of its inauguration, the reservoir was the [[Artificial lake#List of reservoirs by volume|largest artificial lake]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;George St. George. ''Siberia: The New Frontier''. D. McKay Co, 1969. Page 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Its electrical power capacity is 4,500&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|MW]].&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt;

==In literature==
The epic construction of the Bratsk Dam  is the subject of a large eponymous poem by [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]].
Much later (1976), the impact of the reservoir construction on the life of the villagers upstream, many of whom had to be relocated from the flooded areas, or lost some the best lands of their collective farms, became the motive of [[Valentin Rasputin]]'s novel ''Farewell to Matyora''.

The '''Canadian AIDS Society''' (CAS) is a national coalition of community-based [[AIDS service organization]]s across [[Canada]]. Registered as a charity since 1988, CAS has a mandate to improve the response to [[HIV/AIDS in Canada]] across all sectors of society, and to support people and communities living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/t3010form22quickview-eng.action?&amp;fpe=2017-03-31&amp;b=120863311RR0001|title=Canadian Revenue Agency's Charity Listing|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Establishment===
CAS was established after the first two national conferences on HIV/AIDS in Montreal (1985) and Toronto (1986) to act as a national umbrella organization for AIDS service organizations in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdnaids.ca/about-us/history/|title=History of Canadian AIDS Society|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian AIDS Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original founding member organizations were:

* AIDS Calgary Awareness Association
* AIDS Committee of London
* AIDS Committee of Ottawa
* AIDS Committee of Thunder Bay
* AIDS Committee of Toronto
* AIDS Committee of Windsor
* AIDS Network of Edmonton
* AIDS Regina
* AIDS Saskatoon
*[[AIDS Vancouver]]
* AIDS Vancouver Island
* Comité sida aide Montréal (C-SAM)
* Metro Area Committee on AIDS (Halifax)
* Newfoundland and Labrador AIDS Association
* Winnepeg Gay Community Health Centre

Before CAS became a registered charitable organization with paid staff in Ottawa in 1988, a voluntary secretariat steered the organization operating out of the AIDS Network of Edmonton office.

==Objective==
CAS's objective is to strengthen the response to HIV/AIDS in Canada and enrich the lives of people and communities living with, and affected by, HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdnaids.ca/about-us/|title=About us - Canadian AIDS Society|website=www.cdnaids.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure==
===Member Organizations===
CAS represents AIDS service organizations across Canada in almost every Province.  A full list of member organizations is available on CAS's website.[https://www.cdnaids.ca/members/]

===National Partners===
CAS collaborates with other nationally-focused organizations the address HIV/AIDS in Canada. These partners include:

* Canadian Association for HIV Research (CAHR)
* Canadian Public Health Association (CPHA)
* Interagency Coalition on AIDS and Development (ICAD)
* [[Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network]]
* realize (formerly CWGHR)
* CATIE
* CTAC
* Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network
* CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network

=== Governance ===
CAS is governed by a board of directors that includes two representatives from each region of Canada, one of whom must by HIV-positive. Additionally, CAS has two at-large board of director seats for one man and one woman to ensure gender diverse representation at the board level. There is also one board of director seat reserved for an HIV-positive young person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdnaids.ca/contact-us/board-of-directors/|title=Board of Directors - Canadian AIDS Society|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian AIDS Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Funding===
CAS has historically been funded by the Federal government through [[Health Canada]] and/or the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]], however since the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] reorganized funding priorities for HIV and Hepatitis-C in 2016 CAS has received no federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2018/04/24/dozens-of-hiv-aids-organizations-struggling-from-lost-funding/|title=Dozens of HIV/AIDS organizations struggling from lost funding - iPolitics|date=2018-04-24|work=iPolitics|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change in funding, and the general under-funding of HIV/AIDS service organizations in Canada more broadly, resulted in sharp criticism of the Liberal government, particularly by CAS's national partner, the [[Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidslaw.ca/site/download/16731/|title=The Missing Millions: Stopping and Reversing the Steady Erosion of Federal HIV Funding|last=Elliot|first=Richard|date=|website=Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Notable Programs and Campaigns ==

===AIDS Awareness Week &amp; World AIDS Day===
From 1991-2001 CAS ran an annual AIDS Awareness Week campaign with support from various governmental, corporate, and charitable organizations including [[Health Canada|Health and Welfare Canada]], the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]], the [[Canadian Hemophilia Society]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi Strauss &amp; Co]]., and others. AIDS Awareness Week took place in October, but after this project came to an end when the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] stopped funding for it, CAS's awareness campaigns largely revolved around [[World AIDS Day]] of each year.  Each year's AIDS Awareness Week campaign, was organized around a theme. Ads were often developed by [[Ottawa]] creative agency [[McMillan (agency)|McMillan]] and appeared in wide-circulation magazines and periodicals including [[MacLean's]], [[L'actualité]], and [[The Globe and Mail]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS121769+01-Dec-2008+MW20081201| title=Reuters| accessdate=2009-02-13 | date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===[https://quilt.ca AIDS Memorial Quilt]===
The Canadian AIDS Memorial Quilt was a project initiated by AIDS activists in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax, NS]] who organized a tour of the American [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|AIDS Memorial Quilt]] throughout Canada in 1989 which resulted in the creation of hundreds of Canadian quilt panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grandriver-rainbowhistory.ca/tri-PrideEvents/2003tri-Pride/2003-06-12-15CanadianAIDSMemorialQuiltProgramme.pdf|title=The Canadian AIDS Memorial Quilt Event Brochure|last=The NAMES project - Canada|first=|date=2003-06-12|website=Grand River Rainbow Historical Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the activists that began the project passed stewardship of the quilt onto CAS, but in 1994 The NAMES project | le projet des NOMS - Canada was established with Lawrence Eisener as the founding Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=3040372|title=Federal Corporation Information - 304037-2 - Online Filing Centre - Corporations Canada - Corporations - Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|website=www.ic.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Mactavish and John Stinson were also involved in the establishing of the organization which took over stewardship of the quilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://winnipegsun.com/2015/10/17/20-questions-with-john-stinson/wcm/37d358f1-37bc-48b4-8e27-ab40f613cadf|title=20 Questions with John Stinson|date=2015-10-17|work=Winnipeg Sun|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAMES project - Canada maintained and grew the quilt from 400 panels in 1993 to over 600 panels today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/aids-quilt-canada-1.4622347|title=AIDS group mulls how to preserve a Canadian quilt {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quilt was response to the AIDS epidemic affecting the country at the time. Central goals of the quilt were: 1) To commemorate the lives of Canadians who had died of AIDS-related illness(es); 2) to raise funds for community-based [[AIDS service organization]]. In 2013 The NAMES project - Canada dissolved and once again CAS became the steward of the quilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidsmemorial.info/memorial/id=39/canadian_aids_memorial_quilt.html|title=AIDSmemorial.info - Canadian AIDS Memorial Quilt|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aidsmemorial.info|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new digital version of the quilt was launched by CAS in 2018 and is available online at quilt.ca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aidsactivisthistory.ca/2018/02/13/the-canadian-aids-memorial-quilt-website-launch/|title=The Canadian AIDS Memorial Quilt: Website Launch!|date=2018-02-13|work=AIDS Activist History Project|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIDS walk===
Since 1988,Canadian AIDS Society participate in numerous walks to raise money for the organization and to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS.

===[http://hivtestingday.ca/ National HIV Testing Day]===
On June 27, 2017 CAS launched a national initiative to encourage people to be tested for HIV.  Over forty community organizations participated across all regions of Canada by offering free HIV tests to anyone who wanted one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4286443/canadian-aids-society-year-launching-national-hiv-testing-day/|title=Canadian AIDS Society lives to see another year, launching national ‘HIV testing day’|last=Britneff|first=Beatrice|date=|website=Globe and Mail|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Testing Day in Canada, much like its [[National HIV Testing Day (United States)|American counterpart]] that was established in 1995, encourages the use of [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|Point-of-Care Testing (POCT)]] where participants can get their results in a few minutes as opposed two-weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdnaids.ca/testing/|title=HIV Testing Day - Canadian AIDS Society|website=www.cdnaids.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study on the efficacy of National Testing Day in the United States indicates that the program successfully tested more people from priority populations and identified more previously undiagnosed HIV-positive people than during control weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catie.ca/en/pc/evidence-briefs/nhtd|title=National HIV Testing Day|last=|first=|date=|website=CAITE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10028">'''Community Options, Inc. ''' is a 501(c)3 national nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvo.net/usaid/pvo.asp?i=3043&amp;INCVOLAG=YES&amp;INCSUM=YES&amp;VolagText= USAID " Registered U.S. and International PVOs"] "USAID", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; that provides housing and employment supports &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.disability.gov/resource/community-options/ "Find organizations in your community"] " Disability.gov", 2014&lt;/ref&gt; to people with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]],  [[developmental disabilities]] and [[traumatic brain injury]]. The organizations headquarters are located in Princeton, NJ.  In 2015 Community Options was named the fourth-largest nonprofit organization based in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Mack, [http://www.njbiz.com/section/listcentral?djoPage=view_html&amp;djoPid=9913 " NEW JERSEY'S TOP Nonprofit Organizations"], ''NJBIZ'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
The organization was founded in 1989 by Robert Stack, the President and CEO, along with a small group of [[List of disability rights activists|disability advocates]] to create residential and employment supports for individuals with disabilities.  In 2008 the organization supported over 1,400 people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Dilshanie Perera, [http://www.towntopics.com/jul3008/other3.php "Princeton Resident Named to Gov. Richardson’s Task Force"], ''Town Topics'', Wednesday, 30 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Community Options, Inc. also advocates for the [[Deinstitutionalization|de-institutionalization movement]]. The organization states that all people with disabilities should live in community-based settings and be released from out-of-state-run institutions &lt;ref&gt;Matt Hammond, [http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2012/10/hopewell_to_break_ground_for_g.html "Hopewell to break ground for group home"], "The Times", 21 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Stack was born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania in 1955. He attended St. Fidelis Seminary in Butler, Pennsylvania for the priesthood. During this time, he volunteered to work with children with significant disabilities every Saturday and Wednesday afternoon. He dropped out of the Seminary and after graduating from the University of Dayton (Dayton, Ohio), went to Kent State (Kent, Ohio) to study Philosophy. In 1979 he left to work for the State of New York at the Suffolk Developmental Center as a Recreational Aid in the institution. He opened the first two state-operated group homes on the grounds of the institution. He was hired as the Executive Assistant to the Director of the Division of Mental Retardation in 1981. He wrote the original white paper converting the Division of Mental Retardation to the Division of Developmental Disabilities. It was the first time New Jersey government recognized Autism as a treatable and fundable disability.

Stack was youngest Executive Director of United Cerebral Palsy for the entire state in 1984. He founded UCP of Mercer (now enable) UCP of Morris and UPC of Atlantic and Cape May County. He was appointed as the Deputy Director over all the institutions for NJ by Eddie C. Moore in 1987. Stack closed the first institution in New Jersey in Middlesex County.

After the death of Eddie Moore, Stack became a consultant and in 1988 formed an exploratory group to look at the lack of services for people with significant disabilities in NJ, Texas, NY, PA and Tennessee. He incorporated Community Options with friends from both University of Dayton and Kent State in 1989.  In 1990 Stack introduced John F. Kennedy Jr. to the Rehabilitation Conference participants for over 2,000 in Albany, New York.

In 1992, Community Options opened their first four group homes in New Jersey.  From 1995 to 2011, group homes were opened in six other states including Pennsylvania, Texas, New York, South Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comop.org/about-us/history/ "A Brief History of Community Options, Inc."] "Community Options, Inc.", 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''[[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|epidemic]] of [[Ebola virus disease]]''' occurred in '''[[Liberia]]''' from 2014 to 2015, along with the neighbouring countries of [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. The first cases of virus were reported by late March 2014.&lt;ref name="liberianobserver.com"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/security-health/2-5-test-positive-ebola-liberia |title=2 of 5 Test Positive for Ebola in Liberia |newspaper=[[Liberian Observer]] |date=31 March 2014 |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ebola virus]], a [[biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|biosafety level four pathogen]], is an [[RNA virus]] discovered in 1976.&lt;ref name="Ebola situation assessment "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/26-september-2014/en/ |title=Experimental therapies: growing interest in the use of whole blood or plasma from recovered Ebola patients (convalescent therapies) |publisher=WHO |date=26 September 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2014 |author=statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August, a mob of residents from [[West Point, Monrovia|West Point]], an impoverished area of Monrovia, descended upon a local Ebola clinic to protest its presence. The protesters turned violent, threatening the caretakers, removing the infected patients, and looting the clinic of its supplies, including blood-stained bed sheets and mattresses.

=== September ===
By 1 September, [[Ivory Coast]] announced the opening of humanitarian corridors with its two affected neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="Ivory Coast" /&gt;

On 20 September, Liberia opened a new 150-bed treatment unit clinic in Monrovia. At the opening ceremony of the Old Island Clinic on [[Bushrod Island]] six ambulances were already waiting with suspected Ebola patients. More patients were waiting by the clinic after making their way on foot with the help of relatives.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201409221723.html |title=Liberia: 120-Bed Ebola Treatment Center Opens in Liberia |publisher=All Africa |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later 112 beds were already filled with 46 patients testing positive for Ebola, while the rest were admitted for observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/has-sierra-leone-shutdown-slowed-ebolas-spread/2014/09/22/69e8df48-4244-11e4-8042-aaff1640082e_story.html |title=Streets bustling after Sierra Leone shutdown ends |publisher=The Washington Post |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded the number of beds in the city beyond 240.&lt;ref name="who-clinic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/2014/liberia-ebola-clinic/en/ |title=Liberia: Ebola clinic fills up within hours of opening |publisher=WHO |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its capacity was exceeded within 24 hours with a shortage of staff and logistics to take care of a patient with correct precautions in place.&lt;ref name="who-clinic"/&gt; One source says it opened on 21 September 2014 with a 100-bed capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.usaid.gov/2014/09/powering-the-ebola-response-monrovias-island-clinic/ |title=Powering The Ebola Response: Monrovia’s Island Clinic |publisher=usaid.gov |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 23 September, there had been 3,458 total cases, 1,830 deaths, and 914 lab confirmed cases according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/135029/1/roadmapupdate26sept14_eng.pdf?ua=1 |title=Situation report update (Ebola response roadmap) |work=WHO |publisher=who.int |date=26 October 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September Ivory Coast resumed flights to Liberia which had been suspended since 11 August 2014, after WHO's critique for tending to economically strangle the affected nations. From the beginning of the crisis, WHO has discouraged closing the borders with afflicted countries.&lt;ref name="Ivory Coast" /&gt;

On 13 January 2015, the Liberian government announced that new cases of Ebola in Liberia were now restricted to only two of its counties: [[Grand Cape Mount County]] and [[Montserrado County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ebola-spread-now-limited-to-2-counties-in-liberia-official/|title=Ebola Spread Now Limited to 2 Counties in Liberia – Official |publisher=Scientific American|date=13 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   On 28 January, the ELWA-3 Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia was partially dismantled.

In the first week of March the [[World Health Organization]] announced that Liberia had released its last Ebola patient after going a week without any new cases of the virus being reported. If the country reports no new cases for 42 days, it will be declared Ebola-free according to the WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-31744616|title=Ebola outbreak: Liberia releases last patient|date=5 March 2015|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== June/July ===
Three months passed with no new reports of cases.

The WHO announced the male youth had been in close contact with at least 102 people with no recent history of traveling. Contact tracing followed with visitors from affected areas and those attending his funeral. On 1 July a second case was confirmed.&lt;ref name=NPR418913144&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/30/418913144/ebola-returns-to-liberia-with-a-mysterious-case-near-monrovia|title=Ebola Returns To Liberia With A Mysterious Case Near Monrovia|date=30 June 2015|work=NPR.org|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/liberia-reports-second-case-ebola-n385116|title=Liberia Reports Second Case of Ebola|date=1 July 2015|publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2 July a third new case was confirmed leading to the possibility that they might have been infected with the Ebola virus lurking in animal meat according to researchers.

==Healthcare capacity==

===Clinics===

On 20 September 2014, Liberia opened the 150-bed Old Island Clinic on [[Bushrod Island]] in Monrovia.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Another clinic in Monrovia is a 160-bed facility staffed and run by [[Médecins Sans Frontières]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Beds-scarce--staff-scarcer--in-Liberia-s-overrun-Ebola-wards |title=Beds scarce, staff scarcer, in Liberia's overrun Ebola wards |work=Jamaica Observer |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November China opened a "state of the art clinic" outside Monrovia.

== Confounding factors ==
[[File:CDC learns from Liberian District representative.jpg|thumb|300px|A CDC official consulting with a Liberian District representative about Ebola]]

=== Sanitation ===
Sanitation is a major struggle in most parts of Monrovia. There are four public toilets in the [[West Point, Monrovia|West Point]] area in Monrovia, an area with 70,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Africa water atlas"&gt;{{cite book |title=Africa water atlas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjIPf84HHnsC&amp;pg=PA255 |accessdate=30 March 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=UNEP/Earthprint |isbn=978-92-807-3110-1 |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beach and river surrounding West Point area are often used as a lavatory. The Mesurado River is a source of drinking water, and the fish from the water are a primary source of food for many.&lt;ref name="Africa water atlas"/&gt;

=== Corruption ===
{{Further information|Corruption in Liberia}}

It has been reported that body-collection teams, dispatched to collect the body of a suspected Ebola death, accepted bribes to issue falsified death certificates to family members. Due to the stigma of Ebola some families did not want to admit that their relative died from Ebola. The body of the deceased would then be left with relatives for a traditional funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-ebola-stricken-african-families-pay-bribes-for-fake-death-records-1413153854|title=Some Ebola-Stricken African Families Pay Bribes for Fake Death Records|author=Heidi Vogt|date=12 October 2014|work=WSJ|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 10-day Liberian government quarantine of the [[West Point, Monrovia|West Point]] slum in [[Monrovia]], residents were able to leave the quarantine area by bribing soldiers and police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/30/world/africa/quarantine-for-ebola-lifted-in-liberia-slum.html?_r=0|title=Quarantine for Ebola Lifted in Liberia Slum|author= NORIMITSU ONISHI |work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A journalist inside West Point told a local radio station that Liberian soldiers and police were seen "daily soliciting monies from those being quarantined in the area to escape". The journalist reported that "many of those even suspected of having the disease were given free passage to leave West Point for Monrovia city center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnnliberia.com/articles/2014/08/25/liberia-soldiers-deployed-west-point-quarantine-suspected-ebola-affected-persons|title= "LIBERIA: Soldiers Deployed At West Point To quarantine Suspected Ebola Affected Persons Accused Receiving Money To Allow Them ‘Go’", GNN Liberia, Cholo Brooks, August 25, 2014.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hiding of Ebola infected and dead ===

In October it was noted that many of the Ebola deaths and those dying were not being reported to health authorities. While the epidemic had been accelerating, the number of bodies being collected was falling. "Very, very few of those dying in the community are being brought forward," said Cokie van der Velde, who organized the collections of bodies with [[Médecins Sans Frontières]].&lt;ref name="Globalpost141010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/health/141010/familes-cant-mourn-ebola-victims-liberia|title=Some people would rather die of Ebola than stop hugging sick loved ones|work=GlobalPost|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Velde announced that the main crematorium in Monrovia was running at full capacity in Monrovia. It was cremating 80 bodies at its mass pyre per day. In early October, the number of cremations drastically decreased to 30 or 40 per day. Van der Velde said, "That means they’re being kept hidden and buried in secret". Traditional funeral rituals are a risk factor in the spread of Ebola, as the body is at its most contagious stage post-mortem.&lt;ref name="Globalpost141010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2014/08/07/people-are-struggling-to-bury-the-ebola-dead-heres-why/|title=People are struggling to bury the Ebola dead.

By late October it was reported that many beds in Liberian Ebola treatment centers were empty due to people no longer reporting suspected Ebola cases to health authorities. The assistant Liberian health minister announced at the time that an assessment of Ebola treatment units discovered that out of the 742 beds only 351 were occupied by patients.&lt;ref name="guardiansecret"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/ebola-cremation-ruling-secret-burials-liberia|title=Ebola cremation ruling prompts secret burials in Liberia|work=the Guardian|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-reporting is believed to be due to a policy decision in August to cremate all bodies of suspected Ebola victims in Monrovia. Cremation was against local culture of a traditional burial. The cremation order came after people in Monrovia's neighborhoods resisted the burial of hundreds of Ebola victims near their homes.&lt;ref name="guardiansecret" /&gt;

=== Issues within government ===
On 6 August 2014, President Sirleaf, in an emergency announcement, informed absent government ministers and civil service leaders to return to their duties in Liberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/08/27/ebola-hit-liberia-fires-absentee-ministers|title="Ebola-hit Liberia fires absentee ministers", SBS News, 27 August 2014.|work=News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August Sirleaf dismissed 10 government officials, including deputy ministers in the central government who refused to return to work. The benefits and pay for nearly twenty other high-ranking officials who refused to return were halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201409152706.html|title=allAfrica.com: Liberia: 10 Ministers Axed, Others Salaries Frozen|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-November President Sirleaf reshuffled the country's cabinet in response to widespread criticism of the government's heavy-handed yet ineffective response to the Ebola crisis. George Warner, previously the head of [[civil service]], would replace [[Walter Gwenigale]] as [[health minister]]. Sirleaf commented Gwenigale had her "full confidence" and will continue as an adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Liberia-health-minister-ousted-in-Cabinet-shuffle-20141116|title=Liberia health minister ousted in Cabinet shuffle|work=News24|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfusions of blood from Ebola survivors ===
A black market for the blood of Ebola survivors has been reported in Liberia. Buyers of the blood hope to gain immunity or recovery via a blood transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Assistance Summary|url=http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/140919_OUA_INTSUM.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These transfusions have been noted as posing a risk for the transmission of [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and other blood-borne diseases. "This has the potential to divert time and resources originally allocated to control Ebola", according to a US military report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/pentagon-dispatches-west-africa-paint-stark-portrait-ebola-epicenter-n233621|title= "Pentagon Dispatches From West Africa Paint Stark Portrait of Ebola Epicenter", Robert Windrem, NBC News, October 26th 2014.|author=Robert Windrem|work=NBC News|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local conspiracy theories ===
* The ''[[Liberian Observer]]'', a major Liberian newspaper, has repeatedly published Ebola-related conspiracy theories. In September it published an article claiming that Ebola and the [[HIV|AIDS virus]] are [[GMO|genetically modified organisms]] to be used as [[Biological warfare|bio-weapons]] on Africans in an attempt to reduce Africa’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/security/ebola-aids-manufactured-western-pharmaceuticals-us-dod|title=Ebola, AIDS Manufactured by Western Pharmaceuticals, US DoD?|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/17/the-major-liberian-newspaper-churning-out-ebola-conspiracy-after-conspiracy/|title=The major Liberian newspaper churning out Ebola conspiracy after conspiracy|work=Washington Post|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October the story went viral on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2014/10/28/Is-the-US-manufacturing-the-Ebola-virus-with-HIV|title=Claims of US manufacturing Ebola with HIV go viral|author=Jean-Jacques Cornish|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late October it was reported that harassment of gay Liberians in Monrovia was occurring after some church leaders said that "God was angry with Liberians over corruption and immoral acts such as homosexuality, and that Ebola was a punishment". The harassment included car windows being smashed and some gay people being forced from their homes and into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/us-foundation-ebola-liberia-gay-idUSKCN0IC1GV20141023?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews|title= "Gay community under attack in Liberia over Ebola outbreak", Reuters, Misha Hussain and Maria Caspani, October 23, 2014.|work=Reuters|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Some members of the community thought it was a bad spirit, a devil or poisoning."&lt;ref name="no5" /&gt;
* At the beginning of the outbreak, many did not believe that the disease existed. "I thought it was a lie (invented) to collect money because at that moment I hadn't seen people affected in my community."&lt;ref name="no5" /&gt;

[[Image:PigExtensive1.jpg|thumb|300px|A small farm in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] mountains. The land here is mostly rock and the slopes are very steep – likely unusable for agriculture, but can provide productive conditions for pigs]]
'''Extensive farming''' or '''extensive agriculture''' (as opposed to [[intensive farming]]) is an [[Agriculture|agricultural]] production system that uses small inputs of [[manual labour|labor]], fertilizers, and [[Capital (economics)|capital]], relative to the land area being farmed.

Extensive farming most commonly refers to sheep and cattle farming in areas with low agricultural productivity, but can also refer to large-scale growing of [[wheat]], [[barley]], cooking oils and other grain crops in areas like the [[Murray-Darling Basin]] in [[Australia]]. Here, owing to the extreme age and poverty of the soils, yields per hectare are very low, but the flat terrain and very large farm sizes mean yields per unit of labour are high. [[Nomadic herding]] is an extreme example of extensive farming, where herders move their animals to use feed from occasional rainfalls.

==Geography==
Extensive farming is found in the mid-latitude sections of most continents, as well as in desert regions where water for cropping is not available. The nature of extensive farming means it requires less rainfall than intensive farming. The farm is usually large in comparison with the numbers working and money spent on it. In 1957, most parts of [[Western Australia]] had pastures so poor that only one [[sheep]] to the square mile could be supported &lt;ref&gt;Wadham, Sir Samuel; Wilson, R. Kent and Wood, Joyce (1957) ''Land Utilization in Australia'' (3rd edition), Melbourne University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the demand has led to the basic division of cropping and pastoral activities, these areas can also be subdivided depending on the region's rainfall, [[vegetation type]] and agricultural activity within the area and the many other parentheses related to this data.

{{farming}}

==Advantages==
Extensive farming has a number of advantages over [[intensive farming]]:

# Less labour per unit areas is required to farm large areas, especially since expensive alterations to land (like terracing) are completely absent.
# Mechanisation can be used more effectively over large, flat areas.
# Greater efficiency of labour means generally lower product prices.
# [[Animal welfare]] is generally improved because animals are not kept in stifling conditions.
# Lower requirements of inputs such as [[fertilizers]].
# If animals are grazed on pastures native to the locality, there is less likely to be problems with exotic species.
# Local environment and soil are not damaged by overuse of chemicals.
# The use of machinery and scientific methods of farming produce a large quantity of crops.

==Disadvantages==
Extensive farming can have the following problems:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Tyrone (2000) ''My Environmental Exposé'', Hill of Content, pp. 42–50; {{ISBN|0-85572-301-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Yields tend to be much lower than with [[intensive farming]] in the short term.
# Large land requirements limit the habitat of wild species (in some cases, even very low stocking rates can be dangerous), as is the case with [[intensive farming]].

Extensive farming may produce more methane and nitrous oxide per kg of milk than intensive farming. A 1995 study compared of a modern dairy farm in Wisconsin with one in New Zealand in which the animals grazed extensively.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8567486 |year=1995 |last1=Johnson |first1=KA |last2=Johnson |first2=DE |title=Methane emissions from cattle |volume=73 |issue=8 |pages=2483–92 |journal=Journal of Animal Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using total farm emissions per kg milk produced as a parameter, the researchers showed that production of methane from belching was higher in the New Zealand farm, while carbon dioxide production was higher in the Wisconsin farm. Output of nitrous oxide, a gas with an estimated [[global warming potential]] 310 times that of carbon dioxide was also higher in the New Zealand farm. Methane from manure handling was similar in the two types of farm. The explanation for the finding relates to the different diets used on these farms, being based more completely on forage (and hence more fibrous) in New Zealand and containing less concentrate than in Wisconsin. Fibrous diets promote a higher proportion of acetate in the gut of ruminant animals, resulting in a higher production of methane that must be released by belching. When cattle are given a diet containing some concentrates (such as corn and soybean meal) in addition to grass and silage, the pattern of ruminal fermentation alters from acetate to mainly propionate. As a result, methane production is reduced. Capper et al. compared the environmental impact of US dairy production in 1944 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Capper"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2527/jas.2009-1781 |title=The environmental impact of dairy production: 1944 compared with 2007 |year=2009 |last1=Capper |first1=J.

'''FPA''' (Family Planning Association) is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] registered [[Charitable organization|charity]] (number 250187) working to enable people to make informed choices about sex and to enjoy [[Reproductive health|sexual health]]. It is the national affiliate for the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] in the United Kingdom. It celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2010.&lt;ref name="fpa80"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.fpa.org.uk/aboutus/fpahistory|title= FPA history|publisher= FPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its motto is "''Talking sense about sex''".

== History ==
FPA was founded in 1930 when five [[birth control]] societies merged to form the '''National Birth Control Council''' (NBCC).&lt;ref name="aim"&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/20/4606.htm Family Planning Association archive details] at [[AIM25]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Vickery Drysdale]] [[FRSE]] was critical within its foundation.&lt;ref&gt;http://openplaques.org/people/234&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated purpose was "that married people may space or limit their families and thus mitigate the evils of ill health and poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sexual healing|first=David|last=Aaronovitch|authorlink=David Aaronovitch|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/mar/20/sexeducation.schools|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|location=London|issn=0029-7712|oclc=265226830|date=20 March 2005|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBCC changed its name to the '''National Birth Control Association''' (NBCA) in 1931,&lt;ref name="aim"/&gt; and then to the Family Planning Association (FPA) in 1939.&lt;ref name="aim"/&gt; Since 1998 it has been known as FPA.

The FPA was heavily invested in guaranteeing and standardising the various contraceptive methods it prescribed using modern science and medicine. From its inception, the association invested heavily in developing and implementing tests for chemical efficacy and safety and rubber quality. These findings were published after 1937 in its annual Approved List of contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=SZUHAN |first1=NATASHA |title=Sex in the laboratory: the Family Planning Association and contraceptive science in Britain, 1929–1959 |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=28 June 2018 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1017/S0007087418000481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally only offering a service to married couples, during the 1950s FPA clinics began to offer pre-marital advice to women, although proof, such as a letter from a vicar or family doctor, was often required before [[contraceptive]] supplies were provided.

During the 1960s, [[Sexual revolution|social and sexual attitudes]] changed dramatically. The [[combined pill]] was first prescribed in FPA clinics in 1961 and within ten years was being used by over one million women. This highly reliable method brought a new sense of sexual freedom to men and women.

By 1970, FPA clinics were offering advice and treatment, without restriction. In 1974, FPA handed their network of over 1,000 clinics to the NHS when contraception became free for all. [[Family planning]] is still part of the health service.

== Leadership ==
The organisation's first administrator was [[Margaret Pyke]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]. Following Pyke's death in 1967, [[Jean Medawar]] took over as chairwoman.

As of 2010, the President of FPA is [[Joyce Gould, Baroness Gould of Potternewton|Baroness Gould of Potternewton]]; Vice Presidents include [[Jacqui Lait]], [[Joan Ruddock]] MP, and [[Jenny Tonge|Baroness Tonge]] and the charity is supported by a number of patrons. Additionally FPA is steered by a Board of Trustees of 12; the Chair is Dr Val Day and the Vice Chair is Paul Woodward.  In January 2008, Julie Bentley became the Chief Executive, taking over from [[Anne Weyman]] OBE, who previously led the organisation for 11 years.

In October 2012, Dr Audrey Simpson OBE became Chief Executive of FPA taking over from Julie Bentley, who previously led the organisation for five years.

== Current activities ==
FPA aims to improve the public's knowledge of sexual health. The organisation runs training courses and projects for professionals, grandparents, parents, carers and young people, and provides an information and press service to communicate sexual health information more widely.

FPA runs an enquiry service providing confidential information and advice on contraception; common sexually transmitted infections; pregnancy choices; abortion and planning a pregnancy. The enquiry service is made up of its helpline and Web Enquiry Service (Ask WES).

FPA also provides clinic details of contraception, sexual health and genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics and sexual assault referral centres. In Northern Ireland, where abortion is difficult to obtain, FPA offers an unplanned pregnancy counselling service.

FPA is also funded by the Department of Health (England) to provide a wide range of booklets on individual methods of contraception, common sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy choices, abortion and planning a pregnancy. These are distributed freely across England to sexual health services and GPs.

Campaigning is a core part of the work of FPA. It played a role in obtaining the provision of free contraception on the NHS across the UK and campaigns around abortion to preserve consumer rights and choices. In May 2008, FPA and other pro-choice groups prevented a reduction of the 24-week time limit for abortion, which was debated in the House of Commons. The organisation is now trying to modernise abortion laws throughout the UK.

In 2010, FPA celebrated 80 years&lt;ref name="fpa80"/&gt; and rebranded with a new logo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fpa.org.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/logo |title=FPA launches new logo |publisher=FPA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226112227/http://www.fpa.org.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/logo |archivedate=2010-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to reach more people with sexual health and sex and relationships information. During the same year it also founded an Achievers' Club to recognise people who have made significant contributions to improving the sexual health of the UK. "My contraception tool", an online tool to help people choose contraception, was launched by FPA and Brook. In October 2010, FPA also held the first all-Ireland conference on abortion for medical practitioners.

At the Charity Awards 2010, ''All about us'', an FPA CD-ROM for people with learning disabilities, won the Disability category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charityawards.co.uk/home/category.php?pg=1&amp;cat=4&amp;yr=14 Improving people’s sexual health through modern technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819105046/http://www.charityawards.co.uk/home/category.php?pg=1&amp;cat=4&amp;yr=14 |date=2010-08-19 }} at charityawards.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{See also|Abortion debate}}
Due to the emotive nature of some topics addressed by FPA - for example, abortion - the charity has been criticised by a number of religious, political and pro-life groups. These groups generally protest on the grounds that all foetuses have a right to life; that sexual health education leads to promiscuity; that contraception is against the teachings of the Bible; and for other similar reasons. In the early years of the charity, objects were thrown at clinics and volunteers were threatened. At the present time, opponents frequently hold protests outside the FPA Belfast office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2009-07-15b.73.0 Abortion Law (Northern Ireland)] (Westminster Hall debate, 15 July 2009) at [[TheyWorkForYou]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frances Wickes''' (born '''Frances Gillespy''', [[Lansingburgh, New York]], August 28, 1875 &amp;ndash; [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], May 5, 1967) was a [[psychologist]] and writer.

==Biography==

A graduate of [[Columbia University]], Wickes was a teacher, writer and playwright for children and teenagers in New York but later became interested in becoming a [[Jungian therapist]], especially for artists, and visited [[Zurich]] several times after meeting [[Carl Jung]] in 1920s, with whom Wickes maintained a correspondence.

Wickes kept a [[dream diary|diary of dreams]] and made conferences, especially at the Analytical Psychology Club of New York. Wickes had a husband, Thomas Wickes (divorced in 1910 and died about 1947) and a son, Eliphalet Wickes (1906–1926). Wickes lived also in California and Alaska.

Jung wrote the preface to her second book on the psychological world of children (1927), where Wickes supported the autonomous presence of the child in the [[collective unconscious]], according to the idea of a [[participation mystique]], which [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] in 1910 had theorized to exist within primitive societies, Wickes's comparing a child to an individual in training and giving more place to [[intuition]] and feeling than attention to the real or rational. The book was translated into German, French, Dutch, Italian and Greek.

In coming decades Wickes helped found [[Spring (journal)|''Spring'']], which bills itself as the oldest Jungian journal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springjournalandbooks.com/cgi-bin/ecommerce/ac/agora.cgi?cartlink=history.html&lt;/ref&gt; and lectured at various branches of the Jung Institutes.

Among Wickes's correspondents are preserved letters to [[Muriel Rukeyser]] (1913–1980), [[Henry Murray]], [[Eudora Welty]], [[Mary Louise Peebles]] (1833–1915), [[Martha Graham]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[May Sarton]], [[Robert Edmond Jones]] (1887–1954) and [[William McGuire (editor)|William McGuire (1917–2009)]]. At death without heirs $1–1/2 million of her $2-million estate was given to the C. G. Jung Institute of [[San Francisco]] and the rest to the Frances G. Wickes Foundation (1955–1974).

'''Human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer awareness and prevention''' is a vital concept from a public and community health perspective.

==Definition==

HPV is the sexually transmitted virus that is known to be the cause of genital warts. There are currently more than 100 different strains of HPV, half of which can cause genital infections.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Sexuality|last=Crooks|first=R.|last2=Baur|first2=K.|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage|year=2014|isbn=9781133943365|location=Belmont, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting here that although it is not usually the HPV strains that cause genital warts that are associated with the oropharyngeal cancers, they are transmitted the same way through oral-genital sexual contact, and consumers should protect themselves accordingly and adhere to a routine health and dental screening schedule to monitor and maintain their health status.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm|title=STD Facts - Human papillomavirus (HPV)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Detection==

Learning and utilizing self-examinations of your body, checking for changes or abnormalities in your mouth while performing your oral hygiene as well as routine checks of your genitals after showering  to note changes or abnormalities can enhance your awareness of changes in your health status. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of all sexually active people will acquire at least one HPV infection in their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is important that consumers seek routine dental examinations as a part of their health care to allow for dentists and primary care providers to screen them for this type of cancer, as early detection can mean all the difference in treatments. Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers can occur anywhere in the mouth, but occur most often in the tongue, tonsils, oropharynx (back of the throat), gums and the floor of the mouth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html|title=What Are the Key Statistics About Oral Cavity and Oropharyngeal Cancers?|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, "Oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located at the base of the tongue (the back third of the tongue), the soft palate (the back part of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/oral-cancer-screening1|title=Final Recommendation Statement: Oral Cancer: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and requires a thorough exam by a dental provider or specialist preferably. Men are twice as likely than women to have oral cancer, regardless of race, as African-Americans and Caucasians are equally likely to develop oral cancer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cancer==

Many people do not realize that some cancers can be linked to viral illnesses, such as human papilloma virus (HPV). Oropharyngeal cancer has been linked in some cases to HPV. The most common type of oral and oropharyngeal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma...and this kind is indicated in about 90% of oral and oropharyngeal cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/oral-cancer|title=Oral and Oropharyngeal Cancer|website=www.ada.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 63% of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas each year are associated with HPV infection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Most cases of HPV go undetected and clear up on their own without the patient ever knowing they had contracted it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, there are 13 HPV strains that are known to potentially cause cancer&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Viens|first=Laura J.|last2=Henley|first2=S.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|language=en-us|volume=65|issue=26|pages=661–666|doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6526a1|issn=0149-2195}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CDC, during an analysis of reported data from national cancer and epidemiological registries between the years of 2008 and 2012, of 30,700 cases of cancer that were estimated to be caused by HPV, 24,600 were found to be caused by strains HPV 16 and HPV 18, which are strains that are preventable as they are covered in the vaccinations that are available to guard against HPV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 3,800 were also found to be caused by 5 other preventable strains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More specifically, 9500 cases of oropharyngeal cancers were caused by the same preventable strains, while 900 more were caused by the other preventable strains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Prevention==

Vaccination is recommended for females and males alike, as early as age 9 and up to 26 years of age.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hpv.html|title=Vaccine Information Statement {{!}} HPV {{!}} VIS {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-teens can get their HPV vaccination at the same time as other scheduled vaccinations and boosters for convenience, as they are able to be safely administered together. Parents should speak to their child's pediatrician regarding their recommendations for vaccinations. Pregnant women are recommended to wait until after they deliver to receive the vaccination.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Anyone with allergy concerns especially to yeast should consult their physician.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Until recently, Gardasil (bivalent, quadrivalent, and 9-valent versions) and Cervarix brands have been available;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; however, after May 2017, only Gardasil 9 (9-valent) will be available for vaccination in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 9-valent simply refers to the 9 strains that the vaccine helps to protect against that are known to be associated with cancers.

The World Health Organization(WHO) says between 30% and 50% of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding alcohol and tobacco products, especially concurrent use.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/cancer/en/|title=WHO Cancer Control Programme|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WHO also indicates there are about "529,000 new cases of cancers of the oral cavity and  pharynx each year, and more than 300,000 deaths"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "The American Cancer Society’s most recent estimates for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers in the United States are for 2017...(are) that about 49,670 people will get oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer...(and) an estimated 9,700 people will die of these cancers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In summary, consumers need to take charge of their own health and be accountable. Go see your doctor and dentist for regular exams, perform self-examinations to look for changes in your body, follow the recommended vaccination guidelines, practice safer sex, and avoid alcohol and tobacco products for a healthier you.

'''Han Feng''' (韩锋), born in [[Qinzhou]], [[Guangxi]], People's Republic of China,&lt;ref name="Zy"&gt;Zynews.com. "[http://www.zynews.com/news/2010-03/18/content_692239.htm Zynews.com]." ''广西局长日记来源新说：韩锋妻子被指泄密者.'' Retrieved on April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the [[Communist Party of China]] and a senior official of the [[China National Tobacco Corporation]].  In early 2010, he was fired and expelled from the party due to corruption and his love life being exposed on the internet from his diary.  The scandal soon became one of the most popular stories in Chinese [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref name="digtimes"&gt;Chinadigitaltimes.net. "[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/han-feng/ Chinadigitaltimes.net]." ''China Arrests Man Who Allegedly Kept Graft Diary.'' Retrieved on April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the scandal and arrest, most netizens overwhelmingly believe Han Feng is a good CPC official.&lt;ref name="digtimes" /&gt;

==Career==
Han originally attended [[Guangxi University]] and studied Chinese language.&lt;ref name="Zy" /&gt;  After graduation he went to [[Shangsi County]] and was selected as Qinzhou office secretary.&lt;ref name="Zy" /&gt;  After 1988 he became the tobacco secretary of the Guanxi region. Ten years later he became a director of the [[China National Tobacco Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Zy" /&gt;  He married one of his classmates who also worked in a tobacco bureau.&lt;ref name="Zy" /&gt;  On February 26, 2003 he was made head director of its [[Laibin]] municipal bureau.&lt;ref name="Zy" /&gt;  In 2009 he was transferred to the Guangxi tobacco monopoly bureau as a director of the sales division.&lt;ref name="top"&gt;Topnews.us. "[http://topnews.us/content/212335-han-feng-s-dairy-entries-leaked-describing-his-misbehavior Topnews.us]." ''Hang Feng's diary entries leaked describing his misbehavior.'' Retrieved on April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==
Han Feng kept a [[Samuel Pepys|Pepysian diary]] with entries covering his daily activities from January 1, 2007 to June 10, 2008 with a total of more than 500 entries.&lt;ref name="pg1Glob"&gt;Globaltimes.cn. "[http://special.globaltimes.cn/2010-03/512887.html Globaltimes.cn]." ''Sexy diarist nabbed for Corruption. pg 1.'' Retrieved on April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It featured graphical sex accounts with mistresses between bribes and banquets.&lt;ref name="pg1Glob" /&gt;  At the time he was the director of the Laibin tobacco monopoly bureau.&lt;ref name="top" /&gt;

According to [[Guangzhou]]-based [[Southern Metropolis Weekly]] (南都周刊).,&lt;ref name="pg1Glob" /&gt; the diary first appeared online on November 23, 2009.  After a four-month cycle of repeated postings and deletions, by the end of February 2010, the news finally broke across almost every major Chinese [[web portal]].&lt;ref name="pg1Glob" /&gt;

==Arrest==
On March 13, 2010 Han Feng was arrested and expelled from the Communist party.&lt;ref name="bangk"&gt;Bangkokpost.com. "[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/171622/china-official-arrested-in-sex-diary-scandal-report "''China official arrested in sex diary scandal: report.''"], Retrieved on April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  After investigation, Han, at the age of 53, was removed from his tobacco bureau division chief post for allegedly accepting bribes totaling 482,000 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]].  He also accepted an apartment worth 300,000 yuan.&lt;ref name="bangk" /&gt;  The diary itself documented 275,000 yuan in just under two years.&lt;ref name="pg1Glob" /&gt;  The bribes were taken between 2002 and 2010.&lt;ref name="digtimes" /&gt;

==Responses==
A star blogger, [[Han Han]] wrote a post titled "Han Feng is a good cadre" which commented on the online leak of the diary.  The blogger said that Han Feng was a good official since the amount of bribes and number of sexual relationships he had was no comparison to other Communist party officials.&lt;ref name="digtimes" /&gt; He then conducted an online survey and concluded that 96% of 210,000 voters with independent [[IP address]]es felt Han Feng was a good official.&lt;ref name="digtimes" /&gt;

Other responses from [[Tianya Club]] said the diary is a great text.  It has done a greater job than any recent literary work or news reports in vividly presenting the typical life of a Chinese official, and the real situation of officialdom as well as male-female relationships in second- and third-tier cities in China.&lt;ref name="pg1Glob" /&gt;  Others responded that the [[Chinese people]]'s requirements for officials are generally low.&lt;ref name="pg2Glob"&gt;Globaltimes.cn. "[http://special.globaltimes.cn/2010-03/512887_2.html Globaltimes.cn]." ''Sexy diarist nabbed for Corruption. pg 2.'' Retrieved on April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others said this "double-faced" life is not unique to Han Feng, but all 80 characters in the diary.&lt;ref name="pg3Glob"&gt;Globaltimes.cn. "[http://special.globaltimes.cn/2010-03/512887_3.html Globaltimes.cn]." ''Sexy diarist nabbed for Corruption. pg 3.'' Retrieved on April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Political commentator Qin Geng said "Han Feng is surely not the worst official in China, that he could even be considered to be one of the good ones.  That is the most fearful part of the story".&lt;ref name="pg3Glob" /&gt;

During the 1980s and again in the 1990s it was suggested at times that the process of making asbestos cement could "neutralize" the asbestos, either via chemical processes or by causing cement to attach to the fibers and changing their physical size; subsequent studies showed that this was untrue, and that decades-old asbestos cement, when broken, releases asbestos fibers identical to those found in nature, with no detectable alteration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/hsl_pdf/2007/hsl0711.pdf Investigation of the chrysotile fibres in an asbestos cement sample (2006) - HSL/2007/11], p.26 onward]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Risks==
Exposure to asbestos in the form of fibers is always considered dangerous. Working with, or exposure to, material that is [[friable]], or materials or works that could cause release of loose asbestos fibers, is considered high risk. However, in general, people who become ill from inhaling asbestos have been regularly exposed in a job where they worked directly with the material.

According to the [[National Cancer Institute]], "A history of asbestos exposure at work is reported in about 70 percent to 80 percent of all cases. However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/images/Documents/67e63bef-d6e0-4c0f-9c7a-e8aa56ed969c/fs6_36.pdf Mesothelioma: Questions and Answers], National Cancer Institute&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in 1998, in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, concurs, and comments that asbestosis has been reported primarily in asbestos workers, and appears to require long-term exposure, high concentration for the development of the clinical disease. There is also a long latency period (the time taken between harmful contact and emergence of the actual resulting illness) of about 12 to 20 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mechanisms in the Pathogenesis of Asbestosis and Silicosis |pmid=9603153|year=1998|last1=Mossman|first1=BT|last2=Churg|first2=A|volume=157|issue=5 Pt 1|pages=1666–80|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|doi=10.1164/ajrccm.157.5.9707141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and potentially up to 40 years.

The most common diseases associated with chronic exposure to asbestos are [[asbestosis]] and [[mesothelioma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/asbestos/health_effects/ ATSDR – Asbestos – Health Effects]. (1 April 2008). ATSDR Home. Retrieved 24 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asbestos-related diseases===
{{main|Asbestos-related diseases}}
Diseases commonly associated with asbestos include:

*'''Asbestosis''': Progressive fibrosis of the lungs of varying severity, progressing to bilateral fibrosis, honeycombing of the lungs on radiological view with symptoms including rales and wheezing. Individuals who have been exposed to asbestos via home, environment, or work should notify their doctors about exposure history.
*'''Asbestos warts''': caused when the sharp fibers lodge in the skin and are overgrown causing benign [[callus]]-like growths.
*'''Pleural plaques''': discrete fibrous or partially calcified thickened area which can be seen on [[X-ray]]s of individuals exposed to asbestos. Although pleural plaques are themselves asymptomatic, in some patients this develops into pleural thickening.
*'''Diffuse pleural thickening''': similar to above and can sometimes be associated with asbestosis. Usually no symptoms shown but if exposure is extensive, it can cause [[lung]] impairment.
*'''[[Pneumothorax]]''': Some reports have also linked the condition of pneumothorax to asbestos related diseases.

==Safety and exposure prevention==
Asbestos exposure becomes an issue if asbestos containing materials become airborne, such as due to deterioration or damage. Building occupants may be exposed to asbestos, but those most at risk are persons who purposely disturb materials, such as maintenance or construction workers. Housekeeping or custodial employees may be at an increased risk as they may potentially clean up damaged or deteriorated asbestos containing materials without knowing that the material contains asbestos. Asbestos abatement or remediation workers and emergency personnel such as firefighters may also become exposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/asbestos_in_schools.html Asbestos in Schools]. US EPA (28 June 2006). Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestos-related diseases have been diagnosed in asbestos workers' family members, and in residents who live close to asbestos mines or processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/asbestos/health_effects/ Asbestos – Health Effects] ATSDR – Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (1 April 2008). Retrieved 4 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common building materials containing asbestos===
Currently in the United States, several thousand products manufactured and/or imported today still contain asbestos.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In many parts of the industrialized world, particularly the European Union, asbestos was phased out of building products beginning in the 1970s with most of the remainder phased out by the 1980s. Even with an asbestos ban in place, however, asbestos may be found in many buildings that were built and/or renovated from the late 1800s through the present day.

Residential building materials containing asbestos include a variety of products, such as: stipple used in textured walls and ceilings; [[drywall joint filler compound]]; asbestos contaminated [[vermiculite]], [[vinyl floor tile]]; vinyl sheet flooring; window [[putty]]; mastic; [[cement board]]; asbestos cement pipes and flues; furnace tape; and [[stucco]]. Asbestos is widely used in roofing materials, mainly corrugated asbestos cement roof sheets and asbestos shingles sometimes called [[transite]]. Other sources of asbestos-containing materials include [[fireproofing]] and [[Architectural acoustics|acoustic materials]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/help.html#health Basic Information | Asbestos | [[US EPA]]] (28 June 2006). Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification and assessment===
A fiber cannot be identified or ruled out as asbestos, either using the naked eye or by simply looking at a fiber under a regular microscope. The most common methods of identifying asbestos fibers are by using [[polarized light microscopy]] (PLM) or [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM). PLM is less expensive, but TEM is more precise and can be used at lower concentrations of asbestos.

If asbestos abatement is performed, completion of the abatement is verified using visual confirmation and may also involve air sampling. Air samples are typically analyzed using [[phase contrast microscopy]] (PCM). PCM involves counting fibers on a filter using a microscope. Airborne occupational exposure limits for asbestos are based on using the PCM method.

The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] has a recommended Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for asbestos of 0.1 fibers/mL over an 8-hour shift. OSHA in the United States and occupational health and safety regulatory jurisdictions in Canada use 0.1 fibers/mL over an 8-hour shift as their exposure limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/asbestos_exposure_health/detecting.html ATSDR – Asbestos – Detecting asbestos-related health problems]. Atsdr.cdc.gov (1 April 2008). Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental asbestos===
Asbestos can be found naturally in the air outdoors and in some drinkable water, including water from natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts61.html|title=Centre for disease control article on asbestos |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov|accessdate=12 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100114012400/http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts61.html| archivedate= 14 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even nonoccupationally exposed members of the human population have tens to hundreds of thousands of asbestos fibers per gram of dry lung tissue, equivalent to millions of fibers in each lung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/422880|title=Medscape article on asbestos |publisher=Medscape.com|date=14 February 2002|accessdate=12 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120827003359/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/422880| archivedate=27 August 2012| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asbestos from natural geologic deposits is known as "naturally occurring asbestos" (NOA). Health risks associated with exposure to NOA are not yet fully understood, and current US federal regulations do not address exposure from NOA. Many populated areas are in proximity to shallow, natural deposits which occur in 50 of 58 California counties and in 19 other US states. In one study, data was collected from 3,000 mesothelioma patients in California and 890 men with [[prostate cancer]], a malignancy not known to be related to asbestos. The study found a correlation between the incidence of mesotheliomas and the distance a patient lived from known deposits of rock likely to include asbestos; the correlation was not present when the incidence of prostate cancer was compared with the same distances. The risk of mesothelioma declined by 6% for every {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} that an individual had lived away from a likely asbestos source.&lt;ref name=Raloff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raloff|first=Janet|title=Dirty Little Secret|doi=10.2307/4017077|pages=26–28|volume=170|issue=2|journal=Science News|year=2006|jstor=4017077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portions of [[El Dorado County, California]] are known to contain natural amphibole asbestos formations at the surface.&lt;ref name=Raloff/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://motherjones.com/environment/2007/05/not-their-back-yard Not in Their Back Yard]", ''Mother Jones'', May/June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[USGS]] studied amphiboles in rock and soil in the area in response to an EPA sampling study and subsequent criticism of the EPA study. The EPA study was refuted by its own peer reviewers and never completed or published. The study found that many amphibole particles in the area meet the counting rule criteria used by the EPA for chemical and morphological limits, but do not meet morphological requirements for commercial-grade-asbestos. The executive summary pointed out that even particles that do not meet requirements for commercial-grade-asbestos may be a health threat and suggested a collaborative research effort to assess health risks associated with "Naturally Occurring Asbestos."

However, the main criticism pointed at EPA was that their testing was conducted in small isolated areas of El Dorado where there were no amphibole asbestos deposits, thus the language regarding amphibole, nonfibrous "particles". Actual surface amphibole deposits in residential areas were ignored for testing purposes. Because of this, no final findings were published by ATSDR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meeker|first=G.P.|last2=Lowers|first2=H.A.|last3=Swayze|first3=G.A.|last4=Van Gosen|first4=B.S.|title=Mineralogy and Morphology of Amphiboles Observed in Soils and Rocks in El Dorado Hills, California|date=December 2006|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2006/1362/|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|last5=Stutley|first5=S.J.|last6=Brownfield|first6=I.K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] was also found to be underlaid with tremolite. The county monitored air quality at construction sites, controlled soil taken from affected areas, and required freshly developed sites to lay {{convert|6|in|mm}} of clean, stable material over the ground.&lt;ref name=Raloff/&gt;

Globally, samples collected from Antarctic ice indicate chrysotile asbestos has been a ubiquitous contaminant of the environment for at least 10,000 years. Snow samples in Japan have shown ambient background levels are one to two orders of magnitude higher in urban than in rural areas. Higher concentrations of airborne asbestos fibers are reported in urban areas where there is more ACM (asbestos containing materials) and mechanisms of release (vehicles braking and weathering of asbestos cement materials); concentrations in the range of 1–20&amp;nbsp;ng/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; have been reported. Fibers longer than 5μm are rarely found in rural areas. Ambient concentrations using [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] analysis have been based on mass measurements.&lt;ref name="godish40"/&gt;

==Biological interactions==

===Mechanisms of carcinogenicity===
Stanton and Layard hypothesized in 1977–78 that toxicity of fibrous materials is ''not'' initiated by ''chemical'' effects;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, M.F. and Layard, M. (1978). ''The carcinogenicity of fibrous minerals''.

[[File:Anthophyllite asbestos SEM.jpg|thumb|right|Asbestos fibers ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] micrograph)]]
Individual asbestos fibers are invisible to the unaided [[human eye]] because their size is about 3–20&amp;nbsp;µm wide and can be as slim as 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm. [[Human hair]] ranges in size from 17 to 181&amp;nbsp;µm in breadth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml| work=The Physics Factbook|title= Diameter of a Human Hair|last=Ley|first=Brian|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibers ultimately form because when these minerals originally cooled and crystallized, they formed by the polymeric molecules lining up parallel with each other and forming oriented [[crystal structure|crystal lattices]]. These crystals thus have three [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage planes]], and in this case, there are two cleavage planes which are much weaker than the third. When sufficient force is applied, they tend to break along their weakest directions, resulting in a linear fragmentation pattern and hence a fibrous form. This fracture process can keep occurring and one larger asbestos fiber can ultimately become the source of hundreds of much thinner and smaller fibers.

When fibers or asbestos structures from asbestos containing materials (ACM) become airborne, the process is called primary release. Primary release mechanisms include [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], [[wikt:impaction|impaction]], fallout, air [[erosion]], vibration, and fire damage. Secondary release occurs when settled asbestos fibers and structures are resuspended as a result of human activities. In unoccupied buildings or during unoccupied periods, fiber release typically occurs by fallout or is induced by vibration or air erosion.&lt;ref name="godish40"&gt;{{cite book|last=Godish|first=Thad|title=Indoor Environmental Quality|year=2001|publisher=CRC Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56670-402-2|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friability of a product containing asbestos means that it is so soft and weak in structure that it can be broken with simple finger crushing pressure. Friable materials are of the most initial concern because of their ease of damage. The forces or conditions of usage that come into intimate contact with most non-friable materials containing asbestos are substantially higher than finger pressure.

==History of health concerns and regulation==
''For additional chronological citations, see also, [[List of asbestos disease medical articles]]''

===Until 1900===
Early concern in the modern era on the health effects of asbestos exposure can be found in several sources. Among the earliest were reports in Britain. The annual reports of the Chief Inspector of Factories in 1898 included a report from [[Lucy Deane Streatfeild|Lucy Deane]] which stated that asbestos had "easily demonstrated" health risks.&lt;ref&gt;Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops, "Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops for the Year 1898", 1899, cited in Tweedale referenced below&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeaneReport&gt;{{cite book|last=Deane|first=Lucy|title="Report on the health of workers in asbestos and other dusty trades" in HM Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops, 1899, Annual Report for 1898|year=1899|publisher=HMSO London|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, what was probably the first study of mortality among asbestos workers was reported in France.&lt;ref&gt;Auribault, D. (1906) "Note sur l'Hygiène et la Sécurité des Ouvriers dans les Filatures et Tissages d'Amianté (On hygiene and security of the workers in the spinning and weaving of asbestos)" in Le Bulletin de l'Inspection du Travail, pp 120–132. This summary was given by Brodeur and roughly confirmed by Merewether &amp; Price in the report cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; While the study describes the cause of death as [[chalicosis]], a generalized pneumoconiosis, the circumstances of the employment of the fifty workers whose death prompted the study suggest that the root cause was asbestos or mixed asbestos-cotton dust exposure.

===1900s–1910s===
[[File:Ferruginous body.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] demonstrating [[asbestosis]] of the lung ([[ferruginous bodies]]). [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
Awareness of asbestos-related diseases can be found in the early 1900s, when London doctor H. Montague Murray conducted a post mortem exam on a young asbestos factory worker who died in 1899. Dr. Murray gave testimony on this death in connection with an industrial disease compensation hearing. The post-mortem confirmed the presence of asbestos in the lung tissue, prompting Dr. Murray to express as an expert opinion his belief that the inhalation of asbestos dust had at least contributed to, if not actually caused, the death of the worker.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H. M. (1907) testimony before the Departmental Committee on Compensation for Industrial Diseases "Minutes of Evidence, Appendices and Index", p. 127 cited and summarized in Merewether &amp; Price (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;

The record in the United States was similar. Early observations were largely anecdotal in nature and did not definitively link the occupation with the disease, followed by more compelling and larger studies that strengthened the association. One such study, published in 1918, noted:

:All of these processes unquestionably involve a considerable dust hazard, but the hygienic aspects of the industry have not been reported upon. It may be said, in conclusion, that in the practice of American and Canadian [[life insurance]] companies, asbestos workers are generally declined on account of the assumed health-injurious conditions of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hoffman, F. L. |year=1918|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/3865 |title=Mortality from Respiratory Diseases in Dusty Trades|journal= Bulletin of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|volume= 231|pages=176–180}} Mr. Hoffman was a professional statistician, employed by Prudential with an international reputation on public health matters.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s–1930s===
Widespread recognition of the occupational risks of asbestos in Britain was reported in 1924 by a Dr. Cooke, a pathologist, who introduced a case description of a 33-year-old female asbestos worker, [[Nellie Kershaw]], with the following: "Medical men in areas where asbestos is manufactured have long suspected the dust to be the cause of chronic bronchitis and fibrosis&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cooke, W. E. |title=Fibrosis of the Lungs Due to the Inhalation of Asbestos Dust|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3317.147|year=1924|pmc=2304688|pmid=20771679|issue=3317|pages=147–140.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Cooke then went on to report on a case in 1927 involving a 33-year-old male worker who was the only survivor out of ten workers in an asbestos [[carding]] room. In the report he named the disease "asbestosis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooke|first1=W. E.|title=Pulmonary Asbestosis|journal=BMJ|volume=2|year=1927|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3491.1024|issue=3491|pmid=20773543|pmc=2525313|pages=1024–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Cooke's second case report was followed, in the late 1920s, by a large public health investigation (now known as the Merewether report after one of its two authors) that examined some 360 asbestos-textile workers (reported to be about 15% of the total comparable employment in Britain at the time) and found that about a quarter of them suffered from pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;ref&gt;Merewether, E.R.A. and Price, C. W. (1930) [http://www.asbestoslegaljournal.com/Asbestos-Lawsuit-Documents/1930-Merewether-Asbestos-Report.pdf "Report on Effects of Asbestos Dust on the Lung"] H.M. Stationery Office&lt;/ref&gt; This investigation resulted in improved regulation of the manufacturing of asbestos-containing products in the early 1930s. Regulations included industrial hygiene standards, medical examinations, and inclusion of the asbestos industry into the British Workers' Compensation Act.&lt;ref&gt;Tweedale, Geoffrey (2001) ''Magic Mineral to Killer Dust, Turner &amp; Newall and the Asbestos Hazard''. Oxford University Press. p. 21. {{ISBN|0-19-924399-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known U.S. workers' compensation claim for asbestos disease was in 1927. In 1930, the first reported autopsy of an asbestosis sufferer was conducted in the United States and later presented by a doctor at the [[Mayo Clinic]], although in this case the exposure involved mining activities somewhere in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mills, R.

In 1930, the major asbestos company Johns-Manville produced a report, for internal company use only, about medical reports of asbestos worker fatalities.&lt;ref name="Castleman"/&gt; In 1932, a letter from U.S. Bureau of Mines to asbestos manufacturer [[Eagle-Picher]] stated, in relevant part, "It is now known that asbestos dust is one of the most dangerous dusts to which man is exposed."&lt;ref name=Brodeur&gt;{{cite book|author=Brodeur, Paul |title=Outrageous Misconduct: The Asbestos Industry on Trial|edition=1st|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1985|isbn=0-394-53320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. doctors found that 29% of workers in a Johns-Manville plant had asbestosis.&lt;ref name="Castleman"/&gt; Likewise, in 1933, Johns-Manville officials settled lawsuits by 11 employees with asbestosis on the condition that the employees' lawyer agree to never again "directly or indirectly participate in the bringing of new actions against the Corporation."&lt;ref name=Brodeur/&gt; In 1934, officials of two large asbestos companies, Johns-Manville and Raybestos-Manhattan, edited an article about the diseases of asbestos workers written by a Metropolitan Life Insurance Company doctor. The changes downplayed the danger of asbestos dust.&lt;ref name=Brodeur/&gt; In 1935, officials of Johns-Manville and Raybestos-Manhattan instructed the editor of ''Asbestos'' magazine to publish nothing about asbestosis.&lt;ref name=Brodeur/&gt; In 1936, a group of asbestos companies agreed to sponsor research on the health effects of asbestos dust, but required that the companies maintain complete control over the disclosure of the results.&lt;ref name="Castleman"/&gt;

===1940s===
In 1942, an internal Owens-Corning corporate memo referred to "medical literature on asbestosis&amp;nbsp;... scores of publications in which the lung and skin hazards of asbestos are discussed."&lt;ref name="Castleman"&gt;[[#Castleman|Castleman]], p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Testimony given in a federal court in 1984 by Charles H. Roemer, formerly an employee of Unarco, described a meeting in the early 1940s between Unarco officials, J-M President [[Lewis H. Brown]] and J-M attorney Vandiver Brown. Roemer stated, "I'll never forget, I turned to Mr. Brown, one of the Browns made this crack (that Unarco managers were a bunch of fools for notifying employees who had asbestosis), and I said, 'Mr. Brown, do you mean to tell me you would let them work until they dropped dead?' He said, 'Yes. We save a lot of money that way.'"&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Charles H. Roemer, Deposition taken 25 April 1984, Johns-Manville Corp., et al. v. the United States of America, U.S. Claims Court Civ. No. 465-83C, cited in [[#Castleman|Castleman]], p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, a Metropolitan Life Insurance Company report found 42 cases of asbestosis among 195 asbestos miners.&lt;ref name="Castleman"/&gt;

===1950s===
In 1951, asbestos companies removed all references to cancer before allowing publication of research they sponsored.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castleman|Castleman]], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, Dr. Kenneth Smith, Johns-Manville medical director, recommended (unsuccessfully) that warning labels be attached to products containing asbestos. Later, Smith testified: "It was a business decision as far as I could understand&amp;nbsp;... the corporation is in business to provide jobs for people and make money for stockholders and they had to take into consideration the effects of everything they did and if the application of a caution label identifying a product as hazardous would cut into sales, there would be serious financial implications."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castleman|Castleman]], p. 666&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, National Gypsum's safety director wrote to the Indiana Division of Industrial Hygiene, recommending that [[acoustic plaster]] mixers wear respirators "because of the asbestos used in the product." Another company official noted that the letter was "full of dynamite" and urged that it be retrieved before reaching its destination. A memo in the files noted that the company "succeeded in stopping" the letter, which "will be modified."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castleman|Castleman]], pp. 669–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s–1980s===
Through the 1970s, asbestos was used to fireproof roofing and flooring, for heat insulation, and for a variety of other purposes. The material was used in fire-check partitioning and doors on North Sea Oil Production Platforms and Rigs.

During the mid-to late 1980s, public health concern focused on potential asbestos fiber exposures of building occupants and workers in buildings containing asbestos containing building materials (ACBM) and their risks of developing lung cancer or mesothelioma. As a consequence, the Health Effects Institute (Cambridge, MA) convened a panel to evaluate the lifetime cancer risk of general building occupants as well as service workers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100322222814/http://www.asbestos-institute.ca/reviews/hei-ar/hei-ar.html Asbestos in Public and Commercial Buildings: A Literature Review and Synthesis of Current Knowledge (1991)]. asbestos-institute.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the EPA issued the Asbestos Ban and Phase Out Rule but in 1991, asbestos industry supporters challenged and overturned the ban in a landmark lawsuit: ''Corrosion Proof Fittings v. the Environmental Protection Agency''. Although the case resulted in several small victories for asbestos regulation, the EPA ultimately did not put an end to asbestos use. This ruling leaves many consumer products that can still legally contain trace amounts of asbestos. For a clarification of products which legally contain asbestos, read the EPA's clarification statement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121022215630/http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/asbbans2.pdf EPA Asbestos Materials Bans: Clarification]. epa.gov. 18 May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Washington State banned asbestos in automotive brakes starting in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/hwtr/betterbrakes.html Washington State Better Brakes Law]. ecy.wa.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), has set limits of 100,000 fibers with lengths greater than or equal to 5&amp;nbsp;µm per cubic meter of workplace air for eight-hour shifts and 40-hour work weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts61.html ToxFAQs for Asbestos], [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, blue and brown asbestos materials were banned outright in 1985 while the import, sale and second hand reuse of white asbestos was outlawed in 1999. The 2012 Control of Asbestos Regulations state that owners of non-domestic buildings (e.g., factories and offices) have a "duty to manage" asbestos on the premises by making themselves aware of its presence and ensuring the material does not deteriorate, removing it if necessary. Employers, e.g. construction companies, whose operatives may come into contact with asbestos must also provide annual asbestos training to their workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm |title=Control of Asbetstos Regulations 2012 |publisher=Health and Safety Executive (HSE) |accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North-west of Nelson, in the Upper Takaka Valley is New Zealand's only commercially harvested asbestos mine.  A low-grade Chrysotile was mined here from 1908 to 1917 but only 100 tons was washed and taken out by packhorse. A new power scheme enabled work to renew and between 1940 and 1949, 40 tons a month was mined by the Hume Company. This continued to 1964, when, due to the short length of its fibre, the limited commercial viability forced mining to cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=GRA18980108.2.14|title=National Library of New Zealand|work=Grey River Argus, Volume LVII, Issue 9871, 8 January 1898, Page 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cobb : the history of the Cobb River hydro-electric power scheme|last=Blair|first=AK|publisher=Cadsonbury Publications, Christchurch, 1998|year=1994|isbn=0477016995|location=Christchurch, New Zealand|pages=67–69, 71–72, 100–101.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handlers of asbestos materials must have a B-Class license for bonded asbestos and an A-Class license for friable asbestos.

The town of [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]], in Western Australia was built around a blue asbestos mine. The entire town continues to be contaminated, and has been disincorporated, allowing local authorities to remove references to Wittenoom from maps and roadsigns.

In May 1997, the manufacture and use of [[crocidolite]] and [[amosite]], commonly known as blue and brown asbestos, were fully banned in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105233/http://www.fnn.co.kr/content.asp?aid=504579c1e94a43f8ad80a83ee2aa0433 "학원 밀집 건물 석면노출 심각"]. fnn.co.kr. 6 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, a full-fledged ban on all types of asbestos occurred when the government banned the manufacture, import, sale, storage, transport or use of asbestos or any substance containing more than 0.1% of asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyoung Ryoul|title=Overview of Asbestos Issues in Korea|journal=J Korean Med Sci|date=12 June 2009|volume=24|series=3|pages=363–367|doi=10.3346/jkms.2009.24.3.363|pmid=19543418|pmc=2698178|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, South Korea became the world's sixth country to enact an asbestos harm aid act, which entitles any Korean citizen to free lifetime medical care as well as monthly income from the government if he or she is diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://health.joseilbo.com/html/news/?f=read&amp;code=1327972365&amp;seq=2992 1970~80년대 석면 다룬 산업 근로자, 폐암 정기검사 필수] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402192750/http://health.joseilbo.com/html/news/?f=read&amp;code=1327972365&amp;seq=2992 |date=2015-04-02 }}. health.joseilbo.com. 25 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
Use of all types of asbestos has been banned in Singapore since 1989. Currently, only ''removal'' of asbestos-containing materials is allowed in Singapore and the Ministry of Manpower must be notified before work commences.

====Turkey====
A complete ban on asbestos in Turkey went into effect in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205402453_text Turkey: New Regulation Banning Asbestos Goes Into Effect, Library of Congress, Global Law Monitor]. Loc.gov. Retrieved on 2015-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Finland'''

The manufacture and import of asbestos containing building materials was banned from 1993 onwards, while the selling and use of such materials was banned from 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tyosuojelu.fi/web/en/working-conditions/construction-industry/asbestos|title=Asbestos in the construction industry Finland|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Delayed recognition===
[[File:Russian made asbestos, after 1983.jpg|thumb|Soviet made asbestos, after 1983. No EHS information.]]
In a 1998 paper, medical historian Peter Bartrip examines why awareness and legislation appear to have lagged unduly, compared to evidence of the risks of asbestos.&lt;ref name="bartrip"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Too little, too late? The home office and the asbestos industry regulations, 1931|last=Bartrip|first=Peter|journal=Med. Hist.|volume=42|issue=4|pages=421–438|year=1998|publisher=The Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|location=London|issn=0025-7273|pmid=10505397|pmc=1044071|doi=10.1017/s0025727300064334}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper concludes by agreeing with a previous paper ('Asbestos: a chronology of its origins and health effects', British Journal of Independent Medicine, 1990) and the 1930 report of Edward Mereweather (a factory medical inspector involved in the legislative investigations of the time), that despite theories suggesting a [[coverup]] and historical evidence that could be cobbled together after the fact, it is more likely that the issue was one of [[hindsight]].

According to Bartrip, Mereweather's 1930 report identified six relevant issues:&lt;ref name="bartrip" /&gt;{{rp|p.422}}
# Significant commercial exploitation of asbestos was still relatively new.
# The industry was small and employed comparatively few workers, particularly in dusty processes.
# The disease developed slowly and unobtrusively.
# The disease was easily confused with tuberculosis.
# Affected workers left the industry and therefore fell out of sight of Factory Inspectors. (Gee, below, states that studies "focused on factories, rather than users")
# Medical research had concentrated on dusts containing free silica.

There had been earlier discussion, notably a few brief comments by Factory Inspectors Adelaide Anderson and Edgar Collis during 1898–1911, described by Bartrip as minor reports of no great substance in otherwise very large reports about factory workers.&lt;ref name="bartrip" /&gt;{{rp|p.423–424}} As a result, he concludes that between 1898 and the late 1920s, all that can be said is that, "the dangers of the material were slowly beginning to be appreciated".&lt;ref name="bartrip" /&gt;{{rp|p.423–424}} As of 1927, the Senior Medical Inspector had reported that the effect of asbestos dust inhalation "was as yet imperfectly understood".&lt;ref name="bartrip" /&gt;{{rp|p.422–423}}

A second paper, by Gee &amp; Greenberg, noted additional factors:&lt;ref name="gee"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Asbestos: from 'magic' to malevolent mineral|last1=Gee|first1=David|last2=Greenberg|first2=Morris|journal=Late lessons from early warnings: the precautionary principle 1896–2000|publisher=[[European Environment Agency|EEA]]|location=Copenhagen|date=9 January 2002|issue=22|pages=52–63|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental_issue_report_2001_22/issue-22-part-05.pdf|isbn=92-9167-323-4|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#  The discovery of carcinogenicity of smoking at approximately the same time as the 1950s asbestos studies, had made it far harder to prove a proposed [[causative]] link for asbestos.
# [[Anecdotal evidence]] and [[hearsay]] noted by local doctors and inspectors, was not pursued or taken seriously.
# "Negative" cancer studies were used, which are poor at detecting statistically significant pathology rates unless they include follow-up for around 30 years.
# A "latency lacuna" exists and contributes to complacency (also reported by Knox 1965) – as the consequences of exposure take decades to arise, by the time they occur it is possible to argue convincingly that "standards have improved" and that therefore the risk is eliminated; however this in turn is not confirmed for another 30 years by which time the same argument can be raised again. Compared to short-term needs, a "speculative" risk not yet confirmed may carry less weight, until long after the time when action could be taken.
# Long term surveys and sanction regimes failed to match short term pressures within politics, nor those within industry; in the case of asbestos they were inadequate.
# [[fallacy|Fallacious]] arguments were used, such as the observation that many asbestos workers remained healthy into old age as evidence of lack of risk or lack of harm. As even the most harmful occupation can have numerous apparent healthy survivors this is an example of "absence of evidence" being interpreted as "evidence of absence".
# As late as 1967, even ''[[The Lancet]]'' was capable of writing that "it would be ludicrous to outlaw this valuable and often irreplaceable material in all circumstances (as) asbestos can save more lives than it can possibly endanger".

==Litigation==
{{globalize|section|date=February 2010}}
{{Main|Asbestos and the law}}
Litigation related to asbestos is regarded as one of the largest litigation cases in legal history in terms of duration, claim size, and scope. Factors responsible for this include:
# ''Asbestos use was extremely widespread:'' It was used across many sectors, countries, industries and uses. It was also widespread in society itself, being used not in limited "niche" areas but within many everyday products, in housing, fire protection, and even decorative material such as [[Artex]], as well as numerous other ways. Over 50% of homes in some countries contained asbestos even after its ban there.&lt;ref name="guardian2011"&gt;Don, Andrew (1 May 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/may/01/asbestos-hidden-health-hazard Asbestos: the hidden health hazard in millions of homes]. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; So it was somewhat ubiquitous;
# ''Knowledge or suspicion of health issues existed for a long time:'' The health issues related to asbestos were known, suspected, or reported, for decades, with modern medical coverage dating back to the 19th century.
# ''Impact was severe, and included factors that tend to lead to high claims:'' serious and fatal disease; also apart from death the costs include long term care and disability, care costs, lifetime loss of income, and other high value compensations.
# ''Relatively easy to be at risk:'' asbestos-related diseases are caused by inhaling tiny airborne fibers, therefore any activity related to asbestos that led to loose dust or fibers could potentially cause disease (''Secondary asbestosis''). As a result, illness occurred not only in the widespread primary industries using asbestos, such as the asbestos mining and processing businesses, but also across industries that might handle their products (construction and demolition, repairs, fire safety), persons who disturbed asbestos products in their homes or workplaces, and even those who laundered clothing used by asbestos workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mesothelioma-attorney.com/asbestos/exposure-to-asbestos/secondary-exposure Household Members of Asbestos-Exposed Workers at Risk of Secondary Exposure]. mesothelioma-attorney.com&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Illnesses arise long after exposure:'' asbestos related diseases can arise decades after actual exposure.
# ''Asbestos industry alleged misconduct:'' alleged concealing, distorting, and suppressing of risk related information, by asbestos related businesses.

{{As of|1999}}, trends indicate that the worldwide rate at which people are diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases will likely increase through the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bianchi|first1=C|last2=Bianchi|first2=T|title=Malignant mesothelioma: global incidence and relationship with asbestos|url=http://www.jniosh.go.jp/en/indu_hel/pdf/379_Bianchi.pdf|journal=Industrial health|volume=45|issue=3|pages=379–87|year=2007|pmid=17634686|doi=10.2486/indhealth.45.379}}. This article identifies sources for data in 37 countries including the US.

In the United States, asbestos litigation is the longest, most expensive mass [[tort]] in U.S. history, involving more than 8,400 defendants and 730,000 claimants as of 2002 according to the [[RAND Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG162.html|title=Asbestos Litigation|year=2005|isbn=0-8330-3078-7|publisher=Rand.org|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one defendant reported claim counts in excess of $800,000 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=131738&amp;p=irol-sec&amp;secCat01Enhanced.1_rs=41&amp;secCat01Enhanced.1_rc=10#4485611|title=Enpro Public Filings|publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal legal system in the United States has dealt with numerous counts of asbestos-related suits, which often included multiple plaintiffs with similar symptoms. In 1999 there were 200,000 related cases pending in the federal court system of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Cong. Hearing: Asbestos Litigation. 107th Cong., 2nd sess. HRG.107-993. Washington: GPO, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it is estimated that within the next 40 years, the number of cases may increase to 700,000. These numbers help explain how there are thousands of current pending cases. Litigation of asbestos materials has been slow. Companies sometimes counter saying that health issues do not currently appear in their worker or workers, or sometimes are settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Stephen J., Deborah Hensler, Allan Abrahamse, Jennifer Gross, Michelle White, Scott Ashwood, and Elizabeth Sloss (2002). Asbestos Litigation Costs and Compensation. Santa Monica,CA: RAND.&lt;/ref&gt;

The volume of the asbestos liability has concerned manufacturers and [[insurance industry|insurers and reinsurers]].&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Acturaries' Mass Torts Subcomittee (August 2007) [http://www.actuary.org/pdf/casualty/asbestos_aug07.pdf "Overview of Asbestos Claims Issues and Trends"]. pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.

In 1999 the United States considered but did not enact the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act.&lt;ref name = "lxkrvq"&gt;United States. Cong. Senate. Finding Solutions to the Asbestos Litigation Problem: the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999. 106th Cong., 1st sess. S.758. Washington: GPO, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1981 and the present, many asbestos companies have filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crowell.com/pdf/AsbestosChart1.pdf Chart of Bankrupt Asbestos manufacturers and distributors]. crowell.com&lt;/ref&gt; While companies filed for bankruptcy, this limited payouts to those who were actually affected by the material. [[Christopher Edley, Jr.]] commented what the 1999 act ultimately would have done if passed would be to "limit punitive damages that seek retribution for the decisions of long-dead executives for conduct that took place decades ago."&lt;ref name = "lxkrvq"/&gt;

Litigation exists outside the United States in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] among other nations (though the amounts awarded in these countries are not as large as in the US). See the [[Asbestos and the law|companion article]] for further information.

In Australia a significant and controversial case was brought against the industrial building materials company [[James Hardie]], which had mined and sold asbestos related products for many years.

==Criticisms of asbestos regulation==
Asbestos regulation critics include the asbestos industry&lt;ref&gt;[http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm1998/mm9801.09.html Multinational Monitor article on Corporate junk science]. Retrieved 16 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and JunkScience.com owner [[Steven Milloy]]. Critics argue that the outright banning of dangerous products by [[government regulation]] is inferior to keeping the products while innovating ways to prevent the lethal effects. They argue that the product benefits are too important to ignore; instead of banning the products, ways should be found to eliminate risks to those who work with the products.

Some criticisms were subsequently discredited. An example is the discredited suggestion by [[Dixy Lee Ray]] and others{{who|date=October 2013}} that the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] disintegrated because the maker of [[O-ring]] putty was pressured by the EPA into ceasing production of asbestos-laden putty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lehr|first=Jay H., editor|title=Rational Readings on Environmental Concerns |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |year=1992 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LsXmMHOT8VsC&amp;pg=PA119 |isbn=0-442-01146-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Challenger&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-pollution.com/challenger.htm |title=Asbestos and Challenger Disaster |publisher=Info-pollution.com|date=9 February 1986|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the putty used in ''Challenger''{{'}}s final flight contained asbestos, and failures in the putty were not responsible for the failure of the O-ring that led to loss of the shuttle.&lt;ref name=Challenger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberg, James (25 January 2011) [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11031097/page/2/ 7 myths about the Challenger shuttle disaster]. MSNBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Asbestos was also used in the first forty floors of the World Trade Center north tower causing an airborne contamination among lower Manhattan after the towers collapsed in the [[September 11 attacks]], causing  [[Steven Milloy]] of the [[libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]] to suggest that the World Trade Center towers could still be standing or at least would have stood longer had a 1971 ban not stopped the completion of the asbestos coating above the 64th floor.&lt;ref&gt;Milloy, Steven (18 January 2007) [http://prwatch.org/prwissues/2001Q4/junkman.html The Junkman's Answer to Terrorism: Use More Asbestos]. prwatch.org. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milloy, Steven (18 January 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120110014532/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244698,00.html Asbestos Fireproofing Might Have Prevented World Trade Center Collapse]. Fox News Channel.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not considered in the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s report on the towers' collapse, on the basis that all fireproofing materials, regardless of their construction, are required to obtain a [[fire-resistance rating]] prior to installation, and all fiber-based lightweight commercial spray fireproofing materials are vulnerable to the [[wikt:dispersion|dispersive]] effects of [[kinetic energy|high speed/high energy impacts]], as these are outside the [[fire test]]ing upon which all ratings are based. Therefore, asbestos would have made little or no difference in preventing the towers' collapse, if used as fireproofing, and upon collapse any asbestos, however used, would still have been largely dispersed into the air within the massive dust cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031210161931/http://info-pollution.com/wtc.htm Asbestos and the WTC collapse]. info-pollution.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, R.

'''Holozoic nutrition''' (Greek: ''holo''-whole ; ''zoikos''-of animals) is a type of [[heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophic]] [[nutrition]] that is characterized by the internalization ([[ingestion]]) and internal processing of gaseous, liquid or solid food particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Integrated Principles of Zoology, 14th ed.|vauthors=Hickman C, Roberts L, Keen S, Larson A, I'Anson H, Eisenhour D |publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Protozoa]], such as [[amoeba]]s, and most of the free living animals,such as animals, exhibit this type of nutrition. 

In Holozoic nutrition the energy and organic building blocks are obtained by ingesting and then digesting other organisms or pieces of other organisms, including blood and decaying organic matter.  This contrasts with [[holophytic nutrition]], in which energy and organic building blocks are obtained through [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemosynthesis]], and with saprozoic nutrition, in which [[digestive enzyme]]s are released externally and the resulting [[monomer]]s (small organic molecules) are absorbed directly from the environment.

There are several stages of holozoic nutrition, which often occur in separate compartments within an organism (such as the stomach and intestines):
#[[Ingestion]]: In animals, this is merely takes place by engulfing the food totally in the mouth.  In protozoa, this most commonly occurs through [[phagocytosis]].
#[[Digestion]]: The physical breakdown of complex large and organic food particles and the [[Enzyme|enzymatic]] breakdown of complex organic compounds into small, simple molecules.
#[[Digestion#Overview of vertebrate digestion|Absorption]]: The [[Active transport|active]] and [[passive transport]] of the chemical products of digestion out of the food-containing compartment and into the body or cytoplasm.[[Assimilation (biology)|Assimilation]]: Utilization of the absorbed molecules for various [[Metabolism|metabolic]] processes.
#[[Egestion]]: The expulsion of undigested material, commonly called [[defecating]]

'''Tooth development''' or '''odontogenesis''' is the complex process by which [[tooth|teeth]] form from [[embryonic cell]]s, [[cell growth|grow]], and erupt into the [[human mouth|mouth]]. For [[human tooth|human teeth]] to have a healthy [[human mouth|oral]] environment, all parts of the tooth must develop during appropriate stages of [[fetal development]]. [[Deciduous teeth|Primary (baby) teeth]] start to form between the sixth and eighth week of prenatal development, and [[permanent teeth]] begin to form in the twentieth week.&lt;ref name="OH1"&gt;Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, pages 70-94&lt;/ref&gt; If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all, resulting in [[Hypodontia]] or [[Anodontia]].

A significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first [[Pharyngeal arch 1|pharyngeal arch]] that is necessary for the development of teeth.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

==Stages==
[[File:Histology of important stages of tooth development..jpg|thumb|Histology of important stages of tooth development]]
[[File:Toothbud annot.gif|alt=Animation of major stages in early tooth development|thumb|Animation of major stages in early tooth development]]
Tooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the initiation stage, the bud stage, the cap stage, the bell stage, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

===Initiation Stage===
One of the earliest signs in the formation of a tooth that can be seen microscopically is the distinction between the [[vestibular lamina]] and the [[dental lamina]]. The dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the [[epithelium|epithelial]] layer of the mouth for a significant time.&lt;ref&gt;University of Southern California School of Dentistry, ''The Bell Stage: Image 26'' found here [http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/ohisto/Cards/tdev/26_bb.html]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205205356/http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/ohisto/Cards/tdev/26_bb.html |date=February 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is regarded as the initiation stage.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

===Bud stage===
The bud stage is characterized by the appearance of a tooth bud without a clear arrangement of cells. The stage technically begins once epithelial cells proliferate into the [[ectomesenchyme]] of the jaw.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;  Typically, this occurs when the fetus is around 8 weeks old.&lt;ref name="Wheaters-255"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Barbara Young |author2=Paul R. Wheater |title=Wheaters Functional Histology |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |page=255 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88tla60sHAUC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255 |isbn=978-0-443-06850-8 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tooth bud itself is the group of cells at the periphery of the dental lamina.

Along with the formation of the dental lamina, 10 round epithelial structures, each referred to as a bud, develop at the distal aspect of the dental lamina of each arch. These correspond to the 10 primary teeth of each dental arch, and they signify the bud stage of tooth development. Each bud is separated from the ectomesenchyme by a basement membrane. Ectomesenchymal cells congregate deep to the bud, forming a cluster of cells, which is the initiation of the condensation of the ectomesenchyme. The remaining ectomesenchymal cells are arranged in a more or less haphazardly uniform fashion.

===Cap stage===
[[File:capstage11-23-05.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Histologic slide of tooth in cap stage.]]
The first signs of an arrangement of cells in the tooth bud occur in the cap stage. A small group of ectomesenchymal cells stops producing [[extracellular]] substances, which results in an aggregation of these cells called the dental papilla. At this point, the tooth bud grows around the ectomesenchymal aggregation, taking on the appearance of a cap, and becomes the enamel (or dental) organ covering the dental papilla. A condensation of ectomesenchymal cells called the dental sac or follicle surrounds the enamel organ and limits the dental papilla. Eventually, the enamel organ will produce enamel, the dental papilla will produce dentin and pulp, and the dental sac will produce all the supporting structures of a tooth, the periodontium.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

[[File:Earlybellstage11-18-05.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Histologic slide of tooth in early bell stage. Note cell organization.]]

===Bell stage===
The bell stage is known for the histodifferentiation and morphodifferentiation that takes place. The dental organ is bell-shaped during this stage, and the majority of its cells are called stellate reticulum because of their star-shaped appearance.  The bell stage is divided into the ''early bell stage'' and the ''late bell stage''.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;  Cells on the periphery of the enamel organ separate into four important layers. Cuboidal cells on the periphery of the dental organ are known as outer enamel epithelium (OEE).&lt;ref name = "Longhorns_Medical"/&gt; The columnar cells of the enamel organ adjacent to the enamel papilla are known as inner enamel epithelium (IEE). The cells between the IEE and the stellate reticulum form a layer known as the stratum intermedium.  The rim of the enamel organ where the outer and inner enamel epithelium join is called the ''cervical loop''.&lt;ref&gt;University of Southern California School of Dentistry, ''The Bell Stage: Image 30'' found here [http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/ohisto/Cards/tdev/30_bb.html]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205205412/http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/ohisto/Cards/tdev/30_bb.html |date=February 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In summary, the layers in order of innermost to outermost consist of dentin, enamel (formed by IEE, or 'ameloblasts', as they move outwards/upwards), inner enamel epithelium and stratum intermedium (stratified cells that support the synthetic activity of the inner enamel epithelium)  What follows is part of the initial 'enamel organ', the center of which is made up of stellate reticulum cells that serve to protect the enamel organ.  This is all encased by the OEE layer.

Other events occur during the bell stage.  The dental lamina disintegrates, leaving the developing teeth completely separated from the [[epithelium]] of the oral cavity; the two will not join again until the final eruption of the tooth into the mouth.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;
[[File:Latebellstage11-18-05.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Histologic slide of tooth in late bell stage. Note disintegration of dental lamina at top.]]
The crown of the tooth, which is influenced by the shape of the inner enamel epithelium, also takes shape during this stage. Throughout the mouth, all teeth undergo this same process; it is still uncertain why teeth form various crown shapes—for instance, incisors versus canines. There are two dominant [[hypotheses]]. The "field model" proposes there are components for each type of tooth shape found in the ectomesenchyme during tooth development. The components for particular types of teeth, such as incisors, are localized in one area and dissipate rapidly in different parts of the mouth. Thus, for example, the "incisor field" has factors that develop teeth into incisor shape, and this field is concentrated in the central incisor area, but decreases rapidly in the canine area. 

The other dominant hypothesis, the "clone model", proposes that the epithelium programs a group of ectomesenchymal cells to generate teeth of particular shapes. This group of cells, called a clone, coaxes the dental lamina into tooth development, causing a tooth bud to form. Growth of the dental lamina continues in an area called the "progress zone". Once the progress zone travels a certain distance from the first tooth bud, a second tooth bud will start to develop. These two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive, nor does widely accepted dental science consider them to be so: it is postulated that both models influence tooth development at different times.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

Other structures that may appear in a developing tooth in this stage are [[enamel knot]]s, [[enamel cord]]s, and [[enamel niche]].&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

[[File:Enamelmineralization11-17-05.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Histologic slide of developing hard tissues. Ameloblasts are forming enamel, while odontoblasts are forming dentin.]]

===Advanced bell stage===
Hard tissues, including enamel and dentin, develop during the next stage of tooth development. This stage is called the crown, or maturation stage, by some researchers. Important cellular changes occur at this time. In prior stages, all of the IEE cells were dividing to increase the overall size of the tooth bud, but rapid dividing, called [[mitosis]], stops during the crown stage at the location where the [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusps]] of the teeth form. The first mineralized hard tissues form at this location. At the same time, the IEE cells change in shape from cuboidal to columnar and become preameloblasts. The [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] of these cells move closer to the stratum intermedium and away from the dental papilla as they become polarized.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

[[File:Crosssectiontooth11-24-05.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Histologic slide of tooth. Note the tubular appearance of dentin.
&lt;br/&gt;A: enamel
&lt;br/&gt;B: dentin]]

The adjacent layer of cells in the dental papilla suddenly increases in size and [[cellular differentiation|differentiates]] into odontoblasts, which are the cells that form dentin.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: a text and atlas'', p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers believe that the odontoblasts would not form if it were not for the changes occurring in the IEE. As the changes to the IEE and the formation of odontoblasts continue from the tips of the cusps, the odontoblasts secrete a substance, an [[Matrix (biology)|organic matrix]], into their immediate surrounding. The organic matrix contains the material needed for dentin formation.  As odontoblasts deposit organic matrix termed predentin, they migrate toward the center of the dental papilla. Thus, unlike enamel, dentin starts forming in the surface closest to the outside of the tooth and proceeds inward. Cytoplasmic extensions are left behind as the odontoblasts move inward. The unique, tubular microscopic appearance of dentin is a result of the formation of dentin around these extensions.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

After dentin formation begins, the cells of the IEE secrete an organic matrix against the dentin. This matrix immediately mineralizes and becomes the initial layer of the tooth's enamel. Outside the dentin are the newly formed ameloblasts in response to the formation of dentin, which are cells that continue the process of enamel formation; therefore, enamel formation moves outwards, adding new material to the outer surface of the developing tooth.

===Enamel===
{{Main article|Amelogenesis}}
Enamel formation is called amelogenesis and occurs in the crown stage (advanced bell stage) of tooth development. "Reciprocal induction" governs the relationship between the formation of dentin and enamel; dentin formation must always occur before enamel formation.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, enamel formation occurs in two stages: the secretory and maturation stages.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins and an organic matrix form a partially mineralized enamel in the secretory stage; the maturation stage completes enamel mineralization.

In the secretory stage, ameloblasts release enamel proteins that contribute to the enamel matrix, which is then partially mineralized by the enzyme [[alkaline phosphatase]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: Text and Atlas'', p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; This mineralized phase occurs very early around the 3rd or 4th month of pregnancy. This marks the first appearance of enamel in the body. Ameloblasts make enamel at the location of where the cusps of the teeth are located. Enamel grows outwards, away from the center of the tooth.

In the maturation stage, the ameloblasts transport some of the substances used in enamel formation out of the enamel. Thus, the function of ameloblasts changes from enamel production, as occurs in the secretory stage, to transportation of substances. Most of the materials transported by ameloblasts in this stage are proteins used to complete mineralization. The important proteins involved are [[amelogenin]]s, [[ameloblastin]]s, [[enamelin]]s, and [[tuftelin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: Text and Atlas'', p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of this stage, the enamel has completed its mineralization.

A residue may form on newly erupted teeth of both dentitions that may leave the teeth extrinsically stained. This green-gray residue, Nasmyth membrane, consists of the fused tissue of the reduced enamel epithelium and oral epithelium, as well as the dental cuticle placed by the ameloblasts on the newly formed outer enamel surface. Nasmyth membrane then easily picks up stain from food debris and is hard to remove except by selective polishing. The child’s supervising adults may need reassurance that it is only an extrinsic stain on a child’s newly erupted teeth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Patients with [[osteopetrosis]] display enamel abnormalities, suggesting that the a3 gene mutation found in V-ATPases also plays a role in the development of hypomineralized and hypoplastic enamel. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lisa|last2=Ganss|first2=Bernhard|last3=Wang|first3=Andrew|last4=Zirngibl|first4=Ralph A.|last5=Johnson|first5=Danielle E.|last6=Owen|first6=Celeste|last7=Bradley|first7=Grace|last8=Voronov|first8=Irina|date=2017-10-01|title=V-ATPases Containing a3 Subunit Play a Direct Role in Enamel Development in Mice|journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry|language=en|volume=118|issue=10|pages=3328–3340|doi=10.1002/jcb.25986|pmid=28295540|issn=1097-4644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dentin===
{{Main article|Dentinogenesis}}
Dentin formation, known as dentinogenesis, is the first identifiable feature in the crown stage of tooth development. The formation of dentin must always occur before the formation of enamel. The different stages of dentin formation result in different types of dentin: mantle dentin, primary dentin, secondary dentin, and tertiary dentin.

Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, differentiate from cells of the dental papilla. They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest to the area of the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2&amp;nbsp;μm in diameter).&lt;ref name="OH3"&gt;Cate, ''Oral Histology'', p. 128-139.&lt;/ref&gt; The odontoblasts begin to move toward the center of the tooth, forming an extension called the [[odontoblast process]].&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt; Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150&amp;nbsp;μm thick.&lt;ref name="OH3" /&gt;

Whereas mantle dentin forms from the preexisting ground substance of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause [[collagen]] to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as [[lipid]]s, [[phosphoprotein]]s, and [[phospholipid]]s) are also secreted.&lt;ref name="OH3" /&gt;

Secondary dentin is formed after root formation is finished and occurs at a much slower rate. It is not formed at a uniform rate along the tooth, but instead forms faster along sections closer to the crown of a tooth.&lt;ref&gt;Summitt, ''Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This development continues throughout life and accounts for the smaller areas of pulp found in older individuals.&lt;ref name="OH3" /&gt; Tertiary dentin, also known as reparative dentin, forms in reaction to stimuli, such as [[Attrition (dental)|attrition]] or [[dental caries]].&lt;ref&gt;Summitt, ''Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crosssectionroottooth11-24-05.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Cross-section of tooth at root. Note clear, acellular appearance of cementum.&lt;br/&gt;A: dentin&lt;br/&gt;B: cementum]]

===Cementum===
[[Cementum]] formation is called [[cementogenesis]] and occurs late in the development of teeth.  [[Cementoblasts]] are the cells responsible for cementogenesis. Two types of cementum form: cellular and acellular.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''Biology of the Human Dentition'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acellular cementum forms first. The cementoblasts differentiate from follicular cells, which can only reach the surface of the tooth's root once [[Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath]] (HERS) has begun to deteriorate. The cementoblasts secrete fine collagen fibrils along the root surface at right angles before migrating away from the tooth. As the cementoblasts move, more collagen is deposited to lengthen and thicken the bundles of fibers. Noncollagenous proteins, such as [[bone sialoprotein]] and [[osteocalcin]], are also secreted.&lt;ref name="OH2"&gt;Cate, ''Oral Histology'', p. 236-248.&lt;/ref&gt; Acellular cementum contains a secreted matrix of proteins and fibers. As mineralization takes place, the cementoblasts move away from the cementum, and the fibers left along the surface eventually join the forming periodontal ligaments.

Cellular cementum develops after most of the tooth formation is complete and after the tooth occludes (in contact) with a tooth in the opposite arch.&lt;ref name="OH2" /&gt; This type of cementum forms around the fiber bundles of the periodontal ligaments. The cementoblasts forming cellular cementum become trapped in the cementum they produce.

The origin of the formative cementoblasts is believed to be different for cellular cementum and acellular cementum. One of the major current hypotheses is that cells producing cellular cementum migrate from the adjacent area of bone, while cells producing acellular cementum arise from the dental follicle.&lt;ref name="OH2" /&gt;  Nonetheless, it is known that cellular cementum is usually not found in teeth with one root.&lt;ref name="OH2" /&gt;  In [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s, cellular cementum is found only in the part of the root closest to the apex and in interradicular areas between multiple roots.

&lt;br/&gt;A: tooth
&lt;br/&gt;B: gingiva
&lt;br/&gt;C: bone
&lt;br/&gt;D: periodontal ligaments]]

==Formation of the periodontium==
The periodontium, which is the supporting structure of a tooth, consists of the cementum, periodontal ligaments, [[gingiva]], and [[alveolar bone]]. Cementum is the only one of these that is a part of a tooth. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called a "[[Dental alveolus|socket]]". Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum, and the gingiva is the surrounding tissue visible in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Luan X, Ito Y, Diekwisch TG |title=Evolution and Development of Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath |journal=Developmental Dynamics |volume=235 |issue=5 |pages=1167–80 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16450392 |pmc=2734338 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periodontal ligament===
Cells from the dental follicle give rise to the [[periodontal ligament]] (PDL). Specific events leading to the formation of the periodontal ligament vary between deciduous (baby) and permanent teeth and among various [[species]] of animals.&lt;ref name="OH2" /&gt; Nonetheless, formation of the periodontal ligament begins with ligament fibroblasts from the dental follicle. These fibroblasts secrete collagen, which interacts with fibers on the surfaces of adjacent bone and cementum.&lt;ref name="Ross, Kaye p. 453"&gt;Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: Text and Atlas'', p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This interaction leads to an attachment that develops as the tooth erupts into the mouth. The [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]], which is the arrangement of teeth and how teeth in opposite arches come in contact with one another, continually affects the formation of periodontal ligament. This perpetual creation of periodontal ligament leads to the formation of groups of fibers in different orientations, such as horizontal and oblique fibers.&lt;ref name="OH2" /&gt;

===Alveolar bone===
As root and cementum formation begin, bone is created in the adjacent area. Throughout the body, cells that form bone are called [[osteoblast]]s. In the case of alveolar bone, these osteoblast cells form from the dental follicle.&lt;ref name="OH2" /&gt; Similar to the formation of primary cementum, collagen fibers are created on the surface nearest the tooth, and they remain there until attaching to periodontal ligaments.

Like any other bone in the human body, alveolar bone is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and [[osteoclast]]s destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth.&lt;ref name="Ross, Kaye p. 452"&gt;Ross, Kaye, and Pawlina, ''Histology: Text and Atlas'', p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics using bands, wires, or appliances, an area of bone under [[compression (physical)|compressive]] [[force]] from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in [[bone resorption]]. An area of bone receiving [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation. Thus, the tooth or teeth are slowly moved along the jaw so as to achieve a dentition that works in harmony. In this way, the width of the space between the alveoli and the root is kept about the same.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gingiva===
The connection between the gingiva and the tooth is called the dentogingival junction. This junction has three epithelial types: gingival, sulcular, and junctional epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth.&lt;ref name="OH2" /&gt;

Much about gingival formation is not fully understood, but it is known that [[hemidesmosomes]] form between the gingival epithelium and the tooth and are responsible for the ''primary epithelial attachment''.&lt;ref name="OH2" /&gt; Hemidesmosomes provide anchorage between cells through small filament-like structures provided by the remnants of ameloblasts.  Once this occurs, junctional epithelium forms from reduced enamel epithelium, one of the products of the enamel organ, and divides rapidly. This results in the perpetually increasing size of the junctional epithelial layer and the isolation of the remnants of ameloblasts from any source of nutrition. As the ameloblasts degenerate, a [[gingival sulcus]] is created.

==Nerve and vascular formation==
Frequently, nerves and blood vessels run parallel to each other in the body, and the formation of both usually takes place simultaneously and in a similar fashion. However, this is not the case for nerves and blood vessels around the tooth, because of different rates of development.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

===Nerve formation===
[[Nerve fiber]]s start to near the tooth during the cap stage of tooth development and grow toward the dental follicle. Once there, the nerves develop around the tooth bud and enter the dental papilla when dentin formation has begun. Nerves never proliferate into the enamel organ.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt;

===Vascular formation===
[[Blood vessel]]s grow in the dental follicle and enter the [[dental papilla]] in the cap stage.&lt;ref name="OH1" /&gt; Groups of blood vessels form at the entrance of the dental papilla. The number of blood vessels reaches a maximum at the beginning of the crown stage, and the dental papilla eventually forms in the pulp of a tooth. Throughout life, the amount of pulpal tissue in a tooth decreases, which means that the blood supply to the tooth decreases with age.&lt;ref name="Ross, Kaye p. 452"/&gt; The enamel organ is devoid of blood vessels because of its epithelial origin, and the [[mineralized tissues]] of enamel and dentin do not need nutrients from the blood.

==Tooth eruption==
{{Main article|Tooth eruption}}

Tooth eruption occurs when the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Although researchers agree that tooth eruption is a complex process, there is little agreement on the identity of the mechanism that controls eruption.&lt;ref&gt;Riolo and Avery, ''Essentials for Orthodontic Practice'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commonly held theories that have been disproven over time include: (1) the tooth is pushed upward into the mouth by the growth of the tooth's root, (2) the tooth is pushed upward by the growth of the bone around the tooth, (3) the tooth is pushed upward by vascular pressure, and (4) the tooth is pushed upward by the cushioned hammock.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Craniofacial Growth and Development'', pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The cushioned hammock theory, first proposed by Harry Sicher, was taught widely from the 1930s to the 1950s. This theory postulated that a [[ligament]] below a tooth, which Sicher observed under a microscope on a histologic slide, was responsible for eruption. Later, the "ligament" Sicher observed was determined to be merely an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] created in the process of preparing the slide.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Craniofacial Growth and Development'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely held current theory is that while several forces might be involved in eruption, the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process. Theorists hypothesize that the periodontal ligaments promote eruption through the shrinking and cross-linking of their collagen fibers and the contraction of their fibroblasts.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Craniofacial Growth and Development'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although tooth eruption occurs at different times for different people, a general eruption timeline exists. Typically, humans have 20 [[Deciduous teeth|primary (baby) teeth]] and 32 [[permanent teeth]].&lt;ref&gt;The American Dental Association, ''Tooth Eruption Charts'' found here {{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/sections/scienceAndResearch/pdfs/patient_56.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108190834/http://www.ada.org/sections/scienceAndResearch/pdfs/patient_56.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tooth eruption has three stages. The first, known as deciduous [[dentition]] stage, occurs when only primary teeth are visible. Once the first permanent tooth erupts into the mouth, the teeth are in the mixed (or transitional) dentition. After the last primary tooth falls out of the mouth—a process known as exfoliation—the teeth are in the permanent dentition.

Primary dentition starts on the arrival of the [[mandibular central incisor]]s, usually at eight months, and lasts until the first permanent molars appear in the mouth, usually at six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Major M. |last1=Ash |first2=Stanley J. |last2=Nelson |title=Wheeler's dental anatomy, physiology, and occlusion |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |pages=38 and 41 |isbn=978-0-7216-9382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary teeth typically erupt in the following order: (1) central [[incisor]], (2) lateral incisor, (3) first [[Molar (tooth)|molar]], (4) [[Canine tooth|canine]], and (5) second molar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Major M. |last1=Ash |first2=Stanley J. |last2=Nelson |title=Wheeler's dental anatomy, physiology, and occlusion |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=38 |isbn=978-0-7216-9382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, four teeth erupt for every six months of life, mandibular teeth erupt before maxillary teeth, and teeth erupt sooner in females than males.&lt;ref&gt;WebMd, ''Dental Health: Your Child's Teeth'' found here [http://www.webmd.com/content/article/66/79639.htm?z=4208_00000_9003_to_02].&lt;/ref&gt; During primary dentition, the tooth buds of permanent teeth develop below the primary teeth, close to the palate or tongue.

Mixed dentition starts when the first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Major M. |last1=Ash |first2=Stanley J. |last2=Nelson |title=Wheeler's dental anatomy, physiology, and occlusion |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=41 |isbn=978-0-7216-9382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent teeth in the maxilla erupt in a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) [[Maxillary first molar|first molar]] (2) [[Maxillary central incisor|central incisor]], (3) [[Maxillary lateral incisor|lateral incisor]], (4) [[Maxillary first premolar|first premolar]], (5) [[Maxillary second premolar|second premolar]], (6) [[Maxillary canine|canine]], (7) [[Maxillary second molar|second molar]], and (8) [[Maxillary third molar|third molar]]. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) [[Mandibular first molar|first molar]] (2) [[Mandibular central incisor|central incisor]], (3) [[Mandibular lateral incisor|lateral incisor]], (4) [[Mandibular canine|canine]], (5) [[Mandibular first premolar|first premolar]], (6) [[Mandibular second premolar|second premolar]], (7) [[Mandibular second molar|second molar]], and (8) [[Mandibular third molar|third molar]]. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars.&lt;ref&gt;Monthly Microscopy Explorations, ''Exploration of the Month: January 1998 ''.&lt;/ref&gt; If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to be lost in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Health Hawaii, ''Primary Teeth: Importance and Care '' found here {{cite web |url=http://www.healthhawaii.org/dental/primary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517115628/http://www.healthhawaii.org/dental/primary.html |archivedate=2006-05-17 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as [[malocclusion]]. [[Orthodontics]] may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.

The permanent dentition begins when the last primary tooth is lost, usually at 11 to 12 years, and lasts for the rest of a person's life or until all of the teeth are lost ([[edentulism]]). During this stage, third molars (also called "[[wisdom teeth]]") are frequently [[Extraction (dental)|extracted]] because of decay, pain or impactions. The main reasons for [[tooth loss]] are [[dental caries|decay]] and [[periodontal disease]].&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Periodontology, ''Oral Health Information for the Public '' found here [http://www.perio.org/patient-resources].&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the eruption enamel is covered by a specific film: [[James Nasmyth|Nasmyth's membrane]] or 'enamel cuticle', structure of embryological origin is composed of [[keratin]] which gives rise to the [[enamel organ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Armstrong WG |title=Origin and nature of the acquired pellicle |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=61 |issue=9 |pages=923–30 |date=September 1968 |pmid=5679017 |pmc=1902619}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Darling AI |title=The Distribution of the Enamel Cuticle and Its Significance |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=499–502 |date=July 1943 |pmid=19992694 |pmc=1998608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition and tooth development==
As in other aspects of human growth and development, nutrition has an effect on the developing tooth. Essential nutrients for a healthy tooth include [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], and [[vitamin]]s [[retinol|A]], [[Vitamin C|C]], and [[Vitamin D|D]].&lt;ref&gt;The American Dental Hygiene Association, ''Nutritional Factors in Tooth Development'' found here [http://www.adha.org/CE_courses/course7/nutritional_factors.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium and phosphorus are needed to properly form the hydroxyapatite crystals, and their levels in the blood are maintained by Vitamin D. Vitamin A is necessary for the formation of [[keratin]], as Vitamin C is for collagen. Fluoride, although not a nutrient, is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal of a developing tooth and bones. The dental theory is the low levels of fluoride  incorporation and very mild fluorosis makes the tooth more resistant to demineralization and subsequent decay.&lt;ref name="Ross, Kaye p. 453"/&gt;

Deficiencies of nutrients can have a wide range of effects on tooth development.&lt;ref&gt;The American Dental Hygiene Association, ''Table II. Effects of nutrient deficiencies on tooth development'' found here [http://www.adha.org/CE_courses/course7/table2.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D are deficient, the hard structures of a tooth may be less mineralized. A lack of vitamin A can cause a reduction in the amount of enamel formation. 

Fluoride ingestion has been noted to delay eruption of teeth for as much as a year or more from the accepted eruption dates since the initial 1940s fluoridation trials. Researchers theorize that the delay is a manifestation of fluoride's depressing impact on thyroid hormones. The delay in eruption has been suggested as the reason for the apparent difference in decay among the youngest children. Fluoride ingestion during tooth development can lead to a permanent condition known as [[Dental fluorosis|fluorosis]] with varying levels of severity, the result of fluoride's interference with the normal osteoblast development.&lt;ref&gt;Prenatal and postnatal ingestion of fluorides - A Progress Report.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a hormone-disrupting chemical that has been implicated in having negative effects on human health, including, but not limited to, fetal development. As shown in animal studies which mimic human enamel, the mother’s consumption of products with BPA during pregnancy can lead to the child’s tooth development being obstructed. Those children are shown to be prone to incisor and first molar hypomineralization, a weakened state of the enamel. Additionally, it is most important for mother’s to avoid BPA during pregnancy, but also avoid BPA-use in the child’s products up to five months of age.

==Developmental disturbances==
Anodontia is a complete lack of tooth development, and hypodontia is a lack of some tooth development. Anodontia is rare, most often occurring in a condition called [[Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia]], while hypodontia is one of the most common developmental abnormalities, affecting 3.5&amp;ndash;8.0% of the population (not including third molars). The absence of [[third molar]]s is very common, occurring in 20&amp;ndash;23% of the population, followed in prevalence by the [[second premolar]] and [[lateral incisor]]. Hypodontia is often associated with the absence of a dental lamina, which is vulnerable to environmental forces, such as infection and [[chemotherapy]] medications, and is also associated with many syndromes, such as [[Down syndrome]] and [[Crouzon syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orthodontics and Paediatric Dentistry |last=Millett |first=Declan T. |author2=Richard Welbury  |year=2000 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0-443-06287-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hyperdontia]] is the development of extraneous teeth. It occurs in 1&amp;ndash;3% of [[White (people)|Caucasians]] and is more frequent in [[Asian people|Asian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Damm, Allen, and Bouquot, ''Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; About 86% of these cases involve a single extra tooth in the mouth, most commonly found in the maxilla, where the [[incisor]]s are located.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, ''Basic Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperdontia is believed to be associated with an excess of dental lamina.

Dilaceration is an abnormal bend found on a tooth, and is nearly always associated with trauma that moves the developing tooth bud. As a tooth is forming, a force can move the tooth from its original position, leaving the rest of the tooth to form at an abnormal angle. [[Cyst]]s or [[tumor]]s adjacent to a tooth bud are forces known to cause dilaceration, as are primary (baby) teeth pushed upward by trauma into the gingiva where it moves the tooth bud of the permanent tooth.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Damm, Allen, and Bouquot, ''Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enamel hypoplasia]] or hypomineralization is a defect of the teeth caused by a disturbance in the formation of the organic enamel matrix, clinically visible as enamel defects.&lt;ref name=KanchanMachado2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Kanchan T, Machado M, Rao A, Krishan K, Garg AK|title=Enamel hypoplasia and its role in identification of individuals: A review of literature|date=Apr 2015|journal=Indian J Dent|volume=6|issue=2|pages=99–102|doi=10.4103/0975-962X.155887|pmid=26097340|pmc=4455163|type=Revisión}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be caused by nutritional factors,&lt;ref name=KanchanMachado2015 /&gt; some diseases (such as undiagnosed and untreated [[coeliac disease|celiac disease]],&lt;ref name=NIH /&gt;&lt;ref name=FerrazCampos2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GiucaCei2010 /&gt; [[chicken pox]], [[congenital syphilis]]&lt;ref name=KanchanMachado2015 /&gt;), [[hypocalcaemia|hypocalcemia]], [[fluoride]] ingestion, [[birth injury]], [[preterm birth]], [[infection]] or trauma from a [[deciduous teeth|deciduous tooth]].&lt;ref name=KanchanMachado2015 /&gt;

[[Regional odontodysplasia]] is rare, but is most likely to occur in the maxilla and anterior teeth. The cause is unknown; a number of causes have been postulated, including a disturbance in the neural crest cells, infection, radiation therapy, and a decrease in vascular supply (the most widely held hypothesis).&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Damm, Allen, and Bouquot, ''Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Teeth affected by regional odontodysplasia nevAmelogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a defect in dental enamel formation. Teeth are often free of enamel, small, misshapen, and tinted brown. The cause of these deformities is due to a mutation in enamel in expression.  Dental patients with this disease should be especially cautious and visit their dentist frequently.
  
Natal and neonatal teeth are an anomaly that involves teeth erupting in a newborn infant’s mouth earlier than usual. The incidence ranges from 1:2,000 to 1:3,500 births. Natal teeth are more frequent, approximately three times more common than neonatal teeth. Some authors reported a higher prevalence in females than males. The most common location is the mandibular region of the central incisors.&lt;ref name=MhaskeYuwanati2013&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mhaske S, Yuwanati MB, Mhaske A, Ragavendra R, Kamath K, Saawarn S|title=Natal and neonatal teeth: an overview of the literature|journal=ISRN Pediatr|volume=2013|pages=1–11|date=Aug 18, 2013|pmid=24024038|pmc=3759256|doi=10.1155/2013/956269|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natal teeth and neonatal teeth are associated with genetics, developmental abnormalities and certain recognized syndromes. Additional names for this condition include precocious dentition, baby teeth, and milk teeth.

'''Hyperlexia''' is a [[syndrome]] characterized by a [[child]]'s [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] [[Literacy|ability to read]]. It was initially identified by [[Norman E.|Norman E. Silberberg]] and [[Margaret C. Silberberg]] (1967), who defined it as the precocious ability to read words without prior training in learning to read, typically before the age of 5. They indicated that children with hyperlexia have a significantly higher word-decoding ability than their [[reading comprehension]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richman|first=Lynn, C.|author2=Wood, K.M.|title=Learning disability subtypes: classification of high functioning hyperlexia|journal=Brain and Language|year=2002|volume=82|issue=1|pages=10–21|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(02)00007-X|pmid=12174811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with hyperlexia also present with an intense fascination for written material at a very early age.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976341630639X|title=Hyperlexia: Systematic review, neurocognitive modelling, and outcome|last=Ostrolenk|first=Alexia|date=May 2017|access-date=2017-05-25|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.04.029|pmid=28478182|volume=79|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|pages=134–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperlexic children are often fascinated by [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s or [[number]]s.  They are extremely good at decoding language and thus often become very early readers.  Some hyperlexic children learn to spell long words (such as ''[[elephant]]'') before they are two years old and learn to read whole sentences before they turn three.
An [[fMRI]] study of a single child showed that hyperlexia may be the [[neurological]] opposite of [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref name="pmid14715131"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turkeltaub|first1=Peter E|last2=Flowers|first2=D.Lynn|last3=Verbalis|first3=Alyssa|last4=Miranda|first4=Martha|last5=Gareau|first5=Lynn|last6=Eden|first6=Guinevere F|title=The Neural Basis of Hyperlexic Reading: An fMRI Case Study|journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]|date=January 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=11–25|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00803-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology==
The word hyperlexia is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hyper'' ("over") and ''léxis'' ("[[diction]]", "word").

==Development==
Although hyperlexic children usually learn to read in a non-communicative way, several studies have shown that they can acquire reading comprehension and communicative language after the onset of hyperlexia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They follow a different developmental trajectory relative to neurotypical individuals, with milestones being acquired in a different order. Despite hyperlexic children's precocious reading ability, they may struggle to [[communicate]].  Often, hyperlexic children will have a precocious ability to read but will learn to speak only by [[rote learning|rote]] and heavy repetition, and may also have difficulty learning the [[rules of language]] from examples or from [[trial and error]], which may result in social problems. Their language may develop using [[echolalia]], often repeating words and sentences.  Often, the child has a large [[vocabulary]] and can identify many objects and pictures, but cannot put their language skills to good use. Spontaneous language is lacking and their [[Pragmatics|pragmatic speech]] is [[Language delay|delayed]]. Hyperlexic children often struggle with [[Five Ws|Who? What? Where? Why? and How? questions]]. Between the ages of 4 and 5 years old, many children make great strides in communicating.

The [[social skills]] of a child with hyperlexia often lag tremendously.  Hyperlexic children often have far less interest in playing with other children than do their peers.

==Types of hyperlexia==

In one paper, [[Darold Treffert]] proposes three types of hyperlexia.&lt;ref name="Hyperlexia Types"/&gt; Specifically:
*Type 1: [[Neurotypical]] children who are very early readers.
*Type 2: Children on the autism spectrum who demonstrate very early reading as a [[splinter skill]].
*Type 3: Very early readers who are not on the autism spectrum, though they exhibit some "autistic-like" traits and behaviours which gradually fade as the child gets older.

A different paper by [[Rebecca Williamson Brown]], [[Doctor of Optometry|OD]] proposes only two types of hyperlexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Rebecca Williamson|title=Hyperlexia: Related to Vision and Language Problems|url=http://www.nldline.com/hyperlexia.htm|website=NLDline|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
*Type 1: Hyperlexia marked by an accompanying language disorder.
*Type 2: Hyperlexia marked by an accompanying [[visual-spatial learning disorder]].

==Non-English Studies==

In studies in [[Cantonese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]], subjects were able to read non-words in their native [[orthography]] without a delay relative to the speed with which they read real words in their native orthography.  There is a delay noted with exception words in [[English language|English]], including the examples: chaos, unique, and enough.  These studies also illustrate difficulties in understanding what it is that they are reading.  The findings suggest that non-hyperlexic readers rely more heavily on word [[semantics]] in order to make inferences about word meaning.&lt;ref name="HyperK"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Sung Hee|last2=Hwang|first2=Mina|title=Word and nonword processing without meaning support in Korean-speaking children with and without hyperlexia|journal=[[Reading and Writing]]|date=1 August 2014|volume=28|issue=2|pages=217–238|doi=10.1007/s11145-014-9522-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HyperC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=W.|last2=Weekes|first2=B.|last3=Iao|first3=L.|last4=To|first4=K.|last5=Su|first5=I.|title=Is Reading Aloud Semantically Mediated in Chinese Hyperlexia?|journal=Procedia — Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=October 2013|volume=94|pages=153–154|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.09.075|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813031777|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cantonese study distinguish [[homographs]] and determine the readings for rarely used characters.  In this study, the subject also made errors of [[phonetic analogy]] and regularization of sound.  The authors of the study, Weekes, Wong, Iao, To, and Su, suggest that the two routes model for reading Chinese characters may be in effect for hyperlexics.  The two routes model describes understanding of Chinese characters in a purely phonetic sense and the understanding of Chinese characters in a semantic sense.&lt;ref name="HyperC" /&gt;

The semantics deficit is also illustrated in the study of Korean hyperlexics through a priming experiment.  Non-hyperlexic children read words primed with a related image faster than non-primed words while hyperlexics read them at the same pace.  Lee Sunghee and Hwang Mina, the authors of the Korean study, also found that hyperlexics have fewer errors in non-word reading than non-hyperlexics.  They suggest that this may be because of an imbalance in the [[phonological]], [[orthographical]], and semantic understandings of the subjects’ native language and writing system, in this case, [[Hangul]].  This combination of the parts of linguistics is known as [[connectionist theory]], in which non-words are distinguished from words by differences in interaction between phonology, orthography, and semantics.&lt;ref name="HyperK" /&gt;

In the Lee and Hwang study, the subjects scored lower on general language test and vocabulary tests than the average for their age groups.  Literacy education in [[South Korea]] involves teaching students entire words, rather than starting with the relationship between phonemes and letters in Hangul, despite evidence that letter name knowledge is useful for learning to read words that have not been taught.  The results suggest that hyperlexics are able to obtain the relations between letters (or the smallest unit of the writing system) and their phonemes without knowing the names.&lt;ref name="HyperK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Young-Suk|title=The foundation of literacy skills in Korean: the relationship between letter-name knowledge and phonological awareness and their relative contribution to literacy skills|journal=Reading and Writing|date=29 June 2008|volume=22|issue=8|pages=907–931|doi=10.1007/s11145-008-9131-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reading comprehension|Comprehension]] difficulties can also be a result of hyperlexia.  Semantics and comprehension both have ties to meaning.  Semantics relates to the meaning of a certain word while comprehension is the understanding of a longer text.  In both studies, interpretation and meaning based tests proved difficult for the hyperlexic subjects.

The '''International Federation of Medical Students' Associations''' ('''IFMSA''') is a [[non governmental organization]] representing associations of [[medical students]]. It was founded in May 1951  and currently maintains 135 [[#Members|member organisations]] from 125 [[county|countries]] on six [[continent]]s.&lt;ref name="nmolist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifmsa.org/who-we-are/|title=IFMSA.org - Who we are?|accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The International Federation of Medical Students' Associations was one of the numerous international student organizations set up directly after the end of the Second World War. The first meeting that saw the establishment of the Federation was held in Copenhagen, Denmark in May 1951. The first members of this new organization were England, Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Denmark. London saw the first General Assembly of IFMSA in July 1952. The meeting had a total of thirty participants from ten countries.

Starting from the exclusively European founding organizations the Federation has expanded to include 135 members from all over the world.

IFMSA has always focused on student mobility and exchange as well as conference and workshop organization. The first conferences were the Student International Clinical Conferences, which were quite successful in the 1950s. Various summer schools have been organized through the years, starting in 1963 in Denmark, the UK and [[Scandinavia]]. Other conferences have discussed medical education, drugs and AIDS and HIV issues. In the 1960s projects were organized to help less advantaged students in developing countries the Book Aid project, which sought to send medical books from wealthier nations and the Equipment Appeal, which promoted the shipping of surplus medical equipment to these countries.

The 1970s medical students saw a need for the decentralization of IFMSA. To this aim, IFMSA contributed to the creation of regional medical student organizations in Africa and Asia. Subsequently, regional vice-presidents were elected for six regions as a way of promoting regionalization but this structure was abandoned after a few years.

In the early 1980s IFMSA issued a number of resolutions and declarations on topics ranging from Medical Education to the Prevention of Nuclear War to Primary Health Care. In the late 80's there was a push towards organizing projects that would be able to make a change locally and thus the Village Concept Project idea was born after collaboration with other international student organizations. 1986 also saw the start of the Leadership Training Programs in collaboration with [[World Health Organization]]. These training programs are still active today.

Official relations with WHO started back in 1969, when the collaboration resulted in the organization of a symposium on "Programmed Learning in Medical Education", as well as immunology and tropical medicine programs. In the following years, IFMSA and WHO collaborated in the organization of a number of workshops and training programs. IFMSA has been collaborating with UNESCO since 1971. Since 2007 IFMSA has been an official supporting organization of [[HIFA2015 (Healthcare Information For All by 2015)]].

== Activities ==
The main activities of IFMSA are student exchanges and different projects. Around 10 000 medical students each year participate in international medical student exchanges, both professional and academic (research). IFMSA organizes projects, programs, seminars and workshops on areas of public health, medical education, reproductive health and human rights and peace.

== Organization ==
All activities of the IFMSA are linked to one of its six standing committees, which are:
* Standing Committee on Medical Education (SCOME)
* Standing Committee on Professional Exchange (SCOPE)
* Standing Committee on Research Exchange (SCORE)
* Standing Committee on Public Health (SCOPH)
* Standing Committee on Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health including HIV/AIDS (SCORA)
* Standing Committee on Human Rights and Peace (SCORP)

== Aims ==
To be a forum for medical students throughout the world to discuss topics related to health, education and medicine; to formulate policies from such discussions and to carry out appropriate activities;
To promote humanitarian ideals and medical ethics amongst medical students;
To act as a mechanism for medical students' professional and scientific exchange and projects;
To be a body through which cooperation and contacts with other international organizations are established;
To act as a mechanism for member organizations to raise funds for projects recognized by the IFMSA.

== Objectives ==
The goal of the Federation is to serve society and medical students all over the world through its member organisations by:
* Empowering medical students in using their knowledge and capacities for the benefit of society.
* Providing a forum for medical students throughout the world to discuss topics related to individual and community health, education and science and to formulate policies from such discussions.
* Promoting and facilitating professional and scientific exchanges as well as projects and extracurricular trainings for medical students, thereby sensitising them to other cultures and societies and their health problems.
* Providing a link between members, medical students' associations and international organisations, and to encourage co-operation between them for the ultimate benefit of society.

== Structure ==
To be able to work together, IFMSA has created an organizational structure, which facilitates the flow of ideas and enables the development of activities.

IFMSA is composed of medical students' associations from 125 different countries, from which are formed 135 members of IFMSA and are called National Member Organizations (NMO's). All the activities of IFMSA are organized by the NMO's. Each NMO has its own identity. Most NMO's have Local Committees at the medical schools in their country. The Local Committees coordinate and organize IFMSA activities. Through these Local Committees the NMO's are in direct contact with the medical students.

IFMSA is a federation, which respects the autonomy of its members, the NMO's. The NMO's can decide which activities they take part in and what new activities should be developed.

==Members==
{{main article|List of IFMSA member organisations}}
[[File:IFMSA National Member Organisations - World Map.svg|center|800px]]

IFMSA as an [[umbrella organization]] embraces 135 national and local organisations in 125 [[county|countries]] on six [[continent]]s.

== The International Framework of IFMSA ==
The decision making process is in the hands of the General Assembly, the executive process is in the hands of the International Board and the controlling power is in the hands of the Supervising Council.

The General Assembly (GA) is composed of representatives of all NMO's, and meets twice a year in March and August. The General Assembly decides the activities of IFMSA, the regulations, and the management and elects the Team of Officials and the Supervising Council.

The General Assembly elects the Team of Officials (TO) each year. It is composed of the Executive Board (EB), Standing Committee Directors, Liaison Officers and Regional Directors. The Executive Board is responsible for the daily management of the Federation and deals with issues such as fundraising, marketing, external relations, finances, administration, development and support to National Member Organisations.

Standing Committee Directors are assigned to one field of activities. They coordinate the Standing Committee, which carries out these activities. They give support to national and local officers, prepare the meetings of the Standing Committee and are responsible for development of new activities.

Liaison Officers maintain the contacts with important external relations and represent IFMSA towards those organizations. The Regional Directors are responsible of each of the IFMSA 5 Regions.

The Supervising Council is elected by the General Assembly to evaluate and supervise the work of the IFMSA officials and undertakes actions in case problems arise.

== Meetings ==

===General Assemblies===
Twice a year, the delegations of the NMO's of IFMSA get together at the IFMSA General Assemblies. The March Meeting and the August Meeting bring together several hundred (600–900) medical students from all around the world. During the seven days of the meetings, the delegates discuss matters of the Federation and make valuable contacts for their organizations.

The General Assembly remains the highest decision making body of the Federation although the actual program of the meeting has developed into a mixture of training, planning and evaluation sessions in between the legislative Plenary Sessions. The work in the Standing Committees of IFMSA is the essence for most delegates: signing contracts, presenting and planning projects are all in a day's work for the National Officers from the participating organizations. An extensive Training and Resource Development component has been integrated in the program, providing the participants with new skills needed in their work, but seldom found in the regular University curriculum: Lobbying Skills, Group Dynamics and Strategic Planning to name a few.

With IFMSA being much more than just exchanges, the Project Fair has evolved to extend presentations of local, national and international projects outside the Standing Committees. Round Table Discussions enable the student delegates to discuss currently relevant topics with invited experts and short lectures are frequently given by representatives from, for example, different UN agencies.

A special Financial Committee is elected at each General Assembly to audit the budget and finances of the Federation. Other legislative proceedings at the meetings include adoption of reports from the Executive Board members, IFMSA Officials and IFMSA projects, and adoption of official IFMSA Policy Statements. Guidelines on which areas IFMSA should focus on and other important decisions for the future of the Federation are prepared by the Presidents of the National Member Organizations together with the Executive Board and brought for approval to the Plenary Sessions.

Hosting a General Assembly is an honor, but also a great trial for the Organizing Committee. The entire process is run by voluntary students, from the fundraising to the implementation, and shows that the power of IFMSA indeed lies at the local level. As with any international meeting, the social program is important in providing relaxation between the long hours of work, and giving the hosts an opportunity to show their culture and creativity to their foreign friends.

===Regional and sub-regional meetings===
In addition to the General Assemblies, the National Member Organizations are also getting together for Regional Meetings. These meetings follow a similar agenda as General Assemblies, and are organized yearly for each region. They allow more students of the Region to gather, because the meeting is always in the Region, and the agenda is focused on regionally relevant topics.

== Awards ==
The IFMSA won on October 3, 2014 the [http://socmedawards.com/healthsystemsglobal/winners/ Health Systems Award - Civil Organization]. This award recognizes the organization that best employs social media to engage civil society in health systems-related dialogue. It recognizes the work the Federation has been doing all around the world to connect and engage with health communities around the world so to shape the sustainable and healthy future we want.

==Career==
Van Bemmel was born in [[Rotterdam]] on 17 November 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gzNvCGJEGCYC&amp;pg=PA253 Bemmel, J.H. van] in ''De leden van de Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen: een demografisch perspectief: 1808 tot 2008'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eur&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eur.nl/nieuws/journalisten/archief/archief_persberichten_2000/profdrir_jh_van_bemmel_benoemd_tot_rector_magnificus_van_de_erasmus/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512212941/http://www.eur.nl/nieuws/journalisten/archief/archief_persberichten_2000/profdrir_jh_van_bemmel_benoemd_tot_rector_magnificus_van_de_erasmus/ |title=Prof.dr.ir.

'''Late preterm infants''' are [[infants]] born at a [[gestational age]] between {{frac|34|0|7}} weeks and {{frac|36|6|7}} weeks.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt; They have higher morbidity and mortality rates than term infants (gestational age ≥37 weeks) due to their relative physiologic and metabolic immaturity, even though they are often the size and weight of some term infants.&lt;ref name="Late preterm infants"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barfield|first1=Wanda|title=Late preterm infants|website=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-preterm-infants|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Late preterm" has replaced "near term" to describe this group of infants, since near term incorrectly implies that these infants are "almost term" and only require routine neonatal care.&lt;ref name="Late preterm infants"/&gt;

In 2005, late-preterm births accounted for more than 70% of all preterm births (&lt;37 weeks’ gestation), or approximately 377,000 infants. In fact, much of the increase in the preterm birth rate in recent years can be attributed to increases in late-preterm births.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

== Risk Factors ==
Several important factors that may predispose late-preterm infants to medical conditions associated with immaturity:&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;
* [[respiratory distress]]
* [[apnea]]
* temperature instability
* hypoglycemia
* [[hyperbilirubinemia]]
* poor feeding

At 34–35 weeks, the brain weight is only about {{frac|2|3}} that of a full-term baby.  This may lead to an increased risk of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moster|first1=Dag|last2=Lie|first2=Rolv|last3=Markestad|first3=Trond|title=Long Term Medical and Social Consequences of Preterm Birth|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=July 17, 2008|volume=359|pages=262–273|doi=10.1056/nejmoa0706475|pmid=18635431}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early School-Age Outcomes of Late Preterm Infants|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 15, 2008|volume=123|issue=4|page=e622-e629|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-1405}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mental retardation
* Developmental delay/disability
* Special needs – education
* Retention in kindergarten
* Cerebral palsy

==Neonatal Nutrition==
Late preterm infants have immature gastrointestinal function and feeding difficulties that predispose them to in increase in enterohepatic circulation, decreased stool frequency, dehydration, and hyperbilirubinemia. Feeding during the birth hospitalization may be transiently successful, but not sustained after discharge. Feeding difficulties are associated with relatively low oromotor tone, function, and neural maturation also predispose these infants to dehydration and hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;ref name=Engle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engle|first1=William|last2=Tomashek|first2=Kay|last3=Wallman|first3=Carol|title="Late-Preterm" Infants: A Population at Risk|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 2007|volume=120|issue=6|pages=1390–1401|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2952}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Late Preterm Infants have an increased risk of being underweight and stunted at 12 and 24 months of age versus term infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=Ina|title=Late preterm birth is a risk factor for growth faltering in early childhood: a cohort study|journal=BMC Pediatrics|date=November 16, 2009|volume=9|issue=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper nutrition is essential for normal growth, optimal neurologic and cognitive development, immune protection, and long term health.

==Feeding==
The last trimester of pregnancy the fetus is expressing active amino acid transport, calcium, lipid transfer, and glucose facilitated diffusion.  Delivery of the premature infant requires higher energy expenditure, but with inadequate intake the infant will have negative nitrogen balance.  There are higher needs for Calcium, Phosphorus, and Vitamin D.

==Early Nutrition and Cognitive Outcome==
For every 10 kcal/kg increase in energy intake in the first week of life, there is a 4.6 points increase in MDI (Mental Development Index) at 18 months.

* Small mouth and immature oral muscle
* Weak suck and poor latch
* Easily tire with feeding
* Maternal delayed milk production

==When To Start Feeding==

Factors such as hemodynamic stability, severe IUGR, respiratory, abdominal exam, whether feeding cues are present, and stable glucose could all effect the timing of nutrition.  Some preterm infants will be NPO (nil per os).  If infants are unable to start oral or enteral intake intravenous fluids may begin with amino acids or total parenteral nutrition.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics section on breastfeeding recommendations are all infants should receive human milk.

{{globalize|date=February 2015}}

The '''Doctorate of Medicine and of Philosophy (MD–PhD)''' is a dual doctoral degree for [[physician–scientist]]s, combining the vocational training of the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree with the research expertise of the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree. The degree is granted by [[medical school]]s often through the [[Medical Scientist Training Program]] or other non-MSTP MD–PhD programs. The [[National Institutes of Health]] currently provides 43 medical schools with Medical Scientist Training Program grants that support the training of students in MD–PhD programs at these institutions through tuition and stipend allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/Pages/PredocOverview-MSTP.aspx |title=Medical Scientist Training Program – National Institute of General Medical Sciences |publisher=Nigms.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703191311/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/Pages/PredocOverview-MSTP.aspx |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are often competitive, with some admitting as few as two students per academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2014/02/27/merge-interests-in-science-medicine-with-an-md-phd|title=Merge Interests in Science, Medicine With an M.D.–Ph.D.|publisher=usnews.com|date=|accessdate=2015-08-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906065240/http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2014/02/27/merge-interests-in-science-medicine-with-an-md-phd|archivedate=2015-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCAT score and GPA of MD–PhD matriculants are often higher than MD only matriculants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aamc.org/download/321548/data/factstableb10.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104073150/https://www.aamc.org/download/321548/data/factstableb10.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aamc.org/download/321506/data/factstablea22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application and admissions ==
MD–PhD typically require or prefer candidates who have had a background in research, either under a professor as an undergraduate or have taken at least one gap year to work in a laboratory setting. The application process in addition to a personal statement required for MD-only applications also require two additional essays to describe why an applicant wants to pursue an MD–PhD and an essay describing their research background.

== Training programs ==
In the [[United States]], MD–PhD degrees can be obtained through dual-degree programs offered at some medical schools. The idea for an integrated training program began at [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] in 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mstp.cwru.edu/ |title=CWRU Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) |publisher=cwru.edu |accessdate=2012-06-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310193334/http://mstp.cwru.edu/ |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly spread to other research medical schools. In 1964, through the Chief of the Office of Program Planning and Evaluation Herbert H. Rosenberg, Ph.D., the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) developed a grant to underwrite some universities' MD–PhD programs. This funding was distributed through the [[Medical Scientist Training Program]] (MSTP). There are also non-MSTP funded dual-degree programs (e.g., the Medical Scholars Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago, which receives funding through endowment funds, research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and extramural fellowships).  Non-MSTP funded dual degree programs have more flexibility and can extend to degrees other than the PhD (e.g., JD and MBA degrees).

Admission to a dual degree program is not a requirement to receive MD and PhD degrees. An individual has the option to complete each degree separately through single-degree programs. However, the student is responsible for all medical school tuition and does not receive a stipend during their MD education. Furthermore, since the PhD training is not streamlined with the medical training, students will often take additional years to complete their PhD.

A PhD may also be obtained by physicians during the residency training period. This combined research and graduate-level medical education are offered by a minority of residency programs. This additional education typically extends the residency period by three to four years.

==Training structure==
===Pre-doctoral===
Upon matriculating in an MD–PhD program, students will often follow a 2-PhD-2 plan. In this system, students will complete the pre-clinical curriculum of their medical school (2 years), transition into PhD graduate training (3–5 years), and then finally complete clinical rotations (2 years).

===Post-doctoral===
Upon receiving the MD–PhD dual degree, physician-scientists may choose a variety of career paths. The most common continues to be residency training with additional laboratory training.  However, a physician–scientist may also elect to refuse residency training, thereby having a career essentially akin to a conventional PhD scientist. A physician–scientist may also elect to work in the private sector with no further formal academic clinical nor research training.

==Benefits of the dual degree program==
===Financial compensation===
Some  MD–PhD programs (all MSTPs) cover all medical school tuition, provide a stipend, and cover health insurance expenses.

===Residency programs===
Candidates with MD–PhD dual degrees are favorably looked upon in most residency programs.

===Career flexibility===
{{Confusing|section|reason=tried to clean up but frankly am not sure what the second sentence is exactly tried to say|date=November 2017}}

Graduates with an MD–PhD degree are generally qualified for a variety of careers in medicine and medical research. On top of graduating debt free, graduates generally have to stay in the medical field to pay off large debts if they decide to quit medicine and find work as a researcher or in academia.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Like residency, MD–PhD graduates are often given preference in any research or academia job applications.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Career paths==
The vast majority (over 80%) of MD–PhD graduates eventually choose to enter [[academia]], government, or industry where medical research is a central component of their duties.&lt;ref name=Ley_2005&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ley TJ| author2=Rosenberg LE | title=The physician-scientist career pipeline in 2005: build it, and they will come | journal=JAMA | date=2005 | pages=1343–51 | volume=294 | issue=11 | pmid=16174692 | doi=10.1001/jama.294.11.1343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology|FASEB]] study conducted in 2000, graduates of NIH-funded MSTPs make up just 2.5% of medical school graduates each year, but after graduation, account for about one third of all NIH research grants awarded to physicians. Many MD–PhD graduates also practice clinical medicine in their field of expertise.&lt;ref name=Zemlo_2000&gt;{{cite journal | author=Zemlo TR | author2=Garrison HH | author3=Partridge NC | author4=Ley TJ | title=The physician-scientist: career issues and challenges at the year 2000 | journal=FASEB J | date=2000 | pages=221–30 | volume=14 | issue=2 | pmid=10657979 | url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/full/14/2/221 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626000953/http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/full/14/2/221 | archivedate=2009-06-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical device connectivity''' is the establishment and maintenance of a connection through which data is transferred between a [[medical device]], such as a patient monitor, and an [[information system]]. The term is used interchangeably with biomedical device connectivity or biomedical device integration. By eliminating the need for manual data entry, potential benefits include faster and more frequent data updates, diminished human error, and improved workflow efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witonsky |first1=P |title=Leveraging EHR investments through medical device connectivity |journal=Healthcare Financial Management |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=50–3 |year=2012 |pmid=22931026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical devices may be connected on wireless and wired networks. Wireless networks, including Wi-Fi, Wireless Medical Telemetry Service, and Bluetooth, provide more ubiquitous coverage of connectivity, allowing uninterrupted monitoring of patients in transit. Wired networks are fast, stable, and highly available. Wired networks are usually more costly to install at first and require ongoing costs for maintenance, but allow connectivity of the organization in a closed environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brookstone |first=Alan |date=August 17, 2011 |title=Pros and Cons of Wireless and Local Networks |url=http://www.americanehr.com/blog/2011/08/the-pros-and-cons-of-wireless-and-local-networks/ }}{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interoperability of Devices==

Adherence to '''Standards''' ensures interoperability within a network of medical devices. In most cases, the clinical environment is heterogenous; devices are supplied by a variety of vendors, allowing for different technologies to be utilized. Achieving interoperability can be difficult, as data format and encryption varies among vendors and models.&lt;ref&gt;Day, B., (2011). Standards for medical device interoperability and integration. Patient Safety &amp; Quality Healthcare, Jan/Feb. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.psqh.com/januaryfebruary-2011/739-standards-for-medical-device-interoperability-and-integration.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131192305/http://www.psqh.com/januaryfebruary-2011/739-standards-for-medical-device-interoperability-and-integration.html |archivedate=2013-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The following standards enable interoperability between connected medical device.

*'''CEN [[ISO/IEEE 11073]]*''' enables the communication between medical devices and external information systems. This standard provides plug-and-play interoperability between devices, and facilitates the efficient exchange of data acquired at the point of care in all care environments.{{fact|date=August 2016}}
*[[IEEE 802.11]] a/b/g/n are standards for implementing a [[wireless local area network]] (WLAN) in 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz and 5&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency bands, utilizing the same basic protocol.{{fact|date=August 2016}}

Regulatory organizations and industrial associations, such as [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise]] (IHE) initiative and [[Continua Health Alliance]], are working towards standardized vendor-neutral device integration systems.&lt;ref name=pmid20225710&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rhoads |first1=John G. |last2=Cooper |first2=Todd |last3=Fuchs |first3=Ken |last4=Schluter |first4=Paul |last5=Zambuto |first5=Raymond Peter |title=Medical device interoperability and the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) initiative |journal=Biomedical Instrumentation &amp; Technology |volume=Suppl |issue= |pages=21–7 |year=2010 |pmid=20225710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IHE provides a single set of internationally harmonized medical device informatics and interoperability standards as a unitary reference point for the industry. The IHE collaborates with Continua Health Alliance regarding data exchange protocol and device specializations.&lt;ref name="ftp"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Todd |last1=Cooper |first2=John |last2=Rhoads |date=October 7, 2010 |title=Medical Medical Device Interoperability Interoperability Inquiry |publisher=Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise |url=ftp://ftp.ihe.net/Patient_Care_Devices/Presentations/VA_2010-10-07/VA_MDIP_2010-10-07_PCD_Stds_Overview_Cooper-Rhoads_r2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHE Patient Care Device (PCD) Technical Framework Volumes 1-3 defines the established standards profiles, such as the integration, transaction and semantic content profiles respectively for complete, enterprise-wide integration and interoperability of health information systems.&lt;ref name="ihe_a"&gt;IHE International. (2012). IHE Patient Care Device . Retrieved November 16, 2012, from {{cite web |url=http://www.ihe.net/pcd/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204123845/http://www.ihe.net/pcd/ |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IHE International Inc.

Retrieved November 14, 2012, from http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/index.cfm#pcd&lt;/ref&gt; 
Several profiles have applications in medical device connectivity including the following:

*'''[DEC] Device Enterprise Communication'''  -  supports publication of information from point-of-care medical devices to applications such as clinical information systems and electronic health record systems, using a consistent Health Level Seven version 2 (HL7 v.2) messaging format and device semantic content or [[DICOM]] profile.&lt;ref name="ihe_a" /&gt;
*'''[ACM] Alarm Communication Management''' - ensures the right alarm with the right priority to the right individuals with the right content.&lt;ref name="ihe_a" /&gt;
*'''[DEC-SPD] Subscribe to Patient Data''' - supports a filtering mechanism for data transaction.&lt;ref name="ihe_a" /&gt;
*'''[PIV] Point-of-care Infusion Verification''' - supports communication of a 5-Rights validated medication delivery / infusion order (from Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) system, also known as Barcode Point of Care (BPOC) system, to an infusion pump or pump management system&lt;ref name="ftp" /&gt;
*'''[RTM] Rosetta Terminology Mapping''' - is based on the [[ISO/IEEE 11073]] semantic standards converting vendor specific terms into harmonized standard terms. It uses a set of tools (Excel spreadsheets &amp; XML files) to map the proprietary semantics communicated by medical devices to a standard representation using [[ISO/IEEE 11073]] semantics.&lt;ref name=pmid20225710/&gt;
*'''[IDCO] Implantable Device – Cardiac – Observation (IDCO)*''' profile - specifies a mechanism for transmission, and processing of discrete data elements and report attachments associated with cardiac device observations.&lt;ref name="ihe" /&gt;

== Medical Device Integration Software ==
Hospitals have many different makes and models of medical devices. Each department has different types of devices, and rarely does an entire hospital run the same brand device. Because of the large number of devices, and the varying formats that data is exchanged (RS-232, HL7, Bluetooth, WiFi), Medical Device Integration software has become a critical component to integrating this vital patient data. Software such as Picis [http://www.picis.com/medical-device-integration.html Hawkeye] connects with virtually any device via HL7, Serial (RS-232), Bluetooth, WiFi, etc., and shares this data to any other software platform across a hospital network. This allows hospitals to continue to use their older devices, in a more modern network.

==Positive Patient Identification and Connectivity==
Patient confidentiality can be compromised when the device data is transmitted to the wrong electronic health record. A positive patient identification at the point of care can be ensured through bar-code identifiers and [[radiofrequency identifiers]]. 
*'''Bar-code Identification''' - Patient data is encoded within a bar-code on the patient's identification bracelet. Device identifying data is encoded within a bar-code attached to the device. Scanning the patient bar-code in conjunction with the medical device bar-code, ensures a patient-device association.&lt;ref name="McAlpine"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McAlpine |first1=B |title=Improving medical device connectivity. Both bar coding and RFID technologies can be applied to improve workflow |journal=Health Management Technology |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=18–9 |year=2011 |pmid=21650134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Radiofrequency Identification''' - Patient and device identifying information is encoded within an RFID tag. This information is detected, and the clinician is prompted to confirm the patient-device association. RFID is a more efficient method of positive patient identification when there are multiple devices in use.&lt;ref name="McAlpine" /&gt;

==Security Issues in Medical Device Connectivity==
Security issues may arise in medical networking for many reasons. The following is a list of security challenges particular to medical devices:
* Medical devices often operate with commercial [[central processing units]], [[operating systems]], or [[off-the-shelf software]], which place them at risk of cyber threat.&lt;ref name=Axel&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wirth |first1=Axel |title=Cybercrimes Pose Growing Threat to Medical Devices |journal=Biomedical Instrumentation &amp; Technology |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=26–34 |year=2011 |pmid=21322805 |doi=10.2345/0899-8205-45.1.26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to tight regulations surrounding medical devices, upgrades to software and security installations must be approved by the manufacturer, resulting in delays.&lt;ref name=Axel/&gt;
* Device operating systems are often early generation and may no longer be supported.&lt;ref name=Axel/&gt;
* Homogenous device environments facilitate rapid spread of computer virus.&lt;ref name=Axel/&gt;
* Devices may have limited memory, necessitating the use of scaled back versions of operating systems, making it more difficult to utilize common security software.&lt;ref name=Axel/&gt;

'''Mental distress''' (or '''psychological distress''') is a term used, both by some [[mental health]] practitioners and users of mental health services, to describe a range of symptoms and experiences of a person's internal life that are commonly held to be troubling, confusing or out of the ordinary.

Mental distress has a wider scope than the related term [[mental illness]]. Mental illness refers to a specific set of medically defined conditions. A person in mental distress may exhibit some of the symptoms described in [[psychiatry]], such as: anxiety, confused emotions, hallucination, rage, depression and so on without actually being ‘ill’ in a medical sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=altham.com |url=http://www.changes.org.uk/html/mental_distress.html |title=Mental Distress Changes |publisher=Changes.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life situations such as: bereavement, stress, lack of sleep, use of drugs or alcohol, assault, abuse or accident can induce mental distress. This may be something which resolves without further medical intervention, though people who endure such symptoms longer term are more likely to be diagnosed with mental illness. This definition is not without controversy as some mental health practitioners would use the terms mental distress and mental illness interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Distinguishing mental illness in primary care |journal= BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume= 321|issue= 7273|pages= 1412|date= |pmc=1119126|year= 2000|author1= Goldberg|first1= D|pmid=11187100|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7273.1412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some users of mental health services prefer the term mental distress in describing their experience as they feel it better captures that sense of the unique and personal nature of their experience, while also making it easier to relate to, since everyone experiences distress at different times. The term also fits better with the [[social model of disability]].

==Social disparities among black people==
The social disparities associated with mental health in the Black community have remained constant over time.  According to the Office of Minority Health, black people comprise 12.9% of the U.S. population, yet they are 30% more likely than European Americans to report serious psychological distress.  Moreover black people are more likely to have Major Depressive Disorder, and communicate higher instances of intense symptoms/disability.&lt;ref&gt;Shim et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, researchers have attempted to examine the sociological causes and systemic inequalities which contribute to these disparities in order to highlight issues for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2010; Gonzalez et al., 2008; Shim et al., 2009; Griffith et al., 2009; Levin, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, much of the research on the mental well-being of black people are unable to separate race, culture, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or behavioural and biological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hunter and Schmidt (2010), there are three distinct beliefs embraced by black people which speak to their socio-cultural experience in the United States: a perception of racism, stigma associated with mental illness, and the importance of physical health. According to Raymond Depaulo, M.D., African Americans are less likely to report depression due to heavy social stigma within their community and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these social aspects of mental health can create a lot of distress. Therefore, discrimination within the healthcare community and larger society, attitudes related to mental health, and general physical health contribute largely to the mental well-being of black people .&lt;ref&gt;Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;


Mental health in the black community is a major issue that is often overlooked due to lack of information, stigmas and socio-economic factors. These factors have been the cause of suicide rates between teens ages 10-14 rising 233% within the last 15 years.  Community based issues have also caused black people to be 20% more likely to experience serious mental health conditions than the general population.  Among the stigmas within the black people community, there is also a major discord between mental health providers and their black patients in regards to proper diagnosis and treatment.  It is an issue that is increasingly getting worse, and one that demands that more be done to fight the problems that these mental health issues cause within the black community.

There are also disparities with mental health when it comes to black women. One of the reasons why Black women tend to hesitate when it comes to mental health support and treatment is the aura of the Strong Black Woman schema or S.B.W. According to Watson and Hunter, Various scholars have traced the origins of the SBW race-gender schema to slavery and have suggested that the schema persists because of the struggles that African-American women continue to experience, such as financial hardship…racism, and sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Natalie|date=2015|title=Anxiety and Depression among African American Women: The Costs of Strength and Negative Attitudes toward Psychological Help-Seeking|url=|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=21|pages=604|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson and Hunter state that Black women, due to the strong black woman schema have a tendency to handle tough and difficult situations alone. 

==Mental health disparities among black youth==
Comparable to their adult counterparts, black adolescents experience mental health disparities. The primary reasons for this have been stipulated to be discrimination, inadequate treatment, and underutilization of mental health services, though black youth have been shown to have higher self-esteem than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Alexandre et al., 2010; Freedenthal, 2007; Hughes, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, children of immigrants, or second-generation Americans, often encounter barriers to optimal mental well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Bridges et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2009; Dotterer et al., 2009; Rumbaut, 1994; Nicolas et al., 2009; Seaton et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Discrimination and its effects on mental health are evident in adolescents’ ability to achieve in school and overall self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are unable to pinpoint exact causes for black teenagers’ underutilization of mental health services.  One study attributed this to using alternative methods of support instead of formal treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Freedenthal, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Black youth described other means of support, such as peers and spiritual leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Freedenthal, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  This demonstrates that black teens are uncomfortable disclosing personal matters to formal supports.  It is difficult to decipher if this is cultural or a youth-related issue, as most teens do not choose to access formal supports for their mental health needs.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3057">'''Multifocal''' and '''Accommodating intraocular lenses''' are artificial [[intraocular lens]]es (IOLs) that are designed to provide focus of both distance and near objects, in contrast to monofocal intraocular lenses which only have one focal point and correct distance vision. The issue of restoring [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] following cataract surgery or through refractive lens exchange is becoming an increasingly important topic in ophthalmology.

Intraocular lenses that correct [[presbyopia]] are divided into two main categories:&lt;ref name=azar /&gt;

* ''Multifocal IOLs'': achieve near and distance vision by having two (bifocal) or three (trifocal) focal points simultaneously. The function of multifocal IOL depends on the pupil size for refractive types. The concept is based on the principle that the pupil tends to constrict for near tasks, so the central portion of the lens is designed for near and the outer portion for distance. For diffractive types of multifocal IOLs, light is split by diffraction and the vision is pupil independent.
* ''Accommodating IOLs'': change in shape and power when the ciliary muscle contracts.

== Evidence about different lenses ==

Monofocal lenses are standard lenses used in cataract surgery. People who have a multifocal intraocular lens after their cataract is removed may be less likely to need additional glasses compared with people who have standard monofocal lenses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People receiving multifocal lenses may experience more visual problems, such as glare or haloes (rings around lights), than with monofocal lenses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Silva|first=Samantha R.|last2=Evans|first2=Jennifer R.|last3=Kirthi|first3=Varo|last4=Ziaei|first4=Mohammed|last5=Leyland|first5=Martin|date=2016|title=Multifocal versus monofocal intraocular lenses after cataract extraction|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=12|pages=CD003169|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003169.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27943250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People receiving accommodative intraocular lenses had improvements in near vision but these improvements were small and reduced over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People who received accommodative intraocular lenses may have a higher risk of thickening and clouding of the tissue behind the intraocular lenses (posterior capsule opacification) but there is some uncertainty around this finding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ong|first=Hon Shing|last2=Evans|first2=Jennifer R.|last3=Allan|first3=Bruce D.

The '''''Narcosobrinos'' affair''' (Spanish for ''Narconephews'') is the situation of events that surrounded two nephews of Venezuelan President [[Nicolás Maduro]] and his wife [[Cilia Flores]] who were arrested for narcotics trafficking. The nephews, [[Efraín Antonio Campo Flores]] and [[Francisco Flores de Freitas]], were arrested on 10 November 2015 by the [[United States Drug Enforcement Administration]] in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]] after attempting to transport 800 kilograms of [[cocaine]] into the United States.&lt;ref name=CNN1111&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/americas/venezuela-president-family-members-arrested/|title=U.S. agents arrest members of Venezuelan President's family in Haiti|author=Kay Guerrero and Claudia Dominguez|date=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USvCAMPOSFLORES"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Preet Bharara|Bharara]]|first1=[[Preet Bharara|Preet]]|title=United States of America v.

==Etymology==
The word ''Narcosobrinos'' is the word ''narco'', meaning "[[drug dealer]]", followed by ''sobrinos'', which translates to "nephews". Its translation could therefore be "drug dealer nephews". The term derived from the media which focused on the relation of drug dealing allegations to President Maduro's nephews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narcosobrinos Archivo|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/tag/narcosobrinos/|website=[[La Patilla]]|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EEUU: postergaron una vez más la audiencia de los narcosobrinos de Maduro {{!}} Nicolás Maduro, Narcotráfico en Venezuela, Nueva York - América|url=http://www.infobae.com/2016/05/03/1808848-eeuu-postergaron-una-vez-mas-la-audiencia-los-narcosobrinos-maduro|website=[[Infobae]]|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restan días para el juicio de los "narcosobrinos"|url=http://www.venezuelaaldia.com/2016/05/restan-dias-juicio-los-narcosobrinos/|website=Venezuela al Día|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carrillo Mazzali|first1=Jessica|title=Difieren audiencia del caso de los "narcosobrinos" de Cilia|url=http://www.talcualdigital.com/Nota/123585/difieren-audiencia-del-caso-de-los-narcosobrinos-de-cilia|website=[[Tal Cual]]|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La mujer de Maduro acusa a la DEA de secuestrar a sus "narcosobrinos"|url=http://www.abc.es/internacional/abci-cilia-flores-defiende-narcosobrinos-y-acusa-haberlos-secuestrado-201601132042_noticia.html|website=''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]''|accessdate=20 May 2016|language=es-ES|date=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lozano|first1=Daniel|title=Nicolás Maduro, seis días de silencio en torno al escándalo de los 'narcosobrinos'|url=http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2015/11/17/564b2093ca474124548b45ae.html|website=''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''|accessdate=20 May 2016|date=2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jackson Diehl]], Deputy Editorial Page Editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the Bolivarian government of Venezuela shelters "one of the world's biggest drug cartels". There have been allegations of former president [[Hugo Chávez]] being involved with drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=JDmay2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diehl|first1=Jackson|title=A drug cartel's power in Venezuela|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-drug-cartels-power-in-venezuela/2015/05/24/9bc0ff14-ffd6-11e4-8b6c-0dcce21e223d_story.html|accessdate=29 May 2015|agency=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported from United States officials that drug trafficking in Venezuela increased significantly with Colombian drug traffickers moving from Colombia to Venezuela due to pressure from law enforcement.&lt;ref name=SUNwsj&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeCórdoba|first1=José|last2=Forero|first2=Juan|title=Venezuelan Officials Suspected of Turning Country into Global Cocaine Hub; U.S. probe targets No. 2 official Diosdado Cabello, several others, on suspicion of drug trafficking and money laundering|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelan-officials-suspected-of-turning-country-into-global-cocaine-hub-1431977784|accessdate=19 May 2015|agency=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.]]|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[United States Department of Justice]] official described the higher ranks of the Venezuelan government and military as "a criminal organization", with high ranking Venezuelan officials being accused of drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=SUNwsj/&gt; Those involved with investigations stated that Venezuelan government defectors and former traffickers had given information to investigators and that details of those involved in government drug trafficking were increasing.&lt;ref name=SUNwsj/&gt; Anti-drug authorities have also accused some Venezuelan officials of working with [[Mexican drug cartel]]s.&lt;ref name="ELPAISdrugs2"&gt;{{cite news|last = Meza|first = Alfredo|title = Corrupt military officials helping Venezuela drug trade flourish|url = http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/09/26/inenglish/1380217098_793793.html|accessdate = 5 March 2014|newspaper = El Pais|date = 26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a presentation at the XXXII International Conference on Drugs in 2015, commander of the [[United States Southern Command]] General [[John F.

General Kelly also stated that almost all shipments of cocaine using aircraft comes out of Venezuela and that since 2013 to early-2014, the route of drug trafficking aircraft has changed from heading to Central America to primarily traveling through Caribbean islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Quisiéramos más cooperación del lado venezolano': EE.

Due to the extradition process, New York courts could not apprehend those who assisted the nephews on their way to Haiti,&lt;ref name=ABCnov19/&gt; though a pilot was later arrested.

====Roberto de Jesús Soto García====
On 28 October 2016, a Honduran man, Roberto de Jesús Soto García, was arrested in Honduras and extradited to the United States. According to authorities, Soto García was responsible for transporting drug shipments from [[Juan Manuel Gálvez International Airport]]. Soto García allegedly provided information about the port and was supposed to take the drugs from the nephews into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Detienen a hondureño con petición de extradición de EUA|url=http://www.laprensa.hn/sucesos/1012694-410/detienen-a-hondure%C3%B1o-con-petici%C3%B3n-de-extradici%C3%B3n-de-eua|accessdate=31 January 2017|work=[[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]]|date=28 October 2016|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aircraft pilot====
In June 2016, Yazenky Antonio Lamas Rondón, the pilot of the plane which transported the cocaine and the two nephews, was arrested at the [[El Dorado International Airport]] in [[Bogota, Colombia]] after the DEA and [[Interpol]] put out a [[Arrest warrant|warrant]] for his arrest. According to the DEA, Lamas Rondón piloted over 100 flights over the span of a decade from Venezuela which trafficked various drugs throughout Latin America. He is also believed to be involved with the [[Cartel of the Suns]], a group of corrupt drug trafficking Venezuelan officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gagne|first1=David|title=Venezuela Pilot's Arrest May Hold Clues to Cartel of the Suns|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/venezuela-drug-pilot-may-be-clue-to-cartel-of-the-suns|website=[[InsightCrime]]|accessdate=27 July 2016|date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
{{main|United States of America v. Campo and Flores}}
The nephews originally plead not guilty to the charges of conspiring to transport cocaine into the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Córdoba|first1=Nicole Hong And José De|title=Relatives of Venezuelan President Plead Not Guilty to Drug Charges|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/relatives-of-venezuelan-president-plead-not-guilty-to-drug-charges-1450400141|accessdate=27 July 2016|agency=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the two facing up to [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life in prison]].&lt;ref name="GUARDhuh"&gt;{{cite news|last1=York|first1=Reuters in New|title=Nephews of Venezuela's first lady thought cocaine arrest was kidnapping|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/05/nephews-venezuela-first-lady-cocaine-arrest-kidnapping|accessdate=27 July 2016|agency=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In trial papers filed on 1 July 2016, the nephews stated that they were not [[Miranda warning|informed of their rights]] when detained, attempting to suppress their statements that they made to DEA agents after their arrest.&lt;ref name="GUARDhuh"/&gt; However, on 22 July 2016, their statements made to DEA agents were filed as [[Exhibit (legal)|exhibit]] by the [[United States Attorney|United States Attorney Office in Manhattan]], with the two men confessing to their conspiracy to traffic cocaine into the United States that was supposed to be supplied by the Colombian guerilla group, the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)]].&lt;ref name="REUTconfess"&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela first lady's nephews confessed to drug scheme, U.S. says|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-usa-drugs-idUSKCN10404U|accessdate=27 July 2016|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair hoped to make $20 million through multiple drug shipments.&lt;ref name="REUTconfess"/&gt; A confidential informant posing as a leader of the Sinaloa cartel confessions testified that Efrain Campo planned to finance Cilia Flores' congressional campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEA: Nephew sold drugs to fund Venezuelan first lady's campaign|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article102203927.html|agency=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=September 18, 2016|date=  September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2016, the jury reached a verdict finding the two nephews guilty of attempting to traffic drugs into the United States.&lt;ref name="REUT18nov"/&gt;

====Murdered witnesses====
[[File:Narcosobrinos 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Campo and Flores meeting with CW-1 who was confined to a wheelchair.]]
Two witnesses that allegedly observed the nephews were murdered shortly before and after their arrest, raising concerns that the drug trafficking operation was larger that suspected.&lt;ref name="ICinformant"/&gt; Two weeks before the nephews were arrested, the Venezuelan known as "Hamudi" who introduced the nephews to CW-1 was murdered by FARC suppliers.&lt;ref name="ICinformant"/&gt; Weeks after the arrests in December 2015, CW-1 was murdered as well.&lt;ref name="ICinformant"/&gt;

It is thought to be that the nephews were not "the brains" of the trafficking attempt but were working under the [[Cartel of the Suns]]. The murdering of witnesses was a possible way to cover possible involvement by Venezuelan officials. In the United States, the punishment for killing a witness is a [[federal offense]] punishable by up to life in prison or execution.&lt;ref name="ICinformant"/&gt;

==Media coverage==
International media focused on the events surrounding the nephews and their trial while Venezuelan media was largely censored from revealing that the two were related to the President Maduro and his wife.&lt;ref name="LPpetit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petit|first1=Maibort|title=El día del veredicto: Los narcosobrinos tuvieron que asumir la responsabilidad por sus delitos|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2016/11/19/el-dia-del-veredicto-los-narcosobrinos-tuvieron-que-asumir-la-responsabilidad-por-sus-delitos/|accessdate=20 November 2016|work=[[La Patilla]]|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan media organizations like [[Globovisión]] and ''[[Últimas Noticias]]'' only mentioned that "two Venezuelans" were charged with drug trafficking without showing any relation to the president's family, raising accusations of self-censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corte Federal de EEUU declara culpable a venezolanos por ingresar droga al país|url=http://globovision.com/article/corte-federal-de-ee-uu-declara-culpable-a-venezolanos-de-conspirar-para-ingresar-droga-al-pais|accessdate=20 November 2016|work=[[Globovisión]]|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La burda manera en la que Globovisión y UN "informaron" sobre veredicto de narcosobrinos|url=https://dolartoday.com/vergonzoso-la-burda-manera-en-la-que-globovision-y-un-informaron-sobre-veredicto-de-narcosobrinos/|website=[[DolarToday]]|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media, which is popular in Venezuela, was used by journalists as a way to allow Venezuelans to bypass censorship and provide updates about the situation surrounding the president's nephews.&lt;ref name="LPpetit"/&gt;

==Reactions==
===Academics and scholars===
According drug trafficking expert to Bruce Bagley of the [[University of Miami]], "The nephews are just the tip of the iceberg ... Corruption is rampant in power circles in Venezuela. This case suggests a culture that drug trafficking is routine and daily fare for someone with contacts in the presidential palace", with Bagley further stating that "With their connections, they felt they would skate through ... They made a mistake because when the DEA heard their names they targeted them".&lt;ref name="UNIcircles"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=David|title=Venezuela drug case reveals 'rampant' culture of corruption in circles of power|url=http://www.univision.com/univision-news/latin-america/venezuela-drug-case-reveals-rampant-drug-culture-in-circles-of-power|accessdate=4 August 2016|agency=[[Univision]]|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government of Venezuela===
After Maduro's nephews were apprehended by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] for the illegal distribution of cocaine on November 10, 2015, Maduro posted a statement on Twitter criticizing "attacks and imperialist ambushes" which was viewed by many media outlets as being directed towards the United States.&lt;ref name="What's Wrong with Venezuela"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What's Wrong with Venezuela?|url = http://www.internationalpolicydigest.org/2015/11/25/what-s-wrong-with-venezuela/|website = International Policy Digest|accessdate = 2015-11-30|date = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What's Wrong with Venezuela" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. arrests Nicolas Maduro's family members – CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/americas/venezuela-president-family-members-arrested/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, accused the United States of kidnapping her nephews and said that she had proof that they were kidnapped by the DEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela's first lady Cilia Flores: US kidnapped my nephews over drug charges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/venezuelas-first-lady-cilia-flores-us-kidnapped-my-nephews-over-drug-charges|accessdate=27 July 2016|agency=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diosdado Cabello, a senior official in Maduro's government who has been accused of drug trafficking himself, was also quoted as saying the arrests were a "kidnapping" by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Arrest of Nicolas Maduro Relatives a 'Kidnapping,' Venezuelan Official Says|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/arrest-of-nicolas-maduro-relatives-a-kidnapping-venezuelan-official-says-1447712823|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-30|issn = 0099-9660|first = Anatoly|last = Kurmanaev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberto de Jesús Soto Garcia, a Honduran man who provided assistance to the smugglers, has been linked to Venezuela's Vice President [[Tareck El Aissami]].&lt;ref name="ENHnarco"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maria Delgado|first1=Antonio|title=Presentan cargos por narcotráfico contra socio hondureño de los sobrinos de Maduro|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america-latina/venezuela-es/article86773377.html|accessdate=31 January 2017|work=[[El Nuevo Herald]]|date=29 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the arrest of the nephews, [[Associated Press]] correspondent [[Hannah Dreier]] was detained by [[SEBIN]] agents. She was then interrogated, being threatened with being beheaded in a way like [[ISIL]] did to [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]], saying they would release her for a kiss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1516">The '''National Obesity Forum''' is a British independent professional organisation which campaigns for a more interventional approach to [[obesity]].  It was established in May 2000.

In June 2012 the Forum complained that [[General practitioner|GP]]s in England were rewarded financially through the [[Quality and Outcomes Framework]] for recording the number of obese patients - yet not for doing anything about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GPs 'Ticking Boxes' On Obesity|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/06/20/gps-ticking-boxes-on-obesity-national-obesity-forum_n_1611120.html|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 the Chairman Dr [[David Haslam GP|David Haslam]] called for [[bariatric surgery|stomach surgery]] to be offered to obese children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Call for Obese Children To Be Offered Stomach Surgery|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/18/calls-for-obese-children-stomach-surgery_n_2712523.html|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of Minority Health''' ('''OMH''') was created in 1986{{where|date=April 2012}} and is one of the most significant outcomes of the 1985 Secretary's Task Force ''Report on Black and Minority Health'', also known as the "Heckler Report". The Heckler report "was a landmark effort in analyzing and synthesizing the present state of knowledge [in 1985] of the major factors that
contribute to the health status of Blacks, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans."&lt;ref name=refname2&gt;{{cite web|title=Heckler Report|url=https://archive.org/details/reportofsecretar00usde|work=HHS|publisher=HHS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office the Heckler Report established is dedicated to improving the health of racial and [[ethnic minority]] populations through the development of [[Health policy|health policies]] and programs that will help eliminate health disparities. OMH was reauthorized by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010 (P.L. 111-148).&lt;ref name="refname1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About OMH|url=http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=1&amp;lvlID=7|work=The Office of Minority Health|publisher=HHS|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118084108/http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=1&amp;lvlID=7|archivedate=2013-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

How OMH works: OMH works in partnership with communities and organizations in the [[Public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s. These collaborations support a systems approach for eliminating health disparities, national planning to identify priorities, and coordinated responses through focused initiatives. OMH provides funding to state offices of minority health, multicultural health, and [[health equity]]; community and faith-based organizations, institutions of higher education, tribes and tribal organizations; and other organizations dedicated to improving health.&lt;ref name="refname1" /&gt;

==National Partnership for Action to End Health Disparities (NPA)==
The purpose is to improve nationwide cohesion and coordination of strategies and actions to eliminate health disparities and achieve health equity. The NPA has five goals:
increasing awareness;
strengthening leadership at all levels;
improving health and healthcare outcomes;
improving [[Cultural competence|cultural]] and [[linguistic competence]]; and
improving data availability, and coordination, utilization, and diffusion of research and evaluation outcomes.&lt;ref name=refname1/&gt;

==OMH Resource Center==
The OMH Resource Center is a one stop shop for minority health literature, research, and referrals. The center also provides technical assistance to community organizations on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=refname1/&gt;

Cultural and Linguistic Competency: OMH is committed to culturally and linguistically competent systems that will ensure the needs of minority communities are integrated and addressed within health-related programs across the nation.&lt;ref name=refname1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6209">'''Oral sedation dentistry''' is a medical procedure involving the administration of oral sedative drugs, generally to facilitate a dental procedure and reduce patients fear and anxiety related to the experience. Oral sedation is one of the available methods of conscious sedation dentistry, along with inhalation sedation (nitrous oxide) and conscious intravenous sedation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sedationdentistry4u.com/types-of-sedation-dentistry.htm Types of Conscious Dental Sedation (Nitrous Oxide - Oral Sedation - IV Sedation)]&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs which can be used for sedation include [[diazepam]], [[triazolam]], [[zaleplon]], [[lorazepam]], and [[hydroxyzine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dental-sedation.org/content/oral-sedation-info{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Dental patients with generalized [[anxiety]], [[belonephobia]] (fear of needles and sharp instruments), prior dental trauma, or generalized fear of the dentist can take oral medication in order to reduce their anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dentalfearcentral.org/help/sedation-dentistry/oral-sedation/&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of single and incremental dose protocols are used to medicate the patient as early as the day before treatment. Medication additionally helps reduce memory or the sights and smells of the dental office to avoid recall of any trauma.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rxlist.com/ativan-drug.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The sedative effect allows more dentistry to be completed in fewer appointments as well as allowing complex procedures to be performed in less time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webreprints.djreprints.com/1735970514909.pdf Wall Street Journal, June 19, 2007. "Did I Really Have a Root Canal?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drugs==
* [[Diazepam|Valium]] (Diazepam) is the most widely recognized drug in the group. It has been around since the 1960s and is a well known and time-tested sedative with amnesic properties. Valium has a longer half-life than some of the other medications, so it is particularly useful for appointments where extensive dentistry is being performed.
* [[Triazolam|Halcion]] (Triazolam) is most well known for the treatment of insomnia. It is highly effective when used in oral sedation protocols, and if deemed appropriate by your dentist, can be used in conjunction with an antihistamine.
* [[Zaleplon|Sonata]] (Zaleplon) is similar to Halcion in that it is also commonly used for the treatment of insomnia.
* [[Lorazepam|Ativan]] (Lorazepam) is commonly prescribed for the treatment of anxiety. It possesses many of the desirable effects of other benzodiazepines with amnesic properties. It is an effective sedative with a medium length half-life and is useful for appointments that are longer than two hours.
* [[Hydroxyzine|Vistaril]] (Hydroxyzine) while classified as an antihistamine has also been shown to have anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects. It also works in conjunction with many of the benzodiazepines but has no amnesic properties.
* [[Midazolam|Versed]] (Midazolam) has the shortest half-life of all of the benzodiazepines, lasting about an hour, and making it ideal for short appointments or simple procedures. It has many of the same anxiolytic and amnesic benefits of other benzodiazepines, but is less commonly used because of its duration.

==Risk mitigation==
Drug characteristics must be carefully considered when choosing the appropriate medication. Matching factors, such as where the drug is metabolized and any underlying diseases requires a good medical history and thorough knowledge of the drug's characteristics. All risk factors, individual characteristics, and procedural complexities can be taken into account in order to provide the best drug choice.

==Education==
Courses in Oral Sedation Dentistry are offered across North America at various dental schools and private organizations. The largest for-profit provider of dental sedation continuing education in North America is the [[Dental Organization for Conscious Sedation]]. Specialty courses are being taught in pediatric sedation, ACLS, IV Sedation and emergency preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.DOCSeducation.com DOCS Education]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest not-for-profit organization that provides educational courses in oral sedation as well as IV sedation and general anesthesia is the [[American Dental Society of Anesthesiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adsahome.org ADSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
Education and training requirements to administer sedation vary by state. The [[American Dental Association|ADA]] has set forth general sedation guidelines that have been adopted or modified by many states. There are typically dosing limitations involved with [[anxiolysis]], usually a single dose the day of treatment not to exceed the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of the medication in order to achieve the intended level of sedation. However, these sedation laws vary from state to state. Anxiolysis protocols are designed to treat healthy ASA I &amp; II patients ages 18 and up for one to four hours of treatment. Some states now require a permit even for [[nitrous oxide]] administration and/or [[anxiolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.docseducation.com/dental-sedation-regulations Sedation Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The main advantages of oral sedation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sedationdentistry4u.com/oral-sedation-advantages.htm Advantages of Oral Sedation Dentistry]&lt;/ref&gt; versus other sedation methods are:
* Ease of administration (you only have to take a pill)
* Effectiveness
* No needles involved
* High patient acceptance
* Amnesic effect
* Lower cost vs intravenous sedation

[[File:Partridge Island New Brunswick Canada.jpg|thumb|The Celtic Cross Memorial on Partridge Island, Canada's Emerald Island.]]
'''Partridge Island''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] island located in the [[Bay of Fundy]] off the coast of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], within the city's Inner Harbour.

The island is a provincial historic site and was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|12721|Partridge Island Quarantine Station|26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies on the west side of the mouth of the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]].

During the [[American Revolution]], in 1780, six British troops from Major [[Timothy Hierlihy]]'s corps, under the command of Lieut. Wheaton, attacked eight American [[privateer]]s in a house they were occupying on Partridge island.  The British killed three of the privateers and the other five were taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ahistorynovasco01murdgoog#page/n628/mode/1up/search/tartar p.608]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partridge Island was first established as a [[quarantine]] station and [[pest house]] in 1785 by the Saint John Royal Charter, which also set aside the island for use as a navigational aid station and a military post. Its first use as a quarantine station was not until 1816. A hospital was constructed on the island in 1830. 

==Immigration and Memorials==
The island received its largest influx of immigrants in the 1840s during the "[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]", also known as the "Irish Potato Famine," when a shortage of potatoes occurred due to [[Phytophthora infestans|potato blight]] striking Ireland's staple crop.  The famine caused millions to starve to death or otherwise emigrate, mainly to North America. During the famine, some 30,000 immigrants were processed by the island's visiting and resident physicians, with 1,196 dying at Partridge Island and the adjacent city of Saint John during the [[Typhus epidemic of 1847]].&lt;ref name="mccord"&gt;{{cite web|title=1967.25A-C {{!}} Partridge Island|url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/1967.25A-C|work=[[McCord Museum]]|accessdate=22 January 2012|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1890s there were over 78,000 immigrants a year being examined or treated on the island.

A memorial to the Irish immigrants of the mid-1840s was set up on the island in the 1890s, but by World War One it had deteriorated. In 1926 the Saint John City Cornet Band approached Saint John contractor George McArthur who agreed to lead a campaign to build a suitable monument. The [[Celtic Cross]] memorial to the Irish dead of 1847 was dedicated in 1927. This was restored and rededicated in 1985. In the early and mid-1980s, memorials were built by the Saint John Jewish Community, the Loyal Orange Lodge, the Partridge Island Research Project, and the Partridge Island &amp; Harbour Heritage Inc., a company that was registered in 1988 and dissolved in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charityfocus.ca/en/pages/charitysummary.aspx?charityid=107820706RR0001|title=Charity Focus {{!}} Imagine Canada|website=www.charityfocus.ca|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The memorials were dedicated to the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish immigrants buried in the six island graveyards.  A monument was also dedicated to all of the Irish dead from 1830 to the 1920s.

==History==
[[File:Partridge Island and Bell Buoy.jpg|thumb|left|A c. 1905 postcard showing Partridge Island and a buoy]]
The island's folklore begins with the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq Nation]], who referred to the island as "Quak'm'kagan'ik" meaning "a piece cut out."  This name is in reference to the belief that the island was created when [[Glooscap]] smashed the dam that "Big Beaver" had built. At the [[Reversing Falls Rapids]] a piece of the dam was swept in the rush of water to the mouth of the harbour where it came to rest to form the island. This version of the legend dates to the early 20th century. The 19th century version refers to Partridge Island in Minas Basin in Nova Scotia.

Following the arrival of the American Loyalists from the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1783, and the formation of the city of Saint John, there was the need for a lighthouse to aid shipping. A light station was erected on Partridge Island and began operating in 1791.  It was only the third light station to have been built in [[British North America]]. A signal station was soon located on the island and it was used for many years to alert the harbour to vessels approaching from the [[Bay of Fundy]]. The island's light and signal station were both established in 1791.

The island was Saint John's principal military fortification from 1800 until 1947. It was the only Saint John fortification to be used during all periods of Saint John's military activity. There are still visible remains of the Royal Artillery gun battery of 1812, and of both the First and Second World Wars.

The island was also home to dozens of island families over the years, from lightkeepers such as Captain Samuel Duffy, James Wilson, Albert Smith, Charles Mitchell and Thomas Furness, to hospital staff such as Doctors George and William Harding, hospital stewards Thomas McGowan, Fred and Jim Hargrove, and teachers for the island's school such as Jean MacCullum and Forbes Elliott. 

Boat tours to the island operated from 1982 until 1995 when the island's small museum closed. Public access is now restricted. There have been numerous books written about the island as well as video documentaries.

==Efforts to Reopen the Island==

Ambitions to turn Partridge Island into a tourist site have been ongoing. In 2014, the federal government set aside $200,000 for a feasibility study which would assess the cost of repairing the breakwater and creating a walkway that would cross to the island as well as annual operation and maintenance costs. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/partridge-island-tourism-feasibility-study-now-underway-1.3026359&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that it would cost between $27-$40 million to create a path to the island. 

Wayne Long, MP for Saint John, has proposed that a wharf be built at the site and that boat tours would go to and from it.  Long said in 2017, "The time for action is now" about creating access to the historic island. Long estimates that the wharf would cost only $5 million, which is a sharp reduction from the cost of a walkway.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/partridge-island-saint-john-ruins-military-tunnels-history-1.3494250&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before opening to the public, a clean-up of the island's significant soil contaminates would have to be done. All of the remaining buildings on the site have been vandalized or burned. Of the six graveyards, the 19th century graveyard was almost completely obliterated by the military during [[World War II]]. Less than three dozen graves remain. Instead of remaining a well-kept national historic site, Partridge Island has become the "haunted, dangerous rite of passage for New Brunswick’s wasted youth."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/4wbqaq/partridge-island-is-the-haunted-dangerous-rite-of-passage-for-saint-johns-wasted-youth&lt;/ref&gt; Many young people from the local area go to the island to party or to vandalise, although it is illegal to cross the breakwater.

This is a list of the [[United Nations Permanent Representative|Permanent Representatives]] of [[Belarus]] to the [[United Nations]]. Permanent Representative is a head of the permanent mission of Belarus to the United Nations. The current office holder is [[Valentyn Rybakov]], since August 7, 2017.
== History ==
{{Split-section|Byelorussia and the United Nations|date=November 2018}}
26 June 1945 was signed the Charter of the [[United Nations]] and came into force on 24 October 1945. The [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was among the first countries that signed the [[United Nations Charter]], becoming a founding member of the United Nations among 51 countries.

Until 1958 the permanent mission of Byelorussia was led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs rather than the permanent representative.

Since Belarusine's independence in August 1991, membership in the United Nations is a priority of [[Foreign relations of Belarus|Belarusine's foreign policy]].

==Permanent Mission Composition==
The permanent mission of Belarus consists of permanent representative, three counsellors (one of which is a permanent representative deputy) and a military adviser. The permanent mission also includes about 10 various secretaries and attaches.

'''Person-fit analysis''' is a technique for determining if the person's results on a given [[Test (student assessment)|test]] are valid.

The purpose of a person-fit analysis is to detect item-score vectors that are unlikely given a hypothesized test theory model such as [[item response theory]], or unlikely compared with the majority of item-score vectors in the sample. An item-score vector is a list of "scores" that a person gets on the items of a test, where "1" is often correct and "0" is incorrect.  For example, if a person took a 10-item quiz and only got the first five correct, the vector would be {1111100000}.

In individual decision-making in [[education]], [[psychology]], and [[personnel selection]], it is critically important that test users can have confidence in the test scores used. The validity of individual test scores may be threatened when the examinee's answers are governed by factors other than the psychological trait of interest - factors that can range from something as benign as the examinee dozing off to concerted fraud efforts. Person-fit methods are used to detect item-score vectors where such external factors may be relevant, and as a result, indicate invalid [[measurement]].

Unfortunately, person-fit statistics only tell if the set of responses is likely or unlikely, and cannot prove anything. The results of the analysis might look like an examinee cheated, but the ability to prove it by returning to when the test was administered is not possible. This limits its practical applicability on an individual scale. However, it might be useful on a larger scale; if most examinees at a certain test site or with a certain proctor have unlikely responses, an investigation might be warranted.

'''Phoebe Louise Adams Gloeckner''' (born December 22, 1960), is an American [[cartoonist]], [[illustrator]], [[Painting|painter]], and [[novelist]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes-MagFeature-2001&gt;{{cite news|last1=Orenstein|first1=Peggy|title=Phoebe Gloeckner Is Creating Stories About the Dark Side of Growing Up Female|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/05/magazine/05COMICS.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS-POV-2006&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bengal|first1=Rebecca|title=Interviews: On Cartooning - Phoebe Gloeckner|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/tintinandi/sfartists_gloeckner.php|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=[[POV (TV series)]], [[PBS]]|date=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Gloeckner worked prolifically as a medical illustrator since 1988, and her training is evident in her paintings and comics art, which are highly detailed and often prominently feature the human body. Her first prominent work in fiction publishing, a series of illustrations for the [[RE/Search]] edition of [[J. G. Ballard]]'s novel ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'', used clinical images of internal anatomy, sex, and physical trauma in ambiguous and evocative combinations.

Her early [[comics]] work, in the form of short stories published in a variety of [[underground comics|underground]] anthologies including ''[[Wimmen's Comix]]'', ''[[Weirdo (comics)|Weirdo]]'', ''Young Lust'', and ''[[Twisted Sisters (comic)|Twisted Sisters]]'', and in the tabloid zine, [[RE/Search]] (numbered volumes), was sporadic and rarely seen until the 1998 release of the collection ''A Child's Life and Other Stories''. This was followed by her 2002 novel ''[[The Diary of a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures]]'', which revisited the troubled life of the young character (usually referred to as "Minnie Goetze") previously featured in some of her comics, this time in an unusual combination of prose, illustration, and short comics scenes.

Her novel and many of her short stories are semi-[[autobiography|autobiographical]], a frequent cause of comment due to their depiction of sex, drug use, and childhood traumas; however, Gloeckner has stated that she regards them as fiction. Sexual content led to ''A Child's Life and Other Stories'' being banned from the public library in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[California]], after it was checked out by an 11-year-old reader. The mayor of Stockton called the book "a how-to book for pedophiles."&lt;ref name=PubWkly-GuidelinesGraphicNovels-2004&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kinsella|first1=Bridget|title=Libraries Developing Guidelines For Graphic Novels|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20041122/22471-libraries-developing-guidelines-for-graphic-novels.html|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=19 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic novel was also classified as pornography and refused entry by customs officials in both France and England.&lt;ref name=Slate-Interview-2003 /&gt;

Less controversial, and actually intended for children, is the book ''Weird Things You Can Grow'', published by Random House, and books in the series beginning with ''Tales too Funny to be True'' published by HarperCollins, for which she did the illustrations.

A film version of ''[[The Diary of a Teenage Girl]]'' premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was acquired by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] at the festival.&lt;ref name=Deadline-Sundance-Sony-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming Jr|first1=Mike|title=Sony Pictures Classics Confirms ‘Diary Of A Teenage Girl’ Deal – Sundance|url=https://deadline.com/2015/01/diary-of-a-teenage-girl-sony-pictures-classics-sundance-1201358842/|accessdate=11 August 2015|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapted and directed by [[Marielle Heller]], it is based on Heller's earlier stage adaptation.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Teenage-Theater-2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webster|first1=Andy|title=Theater Review: The Diary of a Teenage Girl - Me and My Hormones, Raging in the 1970s|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/theater/reviews/01teenage.html|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Alexander Skarsgard]] as Monroe, [[Kristen Wiig]] as Charlotte, and [[Bel Powley]] as the main character, Minnie Goetze. Heller developed the script at the [[Sundance Institute]]'s Sundance Feature Film Program Lab.&lt;ref name=Deadline-Sundance-Sony-2015 /&gt; The film won "Best First Feature" at the 2016 Spirit Awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/diary-a-teenage-girl-wins-869784&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloeckner briefly taught courses at [[Suffolk Community College]] and [[SUNY Stony Brook]].&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal-Interview-2011 /&gt;

Gloeckner is an Associate Professor at the [[University of Michigan]] [[Penny W. Stamps School of Art &amp; Design|Stamps School of Art &amp; Design]], a position she has held since 2010.&lt;ref name=UMich-Stamps-Bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Phoebe Gloeckner: Associate Professor, School of Art &amp; Design|url=http://stamps.umich.edu/people/detail/phoebe_gloeckner|website=[[University of Michigan]] - [[Penny W.

In recognition of her contributions to the comic art form, [[Comics Alliance]] listed Gloeckner as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/women-lifetime-achievement-awards/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630033418/http://comicsalliance.com/women-lifetime-achievement-awards/ |archivedate=2016-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Gloeckner was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Her mother was a librarian&lt;ref name=NYTimes-MagFeature-2001 /&gt; and her father, David Gloeckner,&lt;ref name=PBS-POV-2006 /&gt; was a commercial illustrator. Her father's family was [[Quakers|Quaker]] and she attended Quaker schools when she was young.&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal-Interview-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groth|first1=Gary|title=The Phoebe Gloeckner Interview|url=http://www.tcj.com/phoebe-gloeckner-2/|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=[[The Comics Journal]]|date=6 February 2011|quote=#261, published July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a younger sister.&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal-Interview-2011 /&gt;

Gloeckner's parents divorced when she was 4 years old. In 1972, when she was 11 or 12 years old, her mother remarried and the family moved to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=Slate-Interview-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joiner|first1=Whitney|title=Not your mother’s comic book|url=http://www.salon.com/2003/03/15/gloeckner/|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=[[Salon (magazine)|Slate]]|date=15 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended several Bay Area schools, including The Hamlin School for Girls, The Urban School of San Francisco, [[Lick-Wilmerding High School]], and The Independent Learning School.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} She was a boarding student at [[Castilleja School|Castilleja]] (in Palo Alto) for a year, but returned to San Francisco to live with her mother, her mother's boyfriend, and her sister, when she was 14.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-MagFeature-2001 /&gt;

Gloeckner began cartooning at the age of 12. Because her mother was dating [[Robert Armstrong (comics)|Robert Armstrong]], a cartoonist in [[Robert Crumb]]'s band [[Cheap Suit Serenaders]], she met many San Francisco [[underground comics]] figures who had a profound influence upon her, including [[Robert Crumb]], [[Aline Kominsky]], [[Bill Griffith]], [[Terry Zwigoff]], and [[Diane Noomin]].&lt;ref name=Slate-Interview-2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal-Interview-2011 /&gt;

Gloeckner attended [[San Francisco State University]] from 1980 to 1985, where she was a pre-med student and studied French and art. She spent the 1983-1984 academic year in [[Université d’Aix-Marseille]] studying art, French, and biology, and from 1984 to 1985 spent about six months studying Czech and literature at [[Charles University]] in [[Prague, Czech Republic|Prague]]. She has an M.A. in Biomedical Communications from [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]], which she received in 1988. The degree was in [[medical illustration]]. Her 1987 dissertation was on the "Semiotic Analysis of Medical Illustration,"&lt;ref name=UT-Dissertation-1987&gt;{{citation|last1=Gloeckner|first1=Phoebe L A|title=Semiotic Analysis of Medical Illustration|work= [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]]|quote=Thesis/dissertation|year=1987|OCLC=21957259}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she studies narrative devices used in medical and surgical illustration.&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal-Interview-2011 /&gt;

Gloeckner became interested in medical illustration through her maternal grandfather, an antique dealer who collected and sold old books, and her paternal grandmother, Dr. Louise Carpenter Gloeckner, who was a physician in Philadelphia and was the first woman to be elected vice president of the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name=PBS-POV-2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune-Grandmother-1969&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Sue|title=A Woman Doctor Takes a Giant Step in the A.M.A.|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/09/15/page/57/article/a-woman-doctor-takes-a-giant-step-in-the-a-m-a|accessdate=11 August 2015|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=15 September 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1986, Gloeckner married Czech artist Jakub Kalousek.&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-TxMarriage-1986&gt;{{cite web|title=Phoebe L Gloeckner mentioned in the record of Jakub Kalousek and Phoebe L Gloeckner|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VT21-HSX|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later divorced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45298">'''Prevention of mental disorders''' are measures that try to decrease the chances of a [[mental disorder]] occurring. A 2004 WHO report stated that "prevention of these disorders is obviously one of the most effective ways to reduce the [disease] burden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=World Health Organization, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse |author2=Prevention Research Centre of the Universities of Nijmegen and Maastricht |date=2004 |title=Prevention of mental disorders: effective interventions and policy options: summary report |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |isbn=92-4-159215-X |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/en/prevention_of_mental_disorders_sr.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2011 [[European Psychiatric Association]] (EPA) guidance on prevention of mental disorders states "There is considerable evidence that various psychiatric conditions can be prevented through the implementation of effective evidence-based interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.10.004 |title=European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on prevention of mental disorders |year=2012 |last1=Campion |first1=J. |last2=Bhui |first2=K. |last3=Bhugra |first3=D. |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=68–80 |pmid=22285092 |last4=European Psychiatric |first4=Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2011 [[UK Department of Health]] report on the economic case for mental health promotion and mental illness prevention found that "many interventions are outstandingly good value for money, low in cost and often become self-financing over time, saving public expenditure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/businessAndConsultancy/LSEEnterprise/news/2011/healthstrategy.aspx |title=Mental health promotion and mental illness prevention: The economic case |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] re-affirmed prevention as a research priority area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-research-priorities/srp-objective-3/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-emptive [[cognitive behavioural therapy|CBT]]===
Use of [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)]] with people at risk has significantly reduced the number of episodes of generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety symptoms, and also given significant improvements in explanatory style, hopelessness, and dysfunctional attitudes.&lt;ref name="Bienvenu Ginsburg 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09540260701797837 |title=Prevention of anxiety disorders |year=2007 |last1=Bienvenu |first1=O.

As of 2018, some health providers now advocate pre-emptive use of CBT to prevent worsening of mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpft.nhs.uk/services/community-services/wellbeing-service/our-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental silence [[meditation]]===
[[Sahaja yoga|Sahaja]] [[meditation|meditators]] scored above control groups for emotional well-being and mental health measures on [[SF-36]] ratings, leading to proposed use for mental illness prevention, although this result could be due to meditators having other characteristics leading to good mental health, such as higher general self care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/350674 |pmid=22611427 |pmc=3352577 |title=Quality of Life and Functional Health Status of Long-Term Meditators |journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=2012 |pages=350674 |year=2012 |last1=Manocha |first1=Ramesh |last2=Black |first2=Deborah |last3=Wilson |first3=Leigh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5215.2010.00519.x |title=Meditation, mindfulness and mind-emptiness |journal=Acta Neuropsychiatrica |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=46–7 |year=2014 |last1=Manocha |first1=Ramesh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=Adam |title=Sahaja Yoga: an ancient path to modern mental health? |year=1999 |type=PhD Thesis |hdl=10026.1/1969 }}{{pn|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mindfulness===

An 8 week [[mindfulness]] course given to students was found to reduce the number subsequently needing treatment for [[mental illness]] by 60%, although the study was not of large size and commented that the effect could be due to 'non-specific effects', as the control group had received no attention at all, rather than an alternative intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30231-1 |pmid=29422189 |pmc=5813792 |title=A mindfulness-based intervention to increase resilience to stress in university students (the Mindful Student Study): A pragmatic randomised controlled trial |journal=The Lancet Public Health |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e72–e81 |year=2018 |last1=Galante |first1=Julieta |last2=Dufour |first2=Géraldine |last3=Vainre |first3=Maris |last4=Wagner |first4=Adam P |last5=Stochl |first5=Jan |last6=Benton |first6=Alice |last7=Lathia |first7=Neal |last8=Howarth |first8=Emma |last9=Jones |first9=Peter B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet- and mobile-based interventions===
A review found that a number of studies have shown that internet- and mobile-based interventions can be effective in preventing mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00116 |pmid=28848454 |pmc=5554359 |title=Prevention of Mental Health Disorders Using Internet- and Mobile-Based Interventions: A Narrative Review and Recommendations for Future Research |journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry |volume=8 |pages=116 |year=2017 |last1=Ebert |first1=David Daniel |last2=Cuijpers |first2=Pim |last3=Muñoz |first3=Ricardo F |last4=Baumeister |first4=Harald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific diseases==
===Depression===

For [[schizophrenia]], one study of preventative CBT showed a positive effect&lt;ref name=pmid23335473/&gt; and another showed neutral effect.&lt;ref name=pmid23218022&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.12m07785 |pmid=23218022 |title=Randomized Controlled Trial of Interventions for Young People at Ultra-High Risk of Psychosis |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=349–56 |year=2013 |last1=McGorry |first1=Patrick D |last2=Nelson |first2=Barnaby |last3=Phillips |first3=Lisa J |last4=Yuen |first4=Hok Pan |last5=Francey |first5=Shona M |last6=Thampi |first6=Annette |last7=Berger |first7=Gregor E |last8=Amminger |first8=G.

==Targeted vs universal==
There has been an historical trend among public health professionals to consider targeted programmes. However identification of high risk groups can increase stigma, in turn meaning that the targeted people do not engage. Thus policy recommends universal programs, with resources within such programs weighted towards high risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fph.org.uk/examples_of_interventions |title=UK Faculty of Public Health :: Examples of interventions |publisher=Fph.org.uk |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal prevention (aimed at a population that has no increased risk for developing a mental disorder, such as school programs or mass media campaigns) need very high numbers of people to show effect (sometimes known as the "power" problem). Approaches to overcome this are (1) focus on high-incidence groups (e.g. by targeting groups with high risk factors), (2) use multiple interventions to achieve greater, and thus more statistically valid, effects, (3) use cumulative meta-analyses of many trials, and (4) run very large trials.&lt;ref name="Muñoz et al 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-033109-132040 |title=Prevention of Major Depression |year=2010 |last1=Muñoz |first1=Ricardo F. |last2=Cuijpers |first2=Pim |last3=Smit |first3=Filip |last4=Barrera |first4=Alinne Z. |last5=Leykin |first5=Yan |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=6 |pages=181–212 |pmid=20192789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.8.1385 |title=Examining the Effects of Prevention Programs on the Incidence of New Cases of Mental Disorders: The Lack of Statistical Power |year=2003 |last1=Cuijpers |first1=P. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=8 |pages=1385–91 |pmid=12900296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===History of mental illness prevention strategies===

* In 2018 the [[University of Birmingham]] Mental Health Policy Commission focused on prevention, including the challenges of funding given the shortness of political cycles versus the longer paybacks of prevention.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.birmingham.ac.uk//research/impact/policy-commissions/mental-health&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2018 11 European researchers published a review of mental illness prevention stating that "''Increasing evidence suggests that preventive interventions in psychiatry that are feasible, safe, and cost-effective could translate into a broader focus on prevention in our field.''" and that "''Gaps between knowledge, policy, and practice need to be bridged.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30057-9 |pmid=29773478 |title=Preventive strategies for mental health |journal=The Lancet Psychiatry |year=2018 |last1=Arango |first1=Celso |last2=Díaz-Caneja |first2=Covadonga M |last3=McGorry |first3=Patrick D |last4=Rapoport |first4=Judith |last5=Sommer |first5=Iris E |last6=Vorstman |first6=Jacob A |last7=McDaid |first7=David |last8=Marín |first8=Oscar |last9=Serrano-Drozdowskyj |first9=Elena |last10=Freedman |first10=Robert |last11=Carpenter |first11=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of mental illness prevention programmes===

Historically prevention has been a very small part of the spend of mental health systems. For instance the 2009 UK Department of Health analysis of prevention expenditure did not include any apparent spend on mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Butterfield |first1=Rebecca |last2=Henderson |first2=John |last3=Scott |first3=Robert |date=May 2009 |title=Public Health and Prevention Expenditure in England |type=Health England Report |volume=4  |publisher=Department of Health |location=London |url=http://www.healthengland.org/publications/HealthEnglandReportNo4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913095407/http://www.healthengland.org/publications/HealthEnglandReportNo4.pdf |archive-date=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation is the same in research.&lt;ref name="schizophreniacommission.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schizophreniacommission.org.uk/the-report/ |title=The Report |publisher=The Schizophrenia Commission |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405104051/http://www.schizophreniacommission.org.uk/the-report/ |archivedate=2013-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However more recently some prevention programmes have been proposed or implemented. Prevention programmes can include public health policies to raise general health, creating supportive environments, strengthening communities, developing personal skills, and reorienting services.&lt;ref name="mind.org.uk"/&gt;

* In 2017 the UK [[Public Health England|PHE]] and [[London School of Economics|LSE]] produced research showing short payback periods for a number of prevention interventions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/phe-highlights-8-ways-for-local-areas-to-prevent-mental-ill-health{{full|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017 the Scotland Mental Health Strategy included prevention, including a focus on improving parenting skills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2017/03/1750{{full|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, the UK [[Education Policy Institute]] advocated prevention through increased mental health literacy, better parenting and improving children's resilience and digital world skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children and Young People's Mental Health|url=http://epi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/time-to-deliver-web.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2012 the UK Schizophrenia Commission recommended ''"a preventative strategy for psychosis including promoting protective factors for mental wellbeing and reducing risks such as cannabis use in early adolescence."''&lt;ref name="schizophreniacommission.org.uk"/&gt;
* In 2010 the [[European Union]] DataPrev database was launched. It states ''"A healthy start is crucial for mental health and wellbeing throughout life, with parenting being the single most important factor,"'' and recommends a range of interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataprevproject.net/Parenting_and_Early_Years/ |title=DataPrev |publisher=Dataprevproject.net |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[s:Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906|Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]]''' was the first of a series of significant [[consumer protection law]]s which was enacted by Congress in the 20th century and led to the creation of the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products, and it directed the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors. It required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug’s packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the United States Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary.  ''[[The Jungle]]'' by [[Upton Sinclair]] was an inspirational piece that kept the public's attention on the important issue of unsanitary meat processing plants that later led to food inspection legislation.  Sinclair quipped, "I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach," as readers demanded and got the pure food law.&lt;ref&gt;Arlene F. Kantor, "Upton Sinclair and the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906: 'I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach,'" ''American Journal of Public Health'' 66.12 (1976): 1202-1205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==
The '''Pure Food and Drug Act''' of 1906 was a key piece of Progressive Era legislation, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt on the same day as the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]]. Enforcement of the Pure Food and Drug Act was assigned to the Bureau of Chemistry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture which was renamed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930. The [[Meat Inspection Act]] was assigned to what is now known as the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]], which remains in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first federal law regulating foods and drugs, the 1906 Act's reach was limited to foods and drugs moving in [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]]. Although the law drew upon many precedents, provisions, and legal experiments pioneered in individual states, the federal law defined "misbranding" and "adulteration" for the first time and prescribed penalties for each. The law recognized the U.S. Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary as standards authorities for drugs, but made no similar provision for federal food standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Origin/ucm054819.htm |title=The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement |author=Swann, Ph.D., John P |series=FDA History - Part I |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was principally a "truth in labeling" law designed to raise standards in the food and drug industries and protect the reputations and pocketbooks of honest businessmen.

==Particular drugs deemed addictive==
Under the law, drug labels, for example, had to list any of 10 ingredients that were deemed "addictive" and/or "dangerous" on the product label if they were present, and could not list them if they were not present. [[Alcohol]], [[morphine]], [[opium]], and [[cannabis]] were all included on the list of these "addictive" and/or "dangerous" drugs. The law also established a federal cadre of food and drug inspectors that one Southern opponent of the legislation criticized as "a Trojan horse with a bellyful of inspectors and other employees."&lt;ref&gt;Young, James H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vw8ABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=a+Trojan+horse+with+a+bellyful+of+inspectors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OmZtAIaLIb&amp;sig=jKvKl8taJFCuAKHsVoQs7LK8ybE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHupzo3cPKAhXLth4KHYKgAKAQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pure Food: Securing the Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906.] Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1989, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Penalties under the law were modest, but an under-appreciated provision of the Act proved more powerful than monetary penalties. Goods found in violation of various areas of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published as Notices of Judgment, proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/fdanj/ FDA Notices of Judgment Collection, 1908-1966]&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiencies in this original statute{{For example?}}, which had become noticeable by the 1920s, led to the replacement of the 1906 statute with the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] which was enacted in 1938 and signed by President Franklin Roosevelt. This act, along with its numerous amendments, remains the statutory basis for federal regulation of all foods, drugs, biological products, cosmetics, medical devices, tobacco, and radiation-emitting devices by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]].

==History of passage==
It took 27 years to  the 1906 statute, during which time the public was made aware of many problems with foods and drugs in the U.S. [[Muckraker|Muckraking]] journalists, such as [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], targeted the [[patent medicine]] industry with its high-alcoholic content patent medicines, soothing syrups for infants with opium derivatives, and "red clauses" in newspaper contracts providing that patent medicine ads (upon which most newspapers of the time were dependent) would be withdrawn if the paper expressed support for food and drug regulatory legislation. The Chief Chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry, Dr. [[Harvey Washington Wiley]], captured the country's attention with his hygienic table studies, which began with a modest Congressional appropriation in 1902. The goal of the table trial was to study the human effects of common preservatives used in foods during a period of rapid changes in the food supply brought about by the need to feed cities and support an industrializing nation increasingly dependent on immigrant labor.  Wiley recruited young men to eat all their meals at a common table as he added increased "doses" of preservatives including borax, benzoate, formaldehyde, sulfites, and salicylates. The table trials captured the nation's fancy and were soon dubbed "The Poison Squad" by newspapers covering the story. The men soon adopted the motto "Only the Brave dare eat the fare" and at times the publicity given to the trials became a burden. Though many results of the trial came to be in dispute, there was no doubt that formaldehyde was dangerous and it disappeared quickly as a preservative. Wiley himself felt that he had found adverse effects from large doses of each of the preservatives and the public seemed to agree with Wiley. In many cases, most particularly with ketchup and other condiments, the use of preservatives was often used to disguise insanitary production practices. Although the law itself did not proscribe the use of some of these preservatives, consumers increasingly turned away from many products with known preservatives.

The 1906 statute regulated food and drugs moving in interstate commerce and forbade the manufacture, sale, or transportation of poisonous patent medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ayers |first=Edward A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=August 1907 |title=What The Food Law Saves Us From: Adulterations, Substitutions, Chemical Dyes, and Other Evils |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XIV |issue= |pages=9316–9322 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sojNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA9316|accessdate=2009-07-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act arose due to public education and exposés from public interest guardians such as Upton Sinclair and Samuel Hopkins Adams, social activist [[Florence Kelley]], researcher [[Harvey W. Wiley]], and President Theodore Roosevelt.

== Beginnings of the Food and Drug Administration==
The 1906 Act paved the way for the eventual creation of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and is generally considered to be that agency's founding date, though the agency existed before the law was passed and was not named FDA until later. "While the Food and Drug act remains a foundational law of the FDA mission, it's not the law that created the FDA. [Initially,] the [[Bureau of Chemistry]] (the precursor to the FDA) regulated food safety. In 1927, the Bureau was reorganized into the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration and the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. The FDIA was renamed the FDA in 1930."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Milestones/ucm128305.htm|title=Milestones in U.S. Food and Drug Law History - Significant Dates in U.S. Food and Drug Law History|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law itself was largely replaced by the much more comprehensive [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] of 1938.

== Enforcement of labeling and future ramifications ==
The Pure Food and Drug Act was initially concerned with ensuring products were labeled correctly. Later efforts were made to outlaw certain products that were not safe, followed by efforts to outlaw products which were safe but not effective. For example, there was an attempt to outlaw [[Coca-Cola]] in 1909 because of its excessive caffeine content; caffeine had replaced cocaine as the active ingredient in Coca-Cola in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/why-we-took-cocaine-out-of-soda/272694/ |title=Why We Took Cocaine Out of Soda |author=Hamblin M.D., James |date=January 31, 2013 |series=The Atlantic's Health Editorial |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case ''[[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'', the judge found that Coca-Cola had a right to use caffeine as it saw fit, although Coca-Cola eventually lost when the government appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/02/coca-cola.aspx Pop psychology: The man who saved Coca-Cola]", by Ludy T. Benjamin, ''Monitor on Psychology,'' February 2009, Vol 40, No. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/ref&gt; It reached a settlement with the [[United States government]] to reduce the caffeine amount.

In addition to caffeine, the Pure Food and Drug Act required that drugs such as [[alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[morphine]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as [[patent medicines]] with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing [[opiates]] decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''quality-adjusted life year''' or '''quality-adjusted life-year''' ('''QALY''') is a generic measure of [[disease burden]], including both the quality and the quantity of life lived.&lt;ref name=NICE2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/lgb10/chapter/judging-the-cost-effectiveness-of-public-health-activities |title=Judging whether public health interventions offer value for money |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= September 2013 |website= |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] |access-date=2017-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEglossary&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nice.org.uk/glossary?letter=q |title=Glossary  |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] |access-date=2017-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[economic evaluation]] to assess the value for money of [[medical]] interventions.&lt;ref name=NICE2013/&gt; One QALY equates to one year in perfect health.&lt;ref name=NICEglossary/&gt; If an individual's health is below this maximum, QALYs are accrued at a rate of less than 1 per year. To be dead is associated with 0 QALYs.&lt;ref name="Weinstein2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinstein|first1=Milton C.|last2=Torrance|first2=George|last3=McGuire|first3=Alistair|title=QALYs: The Basics|journal=Value in Health|volume=12|year=2009|pages=S5–S9|issn=10983015|doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00515.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; QALYs can be used to inform personal decisions, to evaluate programs, and to set priorities for future programs.&lt;ref name="Weinstein2009"/&gt;

== Calculation ==
The QALY is a measure of the value of health outcomes. It assumes that health is a function of length of life and quality of life, and combines these values into a single index number. To determine QALYs, one multiplies the [[utility]] value associated with a given state of health by the years lived in that state. A year of life lived in perfect health is worth 1 QALY (1 year of life × 1 Utility value). A year of life lived in a state of less than perfect health is worth less than 1 QALY; for example, 1 year of life lived in a situation with utility 0.5 (e.g. bedridden, 1 year × 0.5 Utility) is assigned 0.5 QALYs. Similarly, half a year lived in perfect health is equivalent to 0.5 QALYs (0.5 years × 1 Utility). Death is assigned a value of 0 QALYs, and in some circumstances it is possible to accrue negative QALYs to reflect health states deemed "worse than dead."&lt;ref name="Weinstein2009"/&gt;

=== Weighting ===
The "weight" (utility) values between 0 and 1 are usually determined by methods such as those proposed in the [[Journal of Health Economics]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* [[Visual analogue scale]] (VAS): Respondents are asked to rate a state of ill health on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 representing being dead and 100 representing perfect health. This method has the advantage of being the easiest to ask, but is the most subjective.

Another way of determining the weight associated with a particular health state is to use standard descriptive systems such as the EuroQol Group's [[EQ-5D]] questionnaire, which categorises health states according to five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities (e.g. work, study, homework or leisure activities), pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = EuroQol--a new facility for the measurement of health-related quality of life|journal = Health Policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)|date = 1990-12-01|issn = 0168-8510|pmid = 10109801|pages = 199–208|volume = 16|issue = 3|last = EuroQol Group|doi=10.1016/0168-8510(90)90421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Data on medical costs are often combined with QALYs in [[cost-utility analysis]] to estimate the cost-per-QALY associated with a health care intervention. This parameter can be used to develop a [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] of any treatment. This [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]] (ICER) can then be used to allocate [[Health care|healthcare]] resources, often using a threshold approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Critical ratios and efficient allocation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0047272773900029|journal = Journal of Public Economics|date = 1973-04-01|pages = 147–157|volume = 2|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0047-2727(73)90002-9|first = Milton|last = Weinstein|first2 = Richard|last2 = Zeckhauser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]], which advises on the use of health technologies within the [[National Health Service]], has since at least 2013 used "£ per QALY" to evaluate their utility.&lt;ref name=NICE2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nice.org.uk/article/pmg9/chapter/6-the-appraisal-of-the-evidence-and-structured-decision-making | title=Guide to the methods of technology appraisal 2013 | publisher=NICE | date=2013 | accessdate=15 Jun 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept of the QALY is credited to work by Klarman et al. (1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 6| issue = 1| pages = 48–54| last = Klarman| first = Herbert E.| first2 = John O'S |last2=Francis |first3=Gerald D. |last3=Rosenthal| title = Cost effectiveness analysis applied to the treatment of chronic renal disease| journal = Medical care| accessdate = 2014-05-06| date = 1968| url = http://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/1968/01000/Cost_Effectiveness_Analysis_Applied_to_the.5.aspx| doi=10.1097/00005650-196801000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Fanshel and Bush (1970)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 18| issue = 6| pages = 1021–66| last = Fanshel| first = Sol|first2=J.W. |last2=Bush | title = A health-status index and its application to health-services outcomes| journal = Operations Research| accessdate = 2014-05-06| date = 1970| url = http://www.eurohex.eu/bibliography/pdf/0990244687/Fanshel_1970_OR.pdf| doi=10.1287/opre.18.6.1021}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Torrance et al.

Then, in 1980, Pliskin et al. proposed a justification of the construction of the QALY indicator using the multiattribute utility theory: if a set of conditions pertaining to agent preferences on life years and quality of life are verified, then it is possible to express the agent's preferences about couples (number of life years/health state), by an interval (Neumannian) utility function.&lt;ref name=Pliskin1980&gt;{{cite journal |pages=206–24 |doi=10.1287/opre.28.1.206 |jstor=172147 |title=Utility Functions for Life Years and Health Status |year=1980 |last1=Pliskin |first1=J. S. |last2=Shepard |first2=D. S. |last3=Weinstein |first3=M. C. |journal=Operations Research |volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This utility function would be equal to the product of an interval utility function on "life years", and an interval utility function on "health state".

== Debate ==
According to Pliskin et al., the QALY model requires [[utility]] independent, [[risk neutral]], and constant proportional tradeoff behaviour.&lt;ref name=Pliskin1980/&gt; Because of these theoretical assumptions, the meaning and usefulness of the QALY is debated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1477-7525-1-80 |year=2003 |last1=Prieto |first1=Luis |last2=Sacristán |first2=José A |journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes |volume=1 |pages=80 |pmid=14687421 |title=Problems and solutions in calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) |pmc=317370}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0272989X07309642 |title=Comparing the Incomparable?

Some argue that there are health states worse than being dead, and that therefore there should be negative values possible on the health spectrum (indeed, some health economists have incorporated negative values into calculations). Determining the level of health depends on measures that some argue place disproportionate importance on physical pain or disability over mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dolan |first=P |title=Developing methods that really do value the ‘Q’ in the QALY |journal=Health Economics, Policy and Law |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=69–77 |year=January 2008 |doi=10.1017/S1744133107004355 |url=http://pauldolan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/developing-the-methods-that-really-do-value.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of ranking interventions on grounds of their cost per QALY gained ratio (or [[Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio|ICER]]) is controversial because it implies a quasi-[[utilitarian]] calculus to determine who will or will not receive treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Michael | last = Schlander | title = Measures of efficiency in healthcare: QALMs about QALYs? | publisher =  Institute for Innovation &amp; Valuation in Health Care | date = 2010-05-23 | location = | url = http://www.michaelschlander.com/pnp/publications_en/Schlander-QALMs-about-QALYs-2010.pdf | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its supporters argue that since health care resources are inevitably limited, this method enables them to be allocated in the way that is approximately optimal for society, including most patients.  Another concern is that it does not take into account equity issues such as the overall distribution of health states – particularly since younger, healthier cohorts have many times more QALYs than older or sicker individuals. As a result, QALY analysis may undervalue treatments which benefit
the elderly or others with a lower life expectancy. Also, many would argue that all else being equal, patients with more severe illness should be prioritised over patients with less severe illness if both would get the same absolute increase in utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1050(199902)8:1&lt;25::AID-HEC398&gt;3.0.CO;2-H |title=Incorporating societal concerns for fairness in numerical valuations of health programmes |year=1999 |last1=Nord |first1=Erik |last2=Pinto |first2=Jose Luis |last3=Richardson |first3=Jeff |last4=Menzel |first4=Paul |last5=Ubel |first5=Peter |journal=Health Economics |volume=8 |pages=25–39 |pmid=10082141 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As early as 1989, [[Graham Loomes|Loomes]] and McKenzie recommended that research be conducted concerning the validity of QALYs.&lt;ref name=Loomes1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loomes|first1=Graham|last2=McKenzie|first2=Lynda|title=The use of QALYs in health care decision making|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=28|issue=4| year=1989|pages=299–308|issn=02779536| doi=10.1016/0277-9536(89)90030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, with funding from the [[European Commission]], the European Consortium in Healthcare Outcomes and Cost-Benefit Research (ECHOUTCOME) began a major study on QALYs as used in [[health technology assessment]].&lt;ref name=ECHOUTCOMEhome&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echoutcome.eu|title=ECHOUTCOME: European Consortium in Healthcare Outcomes and Cost-Benefit Research|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008010513/http://echoutcome.eu/|archive-date=2016-10-08 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ariel Beresniak]], the study's lead author, was quoted as saying that it was the "largest-ever study specifically dedicated to testing the assumptions of the QALY."&lt;ref name=Holmes2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=David |title=Report triggers quibbles over QALYs, a staple of health metrics |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=248 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23467219 |doi=10.1038/nm0313-248 |url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v19/n3/full/nm0313-248.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, at its final conference, ECHOUTCOME released preliminary results of its study which surveyed 1361 people "from academia" in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK.&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreaper |first=Jane |title=Researchers claim NHS drug decisions 'are flawed' |newspaper=BBC News |date=24 January 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21170445|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beresniak2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beresniak|first1=Ariel|last2=Medina-Lara|first2=Antonieta|last3=Auray|first3=Jean Paul|last4=De Wever|first4=Alain|last5=Praet|first5=Jean-Claude|last6=Tarricone|first6=Rosanna|last7=Torbica|first7=Aleksandra|last8=Dupont|first8=Danielle|last9=Lamure|first9=Michel|last10=Duru|first10=Gerard|title=Validation of the Underlying Assumptions of the Quality-Adjusted Life-Years Outcome: Results from the ECHOUTCOME European Project|journal=PharmacoEconomics|volume=33|issue=1|year=2015|pages=61–69|issn=1170-7690|doi=10.1007/s40273-014-0216-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers asked the subjects to respond to 14 questions concerning their preferences for various health states and durations of those states (e.g., 15 years limping versus 5 years in a wheelchair).&lt;ref name=Beresniak2015/&gt; They concluded that "preferences expressed by the respondents were not consistent with the QALY theoretical assumptions" that quality of life can be measured in consistent intervals, that life-years and quality of life are independent of each other, that people are neutral about risk, and that willingness to gain or lose life-years is constant over time.&lt;ref name=Beresniak2015/&gt; ECHOUTCOME also released "European Guidelines for Cost-Effectiveness Assessments of Health Technologies," which recommended not using QALYs in healthcare decision making.&lt;ref name=ECHOUTCOMEguidelines&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echoutcome.eu/images/Echoutcome__Leaflet_Guidelines___final.pdf|title=European Guidelines for Cost-Effectiveness Assessments of Health Technologies|author=European Consortium in Healthcare Outcomes and Cost-Benefit Research (ECHOUTCOME)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814070546/http://echoutcome.eu/images/Echoutcome__Leaflet_Guidelines___final.pdf|archive-date=2015-08-14 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the guidelines recommended that cost-effectiveness analyses focus on "costs per relevant clinical outcome."&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=ECHOUTCOMEguidelines/&gt;

In response to the ECHOUTCOME study, representatives of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the [[Scottish Medicines Consortium]], and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] made the following points. First, QALYs are better than alternative measures.&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Second, the study was "limited."&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Third, problems with QALYs were already widely acknowledged.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Fourth, the researchers did not take budgetary constraints into consideration.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Fifth, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence uses QALYs that are based on 3395 interviews with residents of the UK, as opposed to residents of several European countries.&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt; Finally, people who call for the elimination of QALYs may have "[[Conflict of interest|vested interests]]."&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;

'''Rosalyn Sussman Yalow''' (July 19, 1921 – May 30, 2011) was an American [[medical physics|medical physicist]], and a co-winner of the 1977 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] (together with [[Roger Guillemin]] and [[Andrew Schally]]) for development of the [[radioimmunoassay]] (RIA) technique. She was the second woman (the first being [[Gerty Cori]]), and the first American-born woman, to be awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8553122/Rosalyn-Yalow.html Obituary in ''The Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonolis"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bonolis |first1=Luisa |title=Research Profile – Rosalyn Yalow |url=https://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/research-profile/laureate-yalow |website=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rosalyn Sussman Yalow was born in the Bronx, New York, the daughter of Clara (née Zipper) and Simon Sussman, and was raised in a Jewish household. She went to [[Walton High School (Bronx)]], [[New York City]]. After high school, she attended the all-female, tuition-free [[Hunter College]], where her mother hoped she would learn to become a teacher. Instead, Yalow decided to study physics.{{Quote box|width=30%|quote=I was excited about achieving a career in physics. My family, being more practical, thought the most desirable position for me would be as an elementary school teacher.|source=Rosalyn Yalow&lt;ref name="autobiography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1977/yalow-autobio.html|title=Autobiography|last=Yalow|first=Rosalyn|year=1977|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Yalow knew how to type, and was able to get a part-time position as a secretary to Dr. [[Rudolf Schoenheimer]], a leading biochemist at [[Columbia University]]'s College of Physicians and Surgeons. She did not believe that any respectable graduate school would admit and financially support a woman, so she took another job as a secretary to [[Michael Heidelberger]], another biochemist at Columbia, who hired her on the condition that she studied [[stenography]]. She graduated from [[Hunter College]] in January 1941.&lt;ref name="autobiography" /&gt;

A few years later, she received an offer to be a teaching assistant in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received this offer partially because [[World War II]] had just begun and many men went off to fight, and the University opted to offer women scholarship to avoid being shut down. At the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], she was the only woman among the department's 400 members, and the first since 1917.&lt;ref name="straus1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Straus |first1=Eugene |title=Rosalyn Yalow, Nobel Laureate: Her Life and Work in Medicine |date=1999 |publisher=Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0738202631}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|109}} Yalow earned her [[Ph.D.]] in 1945.  The next summer, she took two tuition-free physics courses under government auspices at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="kahn2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kahn |first1=C. Ronald |last2=Roth |first2=Jesse |title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow (1921–2011) |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=2012 |volume=109 |issue=3 |pages=669–670 |jstor=23077082|bibcode=2012PNAS..109..669K |doi=10.1073/pnas.1120470109 |pmc=3271914 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married fellow student Aaron Yalow, the son of a rabbi, in June 1943. They had two children, Benjamin and Elanna Yalow,  and kept a [[kosher]] home. Yalow did not believe in “balancing her career with her home life” and instead incorporated her home life wherever she could in her work life.&lt;ref name="straus1999"/&gt;{{rp|109}} Yalow did, however, viewed the traditional roles of a homemaker as a priority, and devoted herself to traditional duties associated with motherhood and being a wife.

Throughout her career, she tended to shun feminist organizations, but still, she advocated for including more [[women in science]].&lt;ref name="kahn2012"/&gt; While she believed the reason she had certain opportunities in Physics was because of the war, she thought that the reason that the number of women in this field decreased after the war due to a lack of interest. Yalow saw the feminist movement as a challenge to her traditional beliefs and thought that it encouraged women not to fulfill their duties to become mothers and wives.&lt;ref name="straus1999"/&gt;{{rp|109}}

==Work==
The month after graduating from [[Hunter College]] in January 1941, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow was offered a teaching assistantship in the physics department of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Gaining acceptance to the physics graduate program in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois was one of the many hurdles she had to overcome as a woman in her field. Powerful male figures controlled opportunities for training, recognition, promotion, and many aspects of development in the field of science, and especially physics.

When Yalow entered the university in September 1941, she was the only woman in the faculty, which comprised 400 professors and teaching assistants. She was the first woman in more than two decades to attend or teach at this engineering college.&lt;ref name="anderson2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Rebecca J. |title=Breaking Barriers: The Life and Work of Rosalyn Yalow |journal=The Pharmacologist |date=September 2017 |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=152–163 |url=https://www.aspet.org/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/publications/v59_n3_9_2017_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yalow credited her position at the prestigious graduate school to the shortage of male candidates during World War II. Being surrounded by gifted men made her aware of a wider world in science. They recognized her talent, they encouraged her, and they supported her. They were in a position to help her succeed.&lt;ref name="straus1999"/&gt;

Yalow felt that other women in her field did not like her because of her ambition. Other women saw her curiosity as abandoning the only acceptable path for a woman in science at the time, becoming a high school science teacher, but Yalow wanted to be a physicist.&lt;ref name="straus1999"/&gt; During her time at the University of Illinois, she took extra undergraduate courses to increase her knowledge because she wanted to do original experimental research in addition to her regular teaching duties.&lt;ref name="world2003"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/rosalyn-sussman-yalow |website=World of Microbiology and Immunology |language=en |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years Yalow faced criticism from women at work but she never quit nor turned her back on other young women, if she believed they had the potential to become real scientists. She never became an advocate for women's organizations in the field of science.&lt;ref name="world2003"/&gt; She was even quoted as saying, "It bothers me that there are now organizations for women in science, which means they think they have to be treated differently from the men. I don't approve."&lt;ref name="straus1999"/&gt;{{rp|81}} Although girls and young women found a role model in her after she won her Nobel, Yalow was not a champion for improving women's treatment or representation in science.&lt;ref name="straus1999"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

Yalow's first job after teaching and taking classes at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana graduate school was as an assistant electrical engineer at Federal Telecommunications Laboratory. She, again, found herself to be the only woman employee.&lt;ref name="straus1999"/&gt; In 1946, she returned to [[Hunter College]] to teach physics and consequently influenced many women, most notably a young [[Mildred Dresselhaus]]: Yalow was responsible for steering the future "Queen of Carbon Science" away from primary school teaching and into a research career.&lt;ref name="Vega"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mildred Dresselhaus - Science Video |url=http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/20 |website=Vega Science Trust |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Anderson |first1=Mark |title=Mildred Dresselhaus: The Queen of Carbon |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/profiles/mildred-dresselhaus-the-queen-of-carbon |accessdate=31 August 2018 |work=IEEE Spectrum |date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained a [[physics]] lecturer from 1946 to 1950, although by 1947, she began her long association with the [[Veterans Administration]] (VA) by becoming a consultant to the Bronx VA Hospital.&lt;ref name="howes2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Howes |first1=Ruth H. |title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow (1921–2011) |journal=Physics &amp; Society |date=October 2011 |volume=40 |issue=4 |url=https://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/201110/howes.cfm |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VA wanted to establish research programs to explore medical uses of radioactive substances.&lt;ref name="anderson2017"/&gt; By 1950, Yalow had equipped a [[radioisotope]] laboratory at the Bronx VA Hospital and decided to leave teaching to finally devote her attention to full-time research. There she collaborated with [[Solomon Berson]] to develop [[radioimmunoassay]] (RIA),&lt;ref name="straus1999"/&gt; a radioisotope tracing technique that allows the measurement of tiny quantities of various biological substances in human blood as well as a multitude of other aqueous fluids. Originally used to study insulin levels in diabetes mellitus, the technique has since been applied to hundreds of other substances – including [[hormones]], [[vitamins]] and [[enzymes]] – all too small to detect previously.&lt;ref name="anderson2017"/&gt;

Despite its huge commercial potential, Yalow and Berson refused to patent the method. In 1968, Yalow was appointed Research Professor in the Department of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she later became the Solomon Berson Distinguished Professor at Large.&lt;ref name="howes2011"/&gt;

[[File:Sterling and Yalow receiving Middleton Award 1973.png|thumb|264x264px|Yalow (left), receiving the Middleton Award with [[Kenneth Sterling]], M.D. (center), and Bronx VA Medical Center Director Harold Jaffrey (right)]]

Yalow was awarded a [[Fulbright]] fellowship to [[Portugal]], which is an American scholarship program of competitive, merit-based grants that sponsor participants for exchanges in all areas of endeavor, including the sciences, business, academe, public service, government and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;The Power of International Education, "Fulbright U.S. Student Program," Fulbright, accessed May 14, 2018, https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Yalow won the Eli Lilly Award of the American Diabetes Association, which provides scholarships for up to 100 scholars to attend Scientific Sessions, the world’s largest scientific and medical conference focused on diabetes and its complications. Additionally, it provides the education and training for these scholars to serve as faculty for professional education programs and to clinically manage the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Alexandria, "Lilly Announce New Scholars Program for 74th Annual Scientific Sessions," American Diabetes Association, last modified January 24, 2014, accessed May 16, 2018, http://www.diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/2014/scholars-awards.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, she was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award, which recognizes the world’s most creative and accomplished biomedical scientists who are advancing humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Gairdner, "The Canada Gairdner Awards," Gairdner, accessed May 16, 2018, https://gairdner.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Yalow was awarded the American College of Physicians Award, which recognizes excellence and distinguished contributions by individuals to internal medicine.&lt;ref&gt;American College of Physicians, "Awards, Masterships and Competitions," American College of Physicians, accessed May 16, 2018, https://www.acponline.org/about-acp/awards-masterships-and-competitions.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Yalow was awarded the [[William Shainline Middleton|William S. Middleton]] Award for Excellence in Research, which is the highest honor awarded annually by the Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service to senior bio biomedical research scientists in recognition of their outstanding scientific contributions and achievements, pertaining to the healthcare of Veterans.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, "Office of Research and Development," U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, accessed May 14, 2018, https://www.research.va.gov/services/blrd/research-awards.cfm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo37496/ORD-85yrHistory.pdf|title=A historical look at the establishment of the Department of Veterans Affairs Research &amp; Development Program|last=Hays|first=Marguerite Hays|date=2010|website=U.S. Government Publishing Office|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs Research &amp; Development Program|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1972, she was given the Koch Award of the Endocrine Society, which awards individuals for their dedication to excellence in research, education and clinical practice in the field of endocrinology.&lt;ref&gt;Endocrine Society, "Awards," Endocrine Society, accessed May 16, 2018, https://www.endocrine.org/awards#!?sort=_contentstartdate.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Yalow and Berson (who had died in 1972) were awarded the [[American Medical Association Scientific Achievement Award]], which is a gold medallion award presented to individuals on special occasions in recognition of their outstanding work in scientific achievement.&lt;ref&gt;American Medical Association, "The American Medical Association Awards Program Criteria," American Medical Association, accessed May 14, 2018, https://www.ama-assn.org/content/american-medical-association-ama-awards-program-criteria.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Medical Association (AMA) Award Recipients|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/awards/about-ama-awards-program/past-recipients.page?|publisher=American Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year she became the first female recipient and first nuclear physicist of the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]]. Established by Albert and Mary Lasker in 1945, the award is intended to celebrate scientists who have made fundamental biological discoveries and clinical advances that improve human health.&lt;ref&gt;Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, "The Lasker Awards," Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, accessed May 14, 2018, http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards-overview/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award|url=http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/1976_b_description.htm|publisher=Lasker Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Yalow was the sixth individual woman (seventh overall, considering [[Marie Curie]]'s two wins), and first American-born woman, to win the [[Nobel Prize]] in a scientific field. She was also the second woman in the world to win in the physiology or medicine category (the first being [[Gerty Cori]]). She was so honored, together with [[Roger Guillemin]] and [[Andrew V. Schally]], for her role in devising the [[radioimmunoassay]] (RIA) technique.&lt;ref&gt;Luisa Bonolis, "Research Profile: Rosalyn Yalow," Foundation Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, accessed May 14, 2018, http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/research-profile/laureate-yalow.&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring substances in the human body, the screening of the blood of donors for such diseases as hepatitis was made possible.[17]&lt;ref name="america.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2008/April/20080427135047eaifas0.9798045.html|title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow Nobel Prize winner for physiology or medicine|publisher=america.gov|accessdate=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radioimmunoassay (RIA) can be used to measure a multitude of substances found in tiny quantities in fluids within and outside of organisms (such as viruses, drugs and hormones). The list of current possible uses is endless, but specifically, RIA allows blood-donations to be screened for various types of [[hepatitis]]. The technique can also be used to identify hormone-related health problems. Further, RIA can be used to detect in the blood many foreign substances including some cancers. Finally, the technique can be used to measure the effectiveness of dose levels of antibiotics and drugs.&lt;ref name="America.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2008/April/20080427135047eaifas0.9798045.html#ixzz0rKOY0N87|title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow|date=April 27, 2008|publisher=America.gov|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Yalow was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], which provides an opportunity for an early-career professional with training in science or engineering to learn about a career in public policy and administration.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences, "Fellowships," American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences, accessed May 14, 2018, https://www.amacad.org/content/about/about.aspx?d=103.

In 1986, Yalow was awarded the A. Cressy Morrison Award in Natural Sciences of the N.Y. Academy of Sciences, which is offered by Mr. Abraham Cressy Morrison to individuals with superlative papers on a scientific subject within the field of The New York Academy of Sciences and its Affiliated Societies.&lt;ref&gt;Miner Roy Waldo, ed., Transactions Of The New York Academy of Sciences (n.p., 1944), 7:168, https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.21502/2015.21502.Transactions-Of-The-New-York-Academy-Of-Sciences-Vol-7-1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Yalow received the [[National Medal of Science]], which is given to American individuals who deserve the highest honor in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;National Science &amp; Technology Medals Foundation, "Celebrating America's Highest Honor for Science and Technology," National Science &amp; Technology Medals Foundation, accessed May 14, 2018, https://www.nationalmedals.org/about.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Yalow was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/rosalyn-s-yalow/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Rosalyn S. Yalow]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Santé Mentale et Exclusion Sociale - Europa''' ('''SMES-Europa'''), or '''Mental Health and Social Exclusion - Europa''' ('''MHSE-Europa''') is an [[International association without lucrative purpose|international non-profit organization]] that helps people suffering from both [[mental illness]] and [[extreme poverty]].  SMES-Europa, the Europe-wide organization, was founded in 1992.

== History ==
The European SMES project began in Rome as a result of the first European seminar on the appalling neglect and abandonment homeless people living in extremely poor health &amp; social conditions. The poverty and social exclusion are not a fatality, but a dramatic structural phenomenon of our society and constitutes a political challenge for all the Europe.
Loneliness, sickness, mental illness, drug abuse and/or alcoholism, may be the cause or the results of this state of alienation and exclusion from society, which in some cases the same social context is responsible in beginning of the process that risk to become irreversible and which could eventually lead to a complete break with society.

== General objectives ==
# to improve mental, physical and social well-being; 
# to promote respect of Fundamental Human RIGHT and to facilitate the access to citizenship rights : housing, health, job, education;
# to promote active inclusion: participation and solidarity for people living in extreme social and health precariousness in all European Countries, especially for homeless and mentally ill people.

== Specific objectives ==
* Information and heightening of awareness for all civic society 
* Networking : improving opportunities of working together 
* Education and training: permanent and continuum, promoting exchanges 
* Lobbying and advocacy

== Target group==
SMES helps:
# mentally ill people without adequate assistance, 
# young people at risk of losing viable contact with society, 
# people addicted to alcohol and drugs, 
# ex/prisoners, 
# elderly people who have been abandoned, 
# refugees and migrants without permission of residence.

A '''school social worker'''  provides [[counseling]] and psycho-social services to children and [[adolescent]]s in schools at both micro and macro levels. Social workers work as mental health experts, leaders of social and emotional development within the school community, family-school liaisons, and program development experts.  They aim to address student issues by working with an ecological, systems approach with parents, the school, and the community. They also work with [[crisis intervention]], group treatment, [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse|abuse]] identification and reporting, integrating services to culturally and economically diverse populations, and working on [[education policy]] issues. Most school social workers in the United States hold a [[Master of Social Work]] degree and have specialized training in helping students within the context of local schools.

==History==
===United States===
School social work began during the school year 1907–08 and was established simultaneously in [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]] and [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Jarolmen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=JoAnn Jarolmen|title=School Social Work: A Direct Practice Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abwgAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-2215-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its inception, school social workers were known, among other things, as advocates for new immigrants and welfare workers of equity and fairness  for people of lower socioeconomic class' as well as home visitors. These unheralded and extensive process' led to the expansion of school social work services with the encouragement of the community.

By 1900 over two-thirds of the states had compulsory attendance laws and by 1918, each state had passed [[Compulsory education|compulsory school attendance]] laws based on the philosophy of [[Social inclusion|inclusion]], making [[school]] attendance obligatory by rights, and as a privilege of equal opportunity for those with individual differences (including differences in rate of learning). These pupil personnel workers or attendance workers were replaced by Visiting teachers by 1920's, they were later called as School based caseworkers. They made different emphases and methods in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson &amp; Willie, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; E.g. Special schools, Psycho-social assessment and referrals and family based intervention.

A 1917 study of truancy in Chicago supported "findings that the need for school attendance officers who understood the social ills of the community" and school social workers were best equipped for that responsibility (Allen-Meares, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;25).  Mary Richmond, one of the founding figures of social work, devoted an entire chapter to the visiting teacher in her 1922 book on ''What is Social Casework?''  The testing movement influenced school social work growth as well.  Through the testing movement, [[educators]] were gaining knowledge about individual differences, underscoring the need for some children to attend school, children whose social conditions related to their [[test scores]]. Lastly during this time, leaders in the field like [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]], expressed concerns of how school and education would relate to future success and happiness, and expressed the need to connect school and home in order to relate to the needs of children.

Later in the 1920s, with the [[mental hygiene movement]] school social work was concerned with treating nervous disorders and behavioral problems in difficult children and prevention of social maladjustment, this was the beginning of therapeutic role for school social workers.&lt;ref&gt;Costin, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[great depression]] in the 1930s, like [[school counseling]], school social work also declined.&lt;ref&gt;Areson,1933&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 a progressive movement saw social work efforts to be initiated in the schools, and community settlement programs also have its share that led to its growth.

From the 1940–1960 [[Caseworker (social work)#Social case work|case work]] and [[Group work#Social group work|group work]] in schools had become an established specialty.&lt;ref&gt;Vinter &amp; Saari, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, [[pupil]]-[[personnel]] laws called for a greater emphasis by school social workers on the development of school policies and reforms. School social workers were affected by the governmental reforms and education research. Like school counselors, social workers were now called upon to address student needs while also addressing the sources of student troubles within the school. The school social worker was considered as an expert by then, who could help schools on varying [[psychosocial]] issues.

During the 1970s, school social work gave more emphasis on family, community, collaborative approach with teachers and others school personnel. In 1975, the United States passed the Education of All Handicapped Children Act (EAHC, P.L. 94-142). It gave special importance to the role of School social work services. The legislation was later renamed as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins-Burnett, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter part of the 1970s, inflation was rising at an alarming rate and budget cuts threatened the profession of school social work, especially as many social workers were being replaced by other school personnel claiming similar roles.  The National Association of Social Work (NASW) published a newsletter to bring attention to the issue and get responses from practitioners.  Through this, NASW conducted research and replicated the findings of others' studies on the roles of school social workers and models of practice, and school social work continued to expand.

In the 1980s, school social workers were included as "qualified personnel" in many pieces of legislation, especially in the Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988. These led to NASW giving more attention to the profession and more service to meet the needs of the category. NASW's active participation in the profession eventually led to a school social worker credential with exams in 1992. Since then, there has been a trend of integrative collaborative services.&lt;ref&gt;Allen-Meares et al., 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, school social workers were included in American Education Act. In July 1994 64 school social workers from across the USA met in [[Edwardsville, Illinois]] and formed the School Social Work Association of America. They drafted the first constitution and by-laws for the organization.  In June 2009, a second national organization incorporated, the American Council for School Social Work, after reviewing the direction of the profession and concluding that a stronger, enhanced national voice would benefit the profession.

===Germany===
School social work in Germany began in the 1970s. The German term for school social work "Schulsozialarbeit". It dealt with helping students with social skills, interpersonal relations, and personal growth. Initially it was an institutionalized form of both school and youth welfare for providing underprivileged children support regarding healthy socialization and adjustment in school for rising above the demands of school settings. German school social workers find solution to problems in school environment and personal ones of students. The German Youth Institute provided the first social work training with school social work concentration. Apart from this the changing social and economic paradigms of the 21st century that affects lives of families as wells as of children rises the importance of school social work in German pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marion Huxtable|author2=Eric Blyth|title=School Social Work Worldwide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XtHAAAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=NASW Press|isbn=978-0-87101-348-4|pages=123+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
School social work in India was officially recognized by the [[Government of India]] in the 21st century. From the 1970s, school social workers were prominent in elite schools, adopting the American model of school counseling, based on the client or [[person centered approach]] of [[Carl Rogers]] and others. The main objective was whole welfare of the child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncert.nic.in/departments/nie/dse/activities/advisory_board/pdf/guidelines_for_guidance_and_counseling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] refers to school social workers as Health Wellness Teachers (CBSE Circular No.20/2014), while the [[Integrated Child Protection Scheme]] (ICPS) strictly enforces requirement of a School Social Worker and School Counselor. The psycho-social service scheme instituted under ICPS in [[Kerala]] with the guidance of a child development center (CDC) have contracted social workers for 800 schools to provide the professional services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swd.kerala.gov.in/images/VIKASBHAVAN/prsena635441fgggf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The services are limited to only teenage girls, and excludes boys from equal rights to access of the program.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==School social work values==
Florence Poole in 1949 described a school social worker as a skilled worker required to determine which needs within the school can be met through school social work service. A school social worker must develop a method of offering the service that will fit with the general organization and structure of the school, and which could be identified as using social work knowledge and skill. They must define the service and their contribution so that the school personnel can accept it as a service that contributes to the major purpose of the school.

The values that school social work upholds are:&lt;ref&gt;Allen-Meares, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

* Each pupil is valued as an individual regardless of any unique characteristic.
* Each pupil should be allowed to be participate in the learning process.
* Individual differences should be recognized; intervention should be aimed at guiding pupils' goals with educational support to train them to the life to which they look forward.
* Each child, regardless of race and socioeconomic characteristics, has a right to equal treatment in the school.

The National Association of Social Workers in the U.S. provides a code of ethics for school social work professionals.

==Theoretical framework and services==
School social work is structured around a range of practice models.

===Traditional-clinical model===
John Alderson was the first to describe the existed traditional-clinical models. Generally the schools followed ''social change model'' whose major focus was the dysfunctional conditions of the school; the community school model which urged school social workers to employ ''community organization'' methods; and the social interaction model which de-emphasized a specific methodology and required the worker to intervene with the systems interacting with the target system. These were known as the Traditional models. Students who have disabilities are defined as exceptional children by federal and state legislation, including the Individuals with Disability Education Act (P.L. 94-142), the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) in the United States of America.

In the clinical model, school social workers work primarily through casework methods supplemented by group methods with students and family members; A greater emphasis is placed on [[evidence-based practice]] and promising intervention methods that is supported empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home-school-community relations model===
Later school social workers used an approach that draws on components of the existing multidisciplinary models - Social interaction model, focusing on working with students with social and emotional difficulties and their problems in families(parents) and schools with a flexible and dynamic reciprocal interaction. This model is grounded on systems theory and transactional systems perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; This model was an answer to organize the methodological diversity inherent in the role, rather than limiting to individual change or systems change.

===School-community-pupil relations model===
Lela B. Costin, in 1973 developed this model.  It focuses on the school, community, and student and the interactions among the three. In this model, school social workers serves as mediators, negotiators, consultants, and advocates for students and school personnel, listening to student grievances. They also set up informal groups for students, teachers, and other school personnel. This model also focuses on evaluation by a school social worker of the characteristics of students, the school, and community conditions and their relational affect on the availability and quality of educational opportunities to specific target groups (students with [[chemical dependency]], [[disabilities]], and so on).  They are grounded in [[social learning theory]] and [[systems theory]].

===Clinical and environmental interaction model===
This model is grounded on the ecological systems theory. This was developed by Frey and Dupper (2005) and Germain (2006). The model promotes view of person and environment as a unitary interacting system in which each constantly affects and shapes the other. This model attends the complexities of the person as well as the environment by engaging progressive forces in people and situational assets, and impinging the removal of environmental obstacles for growth and adaptive functioning. This model leads to an effecting dynamic change.&lt;ref&gt;Kratochwill &amp; Shernoff, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of school social workers continues to expand as the knowledge-base and the level of student need grows or the recognition of opportunities to address student need. Two examples of this role expansion include functional behavior assessment, an efficient, empirically - supported, and amenable approach to undesirable school behavior that can be accomplished in a classroom collaboration model with teachers (Waller, 2008) and a leadership role in helping schools become foundational in promoting the mental health of children and adolescents in a manner similar to the role that schools already play in promoting physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the roles played by School Social Workers has grown so substantially as a direct result of student needs, consultation, education, and collaboration with other school personnel (e.g. Waller, 2008) is a practice which is only destined to grow as a means of insufficient resources being used to their greatest advantage.

==Functions==
A survey published in 1989 by school social work experts categorized five job function dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

* Relationships with and services to children and families.
* Relationships with and services to teachers and school staff.
* Administrative and professional tasks. 
* Services to other school personnel.
* Community services.

Further research on these roles revealed other important areas that are frequently addressed - Consultation and teamwork; needs assessment and program evaluation; Social work interventions with systems; developmental programs management.&lt;ref&gt;Constable et al., 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A role where school social work falls short is in the range of administering diagnostic psychological tests. [http://www.sswaa.org/ School Social Work Association of America] identifies general roles like psycho-social assessment, developmental psycho-education, student and family counseling, early intervention for risk behaviors, therapeutic behavioral intervention for academic success, personality development, recreational therapies, yearly assessment, and case management for identifying students in need of help and to promote systematic change within a school system (not to stratify students into groups, and thus stratify the students' opportunities because of this)&lt;ref&gt;House, R. M., &amp; Martin, P. J. (1998). Advocating for better futures for all students: A new vision for school counselors. Education, 119, 284–291.&lt;/ref&gt;), consultation for special issues, crisis intervention and conflict resolution. Social worker deal with stressful situations. Some situations might be more complex than others since every family brings different problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=e0aca517-fb96-4e49-b21a-20bb37fa42b4%40sessionmgr120&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=124&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=32713384&amp;db=a9h|title=Forging Vital School Links|last=Bonnick|first=Helen|date=June 5, 2008|website=EBSCOhost|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and training==
States regulate school social work practice in different ways.  Approximately 33 jurisdictions license or certify school social workers. Most require a master's degree in social work (MSW), but a smaller number of states also license Bachelors of Social Work (holders of the [[BSW]] degree). The National Association of Social Workers with 150,000 members also offers a Certified School Social Work Specialist (C-SSWS) Certificate in school social work revised from the 1992 School Social Work Credential Exam. It does not replace any license or certification that individual states require of school social workers.

The [[Council on Social Work Education]] (CSWE) is the national accrediting body for social work education at the BSW and [[Master of Social Work|MSW]] levels. It specifies foundational social work program components, but social work specialties areas are defined by the individual accredited MSW programs. "Social work education is grounded in the [[liberal arts]] and contains a coherent, integrated professional foundation in social work practice from which an advanced practice curriculum is built at the graduate level."([http://www.cswe.org CSWE], Educational Programs and Accreditation Standards)

==Associations &amp; professional journals==
School social workers work to promote student learning and well-being, address academic and non-academic barriers to learning, develop comprehensive and cohesive academic and social supports, and understand and apply diverse frameworks for evidence-based practice and program development for the educational process to work the fullest extent.&lt;ref&gt;Constable &amp; Alvarez, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Major associations in North America include the School Social Work Association of America, the American Council for School Social Work, and the Canadian Association of School Social Workers and Attendance Counsellors.

School social work journals have been published across the globe including the ''School Social Work Journal'' sponsored by the Illinois Association of School Social Workers, the Journal of School Social Work (JSSW) from [[Chennai]], India and the [[Canadian Journal of School Psychology]] from SAGE Publications, Canada.

'''Secondary treatment''' is a treatment process for [[wastewater]] (or [[sewage]]) to achieve a certain degree of effluent quality by using a [[sewage treatment plant]] with physical phase separation to remove [[settleable solids]] and a biological process to remove dissolved and suspended organic compounds. After this kind of treatment, the wastewater may be called as secondary-treated wastewater.

Secondary treatment is the portion of a sewage treatment sequence removing dissolved and [[colloid]]al compounds measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD).  Secondary treatment is traditionally applied to the liquid portion of sewage after primary treatment has removed settleable solids and floating material. Secondary treatment is typically performed by [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]], aquatic [[microorganism]]s in a managed [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] habitat. [[Bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. [[sugar]]s, fats, and organic short-chain [[carbon]] molecules from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent) while reproducing to form [[cell (biology)|cell]]s of biological solids. Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 40&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4&amp;nbsp;°C and 32&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Basin" /&gt;
[[File:Secondary sedimentation tank 1 w.JPG|thumb|This small secondary [[clarifier]] at a rural sewage treatment plant is a typical phase separation mechanism to remove biological solids formed in a suspended growth or fixed-film bioreactor.]]

==Definitions==

=== Primary treatment ===
Primary treatment of sewage by quiescent settling allows separation of floating material and heavy solids from liquid waste. The remaining liquid usually contains less than half of the original solids content and approximately two-thirds of the BOD in the form of colloids and dissolved organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Abbett, p.19-28&lt;/ref&gt; Where nearby water bodies can rapidly dilute this liquid waste, primary treated sewage may be discharged so natural biological decomposition oxidizes remaining waste.&lt;ref&gt;Abbett, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[San Diego]] used Pacific Ocean dilution of primary treated effluent into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego.gov/mwwd/facilities/ptloma/ |title=Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant |last= |first= |website= |publisher=City of San Diego |accessdate=5 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary treatment ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defined secondary treatment based on the performance observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage.&lt;ref name="EPA-reg"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "Secondary Treatment Regulation: Secondary treatment." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|102}} ''Code of Federal Regulations.'' 1984-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary treated sewage is expected to produce effluent with a monthly average of less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/l BOD and less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/l [[suspended solids]]. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and secondary treatment is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from domestic sewage. The EPA regulations describe [[stabilization pond]]s as providing treatment equivalent to secondary treatment removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from [[combined sewer]]s, dilute industrial wastewater, or [[Infiltration/Inflow]].&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1984). "Secondary Treatment Regulation: Special considerations." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|103}}; and "Treatment equivalent to secondary treatment." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where natural waterways are too small to rapidly oxidize primary treated sewage, the liquid may be used to [[irrigation|irrigate]] [[sewage farm]]s until suburban property values encourage secondary treatment methods requiring less acreage. Glacial [[outwash plain|sand deposits]] allowed some northeastern United States cities to use [[slow sand filter|intermittent sand filtration]] until more compact secondary treatment [[bioreactor]]s became available.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun, p.34-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sewage treatment#Biological nutrient removal|Biological nutrient removal]] is regarded by some sanitary engineers as secondary treatment and by others as tertiary treatment. The differentiation may also differ from one country to another.

=== Tertiary treatment ===
The purpose of [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary treatment]] (also called "advanced treatment") is to provide a final treatment stage to further improve the effluent quality before it is discharged to the receiving environment (sea, river, lake, wet lands, ground, etc.). Tertiary treatment may include biological nutrient removal (alternatively, this can be classified as secondary treatment), disinfection and removal of micropollutants, such as [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s.

==Process upsets==
Process upsets are temporary decreases in treatment plant performance caused by significant population change within the secondary treatment ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.703&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions likely to create upsets include for example toxic chemicals and unusually high or low concentrations of organic waste BOD providing food for the bioreactor ecosystem.

===Toxicity===
Waste containing [[biocide]] concentrations exceeding the secondary treatment ecosystem tolerance level may kill a major fraction of one or more important ecosystem species. BOD reduction normally accomplished by that species temporarily ceases until other species reach a suitable population to utilize that food source, or the original population recovers as biocide concentrations decline.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, p.308&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilution===
Waste containing unusually low BOD concentrations may fail to sustain the secondary treatment population required for normal waste concentrations. The reduced population surviving the starvation event may be unable to completely utilize available BOD when waste loads return to normal. Dilution may be caused by addition of large volumes of relatively uncontaminated water such as stormwater runoff into a combined sewer. Smaller sewage treatment plants may experience dilution from cooling water discharges, major plumbing leaks, firefighting, or draining large swimming pools.

A similar problem occurs as BOD concentrations drop when low flow increases waste residence time within the secondary treatment bioreactor. Secondary treatment ecosystems of college communities acclimated to waste loading fluctuations from student work/sleep cycles may have difficulty surviving school vacations. Secondary treatment systems accustomed to routine production cycles of industrial facilities may have difficulty surviving industrial plant shutdown. Populations of species feeding on incoming waste initially decline as concentration of those food sources decrease. Population decline continues as ecosystem predator populations compete for a declining population of lower [[trophic level]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.386-395&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak waste load===
High BOD concentrations initially exceed the ability of the secondary treatment ecosystem to utilize available food. Ecosystem populations of aerobic organisms increase until oxygen transfer limitations of the secondary treatment bioreactor are reached. Secondary treatment ecosystem populations may shift toward species with lower oxygen requirements, but failure of those species to use some food sources may produce higher effluent BOD concentrations. More extreme increases in BOD concentrations may drop oxygen concentrations before the secondary treatment ecosystem population can adjust, and cause an abrupt population decrease among important species. Normal BOD removal efficiency will not be restored until populations of aerobic species recover after oxygen concentrations rise to normal.

===Design for damage control===
Measures creating uniform wastewater loadings tend to reduce the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a [[plug flow reactor model]] circulating water over surfaces colonized by [[biofilm]], while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]] keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may be followed by a physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth [[activated sludge]] systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film [[trickling filter]] systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;EPA (2004). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/primer.pdf "Primer for Municipal Waste water Treatment Systems."] Document no. EPA 832-R-04-001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–13}}

Wastewater flow variations may be reduced by limiting stormwater collection by the sewer system, and by requiring industrial facilities to discharge batch process wastes to the sewer over a time interval rather than immediately after creation. Discharge of appropriate organic industrial wastes may be timed to sustain the secondary treatment ecosystem through periods of low residential waste flow.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, p.301-306&lt;/ref&gt; Sewage treatment systems experiencing holiday waste load fluctuations may provide alternative food to sustain secondary treatment ecosystems through periods of reduced use. Small facilities may prepare a solution of soluble sugars. Others may find compatible agricultural wastes, or offer disposal incentives to [[septic tank]] pumpers during low use periods.

==Process types==

A great number of secondary treatment processes exist, see [[List of wastewater treatment technologies]]. The main ones are explained below.

===Filter beds (oxidizing beds)===
{{main|Trickling filter}}

In older plants and those receiving variable loadings, [[trickling filter]] beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread onto the surface of a bed made up of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] (carbonized coal), [[limestone]] chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|12}} The filter removes a small percentage of the suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible [[bioclogging]] of the filter media and ponding on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.533-542&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotating biological contactors===
{{main|Rotating biological contactor}}
[[File:Rotating Biological Contactor.png|thumb|right|373 px|Schematic of a typical rotating [[Biological oxidizer|biological contactor]] (RBC). The treated effluent clarifier/settler is not included in the diagram.]]
Rotating biological contactors (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film secondary treatment systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in [[Germany]] in 1960 and have since been developed and refined into a reliable operating unit. The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are sloughed off due to shear forces provided by the rotating discs in the sewage. Effluent from the RBC is then passed through a secondary clarifier where the sloughed biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.&lt;ref&gt;Steel &amp; McGhee, pp.492-493&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activated sludge===
{{main|Activated sludge}}
[[File:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|right|318px|A generalized schematic of an activated sludge process.]]
Activated sludge is a common suspended-growth method of secondary treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved [[oxygen]] to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, [[ammonia]], etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to [[nitrite]]s, [[nitrate]]s, and, in some processes, to [[nitrogen]] gas through [[denitrification]]. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. [[Nocardia]], a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as ''sewage fungus'', is the best known of many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.482-533&lt;/ref&gt;

====Package plants and sequencing batch reactors====
One type of system that combines secondary treatment and settlement is the cyclic activated sludge (CASSBR), or [[sequencing batch reactor]] (SBR). Typically,  [[activated sludge]] is mixed with raw incoming sewage, and then mixed and aerated.  The settled sludge is run off and re-aerated before a proportion is returned to the headworks.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1999). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sbr_new.pdf "Sequencing Batch Reactors."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document no. EPA 832-F-99-073.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disadvantage of the CASSBR process is that it requires a precise control of timing, mixing and aeration. This precision is typically achieved with computer controls linked to sensors. Such a complex, fragile system is unsuited to places where controls may be unreliable, poorly maintained, or where the power supply may be intermittent.  [[Extended aeration]] package plants use separate basins for aeration and settling, and are somewhat larger than SBR plants with reduced timing sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hammer, Mark J. | title=Water and Waste-Water Technology | year=1975 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | pages=390–391 | isbn=0-471-34726-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Package plants may be referred to as ''high charged'' or ''low charged''. This refers to the way the biological load is processed. In high charged systems, the biological stage is presented with a high organic load and the combined floc and organic material is then oxygenated for a few hours before being charged again with a new load. In the low charged system the biological stage contains a low organic load and is combined with [[Flocculation|flocculate]] for longer times.

====Membrane bioreactors====
{{Main|Membrane bioreactor}}
Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are activated sludge systems using a [[Membrane technology|membrane]] liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure [[microfiltration]] or [[ultrafiltration]] membranes and eliminates the need for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional [[activated sludge]] (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000&amp;nbsp;mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000&amp;nbsp;mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.

The cost of building and operating an MBR is often higher than conventional methods of sewage treatment. Membrane filters can be blinded with grease or abraded by suspended grit and lack a clarifier's flexibility to pass peak flows.  The technology has become increasingly popular for reliably pretreated waste streams and has gained wider acceptance where infiltration and inflow have been controlled, however, and the life-cycle costs have been steadily decreasing. The small footprint of MBR systems, and the high quality effluent produced, make them particularly useful for water reuse applications.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2007).

====Aerobic granulation====
{{Main|Aerobic granulation}}
[[File:Nereda biomass left and activated sludge after only minutes of settling.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aerobic granular sludge can be formed by applying specific process conditions that favour slow growing organisms such as PAOs (polyphosphate accumulating organisms) and GAOs (glycogen accumulating organisms). Another key part of granulation is selective wasting whereby slow settling floc-like sludge is discharged as waste sludge and faster settling biomass is retained. This process has been commercialized as [[Nereda|Nereda process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesourcemagazine.org/mark-van-loosdrecht-professor-at-delft-university-of-technology/ |title=Mark van Loosdrecht – Professor at Delft University of Technology |last=Forster |first=Richard |website=Source |publisher=[[International Water Association]] |accessdate=24 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface-aerated lagoons or ponds===
{{Main|Aerated lagoon}}
[[File:Surface-Aerated Basin.png|thumb|right|318px|A typical surface-aerated basin (using motor-driven floating aerators)]]
Aerated lagoons are a [[low technology]] suspended-growth method of secondary treatment using motor-driven aerators floating on the water surface to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer to the lagoon and to mix the lagoon contents. The floating surface aerators are typically rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;kg [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[watt-hour|kW·h]]. Aerated lagoons provide less effective mixing than conventional activated sludge systems and do not achieve the same performance level. The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90 percent removal of BOD with retention times of 1 to 10 days.&lt;ref name=Basin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, M.R.|year=1971|title=Performance of surface-aerated basins|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress Symposium Series|volume=67|issue=107|pages=322–339}} [http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes Available at CSA Illumina website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114140052/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes |date=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many small municipal sewage systems in the United States (1 million gal./day or less) use aerated lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;Maine Department of Environmental Protection. Augusta, ME. [http://www.lagoonsonline.com "Aerated Lagoons – Wastewater Treatment."] Maine Lagoon Systems Task Force. Accessed 2010-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructed wetlands===
{{Main|Constructed wetland}}
Primary clarifier effluent was discharged directly to [[eutrophic]] natural [[wetland]]s for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems can be built to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary treated sewage. Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses plug flow assumptions to compute the residence time required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average residence time.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Middlebrooks &amp; Crites, pp.170-201&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Mary Ann ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th Edition (1976) American Public Health Association {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}} pp.89-95&amp;543-544&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerging technologies===
* Biological Aerated (or Anoxic) Filter (BAF) or Biofilters combine filtration with biological carbon reduction, [[nitrification]] or denitrification. BAF usually includes a reactor filled with a [[filter (water)|filter]] media. The media is either in suspension or supported by a gravel layer at the foot of the filter. The dual purpose of this media is to support highly active biomass that is attached to it and to filter suspended solids. Carbon reduction and ammonia conversion occurs in aerobic mode and sometime achieved in a single reactor while nitrate conversion occurs in [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] mode. BAF is operated either in upflow or downflow configuration depending on design specified by manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=EPA |first= |authorlink = |title =An Emerging Technology: The Biological Aerated Filter |publisher =United States Government Printing Office |volume = |edition = |date =July 1983 |location = |pages = |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stereopsis recovery''', also '''recovery from stereoblindness''', is the phenomenon of a [[stereoblind]] person gaining partial or full ability of stereo vision ([[stereopsis]]).

Recovering stereo vision as far as possible has long been established as an approach to the therapeutic treatment of stereoblind patients. Treatment aims to recover stereo vision in very young children, as well as in patients who had acquired but lost their ability for stereopsis due to a medical condition. In contrast, this aim has normally not been present in the treatment of those who missed out on learning stereopsis during their first few years of life. In fact, the acquisition of binocular and stereo vision was long thought to be impossible unless the person acquired this skill during a [[critical period]] in infancy and early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{cite journal|author=Uri Polat|title=Restoration of underdeveloped cortical functions: Evidence from treatment of adult amblyopia|journal=Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience|volume=26|number=4-5|year=2008|pages=413–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis normally went unquestioned and has formed the basis for the therapeutic approaches to binocular disorders for decades. It has been put in doubt in recent years. In particular since studies on stereopsis recovery began to appear in scientific journals and it became publicly known that neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]] achieved stereopsis well into adulthood, that assumption is in retrospect considered to have held the status of a scientific [[dogma]].&lt;ref name="barry-2009"&gt;Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions''. New York: Basic Books. {{ISBN|978-0-465-02073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[…] The book's main contribution, however, is exposing the wrong-headed dogma that acuity and binocular vision can be restored only during a critical developmental period." —''New England Journal of Medicine''. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[…] Part memoir and part science, ''Fixing My Gaze'' is a fitting tribute to the determination of a patient and her optometrist in challenging conventional wisdom and dogma." —''Journal of Behavioral Optometry''. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astle-etal-2011a"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrew T. Astle|author2=Paul V. McGraw|author3=Ben S. Webb|title=Myth exploded: Recovery of stereo acuity in adults with amblyopia|journal=BMJ Case Reports|year=2011|doi=10.1136/bcr.07.2010.3143|pmid=22707543|pmc=3062842|volume=2011|issue=feb21 2|pages=bcr0720103143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very recently, there has been a rise in scientific investigations into stereopsis recovery in adults and youths who have had no stereo vision before. While it has now been shown that an adult ''may'' gain stereopsis, it is currently not yet possible to predict how likely a stereoblind person is to do so, nor is there general agreement on the best therapeutic procedure. Also the possible implications for the treatment of children with [[infantile esotropia]] are still under study.

== Clinical management of strabismus and stereoblindness ==
In cases of acquired strabismus with [[double vision]] (diplopia), it is long-established state of the art to aim at curing the double vision and at the same time recovering a patient's earlier ability for stereo vision. For example, a patient may have had full stereo vision but later had diplopia due to a medical condition, losing stereo vision. In this case, medical interventions, including [[vision therapy]] and [[strabismus surgery]], may remove the double vision and recover the stereo vision which had temporarily been absent in the patient.

Also when children with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. [[infantile esotropia]]) receive strabismus surgery within the first few years or two of their life, this goes along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for [[binocular vision]] including stereopsis.

In contrast, in a case where a child's eyes are straightened surgically after the age of about five or six years and the child had no opportunity to develop stereo vision in early childhood, normally the clinical expectation is that this intervention will lead to cosmetic improvements but not to stereo vision. Conventionally, no follow-up for stereopsis was performed in such cases.

For instance, one author summarized the accepted scientific view of the time with the words: "Stereopsis will never be obtained unless [[amblyopia]] is treated, the eyes are aligned, and binocular fusion and function are achieved before the critical period for stereopsis ends. Clinical data suggest that this occurs before 24 months of age,[…] but we do not know exactly when it occurs, because crucial pieces of basic science information are missing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nigel W. Daw|title=Critical Periods and Amblyopia|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology: Mechanisms of Ophthalmic Disease|date=April 1998|volume=116|number=4|pages=502–505|doi=10.1001/archopht.116.4.502}}&lt;/ref&gt; For purposes of illustration, reference is made to a book of doctors' handouts for patients, written for the general public and published in 2002, which summarizes the limitations in the terms in which they, at the time, were fully accepted as [[Medical consensus|medical state of the art]] as follows: "If an adult has a childhood strabismus that was never treated, it is too late to improve any amblyopia or [[depth perception]], so the goal may be simply cosmetic – to make the eyes appear to be properly aligned – though sometimes treatment does enlarge the extent of side vision."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin L. Rubin, Lawrence A. Winograd: ''Taking Care of Your Eyes: A Collection of the Patient Information Handouts Used by America's Leading Eye Doctors'', Triad Records (September 2002), {{ISBN|978-0937404614}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has only been accepted very recently that the therapeutic approach was based on an unquestioned notion that has, since, been referred to as "myth" or "dogma".&lt;ref name="astle-etal-2011a"/&gt;

Recently, however, stereopsis recovery is known to have occurred in a number of adults. While this has in some cases occurred after visual exercises or spontaneous visual experiences, recently also the medical community's view of strabismus surgery has become more optimistic with regard to outcomes in terms of binocular function and possibly stereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Dickmann|author2=S. Aliberti|author3=M.T. Rebecchi|author4=I. Aprile|author5=A. Salerni|author6=S. Petroni|author7=R. Parrilla|author8=V. Perrotta|author9=E. Di Nardo|author10=E. Balestrazzi|title=Improved sensory status and quality-of-life measures in adult patients after strabismus surgery|journal=Journal of AAPOS|date=February 2013|volume=17|number=1|pages=25–28|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2012.09.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one author states:
:"The majority of adults will experience some improvement in binocular function after strabismus surgery even if the strabismus has been longstanding. Most commonly this takes the form of an expansion of binocular visual fields; however, some patients may also regain stereopsis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The efficacy of strabismus surgery in adults: a review for primary care physicians|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=April 2011|volume=87|number=1026|pages=269–273|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2010.108670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific investigations on residual [[neuroplasticity|neural plasticity]] in adulthood now also include studies on the recovery of stereopsis. Now it is a matter of active scientific investigation under which conditions and to which degree binocular fusion and stereo vision can be acquired in adulthood, especially if the person is not known to have had any preceding experience of stereo vision, and how outcomes may depend on the patient's history of therapeutic interventions.

== Examples and case studies ==
[[File:9.13.09OliverSacksByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Sacks]] was the first to make the story of Susan Barry, whom he nicknamed "Stereo Sue", known to the general public.]]
Stereopsis recovery has been reported to have occurred in a few adults as a result of either medical treatments including [[strabismus surgery]] and [[vision therapy]], or spontaneously after a stereoscopic [[3D cinema]] experience.

=== Personal reports in ''Fixing my Gaze'' ===
The most renowned case of regained stereopsis is that of neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]], who had had alternating [[infantile esotropia]] with [[diplopia]], but no amblyopia, underwent three [[Strabismus surgery|surgical corrections]] in childhood without achieving binocular vision at the time, and recovered from stereoblindness in adult age after [[vision therapy]] with optometrist Theresa Ruggiero. Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]].&lt;ref name="sacks-2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=Oliver Sacks|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/19/060619fa_fact_sacks |title=Stereo Sue: Why two eyes are better than one|journal=The New Yorker|date=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[David H. Hubel]], winner of the 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Torsten Wiesel]] for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case.&lt;ref name="barry-2009-p138-140"&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', 2009, pages 138-140&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Barry published a book ''Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions'', reporting on her own and several other cases of stereopsis recovery.&lt;ref name="barry-2009"/&gt;

In her book ''Fixing my Gaze'', Susan Barry gives a detailed description of her surprise, elation and subsequent experiences when her stereo vision suddenly set in.

Hubel wrote of her book:
{{Quote box|“It has been widely thought that an adult, cross-eyed since infancy, could never acquire stereovision, but to everyone's surprise, Barry succeeded. In ''Fixing my Gaze'', she describes how wonderful it was to have, step-by-step, this new 3D world revealed to her. And as a neurobiologist she is able to discuss the science as an expert, in simple language.”|source=David H. Hubel, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine, John Franklin Enders Professor of Neurobiology, Emeritus, Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name="barry-2009"/&gt;}}

Her book includes reports of further persons who have had similar experiences with stereopsis recovery. Barry cites the personal experiences of several persons,&lt;!--Comment: the names ofpatients and their optometrists are purposely not listed here in Wikipedia out of respect of their privacy as ordinary people who may not wish to have their names retrieved by search engines, and the names make no difference to the message here--&gt; including a man who was an artist and described his experience of seeing with stereopsis as "that he could see one hundred more times [[negative space]]",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 123&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who had been amblyopic before seeing in 3D described how empty space now "looks and feels palpable, tangible—alive!",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who had been strabismic since age two and saw in 3D after taking vision therapy and stated that "The coolest thing is the feeling you get being “in the dimension”",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', page 124&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who felt quite alarmed at the experience of suddenly seeing roadside trees and signs [[looming]] towards her,&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; and two women who experienced an abrupt onset of stereo vision with a wide-angled view of the world, the first stating: "I was able to take in so much more of the room than I did before" and the second: "It was very dramatic as my [[peripheral vision]] suddenly filled in on both sides".&lt;ref name="barry-p129-131"&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 129-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Common to Barry and at least one person on whom she had reported is the finding that also their [[Visual space|mental representation of space]] changed after having acquired stereo vision: that even with one eye closed the feeling is to see "more" than seeing with one eye closed before recovering stereopsis.&lt;ref name="barry-p129-131"/&gt;

Apart from Barry, another formerly stereoblind adult whose acquired ability for stereopsis has received media attention is neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, professor of psychology and psychobiology at [[University of California Santa Cruz]], who had grown up nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie [[Hugo (movie)|Hugo]] with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability to see the world in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen Peck: [http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120719-awoken-from-a-2d-world/all How a movie changed one man’s vision forever], BBC Future, 19 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry B.

=== Post-surgical stereopsis ===
Certain conditions are known to be a prerequisite for stereo vision, for instance, that the amount of horizontal deviation, if any is present, needs to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David A.

Holmes|title=Maximum angle of horizontal strabismus consistent with true stereopsis|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume=8|number=1|date=February 2004|pages=28–34|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2003.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several studies it has been recognized that surgery to correct strabismus can have the effect of improving binocular function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John D.

Among the investigations into post-surgical stereopsis is a publication of 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal strabismus for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or stereopsis, with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, stereopsis was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of stereopsis and stereoacuity being uncorrelated to the number of years the deviation had persisted.&lt;ref name="kim-etal-2005"/&gt; A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on stereopsis recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all those patients who had had congenital or early-onset strabismus with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone strabismus surgery in the years 1997–1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6–30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with [[Bagolini Striated Glasses Test|Bagolini striated glasses]], 39% with Titmus test, 33% with [[Worth 4 dot test|Worth 4-dot]] test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 [[Second of arc|sec of arc]] of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of stereopsis can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism.&lt;ref name="gharabaghi-azadeh-2006"/&gt; Another study  found that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and stereopsis by means of surgical alignment.&lt;ref name="fatima-etal-2009"/&gt;

In contrast, in a study in which a group of 17 adults and older children of at least 8 years of age, all of whom received strabismus surgery and post-operative evaluation after long-standing untreated [[infantile esotropia]], most showed binocular fusion when tested with Bagolini lenses and an increased [[visual field]], but none demonstrated stereo fusion or stereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthony David Neil Murray|author2=Jane Orpen|author3=Carolyn Calcutt|title=Changes in the functional binocular status of older children and adults with previously untreated infantile esotropia following late surgical realignment|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume=11|number=2|date=April 2007|pages=125–130|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2006.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stereoacuity]] is limited by the [[visual acuity]] of the eyes, and in particular by the visual acuity of the weaker eye. That is, the more a patient's vision of any one of the two eyes is degraded compared to the 20/20 vision standard, the lower are the prospects of improving or re-gaining stereo vision, unless visual acuity itself were improved by other means. Strabismus surgery itself does not improve visual acuity.

=== Stereopsis following training procedures ===
[[Eye exercises|Orthoptic exercises]] have proven to be effective for reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating [[exophoria]] by improving the near-point convergence of the eyes that is necessary for binocular fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Aziz|author2=M. Cleary|author3=H.K. Stewart|author4=C.R. Weir|title=Are orthoptic exercises an effective treatment for convergence and fusion deficiencies?|journal=Strabismus|date=December 2006|volume=14|number=|pages=183–189|pmid=17162439|doi=10.1080/09273970601026185|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments on monkeys, published 2007, revealed improvements in stereoacuity in monkeys who, after having been raised with binocular deptivation through prisms for the first two years, were exposed to extensive psychophysical training. Their stereo vision recovered in part, but remained far more limited than that of normally raised monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Nakatsuka|title=Effects of Perceptual Learning on Local Stereopsis and Neuronal Responses of V1 and V2 in Prism-Reared Monkeys|journal=AJP: Journal of Neurophysiology|date=April 2007|volume=97|number=4|pages=2612–2626|doi=10.1152/jn.01001.2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] have stated that [[perceptual learning]] appears to play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dennis M. Levi|title=Perceptual learning in adults with amblyopia: A reevaluation of critical periods in human vision|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=46|number=3|pages=222–232|date=April 2005|doi=10.1002/dev.20050}}&lt;/ref&gt; One investigation, published 2011, reported on a study on human stereopsis recovery using [[perceptual learning]] which was inspired by Barry's work. In this study, a small number of stereoblind subjects who had initially been stereoblind or stereoanomalous recovered stereopsis using perceptual learning exercises. Alongside the scientific assessment of the extent of recovery, also the subjective outcomes are described: "After achieving stereopsis, our observers reported that the depth “popped out,” which they found very helpful and joyful in their everyday life. The anisometropic observer GD noticed “a surge in depth” one day when shopping in a supermarket. While playing table tennis, she feels that she is able to track a ping-pong ball more accurately and therefore can play better. Strabismic observer AB is more confident now when walking down stairs because she can judge the depth of the steps better. Strabismics AB, DP, and LR, are able to enjoy 3D movies for the first time, and strabismic GJ finds it easier to catch a fly ball while playing baseball."&lt;ref name="ding-levi-2011a"/&gt; In a follow-up study, the authors of this study pointed out that the stereopsis that was recovered following perceptual learning was more limited in resolution and precision compared to normal subjects' stereopsis.&lt;ref name="ding-levi-2011b"/&gt; [[Dennis M. Levi]] was awarded the 2011 Charles F. Prentice Medal of the [[American Academy of Optometry]] for this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaopt.org/About/Prentice Charles F.

[[File:Emacs Tetris vector based detail.svg|upright|thumb|[[Tetris]] is a popular video game from the 1980s. A modified version of the game (not shown here) has been used for dichoptic training.]]
There have been several attempts to make use of modern technology for enhanced binocular eye training, in particular for treating [[amblyopia]] and [[Suppression (eye)|interocular suppression]]. In some cases these modern techniques have improved patients' stereoacuity. Very early technology-enhanced vision therapy efforts have included the [[cheiroscope]], which is a [[haploscope]] in which left- and or right-eye images can be blended into view over a drawing pad, and the subject may be given a task such as to reproduce a line image presented to one eye. However, historically these approaches were not developed much further and they were not put to widespread use. Recent systems are based on [[dichoptic presentation]] of the elements of a [[video game]] or [[virtual reality]] such that each eye receives different signals of the virtual world that the player's brain must combine in order to play successfully.

One of the earliest systems of this kind has been proposed by a research group in the [[University of Nottingham]] with the aim of treating amblyopia, using virtual reality masks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/WO2003092482A1?hl=en Patent WO2003092482 A1 Ocular display apparatus for assessment and measurement of and for treatment of ocular disorders, and methods therefor], priority date 4 May 2002, publication date 13 November 2003, Isabel Ash et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eastgate-etal-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eastgate RM, Griffiths GD, Waddingham PE, Moody AD, Butler TK, Cobb SV, Comaish IF, Haworth SM, Gregson RM, Ash IM, Brown SM |title=Modified virtual reality technology for treatment of amblyopia |journal=Eye (London, England) |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=370–4 | date=March  2006 |pmid=15832182 |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6701882 |url= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|author=Gareth Mitchell|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4849244.stm|journal=BBC News|title=Video games tackle 'lazy eye'|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or commercially available [[Active shutter 3D system|3D shutter glasses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

Another system of dichoptic presentation for binocular vision therapy has been proposed by researchers of the Research Institute of the [[McGill University]] Health Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/WO2009053917A1?hl=en Patent WO 2009053917 A1 Binocular vision assessment and/or therapy], priority date 23 October 2007, publication date 30 April 2009, Robert F.

Clinical supervision of such procedures is required to ensure that double vision does not occur. Most of the patients who underwent this treatment gained improved visual acuity of the weaker eye, and some also showed increased stereoacuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Black JM, Hess RF, Cooperstock JR, To L, Thompson B |title=The measurement and treatment of suppression in amblyopia |journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|volume= |issue=70 |pages=e3927 |year=2012 |pmid=23271400 |pmc=3575204 |doi=10.3791/3927 |url= |issn=}} (with video clip explaining the procedure)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study performed at the same institute showed that dichoptic training can be more effective in adults than the more conventional amblyopia treatment of an [[eye patch]]. For this investigation, 18 adults played the game Tetris for one hour each day, half of the group wearing eye patches and the other half playing a dichoptic version of the game. After two weeks, the group who played dichoptically showed a significant improvement of vision in the weaker eye and in stereopsis acuity; the eye patch group had moderate improvements, which increased substantially after they, too, were given the dichoptic training afterwards.&lt;ref name="li-etal-2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jinrong Li|author2=Benjamin Thompson|author3=Daming Deng|author4=Lily Y.L.

Health insurances always review therapies in terms of [[Clinical governance#Clinical effectiveness|clinical effectiveness]] in view of existing scientific literature, benefit, risk and cost. Even if individual cases of recovery exist, a treatment is only considered effective under this point of view if there is sufficient likelihood that it will predictably improve outcomes.

In this context, medical coverage policy of the global health services organization [[Cigna]] "does not cover [[vision therapy]], [[Optometry|optometric]] [[Vision training|training]], [[eye exercises]] or [[orthoptics]] because they are considered experimental, investigational or unproven for any indication including the management of visual disorders and learning disabilities" based on a bibliographic review published by Cigna which concludes that "insufficient evidence exists in the published, [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] literature to conclude that vision therapy is effective for the treatment of any of the strabismic disorders except preoperative [[prism]] adaptation for acquired esotropia".&lt;ref&gt;[https://cignaforhcp.cigna.com/public/content/pdf/coveragePolicies/medical/mm_0221_coveragepositioncriteria_vision_therapy_orthoptics.pdf Cigna Medical Coverage Policy], Coverage policy number 0221, effective 15 November 2012, for review 15 November 2013 (downloaded 20 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the U.S. [[managed health care]] company [[Aetna]] offers vision therapy only in contracts with [[Health insurance in the United States#Supplemental coverage|supplemental coverage]] and limits its prescriptions to a number of conditions that are explicitly specified in a list of vision disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/400_499/0489.html Clinical policy bulletins: Vision therapy], Number 0489, 4 June 2013, for review 13 June 2013 (downloaded 21 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Why Am I?: The Science of Us''''' (also known as '''''Predict My Future: The Science of Us''''') is a 2016 New Zealand documentary series about the [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study]], a [[longitudinal study|long-running]] [[cohort study]] following 1037 people born in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand during 1972 and 1973. The study revealed the result of the combined effects of hereditary (genes) and environment (upbringing) on how people turn out.

The series of four sixty minute episodes was made by Razor Films of [[Auckland]], New Zealand, and screened on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]] from 31 May to 21 June 2016, with all four episodes available online on TVNZ On Demand.
