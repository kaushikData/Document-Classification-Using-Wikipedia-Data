      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3749">The '''Ali{{okina}}i nui of Kaua{{okina}}i''' was the sovereign [[king]] or [[queen regnant|queen]] of the islands of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] and [[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]].

== Overview ==
The monarchs of Kaua{{okina}}i, like those of the other [[Hawaiian islands]], claim descent from [[Wākea]] and his wife Papa. [[Nanaulu]], a descendant in the fourteenth generation from Wakea, was the ancestor of [[Moikeha]] but his dynasty was supplanted after two generations. The second, or Puna dynasty was established by [[Laamaikahiki]], eleventh in descent from Puna who was twenty-fourth in descent from Wakea. Of course, every ''ali{{okina}}i'' lineage is ancient, but the northern kingdoms produced the great bloodlines that everyone wanted to graft into, including [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha]]. Theirs is the "bluest blood", and the kingdoms they created, while very much like the kingdoms that Kamehameha’s grandparents and parents created, had a slightly different culture. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pacificworlds.com/nuuanu/native/native1.cfm |title=Nu'uanu, O'ahu - A Native Place: Old O'ahu |author=Jim Bartels |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-10-30 |publisher=Pacific Worlds web site }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The last ''Ali{{okina}}i nui'' of Kaua{{okina}}i of the old uninterrupted line of Puna was [[Kawelo'a'maihunali'i]]. After his death the kingship of Kaua{{okina}}i fell on [[Kualii]] of [[Oahu]], a cousin of Kaweloa'maihunali'i.

In 1810, King [[Kaumualii|Kaumuali{{okina}}i]], ceded his kingdom to King [[Kamehameha I|Kamehameha I of Hawaii]], in an effort to avoid bloodshed. Thereafter, he ruled it as a [[Vassal state]], until kidnapped by King [[Kamehameha II]] and taken to [[Honolulu]] in 1821. After his death in 1824, his son [[Humehume|George Kaumuali{{okina}}i]] took back his birth name Humehume and attempted to re-establish an independent on Kaua{{okina}}i, but was also eventually captured and taken to Honolulu. Ironically, any claim to the crown of the Hawaiian islands now rests with Kaumualii's heirs, the [[House of Kawānanakoa]], after the death of the [[House of Kamehameha]] and [[House of Kalākaua]].

'''Ambrose Kanoeali‘i''' or '''Ambrose Kanewali‘i Hutchison''' ({{circa|1856}} – July 17, 1932) was a long time [[Native Hawaiian]] resident of the [[leper settlement]] of [[Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and National Historical Park|Kalaupapa]] on the island of [[Molokai|Molokaʻi]] who resided there for fifty-three years from 1879 to his death in 1932. During his residence, he assumed a prominent leadership role in the patient community and served as ''luna'' or resident superintendent of Kalaupapa from 1884 to 1897.{{sfn|Moblo|1999|pages=58–63}}

==Early life==
He was born in Honomāʻele, [[Hana, Hawaii|Hāna]], [[Maui]], in 1856, the son of [[Ferdinand William Hutchison]] and Maria or Malie Moa, a [[Native Hawaiian]] woman.{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=101–103}}{{sfn|Moblo|1999|page=58}}&lt;ref&gt;Their surname of his father is often misspelled as Hutchinson. ({{harvnb|Tayman|2010|page=333}})&lt;/ref&gt; His father, originally from [[Edinburgh]], was an influential politician during the reign of King [[Kamehameha V]] and served as president of the Board of Health during the early development and management of the leper settlement of [[Kalaupapa]].{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=51–53}} His mother died when he was young while his father left Maui for [[Honolulu]] to pursue a political career, leaving Ambrose and his siblings William and Christina in the care of their mother's relatives.{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=119–120}}

Hutchison was given at one month old to be raised by his mother's sister who was a ''[[kahuna]]'' known for herbal cures. He wrote, in later life, that he may have contracted [[leprosy]] from a man "with large ears and bloated face, swollen hands and feet", who his aunt had treated. Another possible source was a vaccination using the lymph fluid from the arm of another boy.{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=101–103}} From an early age, Hutchison was sent to boarding school in Honolulu under the auspices of the [[Church of Hawaii|Anglican]] Archdeacon George Mason. At this time, the first symptoms of leprosy developed in 1868 when he was twelve years old and developed slowly until he became an adult.{{sfn|Moblo|1999|page=58}}{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=51–53}}

His father and his sister Christina left Hawaii for [[Australia]] in 1875. In later life, Hutchison never mentioned his father by name possibly to shield him from the [[leprosy stigma|stigma of being related to a leper]].{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=101–103}}{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=119–120}}

==Life at Kalaupapa==
In December 1878, Hutchison was arrested and sent to Honolulu's Kalihi Hospital for examination. On January 5, 1879, he was sent to the [[leper settlement]] of [[Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and National Historical Park|Kalaupapa]] on the island of [[Molokai|Molokaʻi]]. He worked as chief butcher and beef dispenser and head storekeeper of the Kalawao store until 1884 when he was appointed as resident superintendent succeeding [[Clayton Strawn]] and [[Rudolph Wilhelm Meyer]].{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=101–103}}{{sfn|Moblo|1999|pages=58–63}} Hutchison became the first government appointed superintendent of Native Hawaiian descent. Although Hawaiians had held the positions as ''luna'' or resident superintendent prior to 1884, they were all subordinate to Meyer and not trusted with financial affairs.{{sfn|Moblo|1999|page=28}} From 1884 to 1890, he served alone in this post with the continued support of Meyer. Between 1890 and 1892, he served as assistant superintendent with Maui sheriff Thomas Evans and his successor former head of Honolulu police William Tell. After 1892, Hutchison was reappointed as acting superintendent, a position he held until replaced by Board of Health official C. B. Reynolds after the death of his main supporter Rudolph Meyer in 1897.{{sfn|Moblo|1999|pages=62–63}}{{sfn|Inglis|2013|pages=123–124}}{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=256–258}}
Hutchison was highly regarded by the Native Hawaiian patient community and the Board of Health in Honolulu. According to resident physician Dr. Arthur Albert St. M. Mouritz, he "displayed marked ability and highly creditable administrative powers for a man so young."{{sfn|Moblo|1999|pages=58–63}}{{sfn|Mouritz|1916|page=203}} In 1898, Hutchison and his wife along with more than seven hundred people at Kalaupapa signed the famous [[Kūʻē Petitions]] against the annexation of Hawaii to the United States.{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=258–263}}

[[File:Father Damien, photograph by William Brigham.jpg|thumb|Hutchison developed a close friendship with [[Father Damien]]]]
During his residency on Kalaupapa, Hutchison worked with [[Father Damien]], whom he had met on his arrival in 1879, and became one of the closest friend of the Catholic priest. Dr. Mouritz described the partnership of the two men and how they greeted new arrivals "steaming hot coffee and warm food". Their friendship lasted until the latter's death in 1889 and Hutchison was possibly one of the eight pallbearers at his funeral.{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=107–109, 112–113}} Hutchison noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was nothing supernatural about Father Damien. He was a vigorous, forceful and impellent man with a big kindly heart in the prime of life and a jack of all trades, carpenter, mason, baker, farmer, medico and nurse, grave digger ... He was that type of man of action, bull headed, strong will high minded ... of determined tenacity to attain results of his aspiration, but of kindly disposition toward all who came into contact with him ... I loved to work with him in his crusade to put down evil for his quality of open heartedness. There was no hypocrisy about him.{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=112}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around 1930, Hutchison started writing ''In Memory of Reverend Father Damien J. De Veuster and Other Priests Who Have Labored in the Leper Settlement of Kalawao, Molokaʻi`'', his personal account of Father Damien's work on the island and a memoir of his own fifty-three year of experience living on Kalaupapa. It was discovered unpublished at the time of his death. Hutchison died on July 17, 1932, at the age of seventy-six, from an attack of influenza pneumonia. After his death, the unfinished manuscript was sent to the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary|Sacred Hearts]] Archives in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]] for storage. Portions of the memoirs, an unfinished will and his other writings are stored at the Hawaii State Archives.{{sfn|Law|2012|page=421}}{{sfn|Inglis|2013|page=6}} According to historian Anwei Skinsnes Law, "despite all his accomplishments and influence, Ambrose Hutchison had been largely left out of his own history."{{sfn|Law|2012|pages=xix–xx}}

==Personal life==
Hutchison married Mary Kaiakonui, a local resident of Kalaupapa, in 1881, in a ceremony blessed by Father Damien. According to historian John Tayman, Mary may had also contracted leprosy and they had a daughter who did not suffer the same infection as her parents. Other sources claimed they were childless. They lived at Hutchison's house, in a part of the settlement called [[Makanalua]]. Kaiakonui cared for her husband as his ''mea kōkua'' (caregiver) until her death on May 16, 1905, at the age of forty-seven. She was buried in the Catholic section of Papaloa Cemetery and a white bronze grave monuments marks her final resting place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Law|2012|page=414}}; {{harvnb|Inglis|2013|page=165}}; {{harvnb|Tayman|2010|page=150}}; {{cite web|title=100 Years, 100 Patients: HUTCHISON, MARY KAIAKONUI|work=Kalaupapa National Historical Park|url=https://www.facebook.com/KALA.NPS/photos/pcb.977065165680322/977065062346999/?type=3|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother's descendants believe that he could be buried next to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Monica Bacon, Milton Hutchison, Moana Hutchison, The Family of Ambrose Hutchison|work=Ka ‘Ohana O Kalaupapa|date=Fall 2008|volume=2|issue=1|page=9|url=http://www.kalaupapaohana.org/Newsletters/Kalaupapa_News_1008.pdf|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of his family were present at the 2009 canonization of Father Damien in Rome.{{sfn|Law|2012|page=423}}

In his incomplete will, Hutchison expressed his love for his mother, his wife and the dwindling Hawaiian race:{{sfn|Law|2012|page=421}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the love and affection I hold for my mother, Maria Mo-a, and Maria Kaiakonui, my wife (deceased), who were of the pure Hawaiian aboriginal ancestry, from whom sprung from and hold dear and my heart longing desire to perpetuate their race from extinction which forecasting shadow of time forbode their doom, which only the power of a mercifull and all loving God can stay, from the evident fate which await them and leaving firm faith in the love and mercy of God, who alone can save and perpetuate and multiply from being effaced from the land, which, by His grace he gave to their forefathers and foremothers and their descendants as a heritage forever and to this end and purpose, I consecrate my worldly estate both real, personal or mixed.{{sfn|Moblo|1999|page=61}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Andreas Wilhelm Schwarzlose''' (31 July 1867–1936) was a German (originally [[Prussia]]n) firearm designer who is best known for designing a blowback-operated machine gun.

==Early life==
Schwarzlose was bom in the Berlin suburb of [[Charlottenburg]], and served as an artilleryman and armorer in the Austro-Hungarian army. He graduated from the National Ordnance College and designed his first pistol in 1892, although it never saw production. In 1897, he opened an arms factory in Berlin which he operated until 1919 when it was shut down by the Allied Disarmament Commission.&lt;ref name="Farwell2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farwell|first=Byron|title=The Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-century Land Warfare: An Illustrated World View|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m-XpP_pdANcC&amp;pg=PA737|year=2001|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-04770-7|page=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ange-Élisabeth-Louis-Antoine Bonnier d'Alco''' (1750 in [[Montpellier]]{{snd}}28 April 1799) was a [[French people|French]] [[diplomat]] during the [[French Revolution]].

A representative of [[Hérault]] in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] and of the [[National Convention]], he generally voted with the majority. Bonnier voted for the execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].  He was a friend of [[Jean-François Rewbell]] and therefore was entrusted with various diplomatic missions, including to [[Lille]] to negotiate with [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]] in October 1797 and to [[Rastadt]] in 1799 to negotiate with the congress. Negotiations at the latter went slowly and on 28 April, Bonnier, [[Claude Roberjot]] and [[Jean Debry]] were attacked by Hungarian [[hussar]]s as they left the town, probably in an attempt to steal their papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bonnier, Ange Elisabeth Louis Antoine|volume=4|page=212}} This cites Huefer, ''Der Rastadtergesandtenmord'' (Bonn, 1896).&lt;/ref&gt; Debry was wounded, but Bonnier and Roberjot were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Chalamel, Désiré Lacroix: ''Album du Centenaire, les Grands hommes et les grands faits de la Révolution Française (1789–1804)''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Villareal''' (January 17, 1880 — February 12, 1945) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[jurist]] who served as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]].

==Profile==

Born in [[Pampanga]], Villa-Real was forced to interrupt his schooling at age 15 in order to work following the death of his father. In 1895, he travelled to [[Japan]] and unsuccessfully sought to enlist in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. After also failing to enlist in the [[French Foreign Legion]] in [[Algeria]], Villa-Real finally enrolled in a Tokyo university, where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Justices of the Supreme Court, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to the [[United States]] before finally returning to the [[Philippines]] in 1904.

Upon his return to the Philippines, Villa-Real passed the civil service examinations, allowing him to work as an [[interpreter]] and [[translation|translator]] with the Bureau of Justice. He also studied law, and passed the bar examinations in 1909. Villa-Real continued working at the Bureau of Justice, this time as an attorney, until he was appointed as a trial court judge in 1916. He returned to the Bureau of Justice in 1921, this time as attorney-general from 1921 to 1925.

Attorney-general Villa-Real was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] on June 26, 1925, filling the vacancy caused by the elevation of Justice [[Ramon Avanceña]] to the Chief Justiceship. Villa-Real served on the Court for the next 15 years, until his retirement on June 5, 1940. Among his more notable opinions were in ''People v. De Guzman'', [[Case citation#The Philippines|51 Phil. 105 (1927)]], a leading case on [[rape]], as well as the original decision in ''Ang Tibay v. CIR'', which would be reversed after his retirement through a famous decision by Justice [[Jose P. Laurel]].

==Death==

Villa-real was one of 2 Supreme Court Justices who were executed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during the [[Battle for the Liberation of Manila|Battle of Manila]] in 1945. On February 12, Japanese soldiers stormed the Pax Court complex in [[Pasay City|Pasay]], a housing compound owned and resided in by Villa-real. 19 people, including Villa-Real and his wife Paz, were herded into a living room, bound, then made to kneel. A grenade was hurled at the group followed by gunfire, leaving 15 dead, including Villa-Real and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;By Sword and by Fire, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Just two days earlier, Villa-Real's former colleague on the Court, [[Anacleto Diaz]], had been executed by the Japanese along Taft Avenue in [[Ermita, Manila]].

'''Austin Robert Carlile''' (born September 27, 1987) is an American musician and baseball coach from [[Pensacola, Florida]]. He is the former lead vocalist of [[Attack Attack!]] and [[Of Mice &amp; Men (band)|Of Mice &amp; Men]]. After leaving Of Mice &amp; Men, he went to coach youth baseball in [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;http://loudwire.com/of-mice-and-men-austin-carlile-coaching-baseball-costa-rica/&lt;/ref&gt; Austin played sports in high school but eventually, due to having to require multiple surgeries from [[Marfan syndrome]] as a teenager, he turned to music as an interest. In late 2016, Carlile departed from Of Mice &amp; Men due to Marfan Syndrome and is currently residing in [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]], [[Costa Rica]].

== Musical career ==

=== Attack Attack! (2006–2008) ===
Carlile formed Attack Attack! (originally called Ambiance) around 2006 when Johnny Franck, Andrew Whiting, Nick White, and Andrew Wetzel met Carlile while playing in local high school bands.&lt;ref name="mtv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/artists/attack-attack-1/biography/|title = Attack Attack!

On October 8, 2009, the same day Carlile announced that he was no longer a part of Attack Attack!, he officially announced the formation of his new project, [[Of Mice &amp; Men (band)|Of Mice &amp; Men]], with Jaxin Hall (bassist). Their first release was "Seven Thousand Miles for What?". They also did a cover of [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", then soon after released "No Really, It's Fine". Soon after, Austin and Jaxin started to gather up the other members of the band. The band recruited several members of already-existing bands, such as Phil Manansala (lead guitarist) from [[A Static Lullaby]], and Tino Arteaga (drummer) from [[Lower Definition]].&lt;ref name=myspace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=89414051&amp;blogId=443354375|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20140907052111/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=89414051&amp;blogId=443354375|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 7, 2014|title=No, I am not in ATTACK ATTACK anymore – Austin Carlile's MySpace Blog|last=Carlile|first=Austin|date=November 18, 2009|publisher=MySpace|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their self-titled debut album was officially announced to be released on February 23, 2010, but was delayed until March 9 for finishes on production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2009/12/of-mice-and-men-announce-debut-album.html|title=Alter The Press!: Of Mice and Men Announce Debut Album Release Date|last=Reid|first=Sean|publisher=Alter the Press!|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Austin was unable to tour with Of Mice &amp; Men, because he needed to have major heart surgery, and his health prevented him from touring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Tim|date=2010-04-04|title=Austin Carlile: "I quit Of Mice &amp; Men"|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/austin_carlile_i_quit_of_mice_men|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purevolume.com/news/of-mice-and-men-austin-carlile-the-flood-interview|title=The PV Q&amp;A: Of Mice &amp; Men's Austin Carlile Talks Work Ethic &amp; Drive: 'I don't think anything worth having should come free or should come easily'|last=Bayer|first=Jonah|date=2012-12-27|website=[[PureVolume]]|access-date=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blanklove.tumblr.com/post/485922300/when-i-was-18-years-old-a-couple-of-months-after|title=When I was 18 years old, a couple of months after...|date=2010-03-30|website=Of Mice &amp; Men Appreciation|access-date=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blanklove.tumblr.com/post/674827448/visuals-from-surgery|title=Visuals from Surgery|date=2010-06-07|website=Of Mice &amp; Men Appreciation|access-date=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Roush]] from [[Sky Eats Airplane]] served as the tour replacement for Austin.

In September 2010, shortly after the departure of [[Craig Owens (vocalist)|Craig Owens]] of [[Chiodos]], rumors that Carlile would replace him circulated quickly, but were denied when [[Brandon Bolmer]] was announced as vocalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahoney |first=Josh |title=Chiodos' New Vocalist...? – Damaged Press |url=http://www.damagedpress.com/newmusic/2010/02/chiodos-new-vocalist/ |publisher=Damaged Press |accessdate=October 6, 2010 |date=February 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220090502/http://www.damagedpress.com/newmusic/2010/02/chiodos-new-vocalist/ |archivedate=February 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fake [[Twitter|tweet]] from Carlile's account was produced making it seem that Carlile would be joining Chiodos as vocalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AUSTIN CARLILE CONFIRMED AS NEW CHIODOS VOCALIST|url=http://strikegently.com/2009/09/26/austin-carlile-confirmed-as-new-chiodos-vocalist/|publisher=Strike Gently|accessdate=October 6, 2010|date=September 26, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155546/http://strikegently.com/2009/09/austin-carlile-confirmed-as-new-chiodos-vocalist/|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlile re-joined the band on January 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karan|first=Tim|title=Alt Press Exclusive: Austin Carlile back in Of Mice &amp; Men|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_austin_carlile_back_in_of_mice_men/|publisher=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|accessdate=January 4, 2011|date=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, after the death of [[Suicide Silence]] singer [[Mitch Lucker]], Carlile appeared on ''[[Ending is the Beginning: The Mitch Lucker Memorial Show]]'' singing the song O.C.D.

In the early morning of March 30, 2013, Carlile was arrested in Bowling Green, Ohio with drum technician Loniel Robinson II, he was later charged with felonious assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zarrillo|first=Zack|url=http://propertyofzack.com/post/46848835387/poz-exclusive-austin-carlile-arrested-for-felonious|title=POZ Exclusive: Austin Carlile Arrested For Felonious Assault; Being Released From Jail Today|publisher=PropertyOfZack|date=April 1, 2013|accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band missed two shows on the "Right Back at It Again" tour with [[A Day to Remember]] and [[Chunk!

He was fined $1,000 plus court expenses, although $800 of the fine was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shotwell|first=James|title=Exclusive: Austin Carlie Found Guilty of Misdemeanor Assault|url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2013/04/29/exclusive-austin-carlile-found-guilty-of-misdemeanor-assault/|publisher=Spin Music, a division of SpinMedia|accessdate=April 18, 2014|date=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the band pulled out in the midst of a European tour so that Carlile could seek medical treatment after experiencing pain during a show in Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Trendell|first=Andrew|title=Of Mice &amp; Men cancel the rest of their tour due to illness|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/nme-2602-1189616|publisher=[[NME]]|date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late November, Carlile elaborated in a series of tweets that, as a sufferer of [[Marfan syndrome]], he wouldn't "get better" and that he had undergone multiple surgeries "just so I can function/live."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Trendell|first=Andrew|title=Of Mice and Men’s Austin Carlile’s devastating message to fans: ‘I won’t get better’|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/mice-men-frontman-austin-carliles-devastating-message-fans-wont-get-better-1884707|publisher=[[NME]]|date= December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2016, Austin Carlile posted on his Instagram and Twitter an open letter stating that he's leaving the band to focus on healing, moving on, and getting better after settling in [[Costa Rica]], saying "...with the closing of one door, another will open." He also said that he "will not stop playing music" and that he is "still able to sing and I'm hungry for what is next to come even though I have no idea what that may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BOqLY-0gxiL/?taken-by=austincarlile|title=Instagram photo by Austin Carlile • Dec 30, 2016 at 11:03pm UTC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed on February 17, 2017 that one of the other reasons Carlile had left the band was because he wasn't allowed to write what he wanted on the next record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/austin_carlile_reveals_part_of_the_reason_behind_his_of_mice_men_exit&lt;/ref&gt; In a reply to an Instagram comment&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BQWl0uHAZpN/&lt;/ref&gt; about whether or not he would be working with Of Mice &amp; Men in the future, he said "No I will no longer be writing with them, one of the reasons I left. They weren't going to let me write what I wanted on next record. That's not gonna happen. I will write what I want despite what that means giving up."

In August 2018, different rumors spread about Austin Carlile saying he was going to join [[Linkin Park]]. The singer, through a post on Twitter, denied these rumors and confirmed that he's currently working on a new project.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/austincarlile/status/1034604277107314688?s=19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brutus''', or '''Brute of Troy''', is a legendary descendant of the [[Troy|Trojan]] hero [[Aeneas]], known in medieval British history as the [[eponymous]] founder and first king of [[Greater Britain|Britain]]. This legend first appears in the ''[[Historia Britonum]]'', an anonymous 9th-century historical compilation to which commentary was added by [[Nennius]], but is best known from the account given by the 12th-century chronicler [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. Notwithstanding this, he is not mentioned in any [[Classics|classical]] text and cannot be considered to be historical.

==''Historia Britonum''==
The ''Historia Britonum'' states that "The island of Britain derives its name from Brutus, a Roman consul" who conquered [[Hispania|Spain]]. This is ultimately derived from [[Isidore of Seville]]'s popular 7th-century work ''[[Etymologiae]]'', in which it was speculated that Britain was named after the Roman general [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]], who pacified [[Further Spain]] in 138 BC. A more detailed story, set before the foundation of Rome, follows, in which Brutus is the grandson or great grandson of Aeneas — a legend that blends Isidore's spurious etymology with the Christian, pseudo-historical, "[[Table of Nations|Frankish Table of Nations]]" tradition that emerged in the early medieval European scholarly world (actually of 6th century AD Byzantine origin, and not Frankish, according to historian [[Walter Goffart]])&lt;ref&gt;Goffart, Walter, "The Supposedly 'Frankish' Table of Nations: An Edition and Study, Frühmittelalterliche Studies 17, 1983, pp. 98–130.&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to trace the peoples of the known world (as well as legendary figures, such as the Trojan house of Aeneas) back to Biblical ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, Thea , "Filling the Gap: Brutus in the Historia Brittonum, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle MS F, and Geoffrey of Monmouth", in: Dresvina, Juliana and Sparks, Nicholas (Eds.), The Medieval Chronicle VII, Rodopi, Amsterdam/New York, 2011, p. 85-102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, T. M., Wales and the Britons, 350-1064, Oxford, 2013, p. 439; 441; 454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wadden, Patrick, "The Frankish Table of Nations in Insular historiography", Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies 72 (Winter 2016), pp. 1–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus and Modern Scholarship (1937–1980)By Louis H. Feldman 1984,page 893&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Roman sources such as [[Livy]] and [[Virgil]], the ''Historia'' tells how Aeneas settled in Italy after the [[Trojan War]], and how his son [[Ascanius]] founded [[Alba Longa]], one of the precursors of Rome. Ascanius married, and his wife became pregnant. In a variant version, the father is Silvius, who is identified as either the second son of Aeneas, previously mentioned in the ''Historia'', or as the son of Ascanius. A magician, asked to predict the child's future, said it would be a boy and that he would be the bravest and most beloved in Italy. Enraged, Ascanius had the magician put to death. The mother died in childbirth.

The boy, named Brutus, later accidentally killed his father with an arrow and was banished from Italy. After wandering among the islands of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and through [[Gaul]], where he founded the city of [[Tours]], Brutus eventually came to Britain, named it after himself, and filled it with his descendants. His reign is synchronised to the time the High Priest [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]] was [[Biblical judges|judge]] in [[Land of Israel|Israel]], and when the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was taken by the [[Philistines]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Britonum'' [[Wikisource:History of the Britons#2.7|7]], [[Wikisource:History of the Britons#2.10|10-11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant version of the ''Historia Britonum'' makes Brutus the son of Ascanius's son [[Silvius (mythology)|Silvius]], and traces his [[Trojan Genealogy of Nennius|genealogy]] back to [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], son of [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1980, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Another chapter traces Brutus's [[Trojan Genealogy of Nennius|genealogy]] differently, making him the great-grandson of the legendary Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]], who was himself a son of Ascanius, and tracing his descent from Noah's son [[Japheth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Britonum'' [[Wikisource:History of the Britons#2.18|18]]&lt;/ref&gt; These Christianising traditions conflict with the classical Trojan genealogies, relating the Trojan royal family to [[Greek gods]].

Yet another Brutus, son of Hisicion, son of Alanus the first European, also traced back across many generations to Japheth, is referred to in the ''Historia Britonum''. This Brutus's brothers were Francus, Alamanus and Romanus, also ancestors of significant European nations.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Britonum'' [[Wikisource:History of the Britons#2.17|17-18]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Historia Regum Britanniae''==
Geoffrey of Monmouth's account tells much the same story, but in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 1#3|1.3–18]], [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 2#1|2.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, Brutus is explicitly the grandson, rather than son, of Ascanius; his father is Ascanius' son Silvius. The magician who predicts great things for the unborn Brutus also foretells he will kill both his parents. He does so, in the same manner described in the ''Historia Britonum'', and is banished. Travelling to Greece, he discovers a group of Trojans enslaved there. He becomes their leader, and after a series of battles they defeat the Greek king Pandrasus by attacking his camp at night after capturing the guards. He takes him hostage and forces him to let his people go. He is given Pandrasus's daughter Ignoge in marriage, and ships and provisions for the voyage, and sets sail.

The Trojans land on a deserted island and discover an abandoned temple to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. After performing the appropriate ritual, Brutus falls asleep in front of the goddess's statue and is given a vision of the land where he is destined to settle, an island in the western ocean inhabited only by a few giants.

After some adventures in north Africa and a close encounter with the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, Brutus discovers another group of exiled Trojans living on the shores of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], led by the prodigious warrior [[Corineus]]. In [[Gaul]], Corineus provokes a war with [[Goffarius Pictus]], king of [[Aquitaine]], after hunting in the king's forests without permission. Brutus's nephew Turonus dies in the fighting, and the city of [[Tours]] is founded where he is buried. The Trojans win most of their battles but are conscious that the Gauls have the advantage of numbers, so go back to their ships and sail for Britain, then called [[Albion]]. They land on "{{lang|la|Totonesium litus}}"—"the sea-coast of [[Totnes]]". They meet the giant descendants of [[Albion (mythology)|Albion]] and defeat them.

Brutus renames the island after himself and becomes its first king. Corineus becomes ruler of [[Cornwall]], which is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall is given a distinct identity predating England, Scotland or Wales. [[Cornishmen]] continued to regard themselves as descendants of Corineus until well into the early modern period.&lt;/ref&gt; They are harassed by the giants during a festival, but kill all of them but their leader, the largest giant [[Gogmagog (giant)|Goemagot]], who is saved for a wrestling match against Corineus. Corineus throws him over a cliff to his death. Brutus then founds a city on the banks of the [[River Thames]], which he calls Troia Nova, or [[Trinovantes|New Troy]]. The name is in time corrupted to [[Trinovantum]], and the city is later called [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;The name Trinovantum, supposedly derived from ''Troia Nova'', is derived from the [[Trinovantes]], a people of [[British Iron Age|Iron Age Britain]].&lt;/ref&gt; He creates laws for his people and rules for twenty-four years. After his death he is buried in Trinovantum, and the island is divided between his three sons: [[Locrinus]] ([[England]]), [[Albanactus]] ([[Scotland]]) and [[Kamber]] ([[Wales]]).

==Legacy==
[[Image:BrutusStoneTotnes.JPG|thumb|The Brutus Stone in [[Totnes]]]]
Early translations and adaptations of Geoffrey's ''Historia'', such as [[Wace]]'s [[Norman language|Norman French]] ''[[Roman de Brut]]'', [[Layamon]]'s [[Middle English]] ''[[Layamon's Brut|Brut]]'', were named after Brutus, and the word ''brut'' came to mean a chronicle of British history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|brut}} "A chronicle of British history from the mythical Brutus downward." Etymology: "= [[Middle Welsh|M.Welsh]] ''brut'', [[modern Welsh|mod.W.]] ''brud'', in the names of the Welsh chronicles of British history"&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of several [[Middle Welsh language|Middle Welsh]] adaptations was called the ''[[Brut y Brenhinedd]]'' ("Chronicle of the Kings"). ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]'' ("Chronicle of the Princes"), a major chronicle for the Welsh rulers from the 7th century to loss of independence, is a purely historical work containing no legendary material but the title reflects the influence of Geoffrey's work and, in one sense, can be seen as a "sequel" to it. Early chroniclers of Britain, such as [[Alfred of Beverley]], [[Nicholas Trivet]] and [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] began their histories of Britain with Brutus. The foundation myth of Brutus having settled in Britain was still considered as genuine history during the [[Early Modern Period]], for example ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]'' (1577) considers the Brutus myth to be factual.

The 18th-century English poet [[Hildebrand Jacob]] wrote an epic poem, ''Brutus the Trojan, Founder of the British Empire'', about him, following in the tradition of the Roman foundation epic the ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bullen|first=A. H.|title=Jacob, Hildebrand|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14568|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=23 January 2013|author2=Bridget Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brutus is an important character in the book series ''[[The Troy Game]]'' by [[Sara Douglass]].

Geoffrey's ''Historia'' says that Brutus and his followers landed at [[Totnes]] in [[Devon]]. A stone on Fore Street in Totnes, known as the "Brutus Stone", commemorates this.

'''Cleon Lewis Bryant''' (born March 28, 1956) is an [[African-American]] [[Baptist minister]] and former [[radio]] and [[television]] host based in his native [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]].

When he formerly resided in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], [[Texas]], Bryant was the president of the [[NAACP]] chapter there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/2011/10/23/leaders-with-ginni-thomas-rev-c-l-bryant/ Leaders with Ginni Thomas: Rev C. L. Bryant], ''Daily Caller'', 23 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
C. L. Bryant is the only child of the late Lewis C. Bryant, a [[World War II]] veteran, and the former Elnola Goode (1917-2005), a native of [[De Soto Parish, Louisiana|De Soto Parish]]. Both of his parents were long-time employee of the Shreveport Club at 410 Travis Street. They are interred at Carver Memorial Cemetery in Shreveport.&lt;ref name=elnolaobit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?age=gr&amp;GSln=Bryant&amp;GSfn=Elnola&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSst=20&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=1049|
|title=Elnola G. Bryant|publisher=Findagrave.com|accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first black children to attend Lake Shore Junior High School in Shreveport at the beginning of [[Segregation in the United States|school desegregation]] in the late 1960s. He graduated in 1974 from [[Fair Park High School]] in Shreveport, along with the [[Fox Sports]] announcer [[Tim Brando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classmates.com/people/Cleon-Bryant/542610411|title=Cleon Bryant (Class of 1974)|publisher=classmates.com|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant was subsequently educated at [[Louisiana State University in Shreveport]] and two defunct institutions, the [[historically black]] [[Bishop College]] in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]], [[Texas]] and the business school, [[Tampa College]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]]. He received a [[master of theology]] degree from Shreveport Bible College and was ordained into the ministry by the late Reverend [[E. Edward Jones]] of Shreveport, a [[civil rights]] activist who was from 1986 to 2003 the president of the black [[National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.]], and pastor for fifty-seven years of the Galilee Missionary Baptist Church in Shreveport. Bryant has spent nearly four decades in the ministry, including a missionary stint to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] section of [[South America]]. He has also worked for twenty-five years in the field of finance. His current church affiliation is the inter-denominational Word of God Ministries in Shreveport with pastor James A. McMenis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomworks.org/cl-bryant|title=C. L. Bryant|publisher=[[FreedomWorks]]|accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Bryant has served in several church positions, beginning in [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], Texas, where his struggling congregation received financial assistance from the late Shreveport philanthropist [[Virginia Shehee]], a former member of the [[Louisiana State Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;''The C. L. Bryant Show'', July 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his mother's death in 2005, Bryant was pastor of the Cedar Hill Baptist Church in [[Grand Cane, Louisiana|Grand Cane]] in DeSoto Parish south of Shreveport.&lt;ref name=elnolaobit/&gt;

His ''C. L. Bryant Show'' aired from 2015 to 2017 on weekday evenings from 5:30 to 7:30 Central Time over [[KEEL]] Radio in Shreveport. KEEL said that Bryant left the station to pursue other opportunities.

Bryant is a senior fellow at [[FreedomWorks]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which he has defended against allegations of [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/naacp-tea-party-civil-rights-group-considers-resolution/story?id=11144640&amp;page=2#.T3TEO9lc6So "Michelle Obama Rouses NAACP Before Vote Condemning 'Racist' Elements of Tea Party"], ABC News, 2 July 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Patten [http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/Blacks-Carson-West-Tea/2011/08/31/id/409354 "Blacks Call for Democrat Carson to Resign Over Tea Party 'Hanging' Slam"], Newsmax, 31 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Often at odds with [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]] leaders in the African-American community, Bryant in March 2012 criticized [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[Al Sharpton]] for their roles over protests stemming from the controversial [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]] in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=huff&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/new-york-posts-trayvon-martin_n_1383472.html?ref=new-york "New York Post's Trayvon Martin Front Page Calls Hooded Lawmakers 'Race Hustlers'], ''[[Huffington Post]],'' 03/27/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant is the founder of the group, "One Nation Back to God", which has a [[website]]. In 2012, he produced and released the independent [[film]] [[documentary]], ''[[Runaway Slave (film)|Runaway Slave]],'' "a movie about the race to free the Black community from the [[slavery]] of [[tyranny]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] policies." &lt;ref name=huff/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2205591/|title=Runaway Slave|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|date=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=R.J.|title=C.L.

On January 19, 2016, Bryant endorsed U.S. Senator [[Ted Cruz]] of Texas for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|Republican presidential nomination]].&lt;ref&gt;[[KEEL (AM)]] Radio, January 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He then endorsed the eventual nominee and election winner, President [[Donald Trump]] and defended Trump against allegations raised by his critics on the radio program.

==Personal life==
Bryant is wed to the former Jane Carline Pruitt. They live in [[Grand Cane, Louisiana]] and have four children and eleven grandchildren.

The couple formerly resided in Tampa, Florida; Mrs. Bryant previously lived in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[California]].

The term '''Cairo 52''' refers to the fifty-two men who were arrested on May 11, 2001, aboard a floating [[gay nightclub]] called the '''Queen Boat''', which was moored on the [[Nile]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="dalacoura1295"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalacoura|first1=Katerina|title=Homosexuality as cultural battleground in the Middle East: culture and postcolonial international theory|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=2014|volume=35|issue=7|pages=1295–1296|doi=10.1080/01436597.2014.926119}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ashraf.jpg|thumb|280px|Ashraf Zanati, one of the Cairo 52, who later fled to [[Vancouver, BC]], [[Canada]].]] --&gt;

==Charges==
Of fifty-two men arrested, fifty were charged with "habitual debauchery" and "obscene behaviour" under Article 9c of Law No. 10 of 1961 on the Combat of [[Prostitution]].  Another two were charged with "contempt of religion" under Article 98f of the Penal Code. All fifty-two men pleaded [[innocent]]. 
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Cairo 52.jpg|thumb|280px|left|The Cairo 52 in detention.]] --&gt;

==Treatment of Arrest==
According to the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]] (IGLHRC), the men were subjected to beatings and [[forensic]] examinations to "prove their homosexuality".  All 52 men were kept for twenty-two hours a day in two cramped cells with no beds.

==Trials==
[[Image:QueenBoat.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Queen Boat]]
The trials of the "Cairo 52" lasted five months and the defendants were vilified in the Egyptian [[News media|media]], which printed their real names and addresses, and branded them as agents against the State. The trials were condemned by international [[human rights]] organizations, members of [[US Congress]] and the [[United Nations]]. Lawyers for the defense argued that the cases should be dismissed on the grounds of [[false arrest]], improper arrest procedures, falsified evidence and police intimidation. During the trial, homosexuality was characterized as "un-Egyptian".&lt;ref name="dalacoura1295"/&gt;

On November 14, 2001, twenty-one of the men were convicted of the "habitual practice of debauchery," one man of "contempt for religion," and another, accused of being the "ringleader," was convicted of both charges and received the heaviest sentence, five years' [[penal labour|hard labour]].  A fifty-third man, a teenager, was tried in juvenile court and was sentenced to the maximum penalty of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of probation.

In May 2002, those convicted were released pending a second trial; both the guilty and not-guilty verdicts were overturned, provoking international outrage.  In July 2002, fifty of the men began a second trial (the other two men had been convicted of contempt for religion, and their sentences were upheld).  This trial, held at Qasr-al-Nil Misdemeanors Court in Cairo and presided over by Judge Abdel Karim, the same judge who had presided over the first trial, lasted only fifteen minutes, ending when Karim [[recusal|recused]] himself.  The trial was then moved to September.  The retrial ended in March, 2003.  Twenty-one men were handed three-year jail sentences and twenty-nine were acquitted.

==Cairo 52 in the media==
The Cairo 52 were featured in a documentary by After Stonewall Productions, narrated by [[Janeane Garofalo]], entitled ''[[Dangerous Living: Coming Out in the Developing World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080214183007/http://www.afterstonewall.com/press.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of [[Maher Sabry]]'s unapologetic film ''[[All My Life (2008 film)|Toul Omry]]'' (''All My Life'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334617/#]&lt;/ref&gt;  details the lives of gay men in Egypt against the backdrop of the Cairo 52 and the notorious Queen Boat arrests. One of the characters in the film "Kareem" is almost arrested in the police raid on the floating discothèque. The news of the arrests and the follow-up in the media and newspapers is discussed by the characters throughout the film. One of the Cairo 52 men is featured in [[Parvez Sharma]]'s documentary ''[[A Jihad for Love]]'' (2008).

'''Catherine Malabou''' ({{IPA-fr|malabu|lang}}; born 1959) is a [[France|French]] [[philosophy|philosopher]]. She is professor in the Philosophy Department at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy (CRMEP) at [[Kingston University]].

== Education ==
Malabou graduated from the [[École Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines]] ([[Fontenay-aux-Roses|Fontenay]]-[[Saint-Cloud]]). Her ''[[agrégation]]'' and doctorate were obtained, under the supervision of [[Jacques Derrida]], from the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]]. Her dissertation became the book, ''L'Avenir de Hegel: Plasticité, Temporalité, Dialectique'' (1996).

== Work ==
Central to Malabou's philosophy is the concept of "plasticity," which she derives in part from the work of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and from medical science, for example, from work on [[stem cells]] and from the concept of [[neuroplasticity]]. In 1999, Malabou published ''Voyager avec Jacques Derrida – La Contre-allée'', co-authored with Derrida. Her book, ''Les nouveaux blessés'' (2007), concerns the intersection between [[neuroscience]], [[psychoanalysis]], and philosophy, thought through the phenomenon of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]].

Coinciding with her exploration of neuroscience has been an increasing commitment to political philosophy. This is first evident in her book ''What Should We Do With Our Brain?'' and continues in ''Les nouveaux blessés'', as well as in her book on feminism (''Changer de différence, le féminin et la question philosophique'', Galilée, 2009), and in her forthcoming book about the homeless and social emergency (''La grande exclusion'', Bayard).

Malabou is co-writing a book with [[Adrian Johnston (philosopher)|Adrian Johnston]] on affects in Descartes, Spinoza and neuroscience, and is preparing a new book on the political meaning of life in the light of the most recent biological discoveries (mainly [[epigenetics]]). The latter work will discuss [[Giorgio Agamben|Giorgio Agamben's]] concept of "bare life" and [[Michel Foucault|Michel Foucault's]] notion of [[biopower]], underscoring the lack of scientific biological definitions of these terms, and the political meaning of such a lack.

'''Celebrity culture''' is a high-volume perpetuation of [[celebrities]]' personal lives on a global scale. It is inherently tied to consumer interests where celebrities transform their fame to become [[product brand]]s.

Whereas a culture can usually be physically identified, and its group characteristics easily observed, celebrity culture exists solely as a collection of individuals' desires for increased celebrity viewing. Celebrities themselves do not form a cohesive and identifiable group with which they identify themselves. Celebrities are found across a spectrum of activities and communities including acting, politics, fashion, sports and music. The "culture" is created when it is common knowledge within a society that people are interested in celebrities and are willing to alter their own lives to take part in celebrities' lives. The "culture" is first defined by factors outside of celebrities themselves, and then augmented by celebrities' involvement within that publicly constructed culture. Celebrity culture has become a part of everyday society and functions as a form of entertainment.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19392390903519057?needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt; Today, everyday citizens play an important role in the perpetuation of celebrity culture by constantly checking the whereabouts of celebrities, the trends within celebrity culture, and the general lives of celebrity via media.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Celebrity culture is now reflected in social norms and values because of the extreme citizen involvement.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=3sKwWqBQpbUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=celebrity+culture+in+social+media&amp;ots=-YoDSU6rGQ&amp;sig=1zpMucYbJhg4i0ttaB6JLBPfvaE#v=snippet&amp;q=celebrity%20culture&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Today, as it is now used as entertainment, celebrity culture is viewed as a form of "[[escapism]]" from reality and a means of preoccupation for everyday people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jo-piazza/americans-unhealthy-obsession-with-celebrities_b_1385405.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion from celebrities==
There have been multiple phases in the popularity of celebrity culture. The earliest examples would include the broadcasting of [[television programs]] where human beings could reach wider audiences and individuals could be given rise to fame. As different technologies were released, the manipulation of audiences changed, and the reaches of celebrity culture has greatly expanded. Entrepreneurial individuals began to recognize the financial value in purposefully promoting certain individuals, and thus a consumer approach to celebrities as brands emerged. A culture began to take shape as consumers accepted celebrities as a part of society. This acceptance along with shrewd marketing perpetuates celebrity culture with its constantly shifting customs and beliefs. Celebrity culture can be viewed as synonymous with celebrity industry, where celebrities are treated as products to be sold. Celebrity culture differs from consumer culture in that celebrity culture is a single aspect of consumer culture. Celebrity culture could not exist without consumer culture, as people are consistently buying magazines, apps for celebrities, and other celebrity-related merchandise. Consumers' choices are thus influenced by celebrities' choices. By following celebrities, consumers are invited to take part in the collective society created by the existence of celebrity culture, unknowingly perpetuated by the consumers themselves. Participants of the celebrity culture phenomenon also include the celebrities themselves, being aware they can brand themselves and achieve financial gains through their own fame and status, apart from the foundation of their celebrity pre-branding.

"To people who have grown tired of self-government, the belief in kings and queens and fairy tales seems easier and more comfortable than the practice of politics," wrote Lewis Lapham in his book, ''The Wish For Kings''. This notion is the basis for the naturally occurring relationship between "regular" men and women, and those on a pedestal.

The famous religious books of the world's [[faith]]s are replete with examples of individuals who are well known by the general public. Some of the [[pharaohs]] of ancient [[Egypt]] set in motion devices to ensure their own fame for centuries to come.

Celebrity culture, once restricted to royalty and biblical/mythical figures, has pervaded many sectors of society including business, publishing, and even academia (the [[scilebrities]]). With every scientific advance names have become attached to discoveries. Especially for large contributions to humanity, the contributor is usually regarded honourably. [[Mass media]] has increased the exposure and power of celebrity. A trend has developed that celebrity carries with it increasingly more [[social capital]] than in earlier times. Each nation or cultural community (linguistic, ethnic, religious) has its own independent celebrity system, but this is becoming less the case due to [[globalization]] (see [[J-pop]]).

== Perpetuation of celebrity culture ==
According to Oliver Dreissens, celebrity’s social and cultural prominence can be traced back to the success of the [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Driessens, Olivier. “The Celebritization of Society and Culture: Understanding the Structural Dynamics of Celebrity Culture.” International Journal of Cultural Studies, vol. 16, no. 6, 2013, pp. 641–657., doi:10.1177/1367877912459140. Accessed 23 Feb. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The various forms of mass media allowed for the spread of new images and branding of celebrities. Especially with the inclusion of televisions in the average home, there became more of a familiarity with the people or celebrities now "in our homes".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, P. D. ''Celebrity and Power: Fame in Contemporary Culture.'' University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis;London;, 2014, doi:10.5749/j.ctt7zw6qj.&lt;/ref&gt; Media surrounding celebrities has heavily influenced not only celebrity culture but the general social environment in our lives.&lt;ref&gt;Lundby K (ed.) (2009) Mediatization: Concept, Changes, Consequences. New York: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities are known to not only influence what we buy but many other things such as body image, career aspirations and politics. Richard Dyer has stated that celebrity culture is bound up with the condition of global capitalism in which "individuals are seen to determine society".&lt;ref&gt;Barry, E. (2008). Celebrity, cultural production and public life. International Journal of Cultural Studies, 11(3), 251-258. doi:10.1177/1367877908092583&lt;/ref&gt; Newer technologies, such as cable television and 24/7 coverage, have made today’s celebrities manufactured for mass consumption, as opposed to the celebrities of the thirties and the fifties who were more self-made.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Furedi, F. Soc (2010) "Celebrity Culture" 47: 493. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12115-010-9367-6&lt;/ref&gt;  24/7 coverage pushed for more programming and people to fill the extra time. With this evolved more shows and celebrities who partook in the additional screen time. Reality television has been a large part of fostering a new celebrity culture that is more interchangeable and recognizable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furedi|first=Frank|date=2010-09-23|title=Celebrity Culture|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-010-9367-6|journal=Society|language=en|volume=47|issue=6|pages=493–497|doi=10.1007/s12115-010-9367-6|issn=0147-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable television and social media media sites such as [[YouTube]], have made “overnight” sensations which have perpetuated today's perception of celebrity culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|493}} Celebrities such as [[Justin Bieber]], who rose to immense fame after being discovered on YouTube, are argued to elicit emotional ties and self-reflexiveness that invoke a seemingly personal connection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can be seen with some fans, especially female fans, feeling like they have a certain ownership or connection over a celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, S. "Spectacular Girls: Media Fascination &amp; Celebrity Culture." ''Womens Studies-an Interdisciplinary Journal'', vol. 44, no. 4, 2015, pp. 577-577.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Celebrity and political culture ==
{{main|Celebrity influence in politics}}
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Hillary Clinton and Katy Perry (30805063465).jpg|thumb|Katy Perry and Hillary Clinton at the I'm With Her concert, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential Race]]
There has recently{{Specify|reason=dated term, specify the time period|date=August 2018}} been an intersection of celebrity and political culture. This is a result of the large platform given to celebrities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} As Jane Johnson, a reporter for the popular British celebrity publication [[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] observed that the gossip surrounding celebrities is a nationally unifying among all social groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This unification and large platform provided by celebrities has been a point of interest for political leaders and groups to gain farther reach within various campaigns. Young adults have had historically lower [[voter turnout]] than any other voting age group. Knowing this, politicians and public figures draw from the cultural resources curated by celebrities by mimicking the popular, accessible public persona given off by today's celebrities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As noted by author [[Frank Furedi]], “Politicians self consciously attempt to either acquire a celebrity image or to associate themselves with individuals who possess this status”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be seen with [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Justin Trudeau]] who has become somewhat of a celebrity because of the perception of being personable and supporting progressive, liberal policies. Another example of this was  [[Katy Perry]] campaigning and performing for [[Hillary Clinton]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential election]].

==Today==
Celebrity status is widely sought by many people. Celebrities are often displeased by their status. [[Paparazzi]] are a problem for celebrities. Another problem is [[celebrity marriage]]. There is research{{Clarify|date=October 2011}} that suggests child celebrities have poor emotional health in adulthood, and often turn to drug abuse. Celebrity status is ranked by an "A-list" or "B-list" hierarchy. Sometimes people who achieved celebrity status come to regret it, e.g. [[Bart Spring in 't Veld]], who came to loathe the [[reality TV]] celebrity culture which ''[[Big Brother 1999 (Netherlands)|Big Brother]]'', of which he was the first winner in the world, instigated.

===Celebrity gossip===
Celebrity gossip has become an integral part of American culture, acting as not only a form of entertainment, but a form of social involvement and social order.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19392390903519057?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt; Gossip allows people to connect and interact with one another, providing a sense of community within society. Through gossip, people are able to affirm their values and ideas by hearing about celebrity struggle via tabloids and other forms of media. The information given to people to consume and discuss allows for civic engagement on a global scale as there is material to talk about with others that is generally known through gossip.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Vehicles===
In the USA, celebrity culture is created and disseminated by television talk shows such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', where actors and music stars promote their latest films and albums, and by many celebrity magazines such as ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Us Weekly|Us]]'', and ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]''. Another phenomenon is the arrival and rise of "micro-celebrities" through the [[WWW]] ([[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]]).

==Social media==
Celebrity culture is a constantly changing topic that grows as technology does. Different platforms are being implemented: Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook, all of which provide a new outlet for celebrities to express their thoughts. Twitter is constantly changing celebrity views and provides an unmonitored space for opinions to be shared. It provides a platform for celebrities to re-share ideas and safely share theirs. It also allows for people to comment, making it engaging to fans and followers. Instagram is also growing and continues to be a popular outlet for celebrities, as it provides an outlet for purely pictures. Many of these pictures also include other people who are famous, boosting their image and reaching to different fan bases. Lastly, Facebook is still a common used platform that many celebrities use, especially older demographics. Many older generation prefer Facebook because it is easy to navigate and people can share and write posts that are of importance to them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1367877907083077|title=Celebrity Culture and Public Connection|last=Couldry|first=Nick|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Twitter===
[[Twitter]] allowed higher frequency of interaction with people, thus increasing intimacy and the perception of culture. Twitter users could now directly interact with celebrities with the expectation of a public response.

===Instagram===
Through [[Instagram]]'s unique format another layer of celebrity culture was added, allowing celebrities to further their intimacy with followers by sharing selected photos and videos with their audience. With each additional platform a celebrity uses to promote themselves, a wider view is created thus enhancing the perception of culture. Instagram also recently changed the layout to try to help celebrities become more noticed.They use an algorithm that determines what pictures are at the top of a person's feed and what pictures are at the bottom and are harder to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/421169/most-followers-instagram/|title=Statista Instagram Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trends of celebrities found on Instagram have a massive cultural impact as the platform allows for people to see and imitate a celebrities via clothing, speech, or humor allowing them to indirectly engage with celebrity culture.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Today, Instagram can be used as a platform for marketing as celebrities can be paid huge sums of money for product placement or usage in their posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10536/DRO/DU:30032850|title=Framing celebrity : new directions in celebrity culture|last1=Homes, Redmond|first1=Su, Sean|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415377102|location=London, England|pages=369|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantrums==
Most celebrities are known for "throwing tantrums" to get their way. They're also known for getting in debates with their friends who are also celebrities in order to amp up the drama to let their names be seen. When an individual is in the public eye, it changes how they act and their behavior. Usually it brings people to act in extremes, whether that be extremely good or extremely bad. Most times, publicity only goes to celebrities who are going against the social norm, doing something different. People are more interested in reading about something crazy a celebrity did than them going out and have a respectful lunch

==Complaints==
A common complaint of modern celebrity culture is that the public, instead of seeking virtues or talents in celebrities, seek those who are the most willing to break ethical boundaries, or those who are most aggressive in self-promotion. In other words, [[infamy]] has replaced fame. The social role of the [[town drunk]], the [[court jester]], or the sexually indiscreet are not new, but arguably, the glorification of these individuals is. Society selects celebrities that provide the most entertainment and news stories as the most notorious. For example, the Kardashian family has no real talents to be celebritized, but they provide excess amounts of entertainment via [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]] that allows them to remain in the spotlight, acting as the pinnacle of celebrity culture.

===Explanations===
One possible explanation of this trend is that an artificial importance has been created in order to promote a product or a service, rather than to record a purely biographical event. As more new products are launched in a world market that is constantly expanding, the need for more celebrities has become an [industry] in itself.

Another explanation, used by [[Chuck Palahniuk]], is that this exaggeration of modern celebrity culture is created out of a need for drama and spectacle. In the book ''[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|Haunted]]'', he describes the pattern of creating a celebrity as a god-like figure, and once this image is created, the desire to destroy it and shame the individual in the most extreme ways possible. [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]] magazines are the prototype example of this theory.

==Posthumous fame==
Some creators such as poets, artists, musicians, and inventors are little-known and little-appreciated during their lives but are feted as brilliant innovators after their deaths. In some cases, after historians uncover a creator's role in the development of some type of cultural or technical process, the contributions of these little-known individuals become more widely known. A desire to achieve this type of posthumous fame may have motivated [[Alan Abel]], [[Adam Rich]] and [[Pauly Shore Is Dead|Pauly Shore]] to stage their own deaths.

Sometimes a false death mention can cause a person to rethink their legacy. [[Alfred Nobel]] founded the [[Nobel Prize]]s after an erroneous obituary labelled him a "merchant of death" due to his invention and selling of [[dynamite]].

People who were far more famous after their deaths than during their lifetime (and often were completely or relatively unknown) include Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]; scientist [[Galileo Galilei]]; 1800s-era poet [[John Keats]]; painter [[Posthumous fame of Vincent van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh]]; poet and novelist [[Edgar Allan Poe]]; singer [[Eva Cassidy]]; comedian [[Bill Hicks]]; writer [[Emily Dickinson]]; artist [[Edith Holden]], whose 1906 diary was a best-seller when published posthumously in 1977; writer [[Franz Kafka]]; singer [[Jeff Buckley]]; diarist [[Anne Frank]]; philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]; writer [[John Kennedy Toole]] (who posthumously won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] 12 years after his death); author [[Stieg Larsson]] (who died with his ''[[Millennium series|Millennium]]'' novels unpublished); musician, artist and poet [[Rozz Williams]]; and [[William Webb Ellis]], the alleged inventor of [[Rugby football]].

[[Herostratus]], a young Greek man [[arson]]ed the [[Temple of Artemis]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) in 356 BC in order to immortalize his name. Although authorities at the time tried to expunge him from history and punished people with the [[death penalty]] for even merely mentioning his name, he succeeded in achieving lasting fame, as his name is well known to this day.

In August 2012 Christian was interviewed by the ''[[Halifax Chronicle Herald]]'', after she joined the volunteer crew of a [[HMS Bounty (1960, ship)|replica]] of the original [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']], built by [[MGM]] for a film about the mutiny.

The vessel sailed into [[Hurricane Sandy]] on October 29, 2012.&lt;ref name=NationalPost2012-10-30&gt;

Fourteen members of the ship's complement were able to board a life raft and were saved.
The ''[[Virginian-Pilot]]'' quoted [[United States Coast Guard]] [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Joe Kelly, who described how Christian and the ship's [[Sea captain|captain]] [[Robin Walbridge]] were about to join the rest of the ship's complement in the life raft, when the ''Bounty'' rolled, plunging them into the ocean.&lt;ref name=VirgianPilot2012-10-30&gt;

However, according to later accounts from the survivors, they were all thrown into the water, and had desperately swum for one of the life rafts.&lt;ref name=CnnLifeDeath2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronicleHerald2013-02-15/&gt;
[[Search and rescue]] crews from Coast Guard helicopters rescued the crew members from the life raft.  When Christian was found, ten hours later, she was "unresponsive".  Resuscitation was attempted, but she was pronounced dead in a shore-based hospital in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]].

Patrik Jonsson, writing in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', called her death ''"an almost inexplicable twist on that family legacy."''&lt;ref name=AlaskaDispatch2012-10-31&gt;

Claudene Christian initiated the first lawsuit, claiming a Mattel doll of a cheerleader improperly copied a Cheerleader Doll design.  Mattel was able to establish, to the court's satisfaction, that the cheerleader doll they were marketing was based on a Mattel design that preceded Cheerleader Doll's.  Mattel won and Cheerleader Doll was ordered to pay $100,000.
Subsequently, her father and partner, Harry Christian, initiated a second lawsuit. Christian sought 2.4 billion dollars and various forms of injunctive relief. She lost, and the district court awarded Mattel $501,565 in attorney's fees.

==Singing career==

Christian sang publicly extensively while a teenager in Alaska, and professionally while she lived in California.&lt;ref name=EasyReader2012-10-30/&gt; She was a member of a band called Joe's Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-sandy-victim-claudene-christian,0,1519347.story|title=Superstorm Sandy Claims Life of Former USC Song Girl|date=October 30, 2012|publisher=KTLA Los Angeles|accessdate=9 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030232818/http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-sandy-victim-claudene-christian%2C0%2C1519347.story|archivedate=October 30, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bounty's owners sued for negligence==

''[[CNN]]'' reported in May 2013 that Christian's family were suing the ''Bounty{{'}}'' owners, the HMS Bounty Organization.&lt;ref name=Cnn2013-05-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMail2013-10-21/&gt;
They claimed the ''Bounty'' was unseaworthy on its last voyage, and that the Captain and the ship's owners made the unwise decision to head into Hurricane Sandy, rather than seek the shelter of a harbor.

'''Colin Fry''' (19 May 1962 – 25 August 2015) was an English [[television personality]], entertainer and self-proclaimed [[Mediumship|medium]]. Fry consistently professed his beliefs as a psychic and garnered a following across his career, whilst critics said his capabilities came from [[cold reading]].&lt;ref name=double&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/isil.telemnar/Doublexposure/colin_fry_felixstowe.htm |title=Double Exposure: An Evening with Colin Fry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908185355/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/isil.telemnar/Doublexposure/colin_fry_felixstowe.htm |archivedate=2006-09-08 |df= }} Examination of Fry's cold-reading techniques during a live performance.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11831077/Colin-Fry-medium-obituary.html "Colin Fry, medium - obituary"]. The Telegraph. Retrieved 29 February 2016. "Sceptics countered that Fry’s main talent lay in basic “cold reading” techniques – the art of analysing body language in order to make high-probability guesses about a person. In 1992 Fry was caught out at a seance when the lights were turned on unexpectedly, revealing that he was still holding a “spirit trumpet” that was meant to be suspended in mid-air."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

He was born in [[Haywards Heath]] in Sussex. He claimed to have discovered psychic ability from the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/colin-fry-medium-who-for-more-than-30-years-entertained-and-comforted-audiences-on-stage-and-on-10473580.html Colin Fry: Medium who for more than 30 years entertained and comforted audiences on stage and on television]. The Independent.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Colin Fry has hosted a number of television programmes dealing with the supernatural, including  ''[[Psychic Private Eyes]]'' and ''[[6ixth Sense with Colin Fry]]'', produced by [[Living TV]]. The presented entertainment was based on basic cold reading techniques.&lt;ref name=double/&gt; 

In April 2015, Fry was diagnosed as being [[terminal illness |terminally ill]] with [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.itv.com/news/2015-08-25/tv-psychic-colin-fry-dies-aged-53/ | title=TV psychic Colin Fry dies from lung cancer aged 53 | work=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] | date=25 August 2015 | accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vowing, "The show must go on" he said, "It is bad news for me personally. But it has made me even more determined to carry on. It gives me a chance to say goodbye to my fans, who have been so loyal to me over the years. I hope they and the theatres will all bear with me. I feel good most of the time. But there will be bad days too. It has been a privilege to be allowed to perform my skills on a national stage and television. I have never taken that for granted and I would like to give something back and say, 'thank you for having me. It has been a real pleasure'".{{cn|date=November 2017}} He died on the morning of 25 August 2015, at the age of 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34051952|title=TV medium Colin Fry dies aged 53|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date= |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Fry, who at one time performed under the stage name of "Lincoln", was exposed in 1992 when during a séance the lights were unexpectedly turned on and he was seen holding a [[Séance#Trumpets,_slates,_tables,_and_cabinets|spirit trumpet]] in the air, which the audience had been led to believe was being levitated by spiritual energy.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Youens&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyyouens.com/colinfry.htm|publisher=tonyyouens.com|title=Colin Fry - an evaluation|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-thinking.org.uk/paranormal/spiritualism/desperate-faith.php "Desperate Faith"].

==Career==

Carlson founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938.  Carlson used "Gold Bond Stamps", a consumer loyalty program based on trading stamps, to provide consumer incentive for grocery stores. Carlson was the first entrepreneur to develop a loyalty program for the grocery chain through the issuance of trading stamps. What began as a simple loyalty program for grocers in the Midwest grew into one of the largest service providers of frequent shopper / buyer programs across a variety of retail and hospitality sectors.&lt;ref&gt;''Curtis Leroy Carlson'' (The [[University of Houston]], [[Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management|Conrad N.

Carlson expanded his offerings by purchasing the downtown Minneapolis  [[Radisson Hotel]]  in 1960 and building it into a national chain. He also acquired [[TGI Fridays]], Carlson Leisure Group and hundreds of other hospitality businesses.&lt;ref&gt;''Gold Bond Stamp Company / Carlson Companies 1938 - 1998''  (Harvard Business School) [http://www.hbs.edu/leadership/database/leaders/curtis_l_carlson.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dovie Beams''' (born '''Dovie Leona Osborne'''&lt;ref name=rotea&gt;Hermie Rotea, ''Marcos' Lovey Dovie'', Liberty Pub. Co., 1983, {{ISBN|0-918229-00-6}} [http://rpictures.net/marcosloveydovie.html]&lt;/ref&gt;, August 5, 1932 – December 30, 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/dovie-villagran-obituary?pid=188497601|title=Dovie Leona Osborne Boehms Beam Villagran Obituary|newspaper=Legacy.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] [[actress]], perhaps best known for her 1968-1970 affair with [[Philippines|Philippine]]  President Ferdinand Marcos.

==Scandal==
In 1970, a huge scandal hit the [[Philippines]] over the stormy break-up between then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and his mistress of two years, Hollywood starlet Dovie Beams. On many occasions, she had hidden a [[tape recorder]] under a bed while making love to the president.&lt;ref name=rotea/&gt; Beams had arrived in the Philippines in 1968 to shoot the film ''[[Maharlika#Under Marcos|Maharlika]]'', a movie partially funded by Marcos and meant to glorify his alleged war exploits, in which she played opposite [[Paul Burke (actor)|Paul Burke]] as the movie's Marcos lover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video48.blogspot.com/2009/04/maharlika-1971.html The story behind "Maharlika" (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving the country, Beams held a press conference, and delighted the press and public by playing erotic recordings of herself with Marcos. According to her, she was forced to publicize her "love affair" as "protection" since there were many threats to her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/03/1088488200812.html The Sun-Herald - Philandering dictator added Hollywood star to conquests]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dovie Beams tape became the "most intense public and private turmoil" for Marcos. His aides likened it to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Some believed Marcos [[Proclamation No. 1081|declared]] [[martial law]] early to silence the opposition, which was still using the Beams tape in 1972. Some said [[Imelda Marcos]], his wife and First Lady, became more aggressive and uncontrollable in the government following the scandal. Others said the former first lady started building her domain after her husband's relationship with Beams.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sterling Seagrave]], The Marcos Dynasty, 1988: 225&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sterling Seagrave]] on the broadcasting of the tapes:

{{quote|Student protesters at the University of the Philippines commandeered the campus radio station and broadcast a looped tape; soon the entire nation was listening in astonishment to President Marcos begging Dovie Beams to perform oral sex. For over a week the President's hoarse injunctions boomed out over university loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, The Marcos Dynasty, 1988: 225&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hermie Rotea noted in his book on the scandal that Beams, besides weakening Marcos status, had had the positive influence of empowering women in Filipina society:
 
{{quote|In the beginning [birth-control pills] were banned because of their alleged harmful effects and the opposition of the Church. But Dovie told Marcos: "Look at me. I've been taking birth control pills for years and you don't see anything wrong with me, do you?" Thus after that they brought birth control pills into the Philippines, and now the people were free to make their own decisions regarding having or not having babies.&lt;ref name=rotea/&gt;}}

'''Frits Vilhelm Holm'''&lt;ref name=keevak117/&gt;  (ca. 1881&lt;ref name=nyt1908&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1908/07/12/archives/the-nestorian-stones-message-of-centuries-more-than-a-thousand.html The Nestorian Stone's Message of Centuries; More Than a Thousand Years Old These Inscriptions, in Replica at the Metropolitan Museum, Tell of Early Christianity in China]", ''The New York Times'',
July 12, 1908, Sunday. Section: Magazine Section, Page SM6. (In this article he is referred to as "26-year-old")&lt;/ref&gt; – May 1930) was a Danish scholar and adventurer. His books usually gave his name as simply Frits Holm or Frits V. Holm, while US newspapers of the time usually (mis)spelled his name as '''Fritz von Holm''', sometimes  claiming that he was a member of the European nobility.&lt;ref name=keevak117/&gt;

Holm is best known for his attempt, in 1907, to "obtain" the famous [[Nestorian Stele]] - an ancient Christian monument of [[Xi'an]], in Northwestern China, and sell it to a Western museum. Alerted to his activities (nicknamed by later writers the "Holm-Nestorian expedition to Xi'an"), the local authorities moved the monument from its outdoor location on the western outskirts of the city, and into the [[Stele Forest]] museum. In order not to leave China empty-handed, the disappointed Holm had an exact copy of the stele made for him in Xi'an.&lt;ref name=keevak117/&gt; He had the replica stele taken by cart to the [[Yellow River]], then by small boat down the (not very navigable) Yellow River to the nearest train station at [[Zhengzhou]], and then by train to the major [[Yangtze]] River port of [[Hankou]] (now in [[Wuhan]]).&lt;ref name=nyt1908/&gt;

Instead of London's [[British Museum]], as he supposedly originally intended, Holm had the replica stele shipped to New York, planning to sell it to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. The museum's director [[Caspar Purdon Clarke]], however, was less than enthusiastic about purchasing "so large a stone ... of no artistic value". Nonetheless, the replica stele was exhibited in the museum ("on loan" from Mr. Holm) for about 10 years.
&lt;ref name=keevak117&gt;{{harvnb|Keevak|2008|pp=117–121}}. Holm's original report can be found in {{harvnb|Carus|Wylie|Holm|1909}}, and also in  more popular form in {{harvnb|Holm|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually, in 1917, Mr. George Leary, a wealthy New Yorker, purchased the replica stele and sent it to [[Rome]], as a gift to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/01/29/102315628.pdf NEW CAPTAIN ON ST. LOUIS.; Hartley, Young American Line Commander, Praised for Handling Ship]. ''The New York Times'', January 29, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 1919, Holm married Marguerite MacDonough Green in New York. She was the only child of the late Warren L. Green, the president of the [[American Bank Note Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/10/archives/miss-green-wed-to-dr-frits-holm.html Miss Green Wed to Dr. Frits Holm]. ''The New York Times'', October 10, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

Holm died in May 1930 from pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A16F93B5D157A93C2A81788D85F448385F9 FV HOLM DEAD; DANISH EXPLORER; Succumbs to Pneumonia--...]

[[Malay titles|Tun]] '''Muhammad Fuad Stephens''', (born '''Donald Aloysius Marmaduke Stephens'''; 14 September 1920 – 6 June 1976)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/istana/Biodata%20Tun%20Haji%20Mohd.%20Fuad%20Stephens.html Biodata Tun Haji Mohd. Fuad Stephens]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[Chief Minister of Sabah|Chief Minister]] of the state of [[Sabah]] in Malaysia, and the first ''Huguan Siou'' or Paramount Leader of the [[Kadazandusun]] community. He played a fundamental role in bringing the state of Sabah into the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. He held the chief minister post until 1964, and again in 1976. During his second term as Chief Minister he died in a controversial accident on 6 June 1976, in [[Kota Kinabalu]], the state capital of Sabah. He was a passenger in an Australian made [[GAF Nomad|Nomad aircraft]] which crashed and killed everyone on board. His body was buried at the State Mausoleum near the [[Sabah State Mosque]], [[Kota Kinabalu]].

== Early life ==
Stephens was born on 14 September 1920 in [[Kudat]]. His father, Jules Stephen Pavitt (later known as Jules Pavitt Stephens), was half-[[Kadazan]] and half-British, born and brought up in [[Akaroa]], [[Canterbury Region|Canterbury]], [[New Zealand]] who migrated to [[British North Borneo]] hailing from [[Papar, Malaysia|Papar]] district in the [[West Coast Division]] with paternal ancestry roots in [[Essex]], [[England]]. His mother, Edith Cope, was ethnically half-Japanese, half-British and a quarter-[[Dusun]] ([[Orang Sungai]]) descent originating from the district of [[Kinabatangan]], [[Sandakan Division]].&lt;ref&gt;P. J. (1999), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens had five siblings; two younger sisters and three younger brothers.  Two of them, John and Martin died in infancy. A third, Leo Benedict was born in 1926, later became the President of the [[Dewan Negara]] between 1985–1988.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. (1999), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Donald Stephens founded the political party [[United National Kadazan Organisation]] (UNKO) in August 1961. He played a key role in negotiating the independence of Sabah and the formation of Malaysia, together with [[Tun Mustapha]] of [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO), and [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the then [[Prime Minister of Malaya]]. The formation of Malaysia was finally achieved on 16 September 1963, which is today known as [[Malaysia Day]]. He became Sabah's first Chief Minister.

In 1964, Donald Stephens stepped down as Chief Minister to become the first Malaysian federal [[Cabinet of Malaysia|cabinet member]] from Sabah. He was replaced by [[Peter Lo Sui Yin]] from the [[Sabah Chinese Association]]. Stephens became the minister in charge of Sabah affairs under the Prime Minister's department.&lt;ref name=badref&gt;[http://malaysiana1.blogspot.com/2007/07/whats-in-name.html malaysiana1: What's In A Name?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephens saw Malaysia as the federation of four countries - Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore - as equal partners, as opposed to the eleven states making up the [[Federation of Malaya]], which had less autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d9PsAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=stephens+Sabah+entry+Malaysia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22four+countries%22 ''Sabah 25 years later, 1963-1988''], Institute for Development Studies (Sabah), 1989, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Singapore's exit from Malaysia, Stephens sought a review of Sabah's participation in the federation,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BMvsAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Stephens+wanted+a+review+of+Sabah%27s+participation+in+Malaysia+after+Singapore%27s+exit.&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22a+review+of+Sabah%27s+conditions+of+entry%22 ''ASEAN Forecast''], Volumes 5-7, Executive Publication Pte, 1985, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not seeking secession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=4Js_W_mjLcfUgQbR9IOgBw&amp;q=%22not+seeking+secession%22+%22Stephens%22&amp;oq=%22not+seeking+secession%22+%22Stephens%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...14876.22134.0.23735.12.12.0.0.0.0.75.808.12.12.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.pdvf9OgnXqY ''Malaysia''], 1965, page 24&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was rejected by the federal government, which feared that such a move would endanger the federation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E36JAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=stephens+Sabah+entry+Malaysia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22entry+into+Malaysia%22 ''Malaysian Federalism: Conflict Or Consensus''], 
Mohammad Agus Yusoff, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 2006, page 223&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Fuad Stephens was appointed as the governor of Sabah, known as the [[Yang di-Pertua Negara]] (the post was later known as [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri]]).&lt;ref name="Granville-Edge, P. J. 1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sabahan: The Life And Death of Tun Fuad Stephens|author=Granville-Edge, P. J.|year=1999|isbn=978-983-40114-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held this position until 1975. Later that same year, Tun Fuad Stephens together with [[Harris Salleh]] formed the new political party [[BERJAYA]]. They won the 1976 state election, defeating Tun Mustapha's USNO and becoming the new government of Sabah. Tun Fuad Stephens became Sabah's fifth Chief Minister. Forty-four days later, he died in a plane crash.

== Plane crash ==
{{main|1976 Sabah Air GAF Nomad crash}}
On 6 June 1976 ("Double Six"), Tun Fuad Stephens and several cabinet members boarded a flight from [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]] heading towards [[Kota Kinabalu]]. About {{convert|2|km|mi}} from [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport]], the plane crashed killing everyone on board.

The site of the plane crash is marked by a [[Double Six Monument|memorial constructed]] not long after the accident. The site is located in the Sembulan area near the Grace Garden housing complex in Kota Kinabalu across Jalan Coastal Highway from Sutera Harbour resort.

== Personal life ==
Stephens converted to Islam in January 1971, and he adopted the name '''Muhammad Fuad''', meaning ''soul'' or ''spirit'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Stephens was also encouraged to renounce his surname at the time of his conversion, but he had refused to do so.&lt;ref name="Islam218"/&gt; For a number of years he held the post of [[High Commissioner]] of Malaysia in Australia.

'''Garden hermits''' or '''ornamental hermits''' were [[hermit]]s encouraged to live in purpose-built [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitages]], [[Folly|follies]], [[grotto]]es, or [[rockery|rockeries]] on the estates of wealthy land-owners, primarily during the 18th century. Such hermits would be encouraged to dress like [[druid]]s and remain permanently on-site, where they could be fed, cared-for and consulted for advice or viewed for entertainment.&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Gordon|title=The Hermit in the Garden: From Imperial Rome to Ornamental Gnome|date=2013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199696994|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aV1x0rMca4QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Professor Gordon Campbell, of the [[University of Leicester]], suggests that [[Francis of Paola]] was among the first of the trend, living as a hermit in the early 15th century in a cave on his own father's estate.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; He later served as a confidant and advisor to King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. Thereafter, throughout [[France]], estates of dukes and other lords often included small chapels or other buildings where a resident religious hermit could remain in attendance. According to Campbell, the first estate with a well-known hermitage (which included a small house, chapel and garden) was [[Château de Gaillon]], renovated by [[Charles Cardinal de Bourbon]] during the 16th century.

Garden hermits became popular with British aristocracy during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Contemporary accounts suggest the [[Weld-Blundell family|Weld family]] kept an ornamental hermit in a purpose-built hermitage on the [[Lulworth Estate]] in [[Dorset]].&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook for Travellers in Wiltshire, Dorsetshire and Somersetshire|date=1869|publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hYEOAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of equivalent novelty, the Welds also maintained a "mimic" [[fort]] and [[harbour]] beside an adjoining lake.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; Both [[Painshill]] and [[Hawkstone Park]] were said to have employed ornamental hermits.

The trend continued through to the 1830s, when the idea became less popular as estate landscaping concepts evolved.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Robin Lane|title=Why a hermit can be the perfect garden ornament|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/66eae9bc-8999-11e3-8829-00144feab7de.html|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Even in the 18th and 19th centuries, garden hermits were novelties and eccentricities. Grottos had become more popular during the 18th century as places to withdraw for meditation, relaxation and reflection.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; With an increased focus on [[industrialism]] and production, contemplative garden meditation was viewed by some as an extravagance. With the lack of personal free time in combination with an increase in disposable income, the popularity of "natural" garden landscaping and the rise of [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] culture established an environment in which the idea of garden hermits as novelty guests became popular.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt;

In some early instances, hermits were simply represented or hinted-at, rather than personified; outside a folly or grotto, a small table and chair, reading glasses and a classical text might be placed suggesting that it was where a hermit lived.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; Later, suggestions of hermits were replaced with actual hermits – men hired for the sole purpose of inhabiting a small structure and functioning as any other garden ornament.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; Hermits would sometimes be asked to make themselves available to guests, answering questions and providing counsel. In some cases, the hermits would not communicate with visitors, functioning instead like a perpetual stage-play or live diorama.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; 

In return for their services-in-residence, hermits would generally receive a [[stipend]] in addition to [[room and board]].&lt;ref name=murray/&gt;&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1993 play ''[[Arcadia (play)|Arcadia]]'' deals specifically with the case of an ornamental hermit, investigated by one of the main characters.
*''The Bee-Loud Glade'', a 2011 novel by [[Steve Himmer]], is narrated by an ornamental hermit.
*[[Terry Pratchett]] had [[Sam Vimes]] discover that his wife's country estate housed an ornamental hermit in his 2011 novel ''[[Snuff_(Pratchett_novel)|Snuff]]''.

'''Guinevere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|w|ɪ|n|ɪ|v|ɪər|audio=Guenevere.wav}} {{respell|GWIN|iv|eer}}; {{lang-cy|Gwenhwyfar}} {{audio|Gwenhwyfar.wav|pronunciation}}; {{lang-br|Gwenivar}}), often written as '''Guenevere''' or '''Gwenevere''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Guinevere%2CGwenevere%2CGuenevere%2CGwenhwyfar&amp;year_start=1850&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2CGuinevere%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CGwenevere%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CGuenevere%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CGwenhwyfar%3B%2Cc0 Google Ngram search for common spellings]&lt;/ref&gt; is the wife of [[King Arthur]] in [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]]. Guinevere has been portrayed as everything from a weak and opportunistic traitor to a fatally flawed but noble and virtuous lady. She first appears as ''Guanhumara'' (with many spelling variants in the manuscript tradition) in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', a pseudo-historical chronicle of British history written circa 1136. In the later medieval [[Chivalric romance|romances]], one of the most prominent [[story arc]]s is Queen Guinevere's tragic love affair with her husband's chief knight, [[Lancelot]], indirectly causing the death of Arthur and many others. This story first appeared in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'' and became a motif in Arthurian literature, starting with the [[Lancelot-Grail]] of the early 13th century and carrying through the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. She continues to be a popular character in the modern adaptations of the legend. 

==Name==
The original [[Welsh language|Welsh]] form of the name '''{{lang|cy|Gwenhwyfar}}''' (or ''Gwenhwyvar''), which seems to be cognate with the Irish name {{lang|ga|[[Findabair]]}}, can be translated as "The White Enchantress" or "The White Fay/Ghost", from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] ''*Windo-'' "white, fair, holy" + ''*sēbarā'' "magical being" (cognate with Old Irish ''síabair'' "a spectre, phantom, supernatural being [usually in pejorative sense]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Schrijver | first=Peter | title=Studies in British Celtic Historical Phonology | year=1995 | publisher=Rodopi | isbn=9051838204 | pages=249–250 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_RMQkk3OSIC&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hamp, Eric P. | title=Varia: 1. 1 sál m.

Irish tarr, torrach; 8. tinaid; 9. tindabrad, Findabair; 10. 1 úall, úabar, úais; 11. *uern~? | journal=Études Celtiques | volume=32 | year=1996 | pages=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Koch | first=John T. | title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia | year=2006 | publisher=Abc-clio | isbn=9781851094400| page=861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of the Irish Language (ed. E G Quin et al., Royal Irish Academy, Dublin 1913-76; Letter S, Column 205, electronic version at http://www.DIL.ie)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the name may derive from ''{{lang|cy|Gwenhwy-fawr}}'', or "Gwenhwy the Great", as a contrast to ''{{lang|cy|Gwenhwy-fach}}'', or "Gwenhwy the less". [[Gwenhwyfach]] (also spelled ''Gwenhwyach'') appears in [[Welsh literature]] as a sister of Gwenhwyfar, but Welsh scholars Melville Richards and [[Rachel Bromwich]] both dismiss this etymology (with Richards suggesting that Gwenhwyfach was a back-formation derived from an incorrect interpretation of ''Gwenwhy-far'' as ''Gwenhwy-fawr'').&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Melville, "Arthurian Onomastics", in: ''Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion'', vol. 2, 1969, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] rendered her name as '''{{lang|la|Guanhumara}}''' in [[Latin]] (though there are many spelling variations found in the various manuscripts of his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''). The name is given as '''''Guennuuar''''' in [[Caradoc]]'s ''Vita Gildae'', while [[Gerald of Wales]] refers to her as '''{{lang|cy|Wenneuereia}}'''. In the 15th-century [[Middle Cornish]] play ''[[Bewnans Ke]]'', she was called '''''Gwynnever'''''. A cognate name in [[Modern English]] is [[Jennifer (given name)|Jennifer]], from [[Cornish language|Cornish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cleveland Evans: Jennifer went from 'strange' to popular | work=Omaha | url=http://www.omaha.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111101/LIVING/711019971/1020867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the [[Welsh Triads]] (''{{lang|cy|Trioedd Ynys Prydein}}'', no. 56), there are three Gwenhwyfars married to [[King Arthur]]. The first is the daughter of Cywryd of Gwent, the second of [[Gwythyr ap Greidawl]], and the third of (G)ogrfan Gawr ("the Giant").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Triads of the Island of Britain |last=Bromwich |first=Rachel |date=2006 |edition=3 |pages=154 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-0708313862}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a variant of another Welsh Triad (''{{lang|cy|Trioedd Ynys Prydein}}'', no. 54), only the daughter of Gogfran Gawr is mentioned. Two other Triads (''{{lang|cy|Trioedd Ynys Prydein}}'', no. 53, 84) mention Gwenhwyfar's contention with her sister [[Gwenhwyfach]], which was believed to be the cause of the [[Battle of Camlann]]. In the mid-late 12th-century [[Welsh folklore|Welsh folktale]] ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', she is mentioned alongside Gwenhwyfach.

[[Image:Arthur-Pyle The Lady Guinevere.JPG|thumb|''Lady Guinevere'' by [[Howard Pyle]] from ''[[The Story of King Arthur and His Knights]]'' (1903)|200px]]

In [[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'', she is praised for her intelligence, friendliness, and gentility, while in [[Marie de France]]'s ''[[Lanval]]'' (and [[Thomas Chestre]]'s [[Middle English]] version, ''[[Sir Launfal]]''), she is a vindictive adulteress, disliked by the protagonist and all well-bred knights. Early chronicles tend to portray her inauspiciously or hardly at all, while later authors use her good and bad qualities to construct a deeper character who played a larger role. The works of Chrétien were some of the first to elaborate on the character Guinevere beyond simply the wife of Arthur. This was likely due to Chrétien's audience at the time, the court of [[Marie of France, Countess of Champagne]], which was composed of courtly ladies who played highly social roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Noble | first=Peter | title=The Character of Guinevere in the Arthurian Romances of Chretien de Troyes | journal=The Modern Language Review | year=1972 | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3726121?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103748265941 | volume=67 | issue=3 | pages=524–535 | doi=10.2307/3726121 | issn=0026-7937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinevere is childless in most stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walters|first=Lori|title=Lancelot and Guinevere: a casebook|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8153-0653-9|page=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQTVR53IJo0C&amp;pg=PA295}}&lt;/ref&gt; two exceptions being ''[[Perlesvaus]]'' (the son Loholt) and the [[Alliterative Morte Arthure|Alliterative ''Morte Arthure'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Mediavilla|first=Cindy|title=Arthurian Fiction: An Annotated Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbgDczOgghsC&amp;pg=PA37|year=1999|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-3644-0}}, page 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter text, Guinevere willingly becomes [[Mordred]]'s consort and bears him two sons, though this is implied rather than stated in the text. There were mentions of Arthur's sons in the Welsh Triads, though their exact parentage is not clear.

Other family relations are equally obscure. A half-sister and a brother play the antagonistic roles in the [[Lancelot–Grail]] and the German romance ''[[Diu Crône]]'' respectively, but neither character is mentioned elsewhere. Welsh tradition remembers the queen's sister Gwenhyvach and records the enmity between them. While later literature almost always named [[Leodegrance]] as Guinevere's father, her mother was usually unmentioned, although she was sometimes said to be dead; this is the case in the Middle English romance ''[[The Awntyrs off Arthure]]'' (''The Adventures of Arthur''), in which the ghost of Guinevere's mother appears to her daughter and [[Gawain]] in [[Inglewood Forest]]. Other works name cousins of note, though these do not usually appear in more than one place.

There was once a popular folk rhyme known in Wales concerning Gwenhwyfar: ''"Gwenhwyfar ferch Ogrfan Gawr / Drwg yn fechan, gwaeth yn fawr'' (Gwenhwyfar, daughter of Ogrfan Gawr / Bad when little, worse when great)."&lt;ref&gt;Rhys, John, Studies in the Arthurian Legend, Clarendon Press, 1891, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear}}

==In medieval literature==
===Early appearances===
[[File:Queen Guinevere by James Archer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Queen Guinevere'' by [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (c. 1860)]]

The earliest datable mention of Guinevere (as Guanhumara, with numerous spelling variations in the surviving manuscripts) is in Geoffrey's ''Historia'', written c. 1136. It relates that Guinevere, described as one of the great beauties of Britain, was descended from a [[equites|noble Roman family]] and educated under [[Cador]], [[Duke of Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron Hallam Tennyson Tennyson|first=Baron Alfred Tennyson Tennyson|title=Works of Tennyson, Volume 5|year=1908|page=506|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSZHAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA506&amp;dq=Guinevere+roman+noble+family&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mTR5T93xD6nw0gGc5uW3DQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Guinevere%20roman%20noble%20family&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur leaves her in the care of his nephew Modredus (Mordred) while he crosses over to Europe to go to war with the Roman leader [[Lucius Tiberius]]. While her husband is absent, Guinevere is seduced by Modredus and marries him, and Modredus declares himself king and takes Arthur's throne. Consequently, Arthur returns to Britain and fights Modredus at the fatal Battle of Camlann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilentz|first=Abigail|title=Relationship Devotional: 365 Lessons to Love &amp; Learn|year=2009|publisher=Sterling|location=Lancelot and Guinevere|isbn=1-4027-5577-5|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr4IyCUeCiMC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=arthur+leave+Guinevere+in+a+care+of+a+nephew&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LTZ5T8vqNumI0QHwpP3ZDQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=arthur%20leave%20Guinevere%20in%20a%20care%20of%20a%20nephew&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early appearance of Guinevere is ''Culhwch and Olwen'', in which she is mentioned as Arthur's wife Gwenhwyfar, but little more is said about her.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher W. Bruce (2013). ''The Arthurian Name Dictionary''. p. 243. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; It can not be securely dated; one recent assessment of the language by linguist Simon Rodway places it in the second half of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway, Simon, Dating Medieval Welsh Literature: Evidence from the Verbal System. CMCS Publications, Aberystwyth, 2013, p. 16; pp. 168-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abduction stories ===
Welsh cleric and author [[Caradoc of Llancarfan]], who wrote his ''[[Gildas|Life of Gildas]]'' sometime between 1130-1150,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/1150-Caradoc-LifeofGildas.asp|title= Caradoc of Llangarfan: The Life of Gildas|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Fordham University Medieval Sourcebook|publisher= Fordham University|access-date= 9 April 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; recounts her being kidnapped by [[Maleagant|Melwas]], king of the "Summer Country" (''Aestiva Regio'', perhaps meaning [[Somerset]]), and held prisoner at his stronghold at [[Glastonbury]]. The story states that Arthur spent a year searching for her and assembling an army to storm Melwas' fort when Gildas negotiates a peaceful resolution and reunites husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bruce|first=Christopher W.|title=The Arthurian Name Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZFbczeMtYcC&amp;pg=PA355|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-2865-0}}, page 355&lt;/ref&gt;

A seemingly related account was carved into the [[Modena Cathedral#Archivolt|archivolt of Modena Cathedral]] in Italy, which most likely predates Caradoc's telling. Here, Artus de Bretania and Isdernus approach a tower in which Mardoc is holding '''Winlogee''', while on the other side Carrado (most likely Caradoc) fights Galvagin (Gawain) while the knights Galvariun and Che ([[Sir Kay]]) approach. Isdernus is most certainly an incarnation of Yder, a Celtic hero whose name appears in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', and who is Guinevere's lover in a nearly-forgotten tradition mentioned in [[Béroul]]'s 12th-century ''Tristan'' and reflected in the later ''Roman de Yder''. 

[[File:Tales of the Round table; based on the tales in the Book of romance (1908) (14580312508).jpg|thumb|upright|Lancelot and Guinevere in [[Andrew Lang]]'s illustration for ''Tales of the Round Table'' (1908)]]

Chrétien de Troyes tells another version of Guinevere's abduction, this time by [[Maleagant|Meleagant]] (whose name is possibly derived from Melwas) in the 12th-century ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]''. The abduction sequence is largely a reworking of that recorded in Caradoc's work, but here the queen's rescuer is not Arthur (or Yder) but [[Lancelot]], whose adultery with the queen is dealt with for the first time in this poem. It has been suggested that Chrétien invented their affair to supply Guinevere with a courtly extramarital lover. Mordred could not be used as his reputation was beyond saving, and Yder had been forgotten entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=(de Troyes)|first=Chrétien|title=Lancelot, or, The Knight of the Cart|year=1990|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=0-8203-1213-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BkOv2P91UMC&amp;pg=PR9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ulrich von Zatzikhoven]]'s ''[[Lanzelet]]'' (c. 1200), Valerin, King of the Tangled Wood, claims the right to marry her and carries her off to his castle in a struggle for power that reminds scholars of her prescient connections to the fertility and sovereignty of Britain. Arthur's company saves her, but Valerin kidnaps her again and places her in a magical sleep inside another castle surrounded by snakes, where only the powerful sorcerer Malduc can rescue her.

[[Image:Meigle 2 Vanora.jpg|thumb|left|Meigle stone detail]]

A version of the abduction of Guinevere is associated in local folklore with [[Meigle]] in Scotland, known for its carved [[Pictish stone]]s. One of the stones, now in the [[Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum]], is said to depict '''Vanora''', the local name for Guinevere.&lt;ref name="HScot"/&gt; She is said to have been abducted by King Modred (Mordred). When she is eventually returned to Arthur, he has her condemned to death for infidelity and orders that she be torn to pieces by wild beasts, an event said to be depicted on Meigle Stone 2 (Queen Venora's Stone).&lt;ref name="HScot"/&gt; This stone was one of two that originally stood near a mound that is identified as Vanora's grave.&lt;ref name="HScot"&gt;[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertyabout.htm?PropID=PL_209&amp;PropName=Meigle%20Sculptured%20Stone%20Museum Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum at Historic Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars interpret the Meigle Stone 2 as a depiction of the Biblical tale of [[Daniel in the lion's den]].

The 14th-century Welsh poet [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]] alludes to Guinevere's abduction in two of his poems. In the German tale ''Diu Crône'', Guinevere's own brother Gotegrim kidnaps her and intends to kill her for refusing to marry Gasozein, who claims to be her rightful husband. 

Medievalist [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] suggested that this motif shows that "she had inherited the role of a Celtic [[Persephone]]" (from the [[Greek mythology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loomis|first=Roger Sherman|title=The Development of Arthurian Romance|year=2000|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-40955-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these similar tales of abduction by another suitor – and this allegory includes Lancelot, who whisks her away when she is condemned to [[death by burning|burn at the stake]] for their adultery – are demonstrative of a recurring '[[Hades]]-snatches-Persephone' theme, positing that Guinevere is similar to the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] bride [[Étaín]], who [[Midir]], king of the [[Underworld]], carries off from her earthly life after she has forgotten her past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Neil|title=Diu Crône and the medieval Arthurian cycle|year=2002|publisher=D.S.Brewer|isbn=0-85991-636-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNjGNu2w7WcC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear left}}

===French-inspired tradition===
[[File:Lancelot and Guinevere - Herbert James Draper.jpg|thumb|275px|''Lancelot and Guinevere'' by [[Herbert James Draper]] (c. 1890)|alt=]]

In French [[chivalric romance]]s and the later works based on them, including [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Guinevere is the daughter of King Leodegrance, who had served Arthur's father [[Uther Pendragon]] and was entrusted with the [[Round Table]] after Pendragon's death. In these histories, Leodegrance's kingdom typically lies near the [[Bretons|Breton]] city of Carhaise (the modern [[Carhaix-Plouguer]]). In the fields to the south and east of Carhaise, Arthur defends Leodegrance by defeating [[Rience]], which leads to his meeting and marriage with Guinevere. This version of the legend has Guinevere betrothed to Arthur early in his career, while he was garnering support. When Lancelot arrives later, she is instantly smitten, and they have an affair that in the end leads to Arthur's fall.

Their affair is eventually exposed by Guinevere's sorceress enemy [[Morgan le Fay]] and two of [[King Lot]]'s sons, [[Agravain]] and Mordred, and Lancelot escapes while Arthur reluctantly sentences his wife to be burned at the stake. Knowing Lancelot and his family would try to stop the execution, Arthur sends many of his knights to defend the pyre, though Gawain refuses to participate. Lancelot arrives with his kinsmen and followers and rescues the queen. Gawain's brothers [[Gaheris]] and [[Gareth]] are killed in the battle (among others, including fellow Knights of the Round [[Aglovale]], [[Segwarides]] and [[Sir Tor|Tor]]), sending Gawain into a rage so great that he pressures Arthur into a direct confrontation with Lancelot.

When Arthur goes to France to fight Lancelot, he leaves Guinevere in the care of Mordred, who plans to marry the queen himself and take Arthur's throne. In some versions of the tale, Guinevere assents to Mordred's proposal; in others, she hides in the [[Tower of London]] and later takes refuge in a nun [[convent]] at Almesbury. Hearing of the treachery, Arthur returns to Britain and slays Mordred at Camlann, but his wounds are so severe that he is taken to the isle of [[Avalon]] by Morgan. Guinevere meets Lancelot one last time, then returns to the convent where she spends the remainder of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Roberts|first1=Sandye|last2=Jones|first2=Arthur|title=Divine Intervention II: A Guide to Twin Flames, Soul Mates, and Kindred Spirits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYKT5aqg65QC&amp;pg=PA52|year=2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-1255-6}}, page=52&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear left}}

==In modern culture==
&lt;!-- there are lots of works, here are a sample handful singled out pretty much at random --&gt;

[[File:Ellen Terry as Guinevere costume by Burne-Jones.jpg|thumb|[[Ellen Terry]] as Guinevere in the play ''King Arthur'' by [[J. Comyns Carr]] in the Lyceum Theatre production, designed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], in an American postcard mailed January 12, 1895]]

Modern adaptations of Arthurian legend vary greatly in their depiction of Guinevere, largely because certain aspects of her story must be fleshed out by the modern author. In spite of her iconic doomed romance with Lancelot, a number of modern reinterpretations portray her as being manipulated into her affair with Lancelot (usually by [[Morgan le Fay]] or [[Lady of the Lake#Nimue|Nimue]]), with Arthur being her rightful true love. Others present her love for Lancelot as stemming from a relationship that existed prior to her arranged marriage to Arthur.

*In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', Gwenhwyfar is brought up by a cold, unloving father, which leaves her with a deep inferiority complex and intense agoraphobia. Failing to produce an heir and unable to be with the love of her life, Lancelot, she falls into a deep depression and – hoping for salvation – becomes an increasingly fanatical Christian. Bradley's version is notable for popularizing the Welsh spelling, which many subsequent writers have adopted.
*Lavinia Collins's ''Guinevere'' is a historical romance trilogy dealing with Guinevere's marriage to Arthur and the subsequent development of her relationship with Lancelot. Along with typical themes of the romance genre, this adaptation also deals with concepts of magic and religion and builds on Collins's reading of ''Le Morte d'Arthur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Collins, Lavinia|title=The Warrior Queen (The Guinevere Trilogy)|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/WARRIOR-QUEEN-Guinevere-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00IPRC0TE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393814952&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lavinia+collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the television series [[Merlin (2008 TV series)|''Merlin'']], Guinevere (called "Gwen" by most of the characters) is portrayed by [[Angel Coulby]] and is shown as the daughter of a blacksmith and maid to [[List of Merlin characters#Morgana Pendragon|Morgana]] along with being her best friend. [[Elyan the White]] is portrayed as her brother, and, eventually, one of Arthur's knights. At first, Guinevere is implied as the love interest of [[Merlin]] (who is far younger in the series than in usual tales) and is also shown as having an attraction to Lancelot. However in this version of the story, Guinevere's true love is Arthur. Gwen and Arthur marry, despite [[List of Merlin characters#Uther Pendragon|Uther]]'s and Morgana's attempts to keep them apart. Following Arthur's death, Gwen herself becomes Queen of Camelot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merlin|url=http://www.merlintvshow.com/|publisher=Merlin TV Series Fansite|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Guinevere is a supporting character in [[Gerald Morris]]' ''The Squire's Tales''. She starts the series as King Arthur's newly-wedded queen and ends it as Sister Arthur, peacefully living in a convent after Arthur's departure.
*Guinevere is a central character in the Broadway musical [[Camelot (musical)|''Camelot'']], in which she was initially portrayed by [[Julie Andrews]], then [[Sally Ann Howes]]. [[Vanessa Redgrave]] appeared in the film version of the musical.
*Guinevere appears in the animated series ''[[King Arthur's Disasters]]'', where she is voiced by [[Morwenna Banks]].
*In the television series ''[[Guinevere Jones]]'', Guinevere is reincarnated into the main protagonist Gwen Jones portrayed by [[Tamara Hope]].
*In the film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', Guinevere, played by British actress [[Keira Knightley]], is depicted as a [[Picts|Pictish]] princess in captivity of a Roman noble family in the far north of Britain. Arthur, charged by [[Germanus of Auxerre|Bishop Germanus]] with escorting the family to safety in light of an impending Saxon invasion, discovers her captivity and liberates her. While traveling back to Roman territory, she introduces Arthur to Merlin who attempts to persuade Arthur to lead the Picts (called Woads in the film) to battle the Saxon army. Once back in Roman territory, their relationship culminates in a brief romance, after which Arthur decides to remain at the Roman outpost to fight the Saxons at [[Hadrian's Wall]] while his knights return to Rome. In the climactic [[Battle of Badon|Battle of Badon Hill]], Guinevere leads a Pictish detachment of archers against the first wave of Saxon invaders, and is nearly killed in close-combat before being rescued by Lancelot. Following the battle, Arthur and Guinevere are married by Merlin in a ceremony at [[Stonehenge]].
*In the television series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'', Guinevere is depicted by [[Tamsin Egerton]]. An ambitious and strong-willed woman, she is a great support to Arthur and they develop a strong undeniable attraction. However, she is married to Leontes, one of Arthur's most loyal knights, which frustrates their relationship.
*Guinevere appears in ABC's television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', played by actress Joana Metrass. This version of Guinevere is portrayed with a noticeable [[Spanish language|Castilian]] accent.
*[[Bernard Cornwell]]'s Arthurian series of novels ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'' depicts Guinevere as the princess of Henis Wyren in [[North Wales]]. She is a devoted follower of the [[Ancient Egyptian]] goddess [[Isis]]. She has ambitions of becoming queen of [[Dumnonia]] and weds Arthur, who is the illegitimate son of Uther Pendragon in these novels. The character is fiercely anti-Christian.
*In the TV show ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' episode ''Camelot/3000'', Guinevere is portrayed by Canadian actress [[Elyse Levesque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/12/12/legends-tomorrow-elyse-levesque|title=Legends of Tomorrow books The Originals alum|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, she is a knight who became queen because of her loyalty to Merlin. In response to Sara letting her know of her affection for Guinevere; [[Sara Lance]] felt attraction to her, and after Merlin, who was actually [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]], confessed her love to King Arthur, she and Sara shared a kiss.
* In the ''[[Deverry Cycle]]'' book ''[[Darkspell]]'', the character of Gweniver is a warrior priestess sworn to the Goddess of the Moon in Her Darktime, also known as She of The Sword-Struck Heart. An inspirational warleader, Gweniver is a [[berserker]] in combat.
* In the American original version of the animated series ''[[Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders]]'', Gwenevere (Gwen) is the show's titular main heroine and protagonist, a daughter of Queen Anya and King Jared from the royal family of the magical kingdom of Avalon. As the series begins, she takes up the sacred Sun Stone and bonds with the flying unicorn named Sunstar to lead the all-girl Jewel Riders to rescue her mentor Merlin and defeat the witches Lady Kale (Gwen's evil aunt) and Morgana who want to rule Avalon. Gwenevere was renamed Starla for the show's international version, ''Starla and the Jewel Riders''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2788">'''Habiba bint Jahsh''' was a [[sahaba|companion]] of [[Muhammad]].

==Biography==

Her father was [[Jahsh ibn Riyab]], an immigrant from the [[Banu Asad|Asad ibn Khuzayma]] tribe who had settled in [[Mecca]] under the protection of [[Harb ibn Umayya]]. Her mother was [[Umama bint Abdulmuttalib]], a member of the [[Hashim]] clan of the [[Banu Quraysh|Quraysh]] tribe and a sister of Muhammad's father.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'' vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina'', p. 33. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Habiba and her five siblings were the first cousins of Muhammad.

Habiba was an early convert to [[Islam]]. She married [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]],&lt;ref&gt;Muslim 3:655; Muslim 3:659.&lt;/ref&gt; but was childless.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Habiba was among those who accompanied her brother [[Abd-Allah ibn Jahsh|Abdullah]] on the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'' to [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Ishaq, ''Sirat Rasul Allah''. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad'', p. 215. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habiba suffered from a gynaecological disorder and had constant bleeding for seven years. She consulted Muhammad about how to become ritually clean, and he advised her: "This is a vein. It is not menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Remain away (from prayer) equal (to the length of time) that your menstruation holds you back. After this, bathe yourself&lt;ref&gt;Muslim 3:659.&lt;/ref&gt; and pray."&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad p. 171; Muslim 3:655; Muslim 3:658; Abu Dawud 1:305.&lt;/ref&gt; Habiba went to the house of her sister [[Zaynab bint Jahsh|Zaynab]] (Muhammad's wife) and bathed in Zaynab's tub "till the redness of the blood came over the water"&lt;ref&gt;Muslim 3:655; Muslim 3:656.&lt;/ref&gt; and the tub was "full of blood".&lt;ref&gt;Muslim 3:658.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''hadith'' narrators believed that Muhammad had meant that Habiba should take the [[ghusl|ritual bath]] once a month like other women. However, of her own accord,&lt;ref&gt;Muslim 3:654.&lt;/ref&gt; Habiba thereafter took the bath before every prayer,&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad p. 171; Bukhari 1:6:324.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently five times a day.

In 628 Muhammad granted Habiba 30 ''wasqs'' of dates and grain from the revenues of [[Khaybar]].&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume/Ishaq p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note==

Habiba was known interchangeably as ''Umm Habib'': both are feminine forms of the name ''Habib'' ("beloved"). The Mesopotamian historian [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi|Muhammad ibn Saad]] referred to a tradition in which Habiba was confused with her sister [[Hammanah bint Jahsh|Hamna]], i.e., it was believed that ''Umm Habib'' was the ''kunya'' of Hamna. Ibn Saad asserts that this is not so: they were two people.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley/Saad vol. 8 p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hulbert Harrington Warner''' (1842–1923) was a [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester, New York]] businessman and philanthropist who made his fortune from the sales of [[patent medicine]].

==Biography==
He was born near [[Syracuse, New York]], in a small settlement called [[Warners, New York|Warners]].  Warners had been named for Warner's grandfather, Seth, who had moved there in 1807 from [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]]. In 1865, Warner moved to Michigan to engage in the stove and hardware business. In 1870, Warner moved to Rochester and entered into the first business that would make him a millionaire, selling fire- and burglar-proof safes. The demand for safes had escalated dramatically after the discovery of oil in western Pennsylvania; by decade's end, it is estimated that Warner and his sales agents had sold 60,000 safes worth an estimated $10 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000000|1880|r=3}}}} in present terms).

==Marriage and children==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
Warner was married twice. He married Martha L. Keeney of [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles, New York]] in 1864. Martha died suddenly in 1871, and is buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Skaneateles.

In 1872, Warner remarried, this time to Emily Olive Stoddard of Michigan. Although the details of his second marriage remain vague, it appears that Warner and Stoddard separated in 1893. It appears that the couple may have had one child, Maud, but there is little information available about her.

Warner later lived with Christina de Martinez of Mexico. Warner and Martinez were never actually married (and it appears that Warner and Stoddard were never divorced), but Martinez took Warner's name as her own and they resided in the same household after Warner moved to Minneapolis.

==Patent medicines==

=== Safe Cure{{Anchor|Safe Cure: The Beginning}} ===
[[File:Warner's Kidney and Liver Cure Bottle.jpg|thumb|Warner's Safe Kidney and Liver Cure amber bottle]]
Based upon the history recounted in Warner's early almanacs, Warner used a portion of the wealth he accumulated from the safe business to purchase the formula for a patent medicine from Dr. Charles Craig of Rochester. Warner developed an unexpectedly severe case of [[Bright's disease]], a kidney disease. While close to death, Warner used a vegetable concoction sold by Craig and was restored to health. Based upon his admiration for Craig's Original Kidney Cure, Warner purchased the formula and the rights to the product and in 1879 introduced Warner's Safe Kidney &amp; Liver Cure.

Although Warner's early publications herald Craig's potion as a revelation, references to Craig soon disappeared from Warner's advertising, and ultimately the two ended up in court when Craig attempted to reenter the patent medicine business with a cure remarkably similar to the one he had sold to Warner.

In addition to his Kidney &amp; Liver Cure, Warner also introduced a Safe Nervine, Safe Diabetes Cure, Safe Tonic, Safe Tonic Bitters, Safe Bitters, Safe Rheumatic Cure, Safe Pills, and later his Tippecanoe Bitters. The Warner's patent medicine products, with the exception of the Safe Pills and Tippecanoe, appeared in a unique bottle, which featured an embossed safe on the front. This drew upon his earlier business and implied to his potential customers that his product posed no risk.

In January, 1884, Warner opened his new Rochester headquarters in a lavish multi-story building on St. Paul Street. The [[H. H. Warner Building]] became the centerpiece of his medicine production and turned out an estimated {{Convert|7000|USgal|L}}  of Safe Cure per day. It also served as the headquarters for his promotional department, which published an untold number of almanac and advertising circulars distributed with his medicines to local druggists and grocers. The Warner Building still exists today and houses a variety of businesses. Its granite façade still bears the initial "W".

=== Log Cabin Remedies ===

In 1887, Warner introduced a new product line, which he called his '''Log Cabin Remedies'''. Unlike his Safe Cures, these products appeared in amber bottles with three slanted panels with the name of the particular remedy embossed. The bottles were in red, white, blue, and yellow boxes that featured the image of a log cabin viewed from a window. The Log Cabin Remedies did not replace the Safe Cure line; they only supplemented it. Warner realized that the nation was in a head-long race for expansion westward and his marketing pitch appealed to the American desire for self-reliance. Indeed, the entire thrust of Warner's marketing from its inception can best be described as appealing to his customer's desire to "heal thyself".

=== Warner's Foreign Offices ===

Based upon his success in marketing his Safe Cure products in the United States, Warner quickly decided to expand his operation internationally. In 1883, he opened offices in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and [[London]], [[England]]. The bottles from Toronto have become known as "3-Cities", because they featured the names of all of his offices at that time: Rochester, London, and Toronto.

In 1887, he opened offices in [[Melbourne, Australia]] and [[Frankfurt, Germany]]. In 1888, he expanded to Pressburg in Hungary; however, this office lasted only two years. In 1891, he opened an office in Dunedin, New Zealand; the bottles from that office have become known as "4-Cities", bearing the names of Rochester, Toronto, London, and Melbourne.  The Dundein office was likely little more than a laboratory and, in fact, bottles from the Melbourne and Dundein offices were likely produced in either Rochester or London and shipped to the southern-hemisphere offices due to the primitive state of glass production that existed there at the time.

Warner's advertising also boasts offices in Kreuslingen, Switzerland; Brussels; and Paris. No bottles with these cities embossed have ever appeared, and only one  bottle labeled in French is known to exist.

Warner's offices lasted well into the 20th century, with the Rochester office closing around 1944.

== Philanthropy and failure ==

Having made millions on his second business in patent medicine, Warner embarked on various philanthropic endeavors, most notably his sponsorship of the Warner Observatory in Rochester.

Prior to opening his patent medicine business, Warner had chanced to meet Dr. Lewis Swift, an astronomer, who was ready to leave Rochester for Colorado when Warner convinced him to stay and operate his new observatory. The observatory was completed in 1883 at the then-staggering cost of $100,000 (in current terms, $${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1883|r=3}}}}). It was equipped with a state-of-the-art telescope and was pronounced as being the best-equipped private observatory in the world.

The Observatory was used as a marketing centerpiece by Warner. His almanacs at the time ran essay contents and featured images of the Observatory. Swift used the Observatory to good end, and reportedly discovered six new comets and 900 nebulae.

At one point, Warner offered a reward of $200 for each new comet discovered. This offer was of great help to the young astronomer [[Edward Emerson Barnard]], who claimed eight such awards and used the proceeds to set himself and his new wife up in a newly built house in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

Astronomer Swift and his telescope left Rochester in 1894. The Observatory was demolished in December, 1931.

Warner also used his money to construct a lavish mansion for himself on East Avenue in Rochester. The house fell into disuse and was later demolished.

Warner's patent-medicine empire reached its pinnacle in the late 1880s and began its gradual decline. Flush with success, Warner spent money on highly speculative investments in mining, all of which failed. In an effort to generate more capital, he took the company public, which did generate some revenue.

He sold the company to an English investment group in 1889, which incorporated it as '''H. H. Warner &amp; Co., Ltd'''. Warner bought up 80 percent of the English stock, and took the position of managing director of the company. However, Warner's speculative investments and his waning interest in the business took its toll. When the [[Panic of 1893]] hit, Warner was unable to generate additional capital through stock sales, forcing him into bankruptcy. The American branch of his company was sold to a group of Rochester investors, who continued to operate it as the '''Warner's Safe Remedies Company'''.

== Life After Safe Cure ==

After failing in Rochester, Warner lived for a time in [[New York City]], then moved to [[Philadelphia]], where he may have attempted to start a new patent medicine business, although this is unconfirmed. He ultimately landed in [[Minneapolis]], where he promoted the '''Nuera Manufacturing Co.''', also known as Neura Remedy Co., with the help of his common-law wife Christina de Martinez. He also operated the '''Warner Renowned Remedies Company''', which produced some products offered by mail order.

Warner died in January, 1923, and is buried alongside his first wife, Martha, in Lakeview Cemetery in Skaneateles, NY.

His legacy is his patent medicine empire that produced remedies sold around the world as well as the bottles in which those remedies were contained. The bottles are prized by collectors.

{{History of Hungary}}
'''Hungarians''', also known as '''Magyars''' ({{lang-hu|magyarok}}), are a nation and [[ethnic group]] native to [[Hungary]] ({{lang-hu|Magyarország}}) and historical Hungarian lands who share a common [[Hungarian culture|culture]], [[Hungarian history|history]] and speak the [[Hungarian language]]. Hungarians belong to the [[Uralic peoples|Uralic speaking peoples]]. There are an estimated 13.1–14.7 million ethnic Hungarians and their descendants worldwide, of whom 8.5–9.8 million live in today's Hungary (as of 2011).&lt;ref name="Eurostat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tgs00079&amp;plugin=1|title=Population and living conditions in Urban Audit cities, core city - Total population in Urban Audit cities|publisher=Eurostat|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820070523/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tgs00079&amp;|archivedate=20 August 2012|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2.2 million Hungarians live in areas that were part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] before the [[Treaty of Trianon]] and are now parts of Hungary's seven neighbouring countries, especially [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Serbia|Serbia]], [[Hungarians of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Hungarian diaspora|Slovenia]] and [[Hungarian diaspora|Austria]]. [[Hungarian diaspora|Significant groups]] of people with Hungarian ancestry live in various other parts of the world, most of them in the [[Hungarian American|United States]], [[Hungarian Canadians|Canada]], [[Hungarians in Germany|Germany]], [[France]], the [[Hungarians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Hungarian Brazilian|Brazil]], [[Hungarian Australian|Australia]], and [[Hungarians in Argentina|Argentina]]. Hungarians can be classified into several subgroups according to local linguistic and cultural characteristics; subgroups with distinct identities include the [[Székelys]], the [[Csangos|Csángós]], the [[Palóc]], the [[Matyó]] and the [[Jasz people|Jász]] people, the last being considered an Iranic ethnic group being closely related to the [[Ossetians]].

== Name ==
{{further|Name of Hungary}}
The Hungarians' own ethnonym to  denote themselves in the Early Middle Ages is uncertain. The [[exonym]] "Hungarian" is thought to be derived from  Oghur-Turkic ''On-Ogur'' (literally "Ten Arrows" or "Ten Tribes"). Another possible explanation comes from the [[Old Russian]] "[[Yugra]]" ("Югра"). It may refer to the Hungarians during a time when they dwelt east of the [[Ural Mountains]] along the natural borders of Europe and Asia before their conquest of the Carpathian Basin.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s. v. "Ugrian": "''Ugri'', the name given by early Russian writers to a Finno-Ugric people dwelling east of the Ural Mountains".&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] in 895/6 and while they lived on the [[Etelköz|steppes of Eastern Europe]] east of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], written sources called the Magyars "Hungarians", specifically: "Ungri" by [[Georgius Monachus]] in 837, "Ungri" by ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' in 862, and "Ungari" by the ''[[Annales ex Annalibus Iuvavensibus]]'' in 881.

==History==

===Pre-4th century AD===
{{Main article|Hungarian prehistory}}
During the 4th millennium BC, the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]-speaking peoples who were living in the central and southern regions of the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] split up. Some dispersed towards the west and northwest and came into contact with [[Iranian languages|Iranian speakers]] who were spreading northwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=András|last=Róna-Tas|title=Hungarians and Europe in the Early Middle Ages|year=1999|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least 2000&amp;nbsp;BC onwards, the [[Ugric languages|Ugrian]] speakers became distinguished from the rest of the Uralic community, of which the ancestors of the Magyars, being located farther south, were the most numerous. Judging by evidence from burial mounds and settlement sites, they interacted with the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] [[Andronovo culture]].&lt;ref name=Blench&gt;{{cite book |last=Blench |first=Roger |authorlink= |author2=Matthew Briggs |editor= |others= |title=Archaeology and Language |origyear= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DWMHhfXxLaIC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=Hungarian+people+settlements+Andronovo+Culture+ |accessdate=2008-05-21 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location= |language= |isbn=0-415-11761-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=210 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4th century to c. 830===
[[File:UralMountains1.png|right|upright=0.7|thumb|The possible [[Hungarian prehistory#The Hungarian Urheimat|homeland of the Hungarians]], situated in the Southern Urals.]]

In the 4th and 5th centuries&amp;nbsp;AD, the Hungarians moved from the west of the Ural Mountains to the area between the southern Ural Mountains and the [[Volga River]] known as Bashkiria ([[Bashkortostan]]) and [[Perm Krai]]. In the early 8th century, some of the Hungarians moved to the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] to an area between the Volga, Don and the [[Seversky Donets]] rivers.&lt;ref name="HungaryEarlyHistory"/&gt; Meanwhile, the descendants of those Hungarians who stayed in [[Bashkortostan|Bashkiria]] remained there as late as 1241.

The Hungarians around the Don River were subordinates of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] [[khagan]]ate. Their neighbours were the archaeological [[Saltov Culture]], i.e. Bulgars (Proto-Bulgarians, [[Onogurs]]) and the [[Alans]], from whom they learned gardening, elements of cattle breeding and of agriculture. Tradition holds that the Hungarians were organized in a confederacy of seven tribes. The names of the seven tribes were: ''Jenő'', ''Kér'', ''Keszi'', ''Kürt-Gyarmat'', ''Megyer'', ''Nyék'', and ''Tarján''.

===c. 830 to c. 895===
Around 830, a rebellion broke out in the Khazar khaganate. As a result, three [[Kabar]] tribes&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Sugar, Péter Hanák, [[Tibor Frank]], A History of Hungary, Indiana University Press, 1994 page 11.

The Hungarians faced their first attack by the [[Pechenegs]] around 854,&lt;ref name="HungaryEarlyHistory"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+hu0013)|title=A Country Study: Hungary|publisher=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]|chapter=Early History|accessdate=6 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029114728/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+hu0013%29|archivedate=29 October 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other sources state that an attack by Pechenegs was the reason for their departure to Etelköz. The new neighbours of the Hungarians were the [[Varangians]] and the eastern [[Slavs]]. From 862 onwards, the Hungarians (already referred to as the ''Ungri'') along with their allies, the Kabars, started a series of looting raids from the Etelköz into the Carpathian Basin, mostly against the [[East Francia|Eastern Frankish Empire]] (Germany) and [[Great Moravia]], but also against the [[Balaton principality]] and [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenagain.info/WebChron/EastEurope/Magyars.html |title=Magyars |publisher=Thenagain.info |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entering the Carpathian Basin (c. 895)===
{{Main article|Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Pannonian basin before Hungary}}
[[File:Magyarok-Bejovetele-ChroniconPictum.jpg|thumb|[[Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin]], from the [[Chronicon Pictum]], 1360.]]

In 895/896, under the leadership of [[Árpád]], some Hungarians crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and entered the [[Carpathian Basin]]. The tribe called Magyar was the leading tribe of the Hungarian alliance that conquered the centre of the basin. At the same time (c. 895), due to their involvement in the 894–896 [[Byzantine–Bulgarian wars|Bulgaro-Byzantine war]], Hungarians in Etelköz were attacked by Bulgaria and then by their old enemies the Pechenegs. The [[Bulgarians]] won the decisive [[battle of Southern Buh]]. It is uncertain whether or not those conflicts were the cause of the Hungarian departure from Etelköz.

From the upper [[Tisza]] region of the Carpathian Basin, the Hungarians intensified their looting raids across continental Europe. In 900, they moved from the upper Tisza river to Transdanubia ([[Pannonia]]),{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} which later became the core of the arising Hungarian state. At the time of the Hungarian migration, the land was inhabited only by a sparse population of Slavs, numbering about 200,000,&lt;ref name="HungaryEarlyHistory"/&gt; who were either assimilated or enslaved by the Hungarians.&lt;ref name="HungaryEarlyHistory"/&gt;

Archaeological findings (e.g. in the [[Poland|Polish]] city of [[Przemyśl]]) suggest that many Hungarians remained to the north of the Carpathians after 895/896.&lt;ref&gt;Koperski, A.: Przemyśl (Lengyelország). In: A honfoglaló magyarság. Kiállítási katalógus. Bp. 1996. pp. 439–448.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a consistent Hungarian population in [[Transylvania]], the Székelys, who comprise 40% of the [[Hungarians in Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnic Groups and Population Changes in Twentieth-century Central-Eastern Europe|author=Piotr Eberhardt|publisher=M.

=== After 900===
{{main article| Hungarian invasions of Europe}}

In 907, the Hungarians destroyed a [[Bavaria]]n army in the [[Battle of Pressburg]] and laid the territories of present-day Germany, France, and Italy open to Hungarian raids, which were fast and devastating. The Hungarians defeated the Imperial Army of [[Louis the Child]], son of [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] and last legitimate descendant of the German branch of the house of [[Charlemagne]], near [[Augsburg]] in 910. From 917 to 925, Hungarians raided through [[Basle]], [[Alsace]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Saxony]], and [[Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Wyley |url=http://www.geocities.com/egfrothos/magyars/magyars.html |title=The Hungarians of Hungary |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2013-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027151814/http://www.geocities.com/egfrothos/magyars/magyars.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian expansion was checked at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955, ending their raids against [[Western Europe]], but raids on the [[Balkan Peninsula]] continued until 970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/eceurope/xkgdhungary.html |title=History of Hungary, 895–970 |publisher=Zum.de |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pope]] approved Hungarian settlement in the area when their leaders converted to [[Christianity]], and [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. King Stephen I]] (''Szent István'') was crowned King of Hungary in 1001.

[[File:Magyars 900-1980.png|thumb|left|Population growth of Hungarians (900–1980)]]

At this time, the Hungarian nation numbered around 400,000 people.&lt;ref name="HungaryEarlyHistory"/&gt; The first accurate measurements of the population of the Kingdom of Hungary including ethnic composition were carried out in 1850–51. There is a debate among Hungarian and non-Hungarian (especially [[Slovaks|Slovak]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]]) historians about the possible changes in the ethnic structure of the region throughout history.

[[File:Dunamenti viseletek 1822.jpg|thumb|upright|Traditional Hungarian costumes, 1822]]

Other historians, particularly Slovaks and Romanians, argue that the drastic change in the ethnic structure hypothesized by Hungarian historians in fact did not occur. They argue that the Hungarians accounted for only about 30–40%{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} of the Kingdom's population from its establishment. In particular, there is a [[Origin of the Romanians|fierce debate]] among Hungarians and Romanian historians about the ethnic composition of [[Transylvania]] through these times.

In the 19th century, the proportion of Hungarians in the Kingdom of Hungary rose gradually, reaching over 50% by 1900 due to higher natural growth and [[Magyarization]]. Between 1787 and 1910 the number of ethnic Hungarians rose from 2.3 million to 10.2 million, accompanied by the resettlement of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] and [[Voivodina]] by mainly [[Roman Catholic]] Hungarian settlers from the northern and western counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1715 (after the Ottoman occupation), the [[Southern Great Plain]] was nearly uninhabited but now has 1.3 million inhabitants, nearly all of them Hungarians.

Spontaneous assimilation was an important factor, especially among the German and Jewish minorities and the citizens of the bigger towns. On the other hand, about 1.5 million people (about two-thirds non-Hungarian) left the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between 1890–1910 to escape from [[poverty]].&lt;ref name="immigrants"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jonathan|last1=Lee|author2=Robert Siemborski|url=http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Immigration/waves_of_immigration.html|title=Peaks/waves of immigration|publisher=bergen.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970616234806/http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Immigration/waves_of_immigration.html|archivedate=16 June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum failed due to insufficient [[voter turnout]]. On 26 May 2010, Hungary's Parliament passed a bill granting dual citizenship to ethnic Hungarians living outside of Hungary. Some neighboring countries with sizable Hungarian minorities expressed concerns over the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hungary Citizenship Bill Irks Neighbor |author=Veronika Gulyas |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2010/05/26/hungary-angers-neighbor-with-citizenship-bill |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study states that mtDNA sub-clades like H5a1m, T2a1c, and W3a1d1, which were found in recent Hungarian samples, imply that the Hungarians, Estonians and Finns share pan-European relationships. The molecular dating of the identified mtDNA sub-clades shows that their age exceeds the estimated time of the Hungarian-Slavic contact period in the Carpathian Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00438-018-1458-x| pmid=29948329|title = Whole mitochondrial genome diversity in two Hungarian populations| journal=Molecular Genetics and Genomics| volume=293| issue=5| pages=1255–1263|year = 2018|last1 = Malyarchuk|first1 = Boris| last2=Derenko| first2=Miroslava| last3=Denisova| first3=Galina| last4=Litvinov| first4=Andrey| last5=Rogalla| first5=Urszula| last6=Skonieczna| first6=Katarzyna| last7=Grzybowski| first7=Tomasz| last8=Pentelényi| first8=Klára| last9=Guba| first9=Zsuzsanna| last10=Zeke| first10=Tamás| last11=Molnár| first11=Mária Judit}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results reflect that Slavs, Finn-Ugrians and other European peoples shared a common genetic substratum on the steppes of Eastern Europe.

Another study on [[Y-Chromosome]] markers concluded that "modern Hungarian and [[Székelys|Székely]] populations are genetically closely related", and that they "share similar components described for other Europeans, except for the presence of the [[haplogroup P (Y-DNA)|haplogroup P]]*(xM173) in Székely samples, which may reflect a [[Central Asian]] connection, and high frequency of [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J]] in both Székelys and Hungarians".&lt;ref name="CsányiBogácsi-Szabó2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Csányi|first1=B.|last2=Bogácsi-Szabó|first2=E.|last3=Tömöry|first3=Gy.|last4=Czibula|first4=Á.|last5=Priskin|first5=K.|last6=Csõsz|first6=A.|last7=Mende|first7=B.|last8=Langó|first8=P.|last9=Csete|first9=K.|last10=Zsolnai|first10=A.|last11=Conant|first11=E.

A 2007 study on the [[mtDNA]], after precising that "Hungarians are unique among the other European populations because according to history the ancient [[Magyars]] had come from the eastern side of the [[Ural Mountains]] and settled down in the [[Carpathian basin]] in the 9th century AD", shows that the [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]], "characteristic mainly for Asian populations", is "found in approximately 5% of the total", which thus "suggests that an Asian matrilineal ancestry, even if in a small incidence, can be detected among modern Hungarians."&lt;ref&gt;Nadasi E. ; Gyurus P. ; Czakó M. ; Bene J. ; Kosztolányi S. ; Fazekas S. ; Dömösi P. ; Melegh B.

According to a 2008 study, the mitochondrial lines of the Hungarians are indistinct from that of neighbouring [[West Slavs]], but they are distinct from that of the ancient Hungarians (Magyars). Four 10th century skeletons from well documented cemeteries in Hungary of ancient [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] individuals were sampled.&lt;ref name="csanyi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Csányi|first1=B.|last2=Bogácsi-Szabó|first2=E.|last3=Tömöry|first3=Gy.|last4=Czibula|first4=Á.|last5=Priskin|first5=K.|last6=Csõsz|first6=A.|last7=Mende|first7=B.|last8=Langó|first8=P.|last9=Csete|first9=K.|last10=Zsolnai|first10=A.|last11=Conant|first11=E.

None out of 100 sampled modern Hungarians carried the haplogroup, and just one of about 94 [[Székelys]] carried it. The study also stated that it was possible that the more numerous pre-existing populations or substantional later migrations, mostly Avars and [[Slavs]], accepted the Uralic language of the elite.&lt;ref name="csanyi"/&gt;

An [[autosomal]] analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Science, 14 February 2014, Vol. 343 no. 6172, p. 751, A Genetic Atlas of Human Admixture History, Garrett Hellenthal at al.: "CIs. for the admixture time(s) overlap but predate the Mongol empire, with estimates from 440 to 1080 CE ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209567/figure/F3/ Fig.3.]) In each population, one source group has at least some ancestry related to Northeast Asians, with ~2 to 4% of these groups total ancestry linking directly to East Asia. This signal might correspond to a small genetic legacy from invasions of peoples from the Asian steppes (e.g., the Huns, Magyars, and Bulgars) during the first millennium CE."&lt;/ref&gt; studying non-European admixture in Europeans, found 4.4% of admixture of non-European and non-Middle Eastern origin among Hungarians, which was the strongest among sampled populations.

Compared to the European nations, Andrea Vágó-Zalán's study determined that the Bulgarians were genetically the closest and the Estonians and Finns were among the furthest from the recent Hungarian population.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Vágó-Zalán, [http://teo.elte.hu/minosites/ertekezes2012/vago-zalan_a.pdf A magyar populáció genetikai elemzése nemi kromoszómális markerek alapján], ELTE TTK Biológia Doktori Iskola, 2012, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pamjav Horolma's study, which is based on 230 samples and expected to include 6-8% [[Romani people|Gypsy peoples]], the small Hungarian haplogroup distribution study from Hungary is as follows: 26% R1a, 20% I2a, 19% R1b, 7% I, 6% J2, 5% H, 5% G2a, 5% E1b1b1a1, 3% J1, &lt;1% N, &lt;1% R2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51043486|title=Genetic Structure of the Paternal Lineage of the Roma People (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another study by Pamjav, the area of [[Bodrogköz]] suggested to be a population isolate found an elevated frequency of Haplogroup N: R1a-M458 (20.4%), I2a1-P37 (19%), R1a-Z280 (14.3%), and E1b-M78 (10.2%). Various R1b-M343 subgroups accounted for 15% of the Bodrogköz population. Haplogroup N1c-Tat covered 6.2% of the lineages, but most of it belonged to the N1c-VL29 subgroup, which is more frequent among [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] speaking than Finno-Ugric speaking peoples.

In an attempt to divide N into subgroups L1034 and L708, some Hungarian, [[Székely]], and Uzbek samples were found to be L1034 SNP positive, while all Mongolians, [[Buryats]], [[Khanty people|Khanty]], Finnish, and Roma samples showed a negative result for this marker. The 2500 years old SNP L1034 was found typical for [[Mansi people|Mansi]] and Hungarians, the closest linguistic relatives.&lt;ref&gt;A limited genetic link between Mansi and Hungarians&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the various peoples mentioned above, the Magyars later assimilated or were influenced by other populations in the Carpathian Basin. Among these are the [[Cumans]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Jasz people|Jazones]], [[West Slavs]], [[Germans]], [[Vlachs]] ([[Romanians]]), amongst others. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who occupied the central part of Hungary from c. 1526 until c. 1699, inevitably exerted an influence, as did the various nations (Germans, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats, and others) that resettled depopulated territories after their departure. Similar to other European countries, [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]], [[Armenians]], and [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsy) minorities have been living in Hungary since the Middle Ages.

'''Hamid Cheriet''' (in [[kabyle language]] '''Ḥamid Ceryat''' better known by his [[stage name]] '''Idir''' or '''Yidir''') is an [[Algerian people|Algerian]] singer and [[musician]] born on October 25,1949 in Ath Yenni ([[ Tizi Ouzou Province]]), [[Algeria]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Biography ==
Idir was born in Ath Yenni, a [[Berber people|Berber]] village in [[Kabylie|Haute-Kabylie]]. This farmer's son started studying Geology and was destined for a career in the petroleum industry before his rise to stardom. Idir has been the ambassador of the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] culture, especially the Kabyle music, with only his vocals and acoustic guitar. Idir has always used his status to claim his Berber (Amazigh) identity. His first album ''[[A Vava Inouva (album)|A Vava Inouva]]''  came out in 1976, and the song "[[A Vava Inouva]]" was translated into seven languages. After notable success, Idir wrote and recorded his second album ''Ay Arrac Negh'' (meaning To our children) in 1979.

Idir restarted his career again with the release of a compilation in 1991 of seventeen songs from his first two albums "A Vava Inouva" and "Ay Arrac Negh".

In 1993, a new album ''Les Chasseurs de Lumières" (The Light Hunters) appeared on the Blue Silver label. "Les Chasseurs de lumières" is about (his) predilection, love, freedom and exile (which he had known since he moved to the Paris region in 1975). The acoustic guitar gives to the songs of this album a touch of modernism. We can also hear the voice of the Breton singer Alan Stivell in the duo "Isaltiyen".

Idir restarted his career once again with ''Identités'' in 1999, a tribute album which joined numerous artists together including [[Manu Chao]], [[Dan Ar Braz]], [[Maxime Le Forestier]], and [[Karen Matheson]] for a "A Vava Inouva 2".  Also included were [[Gnawa Diffusion]], [[Zebda]], [[Gilles Servat]], [[Geoffrey Oryema]] and the [[Orchestre National de Barbès]].

In 2008, he had a single with "Tout ce temps" written by [[Zaho]]. He insisted that she join in for the release of the single as a duo.

Idir is also the writer of "A tulawin", a song made famous by [[Manu Chao]]'s version named "Denia" (Poor Algeria), in his album ''[[Próxima Estación: Esperanza]]''.

== Identity and activism ==
[[Image:Idir illustration artlibre jnl.gif|130px|thumb|left|Idir]]
Idir has participated in many concerts supporting different causes. For example, on June 22, 1995, more than 6,000 people attended a concert for peace, freedom and tolerance performed by the singer and his friend [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]], initiators of the association "l'Algérie, la vie" (Algeria and life). Idir also took part in the concert in memory of [[Matoub Lounes]], the Kabyle singer who was assassinated in 1998.

Idir defended his national identity once again at "Le Zénith" in Paris in the spring of 2001 at the "21st Berber Spring", a celebration of Berber culture. And on July 8, he organised a special fund-raising concert to support the population in [[Kabylie]] when anti-government riots rocked the cradle of Berber culture in the summer of 2001. Idir was joined by a number of stars and thousands of Algerian and French fans who turned out to "Le Zénith" to support the population in Kabylie.

'''John Frank Dalton''' (March 8, 1848{{spaced ndash}}August 15, 1951)&lt;ref&gt;Dalton's birthdate has not been definitively established at this time. Some sources claim he was born on April 17, 1844 (either in or near Lexington, Kentucky - somewhere in Frankfort, Kentucky - or someplace in Scott County, Kentucky), while other sources claim he was born on March 8, 1848 at Goliad, Goliad County, Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalton contributed about 20 pages of material to ''The Crittenden Memoirs'' (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1936), a book compiled by Henry Huston Crittenden (1859-1943). The section of the book written by Dalton is titled "Outlawry - Frank Dalton's Pen Pictures" ( comprising pages 355-374 of the book). Dalton's material in ''The Crittenden Memoirs'' consists primarily of articles and letters he had written previously to 1936, most of which had already been published in various newspapers (notably in two Texas newspapers: ''The Gladewater Times'' and ''The Henderson Times'') prior to their publication in the book. Dalton himself states, at two different places in this material (on pages 363 and 372 of the book), that he was born on March 8, 1848.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalton applied for a Confederate veteran pension from the state of Texas. His application was filed on March 19, 1947, and it was approved on August 19, 1947. There is contradictory information on his birth date in this pension file. One letter in the file states that according to a "notice" filed with his pension application, Dalton was born in April 1844, while other paperwork in the file states Dalton was born on March 8, 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; was a man who, in the last few years (1948-1951) of his long life, publicly claimed to be the famous outlaw [[Jesse James]]. However, most professional historians believe that Dalton was merely a Jesse James impostor, and that the real Jesse James was killed by [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert "Bob" Ford]] on April 3, 1882, in a house Jesse was renting located at 1318 Lafayette Street in St. Joseph, Missouri.

With the death of Jesse James in 1882, and the subsequent death of his (Dalton's) wife Julia Ellen Groshon during childbirth in 1886, Dalton abandoned his children and began roaming the countryside.  In the 1930s and 1940s he appeared in Independence County, Arkansas, telling tales of being Jesse James, and on other occasions he told tales of being the famous Western lawman John Franklin "Frank" Dalton (June 8, 1859 - November 27, 1887), thus earning himself a meal.  By the 1940s he was in Oklahoma and Texas, where his uncle lived and he had relatives. It was in Texas that he first claimed he was the same Frank Dalton who historians believe had been killed in 1887.  When it was proved that he wasn't the original Frank Dalton (1859-1887), in April, 1948 - in Lawton, Oklahoma - he took up being Jesse James instead.

Dalton was allegedly 100 years old at the time of his first public appearance as Jesse James - at Lawton, Oklahoma in April–May, 1948. Like the real Jesse James, Dalton apparently had been a [[Confederate States of America|pro-Confederate]] [[Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War|guerrilla]] in Missouri during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. However, Dalton's account of himself as Jesse James did not hold up under questioning from Jesse James' surviving relatives.&lt;ref name="lies"&gt;[[Dale L. Walker|Walker, Dale L.]] ''Legends and Lies: Great Mysteries of the American West''. New York, NY: [[Tor Books|Forge Books]], 1997. pp. 87-110. {{ISBN|0-312-86848-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, several people of note, such as journalist/novelist [[Robert Ruark]],&lt;ref&gt;In 1949 Dalton was living in a cabin on the grounds of Meramec Caverns (near Stanton, Missouri), courtesy of Lester B. Dill, who owned the caverns. Ruark interviewed Dalton there, and on the basis of what he learned during the interview, Ruark wrote 3 articles about Dalton, which were published in various newspapers across the United States (published in early July 1949). It appears that each newspaper in which they were published gave the articles a different title, but the actual content of the articles was kept the same nationwide. Some of the titles of these articles are as follows: "Evidence Supports Story That Jesse James is Alive" (''Herald-Journal'' of Spartanburg, South Carolina, July 6, 1949, p. 3), "Is Jesse James Still Alive?" (''The Evening Independent'' of St. Petersburg, Florida, July 7, 1949, p. 14), "He's Bandit - Case Airtight" (''Salt Lake Tribune'' of Salt Lake City, Utah, July 7, 1949, p. 12), and "Uncle Jesse Looks and Acts Like Real James" (''The Evening Independent'' of St. Petersburg, Florida, July 9, 1949, p. 10).&lt;/ref&gt; were convinced that J. Frank Dalton was the famous outlaw Jesse Woodson James. To many people's surprise, Dalton did appear to have many of the unique body marks/body features which the real Jesse James was rumored to have. These body features included: seven bullet wounds, a rope burn around his neck, a collapsed lung, a damaged fingertip, and severely burned feet.

On September 5, 1949, Rudi Turilli&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Oswald "Rudy" Turilli (March 17, 1919 - July 19, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; and Lester B. Dill&lt;ref&gt;Lester Benton Dill (Nov. 28, 1898 - Aug. 13, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; (the general manager and owner, respectively, of Meramec Caverns, near Stanton, Missouri) hosted a reunion at Meramec Caverns for Dalton and his last-remaining old-time friends, in celebration of Dalton's/Jesse James' supposed 102nd birthday.&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;Rudy Turilli - ''I Knew Jesse James'' (Stanton, MO: Rudy Turilli, 1966), pp. 11-69.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
J. Frank Dalton died on August 15, 1951, in [[Granbury, Texas]], and his death certificate was recorded with the name of the man he claimed to be.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Death Index, Name: Jesse [sic] Woodson [sic] James [sic], Date: Aug. 15, 1951, County: Hood, Cert. No.: 42235.&lt;/ref&gt; His gravestone in Granbury Cemetery also has that claimed identity recorded on it.

==Possibility of the name "J. Frank Dalton" being an alias==
Considerable evidence exists that the name "J. Frank Dalton" (in full: John Frank Dalton) was itself just an alias that this man used.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesse James Was One of His Names - The Greatest Cover Up in History by the Famous Outlaw Who Lived 73 Incredible Lives'' (Arcadia, CA: Santa Anita Press, 1975) - by Del Schrader (1917-1982) and Jesse James III (Orvus Lee Howk) (1905-1984)&lt;/ref&gt; While a resident of the Roper Hotel in Marble Falls, Texas, in the 1940s, J. Frank Dalton claimed to be the presumed dead [[Frank Dalton]], a U.S. Marshall for the Oklahoma Territory under Judge [[Isaac Charles Parker]]. The original Frank Dalton was the older brother to the infamous Dalton Gang members and a touring member of Wild Bill Hickok’s Wild West show. The real Frank Dalton was believed to have died Nov. 27, 1887 while in the line of duty.&lt;ref&gt;"Who was that tall, bearded stranger?" - McNabb, Betty. The Highlander, November 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==What Dalton said about himself and Jesse James in ''The Crittenden Memoirs'' (1936)==
In ''The Crittenden Memoirs'' (1936), a man who refers to himself as "Frank Dalton" writes in detail about the death of Jesse James, claiming that he (Dalton) was present when reporters, law enforcement officers, and locals gathered to witness the scene, and where Bob Ford confessed. Dalton demonstrates an awareness of the general lack of understanding surrounding the details of the death:

"Why was Jesse James killed? Why was it thought by many that the man killed by Bob Ford was not Jesse James? Why did Aunt Zerelda (Jesse's mother) at first deny that the murdered man was her boy? These things have never been told at all, or grossly misrepresented in the telling." Dalton goes on to say that he is aware of others' efforts to pose as Jesse, saying:

"Of course, Jesse has been seen alive from time to time by cheap notoriety seekers. Once a cowboy came up from the Argentine and said that Jesse was ranching and doing well down there. When this report was sifted down, it was found that the man taken for Jesse was a younger son of an English lord.  A few years ago a banker in a West Texas town died, and the report was spread that he was Jesse James. More recently a fellow popped up claiming to be Jesse! How the heck do they get that way, loco weed, or what?  No! Jesse James was killed by Bob Ford on the 3rd of April, 1882, in St. Joseph, Mo., there were too many people who knew him well and came to identify him for there to be any possible doubt, so that is that."&lt;ref&gt;''The Crittenden Memoirs'', pg. 363-4, http://genforum.genealogy.com/james/messages/31025.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the "Frank Dalton" of ''The Crittenden Memoirs'' and J. Frank Dalton were the same person, but the evidence and self-declared inside knowledge strongly suggest they were.

==Dalton surfaces as Jesse James in his affidavit of April 24, 1948==
The following affidavit (signed by J. Frank Dalton in the presence of Reece L. Russell, notary public, in Lawton, Oklahoma on April 24, 1948) appeared in full on the front page of ''The Lawton Constitution'' newspaper, issue of Wednesday, May 19, 1948:

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That I, J. Frank Dalton, being of sound mind and body, wish to state that I am the son of Robert James, a Baptist minister, and Zerelda Cole, and that I was born at Centerville, Missouri, on September 5, 1847. The town of Centerville was later changed to Kearney, Missouri, same being located and situated in the present County of Clay, the State of Missouri. I have used many different names and aliases over many years, but my real name is and always has been JESSE WOODSON JAMES. My full brother was ALEXANDER FRANK JAMES, four years older than myself. We were members of QUANTRILL'S MISSOURI IRREGULARS that fought through the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy, later we became outlaws or bandits who operated over a wide area of several states.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I hereunto set my hand and seal this the 24th day of April, 1948.

(Signed) J. Frank Dalton

==Robert Ruark interviews Dalton in June 1949==
Ever since the time of the murder on April 3, 1882, there has been a small but steady stream of witnesses and researchers who believe that Jesse James faked his death in 1882 and then adopted an alias. The majority of those who subscribe to this "murder hoax" theory believe the real murder victim was Charles "Charley" Bigelow, an undercover Pinkerton detective who was posing as Jesse James and committing robberies - thus incurring the wrath and vengeance of the real Jesse James. This theory holds that there was a "murder hoax conspiracy" involving several people (all close friends of the real Jesse James), who conspired together to murder someone, and who then all swore before the investigating officials that the murder victim was Jesse James. The goal of the conspirators was to manipulate and/or "control" the murder evidence in such a way that the law enforcement and judicial authorities involved in investigating the murder would certify that Jesse was legally dead, thus setting Jesse James free.

In 1949, J. Frank Dalton was living in a cabin on the grounds of Meramec Caverns, courtesy of Lester B. Dill who owned the caverns. In June 1949 the journalist Robert C. Ruark interviewed Dalton there, and then published some of what Dalton told him in a series of 3 newspaper articles which were published in early July 1949 in newspapers across the United States. Following is what J. Frank Dalton told Ruark concerning the Jesse James murder hoax. This information is excerpted verbatim from Ruark's article titled "Uncle Jesse Looks and Acts Like Real James" (''The Evening Independent'', St. Petersburg, Florida, July 9, 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;10):

"Stanton, Mo. - The old man who looks, acts, and talks like Jesse James, and who claims, at 102 years of age, to be Jesse James, says that the man who was killed and buried as Jesse James was a fellow named Charlie Bigelow.

. . . The old man says he had him a string of runnin' horses, and two come down with distemper. 'I fetched 'em to St. Joe to isolate 'em,' he said. 'I had a house there I was not usin' for a spell - not until after some runnin' races at Excelsior Springs. This fellow Charlie Bigelow looked enough like me to be my twin, and he was huntin' a house. I told him and his wife they could use my place for a spell, until after the races, and he moved in.

One day I was out in the barn doctorin' my horses when I heard a gunshot in the house. When I heerd that gun go off I knowed it wasn't no play-party, because we argued with guns in them days. I run into the house and there was Bob Ford, standing over Bigelow with a gun in his hand and blood on the floor. I said to Ford, 'Looks like you killed him, Bob,' and Bob says, 'Looks like I did, Jesse.' Then I says, 'This is my chance, Bob. You tell 'em its me you killed. You tell my mother to say so, and you take care of that Bigelow woman. I'm long gone.'

The old man says he got on one of his horses - a good horse, a four-mile horse - and he lit out. He says he went to Kansas City to Memphis, to New Orleans, where he took a boat for Brazil. He kicked around South America for a spell and came home, and then went to Mexico. He settled later in Oklahoma, and claims to have been elected, under the name of J. Frank Dalton, to the territorial legislature. He later moved to Texas."

==The Mt. Olivet Cemetery exhumation (July 17–19, 1995)==
In recent years there have been a few attempts to resolve these historical mysteries and to finally get to the real truth of the matter. Unfortunately, none of these attempts have produced any evidence which can definitively resolve the issues being debated by the contending parties.

For example, on July 17–19, 1995, James E. Starrs&lt;ref&gt;James Edward Starrs (born July 30, 1930) - See: (1) https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2QNH-T25 (2) http://www.intelius.com/search/people/James-E-Starrs/Fredericksburg-VA&lt;/ref&gt; (David B. Weaver Research Professor of Law, and Professor of Forensic Sciences, at George Washington University Law School)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.gwu.edu/james-e-starrs&lt;/ref&gt; supervised the exhumation of Jesse James' purported grave in Mt. Olivet Cemetery at Kearney, Clay County, Missouri.

Here are the statements of Starrs and his colleagues on this subject, quoted verbatim from their report (page 175): "We are left with three possibilities: (1) the exhumed remains are indeed those of Jesse James; (2) the exhumed remains are not Jesse James, but from another maternal relative of RJ and MN; or (3) the exhumed remains are from an unrelated individual who, by chance, happens to have the same mtDNA sequence as RJ and MN ... Do the mtDNA results prove that the exhumed remains are those of Jesse James? The answer to this question must be no, as there is always the possibility (however remote) that the remains are from a different maternal relative of RJ and MN, or from an unrelated person with the same mtDNA sequence. However, it should be emphasized that the mtDNA results are in complete agreement with the other scientific investigations of the exhumed remains: there is no scientific basis whatsoever for doubting that the exhumed remains are those of Jesse James. The burden of proof now shifts to those who, for whatever reason, choose to still doubt the identification."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://class.csueastbay.edu/faculty/gmiller/3710/DNA_PDFS/mtDNA/mtDNA_JesseJames.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719085854/http://class.csueastbay.edu/faculty/gmiller/3710/DNA_PDFS/mtDNA/mtDNA_JesseJames.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-19 |df= }} - "Mitochondrial DNA Analysis of the Presumptive Remains of Jesse James," by Anne C. Stone, James E. Starrs, and Mark Stoneking, ''Journal of Forensic Sciences'' (2001), Vol. 46, No. 1, pp. 173-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, critics of the exhumation - most notably Betty Dorsett Duke (1947-2015)&lt;ref&gt;http://cook-walden-davis.tributes.com/dignitymemorial/obituary/Betty-Gail-Duke-102801383 (Obituary of Betty Gail Dorsett Duke)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Betty Gail Dorsett Duke (April 2, 1947 - August 29, 2015) - Author of the following books: ''Jesse James Lived and Died in Texas'' (Austin, Texas: Eakin Press, 1998), ''The Truth About Jesse James'' (Fiddler's Green Press, rev. ed., 2008), and ''Jesse James - The Smoking Gun'' (Fiddler's Green, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; - claim that the DNA samples obtained and tested by Starrs' exhumation team did not originate from the remains exhumed from the gravesite. Duke and many other critics of this exhumation have pointed out that, according to the canons of forensic science, the "chain of custody" of the actual remains which yielded the DNA samples tested by the Starrs team was not precisely known at the time of the exhumation, and, moreover, that the "chain of custody" of those remains cannot now be precisely determined or reconstructed through further investigation. Consequently, the critics of the exhumation believe that the primary conclusion the Starrs team published in their report (quoted above) cannot be relied on with any degree of confidence. Going even further, in view of all the evidence which has emerged (since the time of the exhumation) which contradicts the basic conclusion of the Starrs exhumation team, many critics of the exhumation now believe that the primary conclusion of the Starrs exhumation team (as quoted above) is simply false.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Dorsett Duke - Fraudulent Jesse James DNA Results?

==The Granbury Cemetery exhumation (May 30, 2000)==
Bud Hardcastle&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Eugene "Bud" Hardcastle (born May 4, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; - an amateur historian and used car salesman from Purcell, Oklahoma, and a long-time researcher of the Jesse James/J. Frank Dalton mystery - is one of those who (for several reasons) has been unwilling to accept the conclusions of the Starrs exhumation team. In the mid-1990s, Hardcastle joined forces with three sons of Jesse Cole James.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Cole James (Feb. 13, 1882 - Feb. 5, 1964) - There is some evidence that his name was originally spelled "Jessie Coal James." If his name originally was "Jessie Coal James," it is not known at this time why the spelling was changed to "Jesse Cole James."&lt;/ref&gt; These brothers - Jessie Quanah James, Sr.,&lt;ref&gt;Jessie (Jesse) Quanah "Tubby" James, Sr. (Feb. 3, 1923 - Dec. 18, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Burleigh Dale James,&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh (Burley) Dale James (Nov. 1, 1934 - April 16, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles A. James&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. "Shorty" James (born on Jan. 31, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; - all believed that Dalton was their grandfather, and that Dalton really was the famous outlaw Jesse James. J. Frank Dalton was buried in the Granbury Cemetery at Granbury, Hood County, Texas. Hardcastle and the three James brothers decided to request an exhumation order from the Hood County (Texas) Court, so they could have Dalton's remains exhumed and DNA-tested in an attempt to determine - once and for all - if Dalton really was Jesse James.

Attorneys for Hardcastle and his associates filed a request for an exhumation order with the Hood County Clerk's Office on June 14, 1996. At the exhumation hearing held in September 1996, Hood County judge Don Cleveland&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gill Cleveland (born on Dec. 1, 1937) - He was Hood County judge from 1991-1998.&lt;/ref&gt; denied their request, ruling that the attorneys had not provided him with any compelling evidence as to why he should approve the request. On July 20, 1999, Hardcastle's attorney Steven J. Reid filed a second request for an exhumation order with the Hood County Clerk's Office.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.co.hood.tx.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/945{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Scroll down to page 160 of the document) - Index for Mary Burnett, Hood County Clk - Defendant Civil Docket Listing (01/01/1995 thru 12/31/2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that after filing the second request on July 20, 1999, attorney Reid filed at least one "Amended Application for Exhumation." These "amended applications" contained detailed genealogical and historical information which Hardcastle and his associates considered to be the "compelling evidence" which Judge Cleveland had stated was lacking at the time of the first exhumation hearing in September 1996. Hood County judge Linda Ray Steen&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ray Steen (née Linda Lou Ray) (born October 23, 1939) was Hood County judge from 1999-2002. Anderson Luke Rash (born August 8, 1945) was Hood County judge from 2003-2010. William Darrell Cockerham (born July 23, 1943) became Hood County judge on January 1, 2011. His 8-year term will expire on December 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; approved this request at an exhumation hearing held on February 17, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Leland Debusk - "Is It Really Jesse James? - Judge Grants Order to Exhume Reputed Outlaw's Bones," ''Hood County News,'' On-Line Edition (Feb. 18, 2000) - See: http://www.granburydepot.org/z/biog/JamesJesseExhumationOrder.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the exhumation, on May 30, 2000, the investigative team found a second casket at the grave site.  However, the exhumation order was restricted to one casket, and the decision was made to leave the casket farthest from the headstone untouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsok.com/article/2699358|title=Search for outlaw turns grave 2nd casket found at burial site|date=2000-05-31|work=NewsOK.com|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later determined that the exhumed remains were those of a one-armed Granbury resident named William Henry Holland (1883-1927), not the remains of J. Frank Dalton. The mix-up was likely a result of misplaced headstones, and so the mystery remained unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jesse-james-grave-mix-up/|title=Jesse James Grave Mix-Up|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardcastle appears to have moved on to other endeavors, abandoning any further attempts to exhume the remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/600137446/Was-fortune-stashed-to-help-South-rise-again.html|title=Was fortune stashed to help South rise again?|date=2005-05-29|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jay Landsman''' is a semi-[[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] drama ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'' based upon the real life Baltimore City police officer [[Jay Landsman]].  The fictional character of '''Jay Landsman''' is portrayed by actor [[Delaney Williams]].

==Biography==

===Policing method===
Landsman's role in the police department is that of a supervisory detective sergeant who rarely participates in investigative work. Landsman generally acts in the best interests of his subordinates especially those who give him the necessary clearances (closed cases). As a supervisor, Landsman acts in accordance with the wishes of his superior officers even though in some cases, he does not necessarily agree with specific commands. Examples of this are when he is ordered to have [[Bunk Moreland]] find Kenneth Dozerman's missing firearm in [[The Wire (season 3)|Season 3]] and when a dead state's witness becomes an electoral issue in [[The Wire (season 4)|Season 4]]. Throughout the series, he is shown as a commander attempting to strike a balance between loyalty to subordinates and superiors, most often favoring the latter. Landsman has only been called to solve a few murders on his own as a supervisor.  Landsman is lazy and provides a degree of [[comic relief]] in the series. This is shown by the excessive amount of times he reads pornographic magazines while at work and acts nonchalantly even when his colleagues sees him doing it. He also possesses a shrewd understanding of the subtle politics in the [[chain of command]], almost always successfully acting in self-preservation and self-promotion without making many enemies. He states that clearly to McNulty, during the first episode of season 2, by saying it's all about self-preservation and it is too bad that McNulty never learned that. Overall, under Landsman's supervision, the homicide unit ends up often clearing many of the more challenging "[[whodunit]]" homicides occurring in Baltimore city proving him to be an effective sergeant within the department. However, he can be mildly bullying and tends to derive his good humor from [[schadenfreude]] though he is not generally malicious.

He has the duty of ministering in the informal "detective wakes" held in honor of the deceased at Kavanaugh's, the bar frequented by many in the department.  Wakes take place in [[The Wire (season 3)|Season 3]] (for Ray Cole), [[The Wire (season 4)|Season 4]] (for Raymond Foerster) and [[The Wire (season 5)|Season 5]] (for the ostracized, but still-living Jimmy McNulty).

===Season 1===
Landsman is a squad sergeant in the homicide division of the Baltimore police department. His commanding officer was originally [[William Rawls]]. Landsman's squad consists of several of the shows characters - in season one it comprised Detectives [[Jimmy McNulty]], [[Bunk Moreland]], [[Police of The Wire#Michael Santangelo|Michael Santangelo]], [[Police of The Wire#Ray Cole|Ray Cole]], [[Police of The Wire#Ed Norris|Ed Norris]] and [[Police of The Wire#Vernon Holley|Vernon Holley]]. Landsman finds the misfortune of the cops in his unit a constant source of amusement but is also protective of them at times. He is loyal to Rawls and also doggedly pursues the high case clearance rates that Rawls aims for but is realistic about the capabilities of his detectives.

When McNulty went around the chain of command and incurred Rawls's wrath by being detailed to another unit Landsman appeared unsympathetic. He insisted that McNulty's work looking at old homicide cases for the detail be put to his advantage to make up for losing a detective. To this end, he insisted that McNulty look into the Deirdre Kresson murder case; McNulty was reluctant because the case appeared unrelated. Landsman was sure a link would be found and his intuition later proved correct. However, Landsman did argue McNulty's case with Rawls and managed to get Rawls to agree that McNulty could return to homicide with a clean slate if the investigation was wrapped up quickly. Despite Landsman's best efforts McNulty remained out of favor with Rawls because he refused to end the case he was working on prematurely.

Landsman always maintained a black and twisted humor about the work of his squad. When Rawls gave Detective Santangelo an ultimatum of clearing a "whodunit" case by days end Landsman recommended him a psychic. He claimed that the woman, Madame LaRue, was especially gifted in "matters of death investigation". Santangelo took this advice by burying a doll in a grave awaking later that night to be given evidence in the murder that had occurred. When "Sanny" saw that he had been given information regarding an open homicide, he thanked Landsman who then told him that the Gypsy routine was a joke and that it had been Bunk and McNulty who saved his career.&lt;ref name = "JL"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landsman's squad handled the case of the killing of [[Barksdale Organization#Wendell "Orlando" Blocker|Wendell "Orlando" Blocker]] and wounding of detective [[Kima Greggs]] and he was personally involved in the investigation.

===Season 2===
Initial suspicions are confirmed when Landsman admits to McNulty it was he who informed Rawls as to where he didn't want to be re-stationed. He learned of this while being present when McNulty discussed it early in season one.

Landsman's squad was altered as Rawls transferred Santangelo and McNulty out of the unit because they had displeased him by working with the Barksdale detail. [[Lester Freamon]] returned to homicide after a thirteen-year (and four month) absence and joined Landsman's squad.

When Rawls was forced to take on the multiple homicide case of fourteen unidentified dead women, he entrusted it to Landsman. Landsman gave the case to Freamon and Bunk telling them they were his best detectives. When his detectives started working with [[Cedric Daniels]] on the Sobotka detail, Landsman saw the potential to offload the responsibility of the case but Daniels initially refused.

Landsman was responsible for the interrogation of [[List of characters from The Wire#Chester "Ziggy" Sobotka|Chester "Ziggy" Sobotka]] after he killed [[List of characters from The Wire#George "Double G" Glekas|George "Double G" Glekas]]. Although Ziggy quickly confessed, Landsman failed to inform Daniels' specialized detail about the murder in time for them to become involved. Daniels was irate with Landsman for his lack of forethought when it allowed his targets to dispose of evidence at the Glekas crime scene.

===Season 3===
Landsman appeared as a commanding detective of homicide again this season mainly associated with finding the service weapon of Officer [[Western District of The Wire#Kenneth Dozerman|Dozerman]], whose gun was stolen in a failed undercover buy. He had [[Bunk Moreland]] look for the gun, pressuring him intensely until Bunk wrote a ten-page report stating how unproductive the investigation became. Bunk claimed that he had more important things to do as he was a murder investigator and the city's homicide rate was rising, and Landsman appeared to give Bunk his blessing to work murders instead. Landsman delivers the eulogy at the Detective's Wake held for Ray Cole after his sudden death.

Landsman later appeared following the death of officer Derrick Waggoner, a [[African Americans|black]] plainclothes officer accidentally killed by Detective Pryzbylewski, who had mistaken him for a criminal. Landsman was personally angry at the death, referring to it as a "clusterfuck" as the officer murdered was a {{frac|6|1|2}}-year veteran who was 16th on the current sergeant's list with two commendations while Prez was known for his incompetence and still in the department all due to his father-in-law [[Stanislaus Valchek|Stan Valchek]], the Southeastern district commander.

===Season 4===
Landsman is not above getting involved in politics. When his detective [[List of characters from The Wire#Ed Norris|Ed Norris]] informs him he's investigating the murder of a state's witness Landsman passes the knowledge on to [[Stanislaus Valchek#Stanislaus Valchek|Major Valchek]] in secret. Valchek leaks the information to [[Tommy Carcetti]] who uses it against the current mayor in a key debate.

Landsman's squad is boosted by the return of Lester Freamon and the addition of [[Kima Greggs]] when a new unit commander drives them out of the major case unit. Landsman and his detectives constantly tease Greggs when she first joins the unit. Political pressure forces Landsman to assign Greggs, instead of Norris, to the witness murder. When this information is leaked to the press, Landsman attends a press conference with Greggs and Norris to diffuse the story by claiming that they were working it together. Greggs feels used by her superiors and this creates friction between her and Landsman. Landsman is forced to intercede in the investigation a second time when Norris threatens to break the case on the eve of the election. Rawls tells him whatever the outcome of the case, one of the candidates will be put out and it is better to leave it pending until after the election. Landsman is told to reassign Greggs and Norris to polling station duty for the day to prevent progress in their investigation.&lt;ref name = "OC"&gt;{{

After the election, Greggs solves the Braddock case which tends to provide less leads than were initially given and she gains Landsman's respect in the process. Landsman then is seen delivering the eulogy for [[Police of The Wire#Raymond Foerester|Colonel Foerester]] whom he claimed had a miraculous career serving 39 years without a trace of bitterness or hostility, a rarity in the Baltimore Police Department. Landsman is then seen criticizing [[Bunk Moreland|Detective Moreland]] for reversing one of [[Police of The Wire#Vernon Holley|Detective Holley]]'s clearances as he is against cases going from "black to red." Following Foerester's death, [[Cedric Daniels]] is named C.I.D. colonel and allocates more resources to the investigative divisions to allow for more quality investigations, at the order of Mayor-elect [[Tommy Carcetti]]. Landsman then witnesses Detective [[Lester Freamon]] discovering dead bodies in abandoned houses and is initially against their discovery because it will raise the city's homicide rate. When more bodies are discovered, Landsman realizes the squad can't maintain an acceptable clearance rate and becomes less concerned about the department's numbers. Landsman finally sees [[Bubbles (The Wire)|Bubbles]] turn himself in for murder of a teenager and after hearing that the death was accidental, decides not to press homicide charges sending him to a psychiatric unit at Bayview instead.

===Season 5===
After Jimmy McNulty is forced out of the police department, Landsman delivers a speech at the wake in McNulty's honor. He cites his insubordination and personality flaws but also says McNulty is the best detective he has ever had and is sorry for losing him. He fakes breaking out in tears at the end.

==Origins==
The character is based on and named after a real homicide detective sergeant whom [[David Simon (writer)|David Simon]] had met while researching the book ''[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]]''. The character is often given dialogue that the writers recall the real Landsman using. Delaney Williams was chosen for the part because of the creators' experience of working with him in small roles on ''Homicide'' and ''The Corner''.&lt;ref name="Target Commentary"&gt;{{cite video | people = David Simon |date = 2005 | title = ''The Wire'' "The Target" commentary track | medium = DVD | location = | publisher = HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real [[Jay Landsman]] can also be seen on ''The Wire'' in the role of [[Western District of The Wire#Dennis Mello|Dennis Mello]], administrative aide to Major Colvin, first in an uncredited appearance in the season 2 episode "[[Stray Rounds]]", and later as a regular cast member. The real Landsman was the inspiration for detective [[John Munch]], a character from ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]''.

Among the discrepancies between the character on ''The Wire'' and the real Jay Landsman, the most prominent is their physique: the real Landsman was the least overweight sergeant in the homicide squad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=David |title=[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]] |origyear=1991 |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=Owl Books |isbn=0-8050-8075-9 |page=85 |chapter=One |quote=Other sergeants in the homicide unit might resemble grocers who consumed too much of the profits, but at an inch over six feet, Landsman still looked like a street police}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''The Wire'''s version is one of the more heavyset officers on the force, sometimes referred to as "fat man."

'''John I. Gallin''' (born March 25, 1943) is an American medical researcher who has contributed to the understanding of innate immunity but especially [[chronic granulomatous disease]], a [[phagocytosis|phagocyte]] disorder.&lt;ref name="John I.

==Education and career==
Gallin was born on March 25, 1943, in [[New York City]], His father was an attorney, and his mother was trained as a social worker, but then became a stay-at-home mom.&lt;ref name="Interview with Dr. John I. Gallin"&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2016|url=https://history.nih.gov/nihinownwords/docs/gallin1_01.html|title=In Their Own Words: NIH Researchers Recall the Early Years of AIDS, Interview with Dr. John I. Gallin|publisher=Office of NIH History|date=June 23, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[New Rochelle High School]] in [[New Rochelle]], NY, in 1961. He graduated [[Latin honors|cum laude]] from [[Amherst College]] in 1965.  He earned his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]  from  Cornell Medical College of [[Cornell University]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Interview with Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt;

After a medical internship and residency at [[New York University]]’s [[Bellevue Hospital]], in 1971 he began postdoctoral training in basic and clinical research in [[infectious disease]]s at the [[National Institutes of Health]] as a clinical associate in the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]].&lt;ref name="Interview with Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John I. Gallin MD"/&gt; Gallin returned to New York University's Bellevue Hospital as senior chief medical resident from 1974-1975, then came back to NIH.&lt;ref name="Interview with Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt;

In 1985, he was appointed scientific director for intramural research activities at the NIAID, a position he held for the next nine years.&lt;ref name="John I. Gallin MD"/&gt; Gallin was the founding chief of NIAID’s Laboratory of Host Defenses in 1991 and served as chief of the laboratory for 12 years.&lt;ref name="NIAID’s Gallin appointed Clinical Center Director"/&gt; He continues as chief of the lab's clinical pathophysiology section.

Gallin was the 10th director of the NIH Clinical Center, a position he held for 22 years, the longest serving director.&lt;ref name="Interview with Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt; The Clinical Center is the largest hospital focused solely on clinical research and serves the scientific and medical needs of 17 NIH institutes.  In 2011, under Gallin’s leadership, the Clinical Center was the first hospital to receive the Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award.&lt;ref name="2011 Lasker~Bloomberg Award for Public Service"&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2016|url=https://www.cc.nih.gov/ccaward.html|title=2011 Lasker~Bloomberg Award for Public Service|publisher=NIH Clinical Center|date=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Gallin was appointed to the newly created positions of NIH Associate Director for Clinical Research and Chief Scientific Officer for the Clinical Center.&lt;ref name="Gallin appointed new leadership position"&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=March 14, 2017|url= https://www.cc.nih.gov/about/news/newsletter/2016/winter/story-winter-gallin-appointed-leadership.html|title=Gallin appointed new leadership position|publisher=Clinical center News|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These posts report directly to the NIH Director and oversee independent research programs, clinical research training and the scientific review process for all clinical protocols conducted at the NIH. On January 8, 2017, Gallin stepped down as the director of the NIH Clinical Center to focus full-time as the Chief Scientific Officer of the Clinical Center and NIH Associate Director for Clinical Research.&lt;ref name="Gallin appointed new leadership position"/&gt;

Gallin served as Assistant Surgeon General of the [[United States Public Health Service]] and retired from the USPHS as a [[rear admiral]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Gallin has published or co-authored more than 355 articles in scientific journals and has edited two textbooks: ''Inflammation, Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates'' (Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, 1999) and ''Principles and Practices of Clinical Research'' (Academic Press, 2002, 4th edition (2018).&lt;ref name="Biosketch Dr. John I. Gallin"&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2016|url=https://www.cc.nih.gov/about/SeniorStaff/john_gallin.html|title=Biosketch Dr. John I. Gallin|publisher=NIH Clinical Center|date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical research==
Gallin’s primary research interests are on the role of [[phagocytes]], the body’s scavenger cells in host defense.&lt;ref name="Intramural Research Program: Our Research"&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=May 6, 2017|url=https://irp.nih.gov/pi/john-gallin|title=Intramural Research Program: Our research|publisher=NIH Intramural Research Program|date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research has focused on rare hereditary immune disorders, and he identified the genetic basis of several diseases of the phagocytes ([[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]]).&lt;ref name="Intramural Research Program: Our Research"/&gt;

The laboratory has focused on [[neutrophil-specific granule deficiency]], actin interacting protein deficiency and [[chronic granulomatous disease]] (CGD).&lt;ref name="Laboratory of Host Defenses Dr. John I. Gallin"&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=May 6, 2017|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/john-i-gallin-md-macp|title=Laboratory of Host Defenses Dr. John I. Gallin|publisher=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When phagocytes fail to produce hydrogen peroxide and bleach, CGD results. The laboratory described the genetic basis for several forms of CGD and the research has reduced life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections in CGD patients.&lt;ref name="Laboratory of Host Defenses Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt; The laboratory discovered that when CGD patients get older they are protected from [[atherosclerosis]] (narrowing of the arteries), suggesting the abnormal enzyme in this disease might be a drugable target for normal people with atherosclerosis.&lt;ref name="Laboratory of Host Defenses Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt;

==Achievements as NIH Clinical Center Director==
During his tenure as director of the NIH Clinical Center, Gallin oversaw the design and construction of the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC), an 870,000-square-foot research hospital added to the original structure. The CRC opened to patients in 2005.&lt;ref name="Biosketch Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt;

Gallin also established a new curriculum for clinical research training that is now offered globally having reached over 35,000 students throughout the United States and in 26 countries and supported development of new information systems for sharing biomedical translational and clinical research.&lt;ref name="Biosketch Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt;

Gallin was key to establishing a Patient Advisory Group at the Clinical Center in 1998, one of the first for patients participating in clinical research.&lt;ref name="CC patients share their input"&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=March 14, 2017|url= https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/about/news/newsletter/1998/jun98/june.html#people|title=CC patients share their input|publisher=Clinical Center News|date=June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, along with Clinical Center nurses, conceived and championed identifying resources from the NIH Foundation to construct the NIH Edmond J. Safra Family Lodge which opened in 2005.

Gallin stressed the importance of collaboration and helped open the Clinical Center and its depth of resources to the research community outside NIH.&lt;ref name="Biosketch Dr. John I. Gallin"/&gt;

==Memberships==
Gallin is a member of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Association of American Physicians]], the [[American Society for Clinical Investigation]], and the [[American College of Physicians]] (Master).&lt;ref name="Biosketch Dr. John I.

'''Kahiko-Lua-Mea''' (better known simply as '''Kahiko''') is a [[god]] in [[Hawaiian mythology]], who was once a chief on the [[Earth]] and lived in Olalowaia. He is mentioned in the chant ''[[Kumulipo]]'' and in the ''Chant of [[Kūaliʻi]]''.

Kahiko is also mentioned in The Legend of Waia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BqElGaH4DiIC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=kahiko+mythology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3TVXDx1q3a&amp;sig=BQI2Zn2m_L3EtVYH7UjsSda7Yt8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj03ZOo_-HTAhWF0FQKHUH9Du4Q6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=kahiko%20mythology&amp;f=false|title=Hawaiian Mythology|last=Beckwith|first=Martha Warren|date=1940-01-01|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824805142|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend is that there was a head figure that had the ability to speak. He gave power to Kahiko because Waia lacked to keep up with his responsibilities as a chief.

He was born c. 144 in the Ololo Genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kekoolani.org/Pages/Kekoolani%20Genealogy%20Database%20(PAF)/pafg03.htm#20 Kahiko]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Kahiko's name means "old" or "ancient".&lt;ref&gt;''Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian-English, English-Hawaiian'' by [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and [[Samuel Hoyt Elbert]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Family ==
Kahiko's parents are [[Welaahilaninui]] and his wife Owe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Kamakau]], ''Ruling Chiefs of [[Hawaii]]'', Revised Edition. [[Honolulu]]: Kamehameha Schools Press. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edith Kawelohea McKinzie]]. ''Hawaiian Genealogies: Extracted from Hawaiian Language Newspapers''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Abraham Fornander]], Welaʻahilaninui was the first man.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Fornander, ''An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origin and Migrations''. Rutland, VT: Charles E. Tuttle Company. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ancient chant ''Kumulipo'', Kahiko was a son of Chief Keali’iwahilani and his wife Lailai.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kumulipo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahiko married Kupulanakehao&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Warren Beckwith]]. ''Hawaiian Mythology''.&lt;/ref&gt; and had three sons:
*[[Wākea]]
* Lihau-ula
* Makuʻu

His granddaughter was [[Hoʻohokukalani]].

The claim was quickly reprinted by ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and [[TechCrunch]], among others.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europe.newsweek.com/isis-creates-its-own-secure-messaging-app-415565?rm=eu |title=ISIS Creates Its Own Secure Messaging App |date=14 January 2016 |work=NewsWeek |publisher=Newsweek LTD |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tech crunch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/16/isis-app/ |title=ISIS Has Its Own Encrypted Chat App |date=16 January 2016 |work=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL,Inc |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sehnaoui was one of the security specialists that helped debunk the myth of this tool, showing that it was just a "bad media mock-up to try and get some attention".&lt;ref name="dailydot16"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/isis-alrawi-encryption-messaging-app/ |title=The myth of the ISIS Encrypted Messaging App |date=27 January 2016 |work=The Daily Dot |publisher=SlashDot |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''[[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Queen consort|queens]]'''. This list covers a large time span and the role of a queen has changed much over the centuries. However individual queens have also shaped their own role in remarkable ways. Many have truly ruled the country side by side with their husband and some have become sole regents. The marriage of an heir or a king was most often affected by politics and alliances were often affirmed by marriages in the royal families. It was also for a long period not permitted for royalty to marry non-royalty. Thus the choice of wife would be narrow in one's own country and most of the queens in this list are not native to their husband's country.
Due to unions with [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] the queens listed for 1380–1814 were also queens of Denmark and the queens listed for 1814–1905 were also queens of Sweden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5134">A '''musicologist''' is someone who studies music (see [[musicology]]). A '''historical musicologist''' studies music from a historical perspective. An '''ethnomusicologist''' studies music in its cultural and social contexts (see [[ethnomusicology]]). A '''systematic musicologist''' asks general questions about music from the perspective of relevant disciplines (psychology, sociology, acoustics, philosophy, physiology, computer science) (see [[systematic musicology]]). Systematic musicologists often identify more strongly with their non-musical discipline than with musicology.

[[Image:Mariano Azuela 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mariano Azuela]]

'''Mariano Azuela González''' (January 1, 1873 &amp;ndash; March 1, 1952) was a Mexican author and physician, best known for his fictional stories of the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. He wrote novels, works for theatre and literary criticism. He is the first of the "novelists of the Revolution," and he influenced other Mexican novelists of social protest.

Among Azuela's first published writing were some short pieces for the magazine ''Gil Blas Cómico'', where he wrote under the pen name of "Beleño", and his writing published under the heading ''Impresiones de un estudiante'' (''Impressions of a Student'') in 1896. His first novel, ''Maria Luisa'', was written in 1907, followed by ''Los fracasados'' (''The Failures'') in 1908, and ''Mala yerba'' (''Weeds'') in 1909. The theme of his beginning novels are about fate. He wrote of the social life of Mexicans during the Díaz dictatorship. After experiencing the Mexican Revolution first-hand, his writing style became sarcastic and disillusioned. His first novel with the Revolution theme is ''Andrés Pérez, maderista'' in 1911, followed by ''Sin Amor'' (''Without Love'') in 1912, and his most popular, ''Los de abajo'' (''The Underdogs'') in 1915. He continued to write short works and novels influenced by the Revolution. It includes ''El camarada Pantoja'' (''Comrade Pantoja'') in 1937, ''Regina Landa'' in 1939, ''La nueva burguesía'' (''The New Bourgeoisie'') in 1941, and ''La maldición'' (''The Curse'', published posthumously) in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elem.mx/autor/obra/directa/91|title=Obra publicada - Enciclopedia de la Literatura en México - FLM - CONACULTA|website=www.elem.mx|language=es|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works mainly depicts the satirical picture of life in post revolutionary Mexico sharply and angrily stigmatizing demagoguery and political intrigue.

==Early life and career==

Azuela was born in [[Lagos de Moreno]], [[Jalisco]] to a small, but successful rancher, Evaristo Azuela and Paulina Azuela, on January 1, 1873. He grew up in a small farm owned by his father, which later influences the settings in many of his fictional works. He was first admitted to a Catholic seminary at the age of fourteen, but soon abandoned his religious studies. He studied medicine in Guadalajara, Jalisco. He received his M.D. in 1899, practicing medicine first in his home town of Lagos de Moreno, and later, after the Mexican revolution, practiced in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2013 |title =Mariano Azuela |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |location=Chicago, IL |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47063/Mariano-Azuela }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he married Carmen Rivera, niece of Agustín Rivera, priest and historian of Lagos de Moreno. He went to have five sons and five daughters.

Like most young students, Azuela was opposed to the dictatorship of the Díaz regime. During his days in the [[Mexican Revolution]], Azuela wrote about the war and its impact on Mexico. When Porfirio Díaz was overthrown, Azuela was made Chief of Political Affairs of Lagos de Moreno in 1911 and state Director of Education of Jalisco in 1914 by president [[Francisco I. Madero]]. After Madero's assassination, he joined the Constitutionalist cause that sought to restore the rule of law. He traveled with the military forces of Julián Medina, a follower of [[Pancho Villa]], where he served as a field doctor. His participation in the conflict gave him ample material to write ''Los de abajo'' (''The Underdogs'') (1915). He later was forced for a time to emigrate to [[El Paso, Texas]] when the counterrevolutionary forces of Victoriano Huerta were temporarily triumphant. It was there that he wrote ''Los de abajo'', which was his first-hand description of combat during the Mexican revolution, based on his experiences in the field. It was first published as a serial in the newspaper "El Paso del Norte" from October 1915 to December 1915. The book did not receive general recognition until 1924, and it was hailed as a novel of the Revolution. ''Los de abajo'' (''The Underdogs'') depicts the futility of the Revolution, the opportunists in power, and the underprivileged majority of his country. He fought for a better Mexico, and he believed the Revolution corrected some injustices, but it has given rise to others equally deplorable.

==The Mexican Revolution’s Effect on Mariano Azuela’s Writing Career==
Through studying the encyclopedic entries of Nicolás Kanellos, Brown Foundation Professor of Hispanic Studies teaching at the University of Houston, in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Latino Literature discussing Mariano Azuela’s involvement in The Mexican Revolution, the strong influence and lasting impressions of the revolution on his writing career become evident.

In his encyclopedia entry “Azuela, Mariano (1873-1952)”, Nicolás Kanellos underscores Azuela’s physical involvement in the war, and its influence on Azuela’s literary career. Kanellos begins by describing Azuela as, “one of Mexico’s greatest novelists and chroniclers of the Mexican Revolution” (Kanellos, 105).&lt;ref&gt;Kanellos, Nicolás. "Azuela, Mariano (1873–1952)". The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Latino Literature [Three Volumes]. Ed. Nicol‡s Kanellos. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2008. ABC-CLIO eBook Collection. Pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In describing Azuela as a “chronicler”, Kanellos immediately highlights one important feature of Azuela and his work, which is his tendency to record and portray history. In highlighting Azuela’s relationship between history and literature, Kanellos establishes the inseparability of political and global contexts within Azuela’s literary works; for example, Azuela’s novel “The Underdogs” recounts the events of The Mexican Revolution from the perspective of the rebel soldiers. Therefore, Kanellos emphasizes the existing relationship between history and its involvement in Azuela’s work. Kanellos then describes the reason as to why Azuela’s literary works are deeply infused with Mexican politics and history stating, “Azuela’s early career as a writer, in fact, was developed while participating in the Revolution first-hand as a physician in the army of Francisco ‘Pancho’ Villa” (Kanellos, 105).&lt;ref&gt;Kanellos, Nicolás. "Azuela, Mariano (1873–1952)". The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Latino Literature [Three Volumes]. Ed. Nicol‡s Kanellos. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2008. ABC-CLIO eBook Collection. Pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms “first-hand” and “participating” underscore Azuela’s physical involvement in the war. Kanellos’ use of the word “developed” then underscores the manner in which Azuela’s physical involvement paved the way for his writing to grow and mature as a result of his experiences participating in the Mexican Revolution. Kanellos stresses in his encyclopedic entry the persisting role of history and its portrayal in Azuela’s work, but he also emphasizes the manner in history, in particular the Mexican Revolution, essentially birthed Azuela’s writing career.

In understanding the relationship between Mariano Azuela’s involvement in the Mexican Revolution and its effect on his writing career, the undertones of corruption and failed ideals in Azuela’s novels such as “The Underdogs” reveal a more personal perspective that highlights the contrasts between the reality of war and revolution in his novels.

==The Significance of Cultural Identity in ''The Underdogs''==

In exploring Margy McCrary’s academic journal, “The Aztec Connection: Exploring the Construction of Azuela's Revolutionaries in The Underdogs”, she discusses how Demetrio is described as a “full-blooded Aztec” in order to garner his authority over the land, and construct a cultural identity that he and the Mexican peasants must establish in order to fight back against the oppressive Spanish conquerors.

McCrary states that the purpose of a revolution is to reject the identity of the colonizer, however, in order to do this “some sort of unified identity is necessary for a group to revolt successfully” (McCrary 31). The pre-colonial Aztec is embodied by Demetrio Macías because he is connected to both his ancestors and the land. Demetrio is depicted as “riding proudly on his horse” with “pure-blooded Aztec cheeks”, however, Demetrio “seems devoid of any defined identity” because he never acknowledges a greater reasoning to his involvement in the revolution other than either revenge or satisfaction in being the revolutionaries' leader (Azuela 72). This illuminates that Azuela may care about the revolution more than the characters do. McCrary further explains that on page seventy-two of the novel, Macias and his “men threw out their chests as if to breathe the widening horizon” and the “immensity of the sky” illustrating how Demetrio’s freedom is connected to the earth itself and that Demetrio is a legitimate inhabitant of the land. Furthermore, the sense of freedom that Demetrio and the Mexican men feel on the land serves to “distance them from their oppressed identities as colonized beings” because they immediately forget their bleak lives as conquered peasants (36). By depicting Demetrio as a pure-blooded Aztec, Azuela reveals that he as an author is “displeased with the current, colonized identity of his people” and wishes to reconstruct a strong Mexican identity before it had “been influenced by the Spanish colonizers” (37). As a result, Azuela emphasizes the consequences of colonization because Demetrio is “so far separated from his own heritage and identity that he does not even recognize it consciously” (39). When Demetrio begins to forget his identity it results in “petty fighting, looting, and anarchy” (34). Azuela must thus emphasize Demetrio’s heritage for the readers to understand what is at stake in the novel if cultural identity is lost.

==Later life==
In 1917 he moved to [[Mexico City]] where, for the rest of his life, he continued his writing, and worked as a doctor among the poor.

In 1942 he received the Mexican National Prize for Literature. On April 8, 1943 he became a founding member of Mexico's [[Colegio Nacional (Mexico)|National College]], where he gave lectures on Mexican, French, and Spanish novelists, and on his own literary experiences. In 1949 he received the Mexican National Prize for Arts and Sciences. He died in Mexico City March 1, 1952 and was placed in a sepulchre of the Panteón Civil in the [[Panteón de Dolores|Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres]].

==2015 Conference on Mariano Azuela and the Novel of the Mexican Revolution==
On the anniversary year of his famous novel, "The Underdogs", a conference was held in collaboration by the [[Chicana/o studies|Chicano Studies]] departments of both [[California State University, Los Angeles]] and the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM). It was held on May 15–16 at California State University, Los Angeles and contained speakers who were scholars of either Mariano Azuela or the works of the Mexican Revolution.

'''Nicanor Santa Ana Abelardo''' (February 7, 1893 – March 21, 1934) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[composer]] known for his [[kundiman]] songs, especially before the [[World War II|Second World War]].

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Nicanorb A.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Nicanor Abelardo]] --&gt;

==Life==

Nicanor Abelardo was born in [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan]] to Valentin Abelardo and Placida Santa Ana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSMN-SHYZ?i=462|title=Nicanor Avelardo Baptism (Registros parroquiales, 1821-1946)|last=|first=|date=12 February 1893|website=[[FamilySearch]]|publisher=|access-date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother belonged to a family of artists in Guagua, the Henson. He was introduced to music when he was five years old when his father taught him the [[solfeggio]] and the [[banduria]]. Abelardo completed his first composition, a waltz entitled "Ang Unang Buko" dedicated to his grandmother, at the age of eight. By the age of thirteen, he was playing at saloons and cabarets in [[Manila]], and by fifteen, he was teaching at barrio schools in [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan|San Ildefonso]] and [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]] in Bulacan.

[[File:UPDilimanjf2622 09.JPG|thumb|right|225px|N. Abelardo Hall ([[UP Diliman]]).]]

In 1916, Abelardo entered the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music, taking courses under Guy F. Harrison and Robert Scholfield. During his studies, he  composed the melody of the university's official [[anthem]], ''[[U.P. Naming Mahal]]''. After earning a teacher's certificate in science and composition in 1921, he was appointed head of the composition department at the Conservatory in 1924. Years later, he ran a boarding school for young musicians, among which were Antonino Vuenaventura, Alfredo Lozano, and Lucino Sacramento.

Abelardo died in 1934 at the age of 41, leaving behind a collection of roughly 140 compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philmusicregistry.net/artist_profile.php?artist_id=9 |title=Nicanor Abelardo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105195325/http://www.philmusicregistry.net/artist_profile.php?artist_id=9 |archivedate=2010-01-05 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for redefining the [[kundiman]], bringing the form to art-song status. Notable among his works are 'Nasaan Ka Irog," "Magbalik Ka Hirang," and "Himutok."

The main theater of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] and the building housing the [[College or university school of music|College of Music]] in [[UP Diliman]] (Abelardo Hall) were named in his honor and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/~music/index_mission.htm |title=MISSION OF THE COLLEGE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215175500/http://www.upd.edu.ph/~music/index_mission.htm |archivedate=2010-12-15 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliver James''' (born 1953) is a [[Chartered psychologist|chartered]] [[psychologist]], registered with the [[British Psychological Society]]. He is also registered as a [[Relational psychoanalysis|Relational Psychoanalyst]] at the [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] Centre. He is an author, journalist, television producer and broadcaster.

==Career==

Following a degree in Social Anthropology at Cambridge University, he trained as a child clinical psychologist at Nottingham University and worked for six years at the NHS Cassel Hospital in Richmond in a clinical psychologist post.

He has written columns for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', the ''[[Sunday Express]]'', ''[[The Independent]],'' ''[[The Observer]]''  magazine and The Guardian Family section. He also contributes regularly to the Comment page of ''[[The Guardian]]'', as well as occasional articles for the other broadsheets. Currently, he writes a column in the Financial Times Wealth magazine.

Speaking on Channel 4's 2013 "Psychopath Night", James described the [[credit crunch]] as a "mass outbreak of corporate psychopathy which resulted in something that very nearly crashed the whole world economy".&lt;ref&gt;Psychopath Night, [[Channel 4]] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===

In 1982, James made his first television series, for [[Granada]] for the ITV network, about childcare (''Under Fives''). He made two further educational series, one for Channel 4 (''Sex With Paula'', 1987) and one for ITV (''Men On Violence'', 1988, for LWT). He originated and was associate producer of the ITV documentary "The Man who shot John Lennon".{{cn|date=May 2018}}

He was the interviewer and producer of the 44 interviews in [[Room 113]] for the two series of the BAFTA-award-winning [[Network 7 (TV series)|Network 7]] youth programme on [[Channel 4]]. The interviews in Room 113 were described by Chris Dunckley in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as "The most frank since John Freeman's Face-to-Face in the Fifties".{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1990 he produced a documentary for [[Channel 4]] about the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' and in 1992 he contributed three films, two as Producer and one as Producer-Presenter, to the BBC 2 Crime and Punishment season. ''Rape'', for ''40 Minutes'', recorded the meeting of a rapist and a rape victim. ''Prisoner XYY/334422'', also for ''40 Minutes'', was about the psychology of an imprisoned psychopath. 

''Wot U Looking At?'', for the science programme Horizon, presented his influential{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} explanation (from his monograph "Juvenile Violence in a Winner-Loser Culture") for why the poor are more violent than the rich and why, at the time, violence had been rocketing since 1987 in the UK.

In 1995 he produced, directed and presented a forty-minute [[The Late Show (BBC TV series)|Late Show]] documentary for [[BBC2]], ''Prozac Diary'', in which artists took the drug to see how it affected their work. In 1997, he produced and presented ''The Chair'', a 7-part interview series for BBC2, including one in which [[Peter Mandelson]] MP shed a tear.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1998 he was the presenter of a 2-part series about his book, ''New Britain on the Couch'', for Channel 4, followed in 2000 by presenting a one-off documentary about infidelity, ''Affairs of the Heart''. In each of 2004, 2005 and 2006 he has presented a series of programmes about childcare for ''This Morning'', titled ''Through the Eyes of the Child''.

===Books===
His 2002 book, ''They F*** You Up: How to Survive Family Life'', has sold over 150,000 copies, as did his book ''Affluenza'' (2007).

His 2009 book, ''Contented Dementia'', has sold over 70,000 copies in the UK and is widely used by professionals and relatives in managing people with the illness, despite the extreme hostility displayed to the method by the Alzheimer's Society.

In his 2012 book, ''Love Bombing - Reset your child's emotional thermostat'', he describes a technique for parents to help improve relationships between parents and children which is widely used.

In his 2013 book, ''Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks'', he identifies each of the three [[dark triad]]ic personality traits ([[narcissism]], [[Machiavellianism]] and [[psychopathy]]) as being common amongst senior managers.

In his 2014 book, ''How to Develop Emotional Health'', he cites five key elements of good emotional health - insightfulness, living in the present, fluid 'two-way' relationships, authenticity and playfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amandeepmittal.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/book-review-how-to-develop-emotional-health-by-oliver-james/|title=BOOK REVIEW: How To Develop Emotional Health by Oliver James|date=20 March 2017|access-date=8 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasises that although it is rare for a person to develop very high levels of emotional health, his book intends to indicate how it can be incrementally improved over time.

His book ''Not In Your Genes'' (2016) argued that no genes have been found which significantly explain our individual psychology, such as intelligence or mental health, and claimed that nurture is extremely important, explaining why siblings are different and why traits run in family.{{fact|date=January 2018}} Also published in 2016, his book ''Upping Your Ziggy - How [[David Bowie]] Faced His Childhood Demons and How You Can Face Yours'' analyses how Bowie used his lyrics and stage personas to deal with his fear of madness, resulting from his family background. It explores the environmental causes of schizophrenia.

==Reception of work==
During his career in psychology, James has attracted controversy with his views on the [[nature versus nurture]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/12/oliver-james-is-wrong-to-blame-parents-for-their-childrens-mental-illness|title=Oliver James is wrong to blame parents for their children’s mental illness |last=Orr|first=Deborah|date=12 March 2016|work=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stuart Ritchie, a psychologist at the [[University of Edinburgh]], wrote a strongly critical review of James's book ''Not In Your Genes''. He described the book as a "straw man made flesh", "a compendium of psychological myths and legends", and "bending over backwards to avoid awkward conclusions". Ritchie wrote, "Few books risk such damage to the public understanding of science as those by Oliver James", and accused James of "scientific illiteracy".

Ritchie described the book's thesis as "children are born with brains of soft clay, their mental makeup unaffected by genes and infinitely mouldable by their parents", and that "[[DNA]] has no effect on the mind or mental health, whereas parenting reigns supreme". Ritchie described a variety of evidence which contradicts this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Ritchie |url=http://health.spectator.co.uk/on-genetics-oliver-james-is-wrong-about-everything/ |title=On genetics Oliver James is on a different planet to the rest of us |publisher=Spectator Health ''(Health.spectator.co.uk)'' |date=8 March 2016 |accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritchie also responded to a letter from James in ''[[The Psychologist (magazine)|The Psychologist]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/december-2015/not-your-genes |title=Not in your genes &amp;#124; The Psychologist |publisher=Thepsychologist.bps.org.uk |date=28 December 2015 |accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following which James and Prof [[Richard Bentall]] of the [[University of Liverpool]] engaged him in argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/jump-gun-and-you-will-be-shot-down |title=Jump the gun and you will be shot down |work=Thepsychologist.bps.org.uk |accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James responded to Ritchie's criticisms in an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver James |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/30/intelligence-mental-health-genes-nurture |title=Sorry, but you can’t blame your children’s genes |work=The Guardian |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Hugh McGregor Ellis''' (born 30 March 1958) is a former [[Christchurch]] [[child care]] worker who was at the centre of one of New Zealand's most enduring judicial controversies. In June 1993 Ellis was found guilty in the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] on 16 counts of [[Child sexual abuse|sexual offences involving children]] in his care at the Christchurch Civic Creche and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. His conviction was strongly criticised, with concerns centering on how the children's testimony was obtained and presented to the jury.

Ellis maintained his innocence and many New Zealanders supported his calls to overturn the conviction. In 1994, the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] quashed convictions on three of the charges, but upheld the sentence. His conviction and sentence were upheld for a second time in the Court of Appeal in October 1999. Ellis refused to attend parole board hearings while in prison because he would have to confess to the crimes in order to argue for early release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11989759 Jarrod Gilbert: Peter Ellis martyr to deranged prejudice], NZ Herald, 8 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in February 2000, after serving seven years in prison.

In March 2000, former Chief Justice Sir [[Thomas Eichelbaum]] was appointed to conduct a ministerial inquiry reviewing the children's evidence. His report, which was criticised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Ross|title=New Evidence in the Peter Ellis case|journal=New Zealand Law Journal|date=November–December 2007|url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/2007/2007_francis_new_evidence.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530155831/http://www.peterellis.org.nz/2007/2007_francis_new_evidence.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-05-30|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; upheld the guilty verdicts. The same month Governor-General Sir [[Michael Hardie Boys]] rejected Ellis' third bid for pardon on the advice of Justice Minister Phil Goff, who was satisfied with Eichelbaum's finding that Ellis had failed to prove his convictions were unsafe.

Two books and numerous articles&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.peterellis.org.nz for reproductions of articles.&lt;/ref&gt; have been written about the case. Ellis continued to campaign to clear his name. In 2011 he announced intention to lodge a fourth petition for pardon with the Governor General. The case itself was part of a slew of similar cases in the United States–known as the [[day-care sex-abuse hysteria]]—a [[moral panic]] that originated out of [[California]] in 1982 and that existed throughout the 1980s. The hysteria, as well as Ellis' conviction, was cited as a major cause in the decline in the number of male teachers in [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand schools]].&lt;ref name="teacher decline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern-advocate/news/article.cfm?objectid=10938495 | title= Schools 'need to appeal to boys' | publisher=The Northern Advocate | accessdate=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ellis is the eldest of four children. His parents were teachers who separated when he was nine. He left school in 1975 to take up tobacco picking in [[Motueka]]. After two years overseas, he returned to New Zealand. He then had a [[part-time contract|part-time job]] in a bakery in the 1980s which eventually became [[full-time]]. When he left this job and applied for [[unemployment benefits]], authorities discovered he had received dole payments to which he was not entitled. He was prosecuted and convicted in 1986 of "misleading a social welfare officer", and sentenced to 80 hours [[community service]].

Ellis carried out his community service at the Christchurch Civic Creche. His supervisor, Dora Reinfeld, later reported that "Peter ... provided some hilarious puppetry shows – one of which we had to abandon as staff and children 'got out of hand'". Ellis became a relieving worker, and Reinfeld's next monthly report said: "Peter Ellis has fitted in extremely well and puts lots of energy into programme planning. Fantastic team spirit."&lt;ref name="early_life"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hood|first=Lynley|year=2001|title=A City Possessed: The Christchurch Civic Creche Case|publisher=Longacre Press|isbn=1-877135-62-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis's pre-sentencing report said, "The overall picture gained of Peter Ellis is that of an outgoing, uninhibited, unconventional person given to putting plenty of enthusiasm and energy into his work and social activities, sometimes to the point of being risqué and outrageous."&lt;ref name="goldenshowers"&gt;R v Ellis [2000] 1 NZLR 513&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his imprisonment, Ellis had sexual relationships lasting for periods of two to five years with both men and women. He told Lynley Hood, "In a relationship with a woman I was, for want of a better word, [[bisexual]], and with a man I was [[monogamous]]." When working for the Civic Creche, Ellis was described by Hood as "blatantly homosexual".&lt;ref name="early_life" /&gt;

==Investigations==
[[File:North wall1.JPG|thumb|300px|The creche building in January 2006. The door to the toilet lobby, clearly visible, has not been changed since 1991. It features a large glass window and was kept open during the daily operation of the creche. The premises continued to operate as a day care centre until February 2011.]]
=== How it began ===
The case began in November 1991 when a mother, who was a sexual abuse counsellor and a self-claimed victim of sexual abuse, alleged that her four-year-old son said he "didn't like Peter's black penis." Although he explained that this remark was "only a story", his mother interpreted his statement to mean that he had been sexually interfered with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume5/j5_4_3.htm|title=Civic Creche Case, Christchurch|journal=IPT Forensics|year=1993|volume=5|first=Felicity|last=Goodyear-Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis was suspended from work and a meeting was held at the creche attended by staff members, a group of concerned parents, and representatives from the Social Welfare Department. In December, 1991, Sue Sidey, a department psychologist, interviewed six children for whom she felt there were some grounds for concern. The children made no disclosures of any indecent touching by a creche staff member. The police decided there was no case to answer and closed the investigation.&lt;ref&gt; Felicity Goodyear-Smith, [http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume5/j5_4_3.htm#en1 Civic Creche Case, Christchurch], from ''First Do No Harm: The Sexual Abuse Industry'', 1993, Auckland, New Zealand: Benton-Guy Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The role of Detective Colin Eade ===
In December 1991, Detective Colin Eade, who had no expertise in [[early childhood education]], advised the creche's employer, [[Christchurch City Council]], about the allegations. Eade, who at this stage had not interviewed Ellis, wrote: "To date there have been no disclosures of any sort of indecent touching by any person employed at the Child Care centre…[t]he reasons the parents, Ms Sidey [DSW] and myself were so concerned at the start of this enquiry, were that the children were displaying some behaviour that we often attribute to sexual abuse." Later in his letter Eade said the children who were interviewed by Sidey had a "general fear" of Ellis and this fear "may affect their behaviour for some time to come." He commented that it was clear to him that Ellis "should not be involved in any way in the supervision or care of children. I believe that we were very lucky to have this brought to our attention at this stage. If he had continued on at the Centre, things could have got worse."

=== The second police investigation ===

While the initial police investigation into the creche had officially concluded, children continued to be formally interviewed by Department of Social Welfare evidential interviewer Sue Sidey. She testified at trial that she conducted interviews throughout January 1992: "Thereafter I continued interviewing those children whose parents had concerns." Detective Eade was on leave during January 1992. As soon as he returned to work, Eade was advised that a child who had not attended the creche had disclosed sexual abuse. A new investigation then began into allegations of sexual abuse at the Civic Creche. When, over ten months later, this investigation concluded, police believed at least ten offenders had sexually abused children at the Civic Creche and eighty children were involved.&lt;ref name="Ansley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansley|first=B.|title=Judgement in Christchurch|journal=New Zealand Listener|date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's forensic interviews===
At least 118 children were interviewed as part of the second investigation into allegations of sexual abuse. Some had allegedly made allegations to their parents. Some were formally interviewed after they had been mentioned in abuse allegations made by other children. Many were interviewed following advice given to parents by police, sexual abuse counsellors and therapists. Some children were formally interviewed up to six times. One of the complainants upon whose evidence Ellis was convicted was formally interviewed over an eight-month period.

Contrary to [[best practice]] guidelines,&lt;ref name="Sas: Best Practice; interviews "&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichelbaum | first = Thomas
| title=Sir Thomas Eichelbaum's Report into the Peter Ellis Case | publisher=Ministry of Justice | url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case/appendix-c#BEST%20PRACTICE%20MODEL%20FOR%20INVESTIGATIVE%20INTERVIEWS | accessdate=2010-02-09 | chapter = Appendix C – Sas's comments | chapterurl = http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case/appendix-c | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; parents and interviewers discussed children's abuse-allegations that had been previously elicited by parents. Department of Social Welfare specialist interviewers Lynda Morgan and Sue Sidey both testified that they would then try to elicit the same allegations from the child. They would not try to determine if the allegations were reliable nor explore all possible origins of the children's allegations. One mother reportedly told her son's interviewer that she had repeatedly asked him direct questions. She said she was told she had done nothing wrong (Bander, 1997).

During the forensic interviews, children were asked if they had anything to say about the Civic Creche. Few allegations of abuse emerged during this phase of the interviews. Later in the interviews, many specific and direct questions were employed to elicit allegations that children had made to their parents. A number of suggestive and [[leading question]]s were asked. Questions were sometimes repeated when the child had already provided an answer. Children were seldom advised that it was acceptable to say "I don't know" or "I can't remember". Sue Sidey testified that "don't knows" and "can't remembers" were often "anxious responses". She provided no evidence to support her claim.

[[Anatomically correct doll]]s were used. Best practice for forensic interviewing now stipulates that interviewers should not employ such dolls. Best practice also stipulates that an interviewer should try to ascertain the source of a child's claims. Interviewers generally didn't ask children what they had previously heard or had been told about the case. They didn't ask the children what their parents had said to them about Peter Ellis or the Civic Creche. The evidential interviewers seldom probed children's bizarre allegations and sometimes ignored their own guidelines. One complainant told Sue Sidey on 14 occasions that she wanted to leave the interviewing room. Sidey testified at trial that the child appeared to be "very anxious".

==== Best practice on interviewing children ====

Since 1996 the [[New Zealand Department of Child, Youth and Family Services]] has recommended that children who are interviewed to determine if they have been abused should undergo only one evidential interview.&lt;ref name="interviews"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crime.co.nz/c-files.asp?ID=85 | title= Peter Ellis – Other arrests / Appeal fails | accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transcripts"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/Interviews/index.htm | title= Ellis: Child Molester or witch-hunt victim? | accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Stephen J. Ceci]] of [[Cornell University]], an expert in children's suggestibility and children's courtroom testimony, has studied transcripts of many of the children's evidential interviews. In July 1995 he said the interviews "were not conducted in accordance with currently understood scientific principles."&lt;ref name="Ceci 1995"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/1995/1995-0700_TVNZ_Interview-StephenCeci.htm | title= TVNZ Interview with Professor Stephen Ceci | accessdate=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ceci, it is impossible to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate allegations when children are suggestively and repeatedly interviewed over a long period.

=== Arrest ===
The police arrested Ellis on 30 March. Police met with parents again the next day and brought Sue Sidey to the meeting. 

During the [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] hearing into the charges against Ellis, Sidey said she might have told parents at the meeting that some of the indicators of sexual abuse were bedwetting, tantrums and nightmares. Sidey's supervisor, psychiatrist Karen Zelas, testified at trial that there are behavioural factors, which the crèche complainants allegedly exhibited, that are "consistent with" sexual abuse. Bedwetting, nightmares, anxiety, [[Abdominal pain|stomach aches]] were all, she said, consistent with sexual abuse. She did not say that the complainants had been sexually abused, or that she believed they had been abused.

== The Smart report ==

Following the first investigation into allegations of abuse at the creche, the Christchurch City Council requested that psychologist and [[Sex therapy|sex therapist]] Rosemary Smart review the management practices at the crèche. The review of the management of the Civic Creche was in response to "incidents of alleged sexual abuse of children at the Centre over a period of six years by a male staff member" (Smart, 1992). Smart assumed Ellis was guilty, although her report was completed nearly 12 months before his trial. She quoted 'research' by the [[New Hampshire]] sociologist [[David Finkelhor]], whose 1987 book ''Nursery Crimes'' became the bible for American believers in ritual abuse occurring in creches. Claims of satanic ritual abuse activity are now considered to be associated with [[moral panic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de Young | first = Mary | title = The Day Care Ritual Abuse Moral Panic | authorlink = Mary de Young | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC | year = 2004 | publisher = McFarland and Company | location = Jefferson, North Carolina, United States | isbn = 0-7864-1830-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Finkelhor's work has since been discredited.&lt;ref name ="Second Thoughts"&gt;"Second Thoughts on the Christchurch Civic Crèche case: Has justice failed Peter Ellis?", [https://www.peterellis.org.nz/1996/1996-08_NorthAndSouth_SecondThoughtsOnTheCrecheCase.htm ''North and South'', August 1996, Pages 54 - 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart provided no evidence that children had been sexually abused, and the staff that she spoke to "did not know of any incidents of sexual abuse of the children under their care." Nevertheless, Smart suggested female staff may have been directly or indirectly involved with abuse at the Civic Creche. Detectives involved in the Civic case said Smart's report was central to their decision to investigate Ellis's female colleagues.&lt;ref name="Second Thoughts"/&gt;

===Female creche workers implicated===

Smart's report, a copy of which was given to police, was completed in July 1992. Four female co-workers of Ellis were arrested on 1 October 1992. At depositions they faced 15 charges that included [[Sexual assault|sexual violation]], [[indecent assault]] and one charge of performing an indecent act in a [[Public space|public place]]. The charges were dropped, after depositions, on three grounds: firstly that evidence against them was of insufficient weight to justify a trial; secondly that there was so great a potential for prejudice against them that they might be convicted for the "wrong reasons"; and thirdly that the unavoidable delay in their trial may have resulted in hardship to the child involved. 

=== Compensation ===
On 3 September 1992, following discussions between the City Council, [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]] and police, the Civic Creche was closed. In March 1995, the four female employees and six other former staff who had also lost their jobs were awarded $1 million by the Employment Court. This was later reduced to $170,000 by the [[New Zealand Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] in September 1996.&lt;ref name="compensation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/summary/Chronology.htm | title=PeterEllis.org.nz – Chronology | accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ERO report ==
Smart's report stands in marked contrast to another report made by the [[New Zealand Education Review Office|Education Review Office]]. In the week following Ellis' suspension, Education Review Office inspectors spent a full week at the Civic Crèche observing its daily operation. The office subsequently issued a highly favourable report, stating that "The staff ensure personal needs are met with warmth, care and consideration. The children appear happy, inquisitive and sociable," and that "...they [the children] have high [[self-esteem]]."&lt;ref name="Ansley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ERO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/1991/1991-1129_EducationReviewOffice-Report.pdf |format=PDF| title=Education Review Office ''Civic Child Care Centre'' 25–29&amp;nbsp;November 1991 | accessdate=2006-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
At trial, Ellis faced 28 charges involving 13 children. He was charged with, among other things, urinating in a boy's face, placing his penis against a girl's vagina, placing his penis on her anus, touching a girl's vagina and inducing a girl to touch his penis. Some children alleged that he drove them in a white car to his flat in Hereford St, where they were allegedly abused. Most of the alleged abuse occurred in the toilets at the creche. "The offences were alleged to have taken place at unspecified times and dates between 1 May 1986 (four months before Ellis came to the creche) and 1 October 1992 (11 months after he left the creche, and one month after the creche was closed)." (Hood, 2001) Barristers Rob Harrison and Siobhan McNulty represented Ellis; Brent Stanaway and Chris Lange appeared for the Crown.

The complainants testified by two separate means: pre-recorded videotaped interviews conducted by Department of Social Welfare officers (evidence in chief); and testimony via a [[closed-circuit television|closed circuit TV]] link to the children, who were outside the courtroom. Prosecutors had sanitised some of the charges so that few of the bizarre allegations were heard. Rulings by the judge, Neil Williamson, meant that the playing of videotaped interviews not specific to the charges were subject to restrictions. The defence was permitted to play tapes of their choice, but the following applied: unlike prosecution tapes, the child complainants did not have to view defence tapes; in contrast to the prosecution tapes, the jury did not receive a transcript of tapes played by the defence. Before testifying, the children watched portions of their tapes, upon which the prosecution relied, but did not view defence-onus tapes in which they had denied being abused or had made bizarre allegations. Each complainant was accompanied in the CCTV room by an adult, usually a social worker who had been counselling the child in the months leading up to the trial.

Peter Ellis testified that on the occasions he took children for walks, he was accompanied by an adult 75% of the time. The only two bus trips he had taken with children were well documented and had involved other staff members. He stated that he walked to work, did not take a bus and that he did not know the bus timetables. He later qualified that statement and said that sometimes, when it was raining, he would catch a bus to work. He said that whenever possible he would try to avoid nappy [diaper] changes "and things like that". He accepted that he was "often in the toilets alone with children", as were other creche workers. He said that he had never had a driver's licence and had never owned a car. He could drive a car but he "wouldn't recommend anyone getting into it [with him]". He said he would sometimes wear track suit pants without wearing underwear. He did this, he said, because he suffered from [[psoriasis]].

[[The Crown]] prosecutor, Brent Stanaway, argued that Ellis took children on walks ostensibly so he could abuse them. Stanaway said there were only two walks recorded in the creche logbook for February 1990. Ellis said that the creche had moved to new premises near that time and that may have been the reason why there were fewer walks during that month. Ellis said he would sometimes forget to record details of the walks. If he was in a hurry, he would notify one of the creche staff and ask them to record the details. He said he didn't wear a watch but that walks lasted no longer than an hour and ten minutes. One of Ellis's colleagues testified that some walks lasted two hours or longer, but others confirmed Ellis's estimate.

One creche worker testified that Ellis had told her about taking photos of adult [[Human sexual behavior|sex acts]]. Another said that Ellis had talked to her about "[[urolagnia|golden showers]]". It was alleged that Ellis and his mother had taken photos of adults engaged in sex. Ellis testified that he had not spoken to any creche worker about "golden showers".&lt;ref name="goldenshowers"/&gt; He admitted that he had talked about photos of sex acts with a colleague but that he was "having her on". Ellis owned a camera, as did the Civic Creche. An extensive police investigation turned up no photos of adult (or child) sex acts.

Two [[general practitioner]]s of medicine appeared for the Crown. They testified about medical examinations of complainant children which were undertaken to record any physical evidence that supported sexual abuse. Their evidence neither confirmed nor excluded the possibility of sexual abuse. Both testified that abuse involving the trauma that was alleged by some of the children, such as insertion of sticks and burning paper into the anus, would result in severe [[pain]] and distress to children of that age and that such discomfort might last for days, dependent on its severity.&lt;ref name="Medical testimony"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hood|first=Lynley|year=2001|title=A City Possessed: The Christchurch Civic Creche Case|publisher=Longacre Press|isbn=1-877135-62-3|pages=497–498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Medical testimony_2"&gt;Trial record R v Ellis, pages 289–297&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two of the children repeated claims that many adults had been involved in the abuse of children. Spike, Boulderhead, Yuckhead, Stupidhead and other names were mentioned. Several children testified that their parents had questioned them about Ellis. The questions bore a resemblance to the nature of the charges. For example, one boy testified that his mother had asked him if Ellis had urinated in his face. He said his mother had been told by other parents what Ellis had done to him. One girl said she "learnt about all the things Peter did" before being formally interviewed. When asked who taught her, she replied: "Cathy [a specialist interviewer], and she told me what Peter did." The other interviewers denied coaching the children before their interviews. However, during Lynda Morgan's interview of child O (court code), the only complainant to be interviewed only once, the child agreed with Morgan that she had spoken to Sue Sidey before the interview.

Psychiatrist Karen Zelas was the prosecution's [[expert witness]]. She had advised police during their investigation as to how they should collect evidence. She had trained and overseen the interviewers and had attended the second parents' meeting. She had previously advised judges on how child sexual abuse cases should be prosecuted. She contributed to the formulation of section 23G of the Evidence Act, under which an expert can say that certain behaviours are "consistent with" sexual abuse. Scientists and research-based experts that do not have a clinical background are not permitted to testify in cases of sexual abuse.

Zelas testified that the complainants were credible and their evidence was plausible. Their behaviour, she said, was consistent with sexual abuse. When asked what behaviour was inconsistent with sexual abuse, Zelas replied: "I hadn't thought about that." She testified that direct questions were acceptable and useful. "There is a substantial body of research evidence that shows asking children direct questions increases substantially the amount of detail or information they are able to give…the asking of such questions does not lead to significantly more inaccurate answers." However, in a 1992 television interview (Holmes, TVNZ), Zelas said that parents who question their children about sexual abuse "might introduce ideas to the child by the way in which they ask questions…and then...it may be impossible to know whether or not their child actually has been abused." In August 1992, she wrote to the police saying that two of the complainants had undergone "highly leading questioning" from their parents. Her letter was not disclosed to Ellis's defence, and Zelas did not mention any concerns about the two children's credibility at trial.

Karen Zelas also testified that children had to experience sexual activity before they could describe it. "They have to either be told about it in explicit detail, observe it or have it done to them." She qualified that by saying that information provided to children to keep them safe was not sufficiently explicit to "give the children the depth of knowledge that would enable them to describe in detail…acts of sexual activity in a plausible manner."

Psychiatrist and defence expert Keith Le Page said that none of the behaviours described by Zelas were specific to sexual abuse. Le Page said that the child's [[family history]] had to be examined to determine other stressors in the child's life. Changing schools, for example, could be stressful. He said: "The only way to be certain is to get inside the child's mind at the moment when these things were happening because there was no evident stress from any child in relation to any of these things until they were questioned [by their parents]." Le Page said that in his experience, children and adults who had been abused usually expressed distress when recounting their experiences of abuse. "It's not until they really come to terms with what has happened to them that their emotions will stabilise." The complainants showed little or no distress when describing acts of abuse during their interviews and when later testifying in court.

Le Page also testified that children couldn't remember events experienced at a very young age when there was a long delay between the event and the attempt to recall it. Children couldn't remember events, even traumatic events, that had occurred at two or three years of age when there was a long delay, he claimed. The alleged abuse at the creche had occurred when children were at these ages.

=== Conviction ===
In June 1993 Ellis was convicted of 16 counts of [[sexual offences]] involving seven children. The following year he was acquitted of three charges involving the oldest complainant, who had retracted her allegations.

==Aftermath==
A number of irregularities in the trial were publicised in a [[Three (TV channel)|TV3]] ''[[20/20 (New Zealand TV program)|20/20]]'' television programme which aired on 16 November 1997. The programme alleged that the jury foreman had been the celebrant at the Crown Prosecutor's wedding 15 years earlier, and another juror had had a [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationship]] with a close work colleague of a complainant's mother. The investigating detective, Colin Eade, had had sexual relationships with two of the mothers after the trial and had propositioned another during the course of the investigation. He also had had a sexual relationship with one of the evidential interviewers after the trial. The mother whom he propositioned subsequently withdrew her child, the first to make a formal disclosure of abuse, from the inquiry. In 1994 Eade left the police suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crime.co.nz/c-files.asp?ID=39 | title= Peter Ellis | accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Eade said in the television documentary that he would not be surprised if all the complainants had not recanted at some stage of the investigation.

The [[Accident Compensation Corporation]], ACC, reportedly paid more than $500,000 to about 40 parents of Civic Creche children. Generally parents received a standard $10,000, "but in cases where Ellis faced multiple charges relating to a single child, some parents claimed for each alleged incident of abuse" (McLoughlin, 1996). One child's parents allegedly claimed five payments, another claimed four. A conviction was not necessary before money was paid out. An absence of charges did not prevent parents from receiving a payout. Colin Eade and therapists working with the complainants wrote letters to ACC supporting claims for compensation, many of these applications involved children who were not part of subsequent court proceedings.

==Appeals==
The case entered the Court of Appeal in February 1994&lt;ref name="appeal1"&gt;R v Ellis (1994) 12 CRNZ 172&lt;/ref&gt; with Nigel Hampton, QC, and, when Hampton later fell ill, Graham Panckhurst, QC, acting as counsel for Ellis; both were assisted by Rob Harrison. Brent Stanaway and Chris Lange appeared for the Crown. The hearing was interrupted on 28 July when the oldest child on whose testimony Ellis was convicted told her parents that her story was not true, that she had said only what she thought her parents and the interviewer wanted to hear. The Court of Appeal considered that it was not uncommon for child complainants to withdraw their allegations. The appellate judges believed the retraction may have been a case of denial on the part of the child and was grounds to overturn only those convictions relating to that child.&lt;ref name="interviews" /&gt; The child has continued to maintain that she fabricated her allegations.

In November 1998, Ellis presented a second petition to the Governor General seeking a Royal Commission on Inquiry into his case, and either a free pardon or for the whole case to be referred back to the Court of Appeal. The Secretary for Justice sought advice from [[Thomas Thorp|Sir Thomas Thorp]] on the second petition. His advice concluded that the terms of reference should be expanded.

In 1999 the Ellis case was referred to the Court of Appeal for a second time.&lt;ref name="goldenshowers"/&gt; [[Judith Ablett-Kerr]], QC, appeared as counsel for Ellis, and Simon France for the Crown. As was the case in the original trial and in the case of the first appeal, the court restricted the ambit of material it would examine. Reliability of the complainants' accounts, contamination by parents and other sources, along with non-disclosure by police of photographs to [[Defense (legal)|defence counsel]], formed the basis of Ablett Kerr's submission. Ablett Kerr argued that the jury had not been allowed to examine these issues in their entirety. The Crown argued that risks involved with multi-allegation, multi-victim cases were well understood at the time of the trial and the jury had been given a clear picture of the case.

Dr Barry Parsonson, former head of the New Zealand Psychologists Board, said in relation to the children's evidence that led to Ellis's conviction, "the probability of the proportion of fact outweighing the proportion of fiction must be very, very small indeed." He wrote a 120-page report into the children's interviews for Ellis's second Court of Appeal hearing. Michael Lamb, Ray Bull and Maggie Bruck are among international experts who have provided affidavits supporting Ellis's appeals to have his conviction overturned. At the second appeal the Crown presented the expert opinion of Dr Constance Dalenberg.

The court concluded that they were not persuaded that a [[miscarriage of justice]] had occurred but suggested a Royal Commission of Inquiry could better examine some of the issues raised. Ellis immediately presented a third petition to the Governor General.

In March 2000, Sir [[Thomas Eichelbaum]] was appointed to inquire into the Ellis case. He concluded that there was no doubt in regard to the reliability of the children's evidence. The Governor General declined a third application for a pardon.

In June 2003 a petition requesting a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Christchurch Civic Creche case was presented to Parliament. The request was rejected in 2005 by then Justice Minister Simon Power who advised that Ellis had not exhausted all other forms of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Power|first=Simon|title=Request for a Commission of Inquiry into the Peter Ellis Case|url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/2009/2009-1014_SimonPower_to_Brash-Rich-Hood.pdf|work=Letter|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Ellis announced his intention to lodge a fourth petition to the Governor General.

==Thorp report==
In 1999 retired High Court judge [[Thomas Thorp|Sir Thomas Thorp]] examined a petition for the [[royal prerogative of mercy]] lodged by Ellis's counsel, Judith Ablett Kerr. Thorp expressed misgivings with several aspects of the case and recommended a wide-ranging inquiry. His concerns included the lack of [[Corroborating evidence|corroboration]] of the children's claims, the sanitising of some of the charges, the testimony of Karen Zelas, and the fact that several experts with reputations in their field had expressed doubts about the accuracy of the children's claims.

He made several recommendations, among which included employing the services of [[Stephen J. Ceci]]. Ceci had commented on the case for a TVNZ Assignment television program. Ceci had been supplied with a limited number of transcripts but had not seen videotapes of the children's interviews. Thorp wrote "Professor Ceci's involvement to date appears to have been as a consultant to TV3 [sic]. His studies of the American mass allegation creche cases suggest that his opinion could be of particular value. There seems no reason why the Ministry, or Crown Law if it preferred, could not seek his opinion."

He noted the comments of Dr Barry Parsonson, Professor Ceci and Justice Wood, who presided over the [[Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service]]. Thorp stated that the central issues had "nearly attained" an evidentiary basis. If the opinions of Parsonson, Ceci and Wood were found to have substantial support, "it would", he said, "be difficult to argue against the existence of a serious doubt about the safety of the Petitioner's convictions."

==Ministerial inquiry==
In March 2000, then [[Justice Minister|Minister of Justice]] [[Phil Goff]] established a ministerial inquiry into the conduct of the interviews, headed by [[Thomas Eichelbaum|Sir Thomas Eichelbaum]]. This was undertaken in response to ongoing concerns over the reliability of the children's evidence. In a later submission, Ministry officials stated that the Ministerial Inquiry was "intended to address specific areas of concern that might not have been seen to have been fully resolved by the Court of Appeal." Released in March 2001, Eichelbaum's inquiry concluded that the interviews were of good quality overall, and that though excessive questioning by some parents could have led to some contamination, this would not have been sufficient to affect the convictions.&lt;ref name="eichelbaum"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichelbaum | first = Thomas
| title=Sir Thomas Eichelbaum's Report into the Peter Ellis Case | publisher=Ministry of Justice | url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case | accessdate=2010-02-09 | chapter = Chapter 1 – Executive Summary | chapterurl = http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case/1.-executive-summary | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichelbaum made several comments about the case. He found that "the evidence emerged in a credible way." If a particular allegation was induced by a leading question, but jurors did not view the tape, it could not have caused Mr Ellis "any prejudice". The interviewers "were rarely coercive, and remained neutral throughout." The arguments raised by Ellis's counsel in relation to mass allegations "were recognised and traversed" at trial and during two Court of Appeal hearings. Whatever "shortcomings as occurred in the interviewing process did not lead to convictions." In relation to the [[Service of process|legal process]], "doubtful allegations and charges were weeded out. Some charges were dismissed at a preliminary stage, and others during the pre trial process. The jury was astute in identifying those where the supporting evidence or the method by which it emerged was open to valid criticism." The case put forward on Ellis's behalf failed "by a distinct margin; I have not found this anything like a borderline judgment."

The ministerial inquiry was itself controversial. Thomas Eichelbaum was instructed in his terms of reference to seek opinions "from at least two internationally recognised experts (if possible with experience in mass allegation child sexual abuse)." Val Sim, then chief [[Lawyer|legal counsel]] at the [[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Justice Ministry]], advised Sir Thomas on possible candidates. Many leading sex abuse researchers and experts were "discounted" by Sim, due to previous involvement with the case, short publication histories, an overly academic focus, or a controversial public profile. This included Stephen Ceci because he had already expressed a view on the case in the media. Gail Goodman's career had been controversial, but Goodman was Sim's first choice.&lt;ref name="Sim 2000-06-02"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sim |first=Val |authorlink=Val Sim |year=2000 |url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/2000/EichelbaumCorrespondence/2000-0602_Sim_Experts-B-Letter.pdf |title=Letter to Rt Honourable Sir Thomas Eichelbaum, 2&amp;nbsp;June 2000 |format=PDF |page=5 |publisher=www.peterellis.org.nz |accessdate=2006-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two experts were selected: Graham Davies, professor of psychology (UK), and Dr Louise Sas (Canada), a [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]] and [[child advocate]] who had no prior experience in mass allegation creche cases. In a confidential Ministry of Justice memo, Eichelbaum stated that he didn't appoint Ceci or Goodman because of their "research direction" and "high profile".&lt;ref name="Petherick"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/2000/EichelbaumCorrespondence/2000-0613_Petherick_FileNote.htm | title=File note, Michael Petherick, Meeting with Sir Thomas Eichelbaum, 13&amp;nbsp;June 2000 | accessdate=2006-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eichelbaum was advised by Val Sim to ignore Thorp's report because it was not a public document.&lt;ref name="sims"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/2000/EichelbaumCorrespondence/2000-0525_Sim_Videotapes.pdf |format=PDF| title=Letter from Val Sim, Chief Legal Counsel, Ministry of Justice, to Sir Thomas Eichelbaum, 25&amp;nbsp;May 2000 | accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichelbaum interpreted his terms of reference such that he did not interview anyone who had been directly involved with the case. He did not speak with any of the children. He did not speak with the children's parents, some of whom regularly visited the Civic Crèche. He did not speak with the children's evidential interviewers. He did not speak with any of the crèche workers. He did not speak with Ellis's mother. He did not speak with Peter Ellis. He did not speak with the oldest complainant, one of seven children upon whose evidence Ellis was convicted. Several months after the trial had ended, the child stated that she had not been sexually abused. Eichelbaum did not seek advice from academics within New Zealand universities when appointing experts for his inquiry.&lt;ref name="Corballis"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3305/features/681/memory_the_law.html;jsessionid=A5FCD535929BCCFC7F25DAC877C4DC6C| last=Corballis| first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Corballis| title=Memory and the Law| work=[[New Zealand Listener]]| date=September 13–19, 2003| accessdate=2006-09-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011714/http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3305/features/681/memory_the_law.html;jsessionid=A5FCD535929BCCFC7F25DAC877C4DC6C| archive-date=28 September 2007| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only people with whom Eichelbaum discussed the matter of the selection of the experts were Justice Ministry officials and Thomas Lyon, a [[Law of the United States|USA law]] professor. In 1999 Lyon criticised the direction and relevance of research undertaken by experts nominated by Ellis's counsel.&lt;ref name="Lyon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Thomas|date=May 1999|title=The New Wave in Children's Suggestibility Research: A Critique|journal=[[Cornell Law Review]]|volume=84|issue=4|pages=1–71 |url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/Papers/ThomasLyon/TheNewWave_ThomasLyon_1999.htm|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyon's critique was cited approvingly in the Crown's submission to the ministerial inquiry.

The Crown submission said: "The new wave researches [sic] assume that highly suggestive interviewing techniques are the norm in an abuse investigation when there is little [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] to support this view." Stephen Ceci, one of the "new wave", has rejected this claim. Also, it is difficult to see the relevance of the above quote in the context of the Civic Creche case, which is atypical of sex abuse investigations. Lyon agrees that "if one knows whether a particular child was interviewed with suggestive techniques, then one need not ask what most interviews are like." Two of the "new wave", Ceci and Maggie Bruck, wrote an [[amicus brief]] on [[suggestibility]] in support of Kelly Michaels. It was signed by 43 of the 46 researchers who were asked to do so, among them some of the "most well-respected researchers in psychology" (Lyon). Michaels' convictions were subsequently overturned. Ceci and Friedman write that "what Lyon characterizes as a 'new wave' of research is actually a broad and long-standing scientific mainstream."&lt;ref name="CeciFriedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ceci|first=Stephen J.|authorlink=Stephen J. Ceci|author2=Richard D. Friedman|date=November 2000|title=The Suggestibility of Children: Scientific Research and Legal Implications|journal=Cornell Law Review |volume=86|issue=1|pages=33–108 |url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/Papers/StephenCeci/Ceci-etal_2000_TheSuggestibilityOfChildren.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2006-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichelbaum claimed that "the experts and I independently reached the view that the children's evidence in the conviction cases was reliable." Eichelbaum did not say how he determined the children's evidence to be reliable. Professor Graham Davies, one of his appointees, did not assert that the children's evidence was reliable. He wrote he would not "pronounce on the reliability of individual children's accounts."&lt;ref name="davies"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichelbaum | first = Thomas
| title=Sir Thomas Eichelbaum's Report into the Peter Ellis Case | publisher=Ministry of Justice | url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case | accessdate=2010-02-09 | chapter = Appendix A – Davies's comments | chapterurl = http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case/appendix-a | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children's age and the historic nature of the alleged abuse meant that the children could not "be expected to provide the kind of detailed and spontaneous accounts which are so useful from the point of view of making judgements on reliability." Davies stated that he had doubts about the accuracy of allegations concerning abuse outside the crèche. Five guilty verdicts resulted from such allegations.

Louise Sas did not refer to the lack of corroboration of the children's claims. She said that "some parents may have wrongly attributed their child's symptoms to abuse without considering an alternative hypothesis." In her discussion of bizarre allegations in one complainant's evidential interview, she mentioned children being hung in cages as an example of an event "that really happened".&lt;ref name="sas"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichelbaum | first = Thomas
| title=Sir Thomas Eichelbaum's Report into the Peter Ellis Case | publisher=Ministry of Justice | url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case | accessdate=2010-02-09 | chapter = Appendix C – Dr Sas' Report | chapterurl = http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case/appendix-c | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child had claimed that Peter Ellis's mother placed him and other children in cages which were hung from the ceiling. No cages were found and Peter Ellis's mother was not the subject of any charges.

Sas noted, as did Davies, that the interviewers had made errors during the interviewing of children. She concluded that these errors were of no consequence and that the children's evidence was reliable.

Sir Thomas Eichelbaum was unconcerned about the lack of corroboration of the children's claims. Graham Davies, however, wanted the issue of corroboration to be investigated as part of "the wider inquiry". Davies erroneously believed that his report was part of a wide-ranging inquiry. Eichelbaum's terms of reference meant that he did not need to traverse the issues raised in Sir Thomas Thorp's report. Eichelbaum therefore did not try to determine whether the opinions of Parsonson, Ceci and Wood had substantial support.

Phil Goff, then Minister of Justice, claimed that the Ministerial Inquiry had cost $500,000. The amount budgeted for the inquiry was $500,000 to $800,000. The actual cost was $148,878.&lt;ref name="Ellis inquiry cost much less than $500,000 stated"&gt;{{cite news | title=Ellis inquiry cost much less than $500,000 stated | work =[[Otago Daily Times]] | date=26 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A mother's story==
In 1997, Joy Bander published a book about the case. Bander says that after she had heard about allegations of abuse at the creche, she asked her son, Tom, who had attended the creche, if Peter Ellis had abused him. He said he had not and referred to Ellis as his "friend". Bander said she felt "relieved". She said that Tom "would have told us if anything had happened, by asking him directly I had satisfied myself completely." She said she continued to question him "about once a week". His answers didn't cause "the slightest alarm in me, I felt more and more reassured." While Tom was being questioned by his seventeen-year-old brother, he made an ambiguous allegation of abuse. According to Bander, Tom told his brother that Ellis had "'smacked my bottom really, really hard. I couldn't hear the smack but it really hurt.'"

At his first evidential interview Tom stated that "he [Ellis] was alright when I did go there... and now he's not."&lt;ref name="Davies comments on interview of X"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichelbaum | first = Thomas
| title=Sir Thomas Eichelbaum's Report into the Peter Ellis Case | publisher=Ministry of Justice | url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case/appendix-a | accessdate=2010-02-09 | chapter = Appendix A – Davies' comments | chapterurl = http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/s/sir-thomas-eichelbaums-report-into-the-peter-ellis-case/appendix-a | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom repeated his claim that he had been smacked by Ellis. It had allegedly occurred when Ellis took him to the toilet after he had soiled himself. Bander, who had attended the Knox Hall meeting, continued to question Tom after his first formal interview. Three months later, after an incident during which Tom allegedly swore at his mother, Bander and her boyfriend arranged with Tom "to sit down and talk about the creche. I believe you've got a lot to tell me, and now it's time to talk." During that discussion, Bander says Tom made more allegations of abuse. He later told her that he had killed a boy. "Tommy said he really was killed and lots of blood came out of him," said Bander. Tom also said he had been buried in coffins and tied up in cages. He spoke of various places outside the creche where he had allegedly been abused. After one of his evidential interviews, Bander says she was advised that Tom "was probably adding in a story to please the interviewer, and to please me." Bander did not accept that was the case. Bander said that she questioned Tom on a weekly basis until the completion of his fifth and final formal interview in August 1992. Police requested prosecution expert witness Karen Zelas review these later interviews to determine the credibility of the information disclosed in them and to advise upon matters which might be further investigated. On 28 August 1992, she wrote that Tom's parents had "subjected him to intensive interrogation pertaining to 'ritual' abuse...[which] could make it easy to dismiss [his] statements as having little probative value whether or not they might be accurate." She also said that Tom had been subject to "highly leading questioning" by his parents.&lt;ref name="Zelas letter to Ell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/1992/1992-0828_KarenZelas_LetterToPolice.htm | title=Letter from Karen Zelas to John Ell, NZ Police, 28&amp;nbsp;August 1992 | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury never saw this letter. Ellis was found guilty on three of the four charges pertaining to Tom.

In 1994, after the trial, Bander was instrumental in founding the End Ritual Abuse Society Incorporated.&lt;ref name="ERA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/1994/ERA/B_Cert_of_Inc.pdf |format=PDF| title=End Ritual Abuse Incorporated (pdf)| accessdate=2006-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rules stated, "The purpose of this society is to educate the public on ritual abuse and to provide written, audio and visual information on the subject matter." A condition of belonging was that an applicant must be "believing of the existence of ritual abuse". Any member who "discredits those who accept the existence of ritual abuse" was liable for expulsion.&lt;ref name="ERA rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/1994/ERA/3_Rules.pdf|format=PDF| title=End Ritual Abuse Inc: Rules (pdf)| accessdate=2006-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latest reports==
The Ellis case is highly controversial, with many New Zealanders believing he is innocent. A poll of 750 adults conducted in 2002 by the ''[[National Business Review]]'' revealed that 51% thought Ellis was innocent, 25% thought he was guilty, and 24% were unsure.&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_newze.htm | title=Christchurch, New Zealand, Ritual Abuse Cases | accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has been linked with the [[day-care sex-abuse hysteria]], a [[moral panic]] that originated out of California in 1982 and that existed throughout the 1980s. It has also been cited as a major cause in the decline in the number of male teachers in [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand schools]].
&lt;ref name="teacher decline"/&gt;

Research by London ''et al.'' (2005) has found that, contrary to the testimony of Dr Karen Zelas, sexually abused children typically disclose abuse when asked. They seldom deny or recant abuse allegations. The authors noted that the highest recantation rates were found in studies of allegedly abused children in a day-care setting. "Because of concerns about the actual abuse status of the children in these studies, one might argue that these recantation rates reflect the number of children who attempt to discredit their own previous false allegations by setting the record straight."

The continued campaign on behalf of Ellis has angered at least two of the complainants and their parents. "I would have been happy to never talk about the abuse ever again.... I'm sick of being called a liar. And if I don't say anything, Peter Ellis will keep going around saying he's innocent and more people will believe him," stated 'Tom' in a 2003 newspaper interview.&lt;ref name="Children speak out"&gt;{{cite news | title=Christchurch Civic Creche Children Speak Out | publisher=The Dominion Post | date=16 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom, the son of Joy Bander, said he stood by the allegations, including being hung in a cage, that he had made as a young child. He said parents had nothing to do with what the children had said and that all his parents had ever said to him was that he should tell the truth. He continued to claim that female staff at the creche had abused him.

Ellis has received widespread support. In 2001 Lynley Hood published a book about the case and the moral panic of sexual abuse within New Zealand at that time. In 2002 ''A City Possessed'' won the top prize for non-fiction and for readers' choice in the [[Ockham New Zealand Book Awards|New Zealand Book Awards]]. In June 2003, two petitions called for a [[royal commission]] of inquiry into the case. The first, organised by then [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] leader [[Don Brash|Dr Don Brash]] and MP [[Katherine Rich]], had 140 highly prominent signatories, including retired [[High Court of New Zealand|high court]] judge Laurence Greig, nine [[Queen's Counsel|QCs]], two previous [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime ministers of New Zealand]] [[David Lange]] and [[Mike Moore (New Zealand politician)|Mike Moore]], former Auckland [[Chief of police|police chief]] Bryan Rowe, nine professors of law, historian [[Michael King]], "Rachel", a complainant who later retracted her allegations that Ellis had abused her, and experts in scientific, legal and social fields. In 2006, Don Brash cited the case when supporting calls for an independent body investigating [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="brash"&gt;Brash said, "It is cases like the Peter Ellis case that highlight the need for an independent body with the resources and authority to investigate possible miscarriages of justice." {{cite news | title=Brash backs probe panel | publisher=New Zealand Herald | date=23 January 2006 | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10364904 | accessdate=2006-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, "Rachel", then 18, publicly supported the call for a commission of inquiry into the case. She testified at depositions that Peter Ellis had abused her. She did not testify at his trial. She believes that her mother was phoned by [[social work]]ers because her name had been mentioned by other children. When she was formally interviewed she said that Ellis had touched her. When asked where, she replied, "On my head". She said she enjoyed her time at the creche. "I remember loving being there. I remember playing lots of games. Peter was really nice. I got on really well with Peter...I could have imagined that if something was wrong, I would have sensed that." She said she felt pressured by investigators. "I had a feeling I was involved in something pretty serious. One of the women told me Peter had done all these really bad things, and I remember saying, 'But he's a really nice guy'." She said she would have remembered if she had been abused: "I knew he didn't do it." She believes he was convicted because he is homosexual and was the only male worker at the creche.&lt;ref name="Rachel"&gt;{{cite news | title=Complainant seeks inquiry into Ellis case | publisher=The Press | date=23 January 2003 | url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/2003/2003-0628_ThePress_ComplainantSeeksInquiryIntoEllisCase.htm | accessdate=2006-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]]'s justice and electoral [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] reported on the two [[petition]]s relating to the Ellis case. The committee had several concerns with the way the case was prosecuted. It recommended several changes, although it acknowledged that changes had already been made to the way that children were now interviewed. It also suggested that the testimony of expert prosecution witness Karen Zelas would not be permitted if it were proffered now. The committee noted that "The operation of the legal system in respect of this case did not inspire adequate public confidence in the operation of the legal system. A [[Criminal law|justice system]] should lead to certainty. In this case it seemed to increase the sense of uncertainty." However, the committee rejected the petitioners' call for a commission of inquiry, concluding that it was not practical to hold such an inquiry.&lt;ref name="Justice Committee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/docs/2005/2005-0808_JusticeElectoral_Report.pdf |format=PDF| title=Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee (pdf) | publisher=New Zealand House of Representatives | accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007 and January 2008, three articles on the Ellis case were published in ''The New Zealand Law Journal''. These included ''New Evidence in the Peter Ellis Case''&lt;ref name="New Evidence"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/2007/2007_francis_new_evidence.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530155831/http://www.peterellis.org.nz/2007/2007_francis_new_evidence.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-05-30 | format=PDF | title=New Evidence in the Peter Ellis case(pdf) | publisher=New Zealand Law Journal | accessdate=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by researcher Ross Francis, which prompted [[Thomas Thorp|Sir Thomas Thorp]] to comment that the articles "must add to concerns expressed previously that that case may have gone awry."&lt;ref name="Gone awry"&gt;{{cite news | title=Call for inquiry into justice system ignored: ex-judge | publisher=New Zealand Herald | date=12 January 2008 | url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/2008/2008-0112_nz_herald_call_for.htm | accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007 the New Zealand Innocence Project heard from [[University of Otago]] Professor Harlene Hayne of her research which compared the standard of interviews conducted in the Ellis case with those of the [[Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial|Kelly Michaels]] case. Empirical analysis allowed Hayne to conclude that there was a "strong risk that the evidence of children who told of sexual abuse by Ellis was contaminated by the way the interviews were carried out," and that, contrary to Eichelbaum's conclusions, "the standard of the questions in Ellis was not substantially better than those in Michaels." Francis's articles and Hayne's research were cited in January 2008 by Ellis's counsel when making a renewed request that the Ministry of Justice establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the case,&lt;ref name="RCOI"&gt;{{cite news | title=Peter Ellis' lawyers seek Royal Commission | publisher=New Zealand Herald | date=29 January 2008 | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10489380 | accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Associate Justice Minister [[Rick Barker]] rejected this approach in March 2008.&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{cite news | title=Commission decision inevitable says Ellis | publisher=TVNZ | date=28 March 2008 | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_national_story_skin/1664900 | accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further call for a Commission of Inquiry was made by former National MPs [[Katherine Rich]] and [[Don Brash]] and author Lynley Hood in November 2008,&lt;ref name="RichBrashHood1"&gt;{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Espiner | title=Brash, Rich call for fresh inquiry into Ellis verdicts | publisher=The Press | date=15 December 2008 | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4792900a6160.html | accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RichBrashHood2"&gt;{{cite news | title=Former Nat MPs call for Commission of Inquiry | publisher=Scoop.co.nz | date=15 December 2008 | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0812/S00195.htm | accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new Minister of Justice [[Simon Power]] said that the government would reconsider the issue.&lt;ref name="Power1"&gt;{{cite news | title=Government to reconsider Peter Ellis case | publisher=The Press | date=15 December 2008 | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4793550a6009.html | accessdate=2009-01-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113102452/http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4793550a6009.html | archivedate=13 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later declined their request for an inquiry, on the grounds that Ellis still held the right of appeal to the Privy Council and an inquiry therefore could not achieve finality.&lt;ref name="Power2"&gt;{{cite news | title=Request for inquiry in Peter Ellis case declined | publisher=New Zealand Herald | date=14 October 2009 | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10603206 | accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 Ellis ended his long-standing association with [[Judith Ablett-Kerr]], the barrister who had led his second appeal in 1999. Ellis then appointed Nigel Hampton QC and Kerry Cook to pursue legal avenues of appeal. Hampton had previously prepared Ellis's first appeal against conviction in 1994.

On 17 December 2014 Don Brash and author Lynley Hood again called for a review of the case by way of an independent inquiry led by an authority from outside New Zealand. The appeal was made to [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]], the newly appointed Minister of Justice for the National Party-led government returned in the 2014 General Election.&lt;ref name="Call for inquiry"&gt;{{cite news | title=Don Brash renews appeal for Peter Ellis | publisher= Radio New Zealand | date=20 December 2014 | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/262273/don-brash-renews-appeal-for-peter-ellis | accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Par Jiek''' (1950s – 9 April 2017) was a [[brigadier general]] of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA), and veteran of the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]]. In the course of that conflict, Par fought under [[Riek Machar]] with several rebel and pro-government groups, and eventually became a powerful militia commander in [[Unity State|Western Upper Nile]]. In that region, he established his own fiefdom and gained some notoriety for his rivalry with another rebel leader, [[Peter Gadet]]. Even though he had followed Machar during the whole Second Sudanese Civil War until 2005, Par sided with President [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] upon the outbreak of the [[South Sudanese Civil War]] in 2013. Leading pro-government [[counter-insurgency]] forces in [[Wau State]] since 2014, Par was eventually [[2016–17 Wau clashes|ambushed and killed]] by [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition|SPLM-IO]] rebels loyal to Machar in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theinsider.ug/index.php/2017/04/11/machar-rebels-kill-two-spla-generals/|title=Machar rebels kill two SPLA Generals|work=The Insider|author=|date=11 April 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Second Sudanese Civil War ===
==== Initial rebellion and rise in ranks ====
Peter Par Jiek was born in the 1950s as a member of the Dok subgroup of the [[Nuer people]]. He attended the [[Malakal]] secondary school where he received his [[Education in South Sudan|high school education]]. After the outbreak of the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], he joined the SPLA.&lt;ref name="found" /&gt; In 1991, however, Par followed Riek Machar as he broke away from the SPLA,&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;{{sfn|Rone|2003|pp=17, 18}} and afterwards served in Machar's various rebel groups, such as the [[SPLA-Nasir]], [[SPLA-Nasir#Resulting fighting|SPLA-United]], and [[SPLA-Nasir#Dissolution|SSIM/A]]. Eventually, Machar and Par joined the [[South Sudan Defence Forces (militia)|SSDF]] in 1997,&lt;ref name="found" /&gt;&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; an alliance of militias that had decided to side (for the time being) with the [[Sudan]]ese government against other rebel factions.{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=12}} This alliance soon broke down, however, and Par fought under [[Tito Biel]] against the [[Sudanese Armed Forces]] in 1998–99 in [[Unity State|Western Upper Nile]], most notably at [[Leer, South Sudan|Leer]].{{sfn|Rone|2003|pp=17, 18}}{{sfnp|Harker|2000|p=13}} In May 1999, a major government offensive defeated the rebellious SSDF forces, recapturing Leer and driving the SSDF mostly from Western Upper Nile. While most of the SSDF retreated to [[Nyal, South Sudan|Nyal]], Par and some of his men instead moved to [[Tonj]] in [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]].{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=273}} Machar then ordered Par to participate in the Wunlit talks with the SPLA, where he was supposed to ask the SPLA for assistance against the government; the SPLA did sent limited aid, and the SSDF consequently was able to regain some ground.{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=306}} 

In early 2000, Machar left the SSDF, forming the [[Sudan People's Defense Forces/Democratic Front|SPDF]], and Par yet again followed him.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;{{sfn|Rone|2003|pp=358–360}} In March of that year, he was appointed the SPDF's overall commander for Western Upper Nile by Machar.{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=338}} In this position, he expanded his forces by recruiting Dok Nuer, who generally supported him.{{sfn|Rone|2003|pp=77, 346}} From March 2016 onwards, the allied forces of Par and the SPLA, under [[Peter Gadet]]'s command, gained some ground against the Sudanese army and [[Paulino Matip Nhial]]'s pro-government militia, while continuing to weaken the government's grip on the area by ambushing military convoies and destroying oil pipelines.{{sfn|Rone|2003|pp=342, 343}}

==== War of the Peters ====
[[File:Southern Sudan Frontlines June 2001.svg|250px|right|thumb|Frontlines in June 2001; SPDF territory (including Par's) in green.]]

The cooperation between Peter Par and Peter Gadet broke down in June–July 2000, as their militias began to fight each other. Who was responsible for the outbreak of hostilities is unknown, as both sides blamed each other. The resulting conflict became known as "War of the Peters".{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=351}} As Par and Gadet battled for control over Western Upper Nile, the former was reportedly backed by the government, receiving ammunition from Matip's men.{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=352}} In return, Par's men guarded government installations, especially [[Block 5A, South Sudan|Block 5A]].{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=386}} Between July and August 2000, Par joined forces with Matip's pro-government militia and drove Gadet's men to the west of the [[Jur River]], though Gadet was able to retake all lost territory in August and September 2000. This fighting was brutal and led to enormous destruction and the displacement of up to 60,000 people.{{sfn|Rone|2003|pp=358–360}}{{sfnp|Nyaba|2002|p=116}} 

The War of the Peters continued until August 2001,{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=77}} when Par and Gadet agreed to a ceasefire. A few months later, Machar also came to an understanding with the SPLA leadership and agreed to merge the SPDF with the SPLA, whereupon Par and Gadet signed a final peace agreement in [[Koch, South Sudan|Koch]] in February 2002. As result, Par rejoined the SPLA.{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=364, 372, 373}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irinnews.org/fr/node/199369|title=Focus on oil-related clashes in western Upper Nile|work=[[IRIN]]|author=|date=28 February 2002|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadet and Par then split Western Upper Nile between them, with the latter receiving [[Bentiu]], [[Thar Jath]], Leer, and [[Adok]].{{sfn|Rone|2003|p=346}}

==== Later civil war and LRA insurgency ====
As their dispute was now settled, Par and Gadet concentrated on evicting the government from Upper Nile,{{sfn|Rone|2003|pp=77, 78, 413}} though the government soon launched a counter-offensive in the area. While Par managed to repulse an attempt of pro-government forces to capture Leer in September 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/2375/SPLM-Downs-Helicopter-Gunship-As-NIF-Escalates-Fighting.aspx|title=SPLM Downs Helicopter Gunship As NIF Escalates Fighting|work=gurtong|author=Samson L. Kwaje|date=26 September 2002|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Sudanese army eventually retook the town in January 2003 in an fresh drive to clear the area for oil exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sudanreeves.org/2004/12/14/khartoum-captures-leer-in-an-accelerating-offensive-in-sudans-oil-regions-january-27-2003/|title=Khartoum captures Leer in an accelerating offensive in Sudan's oil regions|date=27 January 2003|author=Eric Reeves|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The civil war eventually ended with the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] in 2005. Thereafter, Par was appointed [[lieutenant colonel]] of the SPLA, and took part in the [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency|campaign]] against the [[Lord's Resistance Army]]. By 2006, he and his men were stationed in [[Owiny Ki-Bul]] in [[Eastern Equatoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/61261/uganda-sudan-waiting-vain-rebels|title=Waiting in vain for rebels|work=[[IRIN]]|author=|date=5 October 2006|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Sudanese Civil War ===
After [[South Sudan]]'s independence in 2011, Par was appointed [[brigadier general]].&lt;ref name="death" /&gt; When the civil war between Kiir and Machar broke out in 2013, Par decided to side with Kiir, and quickly became one of the government's leading [[counter-insurgency]] commanders. He narrowly escaped death in 2014, when rebels captured [[Bentiu]] and [[2014 Bentiu massacre|massacred]] all local government supporters. Afterwards, Par joined the SPLA's 5th Division in [[Wau State]], where he was accused of ordering the killings of Nuer SPLA soldiers in [[Wau, South Sudan|Wau town]] and Mapel who were suspected of sympathizing with Machar. Since the outbreak of a widespread rebellion in Wau State in 2016, Par was heavily involved in fighting the local insurgents&lt;ref name="found" /&gt; and became the leading commander for all SPLA operations in Wau State.&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

In April 2017, Par led a major government offensive aimed at retaking Baggari, an important town in Wau State held by SPLM-IO forces. Though his men defeated the rebels and captured Baggari, his convoy was ambushed as it returned to Wau town on 9 April 2017. Par, along with Colonel Abraham Bol Chut Dhuol and twelve of their bodyguards, were killed in the following shootout.&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nyamile.com/2017/04/12/western-lake-governor-matur-chut-collapses-surviving-death-of-his-brothers/|title=Western Lake Governor Matur Chut Collapses, Surviving Death of his Brothers|publisher=Nyamilepedia|date=12 April 2017|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In revenge for their deaths, SPLA soldiers and pro-government [[Dinka people|Dinka]] militiamen belonging to [[Mathiang Anyoor]] murdered and robbed non-Dinkas in Wau town and surrounding villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/south-sudan-civilians-killed-wau-fighting-170410182833372.html|title=South Sudan: Civilians killed in Wau fighting|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=10 April 2017|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Feachem holds a [[Doctor of Science]] degree in Medicine from the University of London, and a PhD in [[Environmental Health]] from the [[University of New South Wales]]. In 2007, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Engineering by the University of Birmingham. He is a [[Fellow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Honorary Fellow of the [[Faculty (university)|Faculty]] of [[Public Health]] Medicine of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] and of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and [[Hygiene]]. In 2002, he was elected to membership of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the US National Academy of Sciences. Sir Richard was knighted by Her Majesty [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/pressreleases/?pr=pr_070105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work==
In October 2007, Sir Richard founded "The Global Health Group" within UCSF Global Health Sciences. The Global Health Group is an “Action Tank” dedicated to bringing major new paradigms in global health through to large scale action. This entails analysis, policy formulation, and consensus building, followed by intensive collaborations with individual developing countries to achieve large-scale application of the new ideas.   The Global Health Group is supported by grants from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[ExxonMobil]], and numerous other sources.

The Global Health Group has three Initiatives; the Malaria Elimination Initiative (MEI), the Private Sector Healthcare Initiative (PSHi) and the Evidence to Policy Initiative (E2Pi).  The MEI is dedicated to shrinking the malaria map by eliminating malaria from the endemic margins inwards. Under Sir Richard's leadership, a global Malaria Elimination Group (MEG) has been established. MEG had its first meeting in California in March 2008, its second in South Africa in October 2008, and its third in Switzerland in April 2009. Hainan, China, in December 2009; Huatulco, Mexico, in November 2010; Zanzibar, Tanzania, November 2011 and December 2012 in Al Ain, UAE. MEG VIII will return to California in October 2013.  The MEI team is based in San Francisco and Southern Africa and has made a significant contribution to policy, science and practice in malaria elimination.  The geographic focus of the work is primarily Asia Pacific and Southern Africa.

The Global Health Group, in collaboration with the Australian Government, the University of Queensland, and WHO launched the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN) in Brisbane in February 2009. APMEN brings together 14 eliminating countries from the Asia Pacific Region to share experiences and co-ordinate policy.

The second front of Feachem's Global Health Group is the PSHi, which focuses on studying and enhancing the role of the private sector in healthcare delivery in developing countries. Of particular interest is the model now known as the Public-Private Investment Partnership (PPIP) in which governments enter into partnerships with private consortia to finance and rebuild major health infrastructure and to provide clinical services over a period of decades.

The Global Health Group has joined with PwC to document pioneering PPIPs in that Spain, Lesotho, Latin America, S.E. Asia, and elsewhere.  A second model of special interest to the Global Health Group is Clinical Social Franchising. The fifth Compendium or Atlas on this topic was recently published by the Global Health Group.

The third Initiative of the Global Health Group is E2Pi, which provides rapid turnaround policy options, based on comprehensive evidence synthesis, concerning current issues in global health.  Clients have included the Gates Foundation, The Global Fund, GAVI, and UNITAID.  The E2Pi is also playing a major role in the Commission in Investing in Health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18299">'''Ruth Hyde Paine''' (born September 3, 1932) was a friend of [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina Oswald]], who was living with her at the time of the [[JFK assassination]]. According to five government investigations,&lt;ref&gt;These were investigations by: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (1963), the [[Warren Commission]] (1964), the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (1979), and the [[Dallas Police Department]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] stored the 6.5&amp;nbsp;mm caliber [[Carcano]] [[rifle]] that he used to assassinate U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[Ruth Paine Home|Ruth Paine's garage]], unbeknownst to her and her husband, [[Michael Paine (engineer)|Michael Paine]].&lt;ref name="WCR-C4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

== Background ==
Paine was born Ruth Avery Hyde, to her parents, William A. and Carol E. Hyde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/friends/ead/5109pain.xml An Inventory of the Ruth Hyde Paine, Marina Oswald Papers, 1963-1968]&lt;/ref&gt; She went to [[Antioch College]] and became a [[Quaker]]. Through her interest in folk dancing and music she met her future husband [[Michael Paine (engineer)|Michael Paine]]. Though strictly speaking not a Quaker, Michael attended meetings with Ruth. They married on December 28, 1957.

In 1959 Michael Paine got a job with [[Bell Helicopter]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 2, p. 385, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0197a.htm Testimony of Michael R. Paine].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Paines moved into a house in the suburb of [[Irving, Texas|Irving]] (Michael Paine's step-father, Arthur M. Young, invented the Bell Helicopter). As liberals in Dallas, the Paines were isolated, and Ruth Paine was quite lonely.&lt;ref name="Mallon"&gt;Thomas Mallon, Mrs. Paine's Garage and the Murder of John F. Kennedy.  {{ISBN|0-375-42117-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Paine had been studying [[Russian language|Russian]] since 1957. In the late 1950s she participated in Quaker pen pal programs and the East-West Contact Committee, which sponsored visits by three Soviets to the US. In 1963 she signed up to teach a summer class in Russian at [[St. Mark's School (Texas)|St. Mark's School]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], but only one student signed up ([[William Hootkins]], who became an actor and had a minor role in the movie ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' as [[X-wing]] pilot [[List of Star Wars characters#P|Jek Porkins]]).

Ruth Paine met the Oswalds through her interest in Russian. A friend from a singing group, Everett Glover, invited her to a party on February 22, 1963 because he thought she would be interested in meeting people who spoke Russian.&lt;ref name="Mallon"/&gt;  The party was arranged by Oswald's friend, 51-year-old Russian émigré [[George de Mohrenschildt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0373b.htm Warren Commission Report], Appendix 13, p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, p. 396, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh11/html/WC_Vol11_0203b.htm Testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine].&lt;/ref&gt; a well-educated petroleum geologist with intelligence connections.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, pp. 190-191, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0099b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; The Paines and Oswalds spent much time together after the party. Ruth befriended Marina though Lee was more distant, despite Ruth and Michael's efforts (and the Paines did not care for him much).

==John F Kennedy assassination==

===Involvement with Oswald family===
Ruth Paine drove Marina Oswald to [[New Orleans]] when the Oswalds moved there in May 1963&lt;ref name="aarclibrary.org"&gt;The Warren Report, Chapter 6, p. 284, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0154b.htm Investigation of Possible Conspiracy; Background of Lee Harvey Oswald]&lt;/ref&gt; and back to Dallas when they moved again in September 1963.&lt;ref name="aarclibrary.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 7–9, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0008a.htm Testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine Resumed].&lt;/ref&gt; When the Oswalds resettled in the Dallas area, Marina and Lee's child, June, moved in with Ruth Paine in the suburb of [[Irving, Texas]] while Lee stayed in a [[Lee Harvey Oswald Rooming House|boarding house]] under the name O.H. Lee.  The second Oswald child was born after Marina moved in. Marina helped with the housework and Ruth's Russian studies while Lee visited on weekends. By this time Michael and Ruth had separated, though their divorce was amicable and Michael was a frequent visitor. At the suggestion of a neighbor, Ruth Paine told Lee Oswald about a job opportunity at the [[Texas School Book Depository]].&lt;ref&gt;The Warren Report, Chapter 1, pp. 14–15, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0019b.htm Summary and Conclusions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Harvey Oswald stayed at the Paine home with Marina and his children unannounced on Thursday night, November 21, 1963—the night before President Kennedy was assassinated.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;KTRK-TV, [http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/state&amp;id=8929380 Suburban home that housed Lee Harvey Oswald being restored].

Retrieved January 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When Oswald left for work on the morning of November 22, he brought a large package that he had kept in the Paine's garage with him to work at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald's coworker and friend, Wesley Frazier testified that Oswald told him the bag contained curtain rods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0117b.htm Testimony of Wesley Frazier], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 2, pp. 226-227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magen Knuth, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/bag.htm The Long Brown Bag].&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence demonstrated that the package actually contained the rifle used by Oswald in the assassination.&lt;ref name="curtainrods"&gt;National Archives, [https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html#curtain Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy] Retrieved January 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bugliosi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Bugliosi|title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F.

Eight days after the assassination of President Kennedy, on November 30, 1963, Ruth Paine inadvertently discovered evidence that Lee Oswald had attempted to [[Lee Harvey Oswald#The attempted assassination of General Walker|assassinate General Edwin Walker]]. Among the letters that Ruth Paine repeatedly sent to Marina was a thick book of household advice in Russian. The book contained an undated note left by Lee for Marina on April 10, 1963 (the day of the Walker assassination attempt) which Marina would later testify she had concealed.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 392–393, CE 1785, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0212b.htm Secret Service report dated December 5, 1963, on questioning of Marina Oswald about note Oswald wrote before he attempted to kill General Walker].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0201a.htm Testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, p. 393–394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dallas Morning News 1963, p. 6"&gt;"Oswald Notes Reported Left Before Walker Was Shot At", ''Dallas Morning News'', December 31, 1963, sec. 1, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol2/html/HSCA_Vol2_0119b.htm Testimony of Marina Oswald Porter], HSCA Hearings, volume 2, pg. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Kennedy assassination, Dallas police had no suspects in the Walker shooting.&lt;ref name="Testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dallas Morning News 1963, p. 6"/&gt;{{sfn|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section A|1979|pp=60-61}}

===Aftermath of assassination===
Ruth Paine testified before the Warren Commission and has been interviewed by a number of authors, including Johnson, [[William Manchester]] and [[Gerald Posner]]. She has appeared in numerous documentaries and even a mock trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. She also testified in [[Jim Garrison]]'s trial of [[Clay Shaw]]. Paine was not called to testify before the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]].&lt;ref name="Mallon"/&gt;

Articles that have appeared in the mainstream press and publications about Ruth Paine have generally been kind. However, others have often depicted the Paines in a negative light; after the assassination, Marina and Lee Oswald's mother Marguerite briefly stayed with Ruth Paine until Marina was taken into custody by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. Marguerite and Lee's brother Robert did not like Ruth Paine, which may have influenced Marina Oswald. They thought Paine sought attention for herself, an opinion Marina would later express before the [[Warren Commission]]. Ruth wrote to Marina incessantly, with letters that took an almost desperate tone, but received no response except for a [[Christmas card]]. They met briefly in 1964 but afterwards they would never see each other again. Paine heard news about Marina through author Priscilla Johnson McMillan&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/biographies/oswald/interview-priscilla-johnson-mcmillan&lt;/ref&gt; until McMillan's relationship with Marina broke off in the early 1980s. 

Ruth Paine returned to Pennsylvania and became principal of a Quaker school, the [[Greene Street Friends School]] located in Germantown.  She soon moved to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and earned a master's degree in psychology from the [[University of South Florida]]. After working for the school system in [[Franklin County, Florida|Franklin County]] in the [[Florida Panhandle]], she returned to St. Petersburg and worked for the [[Hillsborough County, Florida]] school system until her retirement. She is active in Quaker and liberal charities and organizations and lives in [[Santa Rosa, California]].

The City of Irving bought the former Paine home in 2009 and has been restoring it to its 1963 condition to be turned into a museum in time for the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination on November 22, 2013.&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt;

Conspiracy theorists have attempted to connect the Paines to various conspiracies going back generations, since both Ruth and Michael Paine's relatives and ancestors held important government and business positions.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass,James W. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NfvkfM8IbBsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=JFK+and+the+Unspeakable+since+roosevelt&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mlFnT4m2NYHP4QSchOTwBw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=JFK%20and%20the%20Unspeakable%20since%20roosevelt&amp;f=false JFK and the Unspeakable.

According to a declassified CIA document, Ruth's sister, Sylvia Hyde Hoke, was listed as an employee of the agency in the Falls Church, VA local directory in 1961. Ruth visited and stayed with her sister in September 1963. Ruth admits that her sister may have worked for "an outfit."&lt;ref name="The Assassination &amp; Mrs. Paine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jfkpaine.com/research/paine-family-connections-to-the-cia/|title=Paine Family Connections to the CIA - The Assassination &amp; Mrs. Paine|work=The Assassination &amp; Mrs. Paine|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth's father, William Avery Hyde, was an insurance executive who went to work for USAID (United States Agency for International Development), which was and is a well known cover for CIA personnel. Declassified documents show that Hyde had contacts with the CIA, which at least considered him for use in an operation in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="The Assassination &amp; Mrs. Paine"/&gt;

Ruth's husband Michael Paine was the son of [[Ruth Forbes Paine]] and [[George Lyman Paine, Jr.|George Lyman Paine Jr.]].

In [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', the Paines are depicted as Bill and Janet Williams, played by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141632/ Gary Carter] and [[Gail Cronauer]]. While most names in the movie ''JFK'' were not changed, it has been suggested the Paines were renamed to avoid potential legal action.  (The name Janet Williams was used again in the 1993 TV movie ''[[Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald]]'', in which the role was played by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0049124/ Quenby Bakke].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141632/ Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald (1993), Japanese version in 1997, also known later as: Marina's Story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104235/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt#akas Marina's Story, releases in five different nations]&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Wilhelm von Kardorff''' (8 January 1828 in [[Neustrelitz]] – 21 July 1907) was a [[German Empire|German]] landowner and politician who supported the [[Free Conservative Party]]. From the founding of the [[North German Confederation]] in 1867 until his death he was one of the most influential members of his party.&lt;ref name="Fay"&gt;[[Sidney Bradshaw Fay|Sidney B. Fay]], 'Reviewed Work: Wilhelm von Kardorff: Ein Nationaler Parliamentarier im Zeitalter Bismarcks und Wilhelms II, 1828-1907 by Siegfried von Kardorff', ''The Journal of Modern History'' Vol. 9, No. 4 (Dec., 1937), pp. 529-530&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] and [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]], where he fought 31 [[duel]]s.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;[[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], 'Reviewed Work: Wilhelm von Kardorff, ein nationaler Parliamentarier im Zeitalter Bismarcks und Wilhelms II, 1828-1907 by Siegfried von Kardorff', ''The American Historical Review'' Vol. 43, No. 1 (Oct., 1937), pp. 126-128&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[civil service]] in the late 1840s and during the next decade purchased large estates in [[Silesia]].&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;

He greatly admired [[Otto von Bismarck]] and enjoyed a close friendship with him.&lt;ref name="Fay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gooch"&gt;G. P. Gooch, 'Reviewed Work: Wilhelm von Kardorff: ein Nationaler Parlamentarier im Zeitalter Bismarcks und Wilhelms II, 1828-1907 by Siegfried von Kardorff', ''The English Historical Review'' Vol. 51, No. 204 (Oct., 1936), pp. 713-714&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Panic of 1873]] and the consequent [[Long Depression|economic depression]], Kardorff campaigned for the restoration of [[protectionism]], founding the Central Association of German Industrialists in 1875.&lt;ref name="Gooch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt; This campaign was successful, with Bismarck passing a [[German tariff of 1879|tariff]] in 1879.&lt;ref name="Gooch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fay"/&gt; [[G. P. Gooch]] considered this the greatest achievement of Kardorff's career.&lt;ref name="Gooch"/&gt;

Kardorff was the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'s primary expert on economic affairs.&lt;ref name="Gooch"/&gt; His economic ideas were influenced by [[Henry Charles Carey]] and he fought unsuccessfully for the adoption of [[bimetallism]], persuading the Reichstag but not the British, who favoured [[gold standard|gold]].&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gooch"/&gt; He also opposed [[Leo von Caprivi]]'s commercial treaties that led to freer trade and campaigned for higher tariff rates, succeeding in [[German tariff of 1902|1902]].&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;

'''William MacDonald''', (17 June 1924&amp;nbsp;– 12 May 2015), known as "'''the (Sydney) Mutilator'''", was classed as Australia's first true [[serial killer]]. MacDonald was born in [[Liverpool]], England in 1924.&lt;ref name="Kidd"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/macdonald/monster_2.html | title = William "The Mutilator" Macdonald: The Making of a Monster | accessdate =28 October 2010 | last = Kidd | first = Paul B. | date = 2010 | work=William "The Mutilator" Macdonald | publisher= Turner Entertainment Networks }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 1962 MacDonald terrorised Sydney with a string of gruesome murders before being apprehended while working as a porter at Melbourne's [[Southern Cross railway station|Spencer Street railway station]] on 13 May 1963.&lt;ref name=impulses&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G0YVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6986,1244522&amp;dq Mutilation Killings Result of Strange Impulses, Court Told] ''[[The Age]]'', 9 August 1963, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His modus operandi was to select his male victims at random (mostly derelicts), lure them into a dark place, violently stab them dozens of times about the head and neck with a long bladed knife, and finally sever their penis and testicles.

==Early life==
In 1943 at the age of 19, MacDonald was enlisted in the army and transferred to the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]]. One night, MacDonald was [[rape]]d in an [[air-raid shelter]] by one of his [[corporal]]s. At first he felt traumatised, but later came to the conclusion that he enjoyed the experience which, however, preyed on his mind for the rest of his life. Discharged from the army in 1947, he was diagnosed as having [[schizophrenia]] and committed for several months to a [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental asylum]] where daily he was treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

MacDonald emigrated from England to Canada in 1949 and then to Australia in 1955. Shortly after his arrival, he was arrested and charged for touching a detective's penis in a public toilet. For this he was placed on a two-year good behaviour bond. In 1961, MacDonald moved to Sydney. He found accommodation in [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]], where he became well known in the parks and public toilets that were, due to the oppression of "mainstream" society, surreptitious meeting places for homosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Crimes ==

===Amos Hurst (Victim 1)===
The murders began in [[Brisbane]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=da_fY9EfydsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en_US&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20macdonald&amp;f=false The Serial Killer Files - Harold Schechter]&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald befriended a 55-year-old man named Amos Hurst outside the Roma Street Railway Station. After a long drinking session at one of the local pubs, they went back to Hurst's apartment where they consumed more alcohol. When Hurst became intoxicated MacDonald began to strangle him. Hurst was so intoxicated that he did not realise what was happening and eventually began to [[Bleeding|haemorrhage]]. Blood poured from his mouth and on to MacDonald's hands. MacDonald then punched Hurst in the face, killing him.

Five days later he found Hurst's name in a newspaper obituary column. It said Amos Hurst had died accidentally. MacDonald had been in terror of the police arresting him for murder, even though he was certain that no one had seen him leave Hurst's room.

===Alfred Reginald Greenfield (Victim 2)===
On 4 June 1961, police were summoned to the [[The Domain, Sydney|Sydney Domain]] [[Andrew "Boy" Charlton Pool|Baths]]. A man's nude corpse had been found, savagely stabbed over 30 times, and with the genitalia completely severed from his body. Alfred Greenfield became the second victim claimed by the killer soon to be dubbed "the Mutilator".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/macdonald/index_1.html William MacDonald, Sydney serial killer known as "the Mutilator" the Crime Library – The Crime library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Reginald Greenfield had been sitting on a park bench in Green Park, just across the road from [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St Vincent's Hospital]] in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]]. MacDonald offered Greenfield a drink and lured him to the nearby Domain Baths on the pretext of providing more alcohol. Once at the Domain the need to kill had become overwhelming. MacDonald waited until Greenfield fell asleep, then removed his knife from its sheath and stabbed Greenfield approximately thirty times. The ferocity of the first blow severed the [[Artery|arteries]] in Greenfield's neck. MacDonald then pulled down Greenfield's trousers and underwear, severed his genitals and threw them into Sydney Harbour.

===William Cobbin (Victim 3)===
Similarly to the second victim, William Cobbin was stabbed repeatedly and mutilated. His body was found in a [[public toilet]] at [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]].&lt;ref name=crimezzz&gt;[http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/M/MacDONALD_william.php McDonald William: Sydney Mutilator] at Serial Killer Crime Index (www.crimezzz.net)&lt;/ref&gt;

On this night MacDonald was walking down South Dowling Street where he met 55-year-old William Cobbin. MacDonald lured his victim to Moore Park and drank beer with him in a public toilet. Just before the attack, MacDonald put on his plastic raincoat. Cobbin was sitting on the toilet seat when MacDonald, using an [[uppercut]] motion, struck Cobbin in the neck with a knife, severing his [[jugular vein]]. Blood splattered all over MacDonald's arms, face and his plastic raincoat. Cobbin tried to defend himself by raising his arms. MacDonald continued to stab his victim multiple times, covering the toilet cubicle with blood. MacDonald then severed the victim's genitals, placed them into a plastic bag along with his knife, and departed the scene. On the way home MacDonald washed the blood off his hands and face.

===Frank Gladstone McLean (Victim 4)===
On 31 March 1962, in suburban [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales]], the mortally wounded Frank McLean was found by a man walking with his wife and child. He was the victim of an unfinished assault committed by MacDonald. The man found McLean still breathing, but bleeding heavily, and went to get police.

On this day MacDonald bought a knife from a sports store in Sydney. That night MacDonald left the Oxford Hotel in Darlinghurst and followed McLean down Bourke Street past the local police station. MacDonald initiated conversation with McLean and suggested they have a drinking session around the corner in Bourke Lane. As they entered Bourke Lane, MacDonald plunged his knife into McLean's throat. McLean tried to fight off the attack but he was too intoxicated to do so. He was then stabbed again in the face and punched—forcing him off balance. The assault was interrupted by a young family approaching. MacDonald hid himself on hearing the voices and the sound of a baby's cry. Once the man and his family had left to summon police, MacDonald returned to the barely-alive McLean, pulled him further into the lane and stabbed him again. A total of six stab wounds were inflicted.&lt;ref name=firstcom/&gt; He then pulled down McLean's trousers, sliced off his genitals and put them into a plastic bag which he took home and disposed of the next day.

The police at one stage thought that the killer could have been a deranged surgeon. The manner in which McLean's genitals were removed seemed to be done by someone with years of surgical experience. Doctors at one stage found themselves under investigation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Residence in Burwood Road, Concord ===
After being dismissed from his job at the local post office, where he had been hired as a letter sorter under the assumed name of Alan Edward Brennan, MacDonald went into business for himself. He purchased a mixed business store in [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]], again under the assumed name of Alan Edward Brennan. Here, he intended to sell sandwiches and smallgoods, living in rooms above the store. He actually lived there for only about a week after paying the purchase deposit.&lt;ref name=impulses/&gt;

===Patrick James Hackett (Victim 5)===
On the night of Saturday 6 June 1962, MacDonald went to a wine saloon in Pitt Street, Sydney, where he met 42-year-old James Hackett, a thief and derelict who had just recently been released from prison. They went back to MacDonald's new residence where they continued to drink alcohol. After a short period, Hackett fell asleep on the floor. MacDonald then got out a boning knife that he used in his delicatessen. He stabbed Hackett in the neck, the blow passing straight through. After the first blow, Hackett woke up and tried to shield himself, pushing the knife back into MacDonald's other hand and cutting it severely. MacDonald then unleashed a renewed attack, eventually striking the knife into Hackett's heart, killing him instantly. He continued to stab his victim until he had to stop for breath. Hackett's blood was splattered all over the walls and floor.

The knife having become blunted, MacDonald was unable to sever his victim's genitals and fell asleep. when he awoke the following morning he found himself lying next to the victim's body covered in sticky, drying blood. The pools of blood had soaked through the floorboards and almost on to the counter in his shop downstairs. He cleaned himself and went to a hospital to have the wound in his hand stitched.  He told the doctor that he had cut himself in his shop. After cleaning up the blood, MacDonald dragged Hackett's corpse underneath his shop. Believing the police would soon come looking for his victim, he fled to Brisbane.

Three weeks later, neighbours noticed a putrid smell coming from the shop and called the health department, which in turn called the police. On 20 November 1962&lt;ref name=firstcom/&gt; police discovered the rotting corpse, which was too badly decomposed to be identified. An autopsy determined that the body was of someone in their forties, which tallied with records of the missing shop owner, Alan Edward Brennan (MacDonald's alias). In late July, the police had still made no connection between the case and the three previous Mutilator killings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qH1WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vOUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6814,6187726&amp;dq Mutilator may be eyeing victim: 4th knife attack due soon] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 July 1962, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and had profiled the killer as operating in Sydney's inner eastern suburbs, which were many miles distant from Concord.

===The case of the walking corpse===
After investigations, the victim was incorrectly identified as Alan Edward Brennan and a notice published in a newspaper obituary column. This was read by his former workmates at the local post office, who attended a small memorial service conducted by a local funeral director. At this time, MacDonald was living in Brisbane and then moved to [[New Zealand]], believing that the police would still be looking for him. He felt the need to kill again, but for some reason he had to return to Sydney to do it. Returning to Sydney, he met former workmate John McCarthy, who said, "I believed you had died," at which MacDonald replied, "Leave me alone," and ran away,&lt;ref name=firstcom&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HkYVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5802,1861626&amp;dq For Trial on First of 4 Murder Counts] ''[[The Age]]'', 13 August 1963, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; travelling to [[Melbourne]] soon after.

McCarthy went straight to the police. At first they did not believe him. They accused him of having had too much to drink and he was told to go home and sleep it off. They even said that he was crazy. He went back again the next day and tried to explain what had happened, but they still didn't believe him. This persuaded McCarthy to go to the ''[[The Daily Mirror (Sydney)|Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper where he spoke to crime reporter Joe Morris. McCarthy explained how he bumped into the "supposed to be dead" MacDonald, a.k.a. Alan Brennan. The reporter saw the account as credible and filed a story under the headline "Case of the walking corpse". Publication forced the police to exhume the corpse. The fingerprints identified the body as belonging to James Hackett and not William MacDonald. Closer examination found that the body had several stab wounds and mutilation of the penis and testicles, potentially linking the crime to the notorious Mutilator.

==Capture, trial and sentencing==
The Sydney police obtained an identikit picture of MacDonald, which was circulated to every newspaper in the nation. MacDonald had taken a job on the Melbourne railways, being hired as "David Allan".&lt;ref name=crimezzz/&gt; Even though he tried to disguise himself by dyeing his hair and growing a moustache, he was instantly recognised by his workmates. Melbourne police arrested him as he collected his pay for that week.

Under questioning, MacDonald readily admitted to the killings, blaming them on an irresistible urge to kill. He claimed he was the victim of rape as a teenager, and was inflicting his revenge on [[Victimology#Victim of a crime|victim]]s chosen at random. A man with schizophrenia, MacDonald said that he heard voices in his head telling him that his victims were the corporal who raped him as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/william-the-mutilator-macdonald-nsws-oldest-prisoner-dead-at-90-20150513-ggzr52.html|title=William 'the Mutilator' Macdonald, NSW's oldest prisoner, dead at 90|date=13 May 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with four counts of murder and committed for trial on 15 August 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yH1VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5579,2195341&amp;dq Committed on four charges of murder] [[The Age]] p. 5, 15 August 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began in September 1963 and was one of the nation's most sensational. MacDonald pleaded not guilty on the grounds of insanity and testified in great detail to the gruesome murders. He told the court of how blood had sprayed over his raincoat as he castrated his victims, put their private parts into plastic bags and took them home. He even told the court what he did with the genitals once he got home. Some jurors fainted and had to be taken from the court. The jury chose to ignore overwhelming evidence for insanity in handing down a 'guilty' verdict, which amazed expert psychiatrists.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ATVVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E5UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4647,4123349&amp;d Appeal on Sydney Murder Verdict] ''[[The Age]]'', 26 September 1963, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Before passing sentence, Mr Justice McLennan said that this was the most barbaric case of murder and total disregard for human life that had come before him in his many years on the bench. MacDonald showed no signs of remorse and made it quite clear that, if he were free, he would go on killing. He was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences with the strong recommendation that he never be released.

== Imprisonment ==
MacDonald was imprisoned at [[Long Bay Correctional Centre#Current divisions|Long Bay Hospital]], a division of Long Bay Correctional Centre, but was soon certified as insane and transferred to a secure mental hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vwdFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6066,6481744&amp;dq Mutilator certified insane: Minister advised] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 26 January 1964, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the prison system, MacDonald was known simply as Bill; he had been in prison for so long that he became [[Institutionalisation|institutionalised]], the longest continuous serving inmate in the New South Wales prison system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Heinrichs | coauthors= | title=The oldest kid on the block | date=13 May 2007 | url =http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/the-oldest-kid-on-the-block/2007/05/12/1178899169277.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |pages= 2| accessdate =28 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in 2003 "I have no desire to go and live on the outside.
