But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the letters in which it is composed.  It is written in the language of mathematics and its characters are triangles and circles, and other geometric figures without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one wanders about in a dark labyrinth.|Galileo&lt;ref&gt;''The Assayer'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">'''African Socialist Movement''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement Socialiste Africain}}, also known as the MSA) was a [[political party]] in [[French West Africa]]. The MSA was formed following a meeting of the [[Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière]] (SFIO) federations of [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], [[French Sudan]] (now [[Mali]]), [[Gabon]], [[Guinea]], [[Niger]], [[Oubangui-Chari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]), and [[Senegal]]; the meeting was held in [[Conakry]] from 11th January to 13th January 1957. At that meeting it was decided that the African federations would break with its French parent organisation and form the MSA.&lt;ref name="zuc"&gt;Zuccarelli, François. ''La vie politique sénégalaise (1940-1988)''. Paris: CHEAM, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting of the leading committee of MSA met from the 9th to 10th February in [[Dakar]] the same year. Two SFIO delegates attended the session. MSA opted for a federalist solution for [[French West Africa]]. On 26th March 1958, the MSA signed a declaration in [[Paris]] merging itself into the [[African Regroupment Party]] (PRA).&lt;ref name="zuc"/&gt;

==Leadership==
At its founding, [[Lamine Guèye (politician)|Lamine Guèye]] became the president of MSA, [[Barry III]] the general secretary and [[Djibo Bakary]] the deputy general secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7gnvgKsw2LoC|title=Cold War and Decolonization in Guinea, 1946-1958|last=Schmidt|first=Elizabeth|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780821417638|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
The [[Senegal]]ese section of MSA was the [[Senegalese Party of Socialist Action]] (PSAS), and it was led by [[Lamine Guèye (politician)|Lamine Guèye]].&lt;ref name="zuc"/&gt; In Guinea, the [[Socialist Democracy of Guinea]] was the section of MSA.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Thomas, and Janice E.

'''Abū al-Fath Abd al-Rahman Mansūr al-Khāzini''' or simply '''al-Khāzini''' ({{native name|fa|أبوالفتح عبدالرحمن منصور الخازنی}}, flourished 1115–1130) was an [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomer]] of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin from [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|authorlink1=Will Durant|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|authorlink2=Ariel Durant|title=The Story of Civilization: The Age of Faith|year=2011|origyear=1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cusRoE1OJvEC&amp;pg=PP352|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=9781451647617|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[astronomical table]]s written under the patronage of [[Sultan Sanjar]] (''{{lang|ar|Zīj al-Sanjarī}}'', 1115) is considered to be one of the major works in [[mathematical astronomy]] of the medieval period.&lt;ref name = "Montelle"&gt;Montelle, C. (2011). The ‘Well-Known Calendars’: Al-Khāzinī’s Description of Significant Chronological Systems for Medieval Mathematical Astronomy in Arabic. In Steele J. (Ed.), Calendars and Years II: Astronomy and Time in the Ancient and Medieval World (pp. 107-126). Oxford; Oakville: Oxbow Books.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}} He provided the positions of fixed stars, and for oblique ascensions and time-equations for the latitude of [[Merv|Marv]] in which he was based.&lt;ref name = "Meyerhof"&gt;Meyerhof, M. (1948). 'Alī al-Bayhaqī's Tatimmat Siwān al-Hikma: A Biographical Work on Learned Men of the Islam. Osiris, 8, 122-217.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|197}} He also wrote extensively on various calendrical systems and on the various manipulations of the calendars.&lt;ref name="Montelle"/&gt; He was the author of an encyclopedia on [[Weighing scale|scales]] and [[Archimedes' principle|water-balances]].&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"&gt;{{citation|title=Al-Khāzinī, Abu’l-Fath ‘Abd Al-Raḥmān [Sometimes Abū Manṣūr ’ Abd Al-Raḥmān or ’Abd Al-Rahmān Manṣūr].|date=2008|publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography.|pages=335–351.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Al-Khazini was an emancipated slave in Marv,&lt;ref name="Meyerhof"/&gt;{{rp|197}}&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld&gt;{{citation|last=Rosenfeld|first=B.|title=Book reviews: Middle ages &amp; renaissance.|date=1994|publisher= Journal of the History of Science in Society|pages= 85(4), 686.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then one of the most important cities of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. He got his name from his master ({{lang|ar|Abu‘l Husayn ‘Alī ibn Muhammad al-Khāzin al-Marwazī}}) who was the treasurer of Marv.&lt;ref name="Montelle"/&gt;{{rp|107}} The term ''khāzin'' was simply the title of the royal treasurer since the early Islamic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Floor|first1=Willem|title=kazinadar|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kazinadar|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His master made provisions so that al-Khazini could obtain a first-class education.&lt;ref name="Montelle"/&gt; Some believe that al-Khazini was a pupil of [[Omar Khayyam]].&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"/&gt; While this is not known, he wrote about Khayyam, in particular, he gave a description of the water-balance invented by him (and improved upon by [[Al-Isfizari]]).&lt;ref name="Meyerhof"/&gt;{{rp|176}} And according to some sources, he collaborated with him on the [[Jalali calendar|reformation of the Persian calendar]] in 1079.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom"&gt;Mehdi Aminrazavi, ''The Wine of Wisdom: The Life, Poetry and Philosophy of Omar Khayyam'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|199}}

Al-Khazini was known for being a humble man. He refused thousands of [[Dinar]] for his works, saying he did not need much to live on because it was only his cat and himself in his household.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; Al-Khazini was one of only about twenty astronomers of the Islamic era who performed original observations.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; His works reached Byzantium in the 14th century, in particular, they were studied by George Chrysococces and later by [[Theodore Meliteniotes]].&lt;ref name="Montelle"/&gt;{{rp|107}}

==Achievements==
Al Khazini seems to have been a high government official under Sanjar ibn Malikshah and the sultan of the [[Seljuk Empire]]. He did most of his work in Merv, where they are known for their libraries.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; His best-known works are "The Book of the Balance of Wisdom", "Treatise on Astronomical Wisdom", and "The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar".&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt;

"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom" is an encyclopedia of medieval mechanics and hydrostatics composed of eight books with fifty chapters.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; It is a study of the hydrostatic balance and the ideas behind statics and hydrostatics, it also covers other unrelated topics.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; There are four different manuscripts of "The Book of the Balance of Wisdom" that have survived.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; The balance al-Khazini built for Sanjar's treasury was modeled after the balance al-Asfizari, who was a generation older than al-Khazini, built.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; Sanjar's treasurer out of fear destroyed al-Asfizari's balance; he was filled with grief when he heard the news.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; Al-Khazini called his balance "combined balance" to show honor towards Al-Asfizari.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; The meaning of the balance was a "balance of true judgment".&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; The job of this balance was to help the treasury see what metals were precious and which gems were real or fake.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; In "The Book of the Balance of Wisdom" al-Khazini states many different examples from the Koran ways that his balance fits into religion.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; When al-Khazini explains the advantages of his balance he says that it "performs the functions of skilled craftsmen", its benefits are theoretical and practical precision.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt;

The "Treatise on Astronomical Wisdom" is a relatively short work.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; It has seven parts and each part is assigned to a different scientific instrument.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; The seven instruments include: a triquetrum, a dioptra, a "triangular instrument," a quadrant, devices involving reflection, an astrolabe, and simple tips for viewing things with the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; The treatise describes each instrument and their uses.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt;

"The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar" is said to have been composed for Sultan Sanjar, the ruler of Merv and his balance was made for Sanjar's treasury.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; The tables in "The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar" are tables of holidays, fasts, etc.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt; The tables are said to have the latitudes and longitudes of forty-three different stars, along with their magnitudes and (astrological) temperaments.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt;  It is said that al-Khazini's observations for this work were probably done in Merv in various observatories with high quality instruments.&lt;ref name="Al-Khāzinī"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="564">'''Antepredicaments''', in [[logic]], are certain previous matters requisite to a more easy and clear apprehension of the doctrine of ''predicaments'' or [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]]. Such are definitions of common terms, as [[equivocal]]s, [[univocal]]s, etc., with divisions of things, their differences, etc. They are thus called because [[Aristotle]] treated them before the ''predicaments'', hoping that the thread of discourse might not afterwards be interrupted.

==Biography==
Bahm served as Acting Chair of the University of New Mexico's [http://www.unm.edu/~thinker/ Department of Philosophy] from 1954 to 1955 and again from 1964 to 1965. He was a member of numerous committees to support and promote the exchange of philosophical ideas and organized the [http://elibrary.unm.edu/oanm/NmU/nmu1%23mss344bc/nmu1%23mss344bc_m4.html Albuquerque Chapter of the Southwestern Regional American Humanist Association]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in 1954. He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an organizer, past president, and past secretary-treasurer of the New Mexico Philosophical Society.

Bahm in 1933 contributed “A Religious Affirmation” to ''The New Humanist'', listing items that “a person should”:

#Be creedless; that is, be intelligent enough to make adaptations without dependence upon some formula. 
#Be self-reliant; that is, be not dependent upon supernatural agency for intellectual support or moral guidance.
#Be critical; that is, question assumptions and seek certitude scientifically. 
#Be tolerant; that is, be open-minded and hold conclusions tentatively. 
#Be active; that is, live today and grow by exercising his capacities. 
#Be efficient; that is, accomplish the most with the least effort. 
#Be versatile; that is, vary his interests to attain a variety of interesting thoughts. 
#Be cooperative; that is, find some of his satisfactions in social activities. 
#Be appreciative; that is, make the present enjoyable by his attitude. 
#Be idealistic; that is, create and live by ideals which he finds inspiring.

The '''Black Power Revolution''', also known as the "Black Power Movement", '''1970 Revolution''', '''Black Power Uprising''' and ''' February Revolution''', was an attempt by a number of social elements, people and interest groups in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] to effect socio-political change.

==History==

Between 1968 and 1970, a movement gained strength in Trinidad and Tobago that was greatly influenced by the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States. The [[National Joint Action Committee]] (NJAC) was formed out of the Guild of Undergraduates at the [[Saint Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago|St. Augustine]] campus of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI).  Under the leadership of [[Geddes Granger]] (now Makandal Daaga), NJAC and the Black Power movement appeared as a serious challenge to the authority of [[Prime Minister]] [[Eric Williams]].

This was coupled with a growing militancy by the [[trade union]] movement, led by George Weekes of the [[Oilfields Workers' Trade Union]], Clive Nunez of the [[Transport and Industrial Workers Union]] and [[Basdeo Panday]], then a young trade union [[lawyer]] and activist. The Black Power Revolution began with a 1970 [[Carnival]] band named Pinetoppers whose presentation entitled "The Truth about Africa" included portrayals of "revolutionary heroes" including [[Fidel Castro]], [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[Tubal Uriah Butler]].

This was followed by a series of marches and protests. Williams countered with a broadcast entitled ''I am for Black Power''. He introduced a 5% levy to fund unemployment reduction and later established the first locally owned commercial bank. However, this intervention had little impact on the protests

== Leadership ==
{{Social unrest in Trinidad and Tobago}}
It was mainly led by NJAC's duo of Makandal Daaga and Khafra Khambon in tandem with other various interests within the trade unions, and other social groups like Afro-Trinidadians and were noted to attract many disaffected members of the then ruling [[People's National Movement]] (PNM) under Eric Williams.
A large turnout of the disaffected poor of the cities and towns, as well as those black youth of the disaffected communities were attracted to the uprising and were present in the movement, as well as youths and others from the St. Augustine campus of UWI.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Escalation==

On 6 April 1970 a protester, Basil Davis, was killed by the police. This was followed on 13 April by the resignation of [[A. N. R. Robinson]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Tobago]] East. The death of this protester led to the Movement to pick up momentum. On 18 April sugar workers went on strike, and there was talk of a general strike.  In response to this, Williams proclaimed a [[State of Emergency]] on 21 April and arrested 15 Black Power leaders. Responding in turn, a portion of the Trinidad Defense Force, led by [[Raffique Shah]] and [[Rex Lassalle]], [[mutiny|mutinied]] and took hostages at the army barracks at Teteron.  Through the action of the [[Coast Guard]], including Officer Hugh Griffith and negotiations between the Government and the rebels, the mutiny was contained and the mutineers surrendered on 25 April.

Williams made three additional speeches in which he sought to identify himself with the aims of the Black Power movement. He re-shuffled his Cabinet and removed three Ministers (including two white members) and three senators. He also introduced the ''Public Order Act'', which reduced civil liberties in an effort to control protest marches. After public opposition, led by A. N. R. Robinson and his newly created "Action Committee of Democratic Citizens" (which later became the [[Democratic Action Congress]]), the bill was withdrawn.  [[Attorney General]] [[Karl Hudson-Phillips]] offered to resign over the failure of the bill, but Williams refused his resignation.

'''Black Power in the Caribbean''' refers to political and social movements in the [[Caribbean]] region from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s that focused on overturning the existing racist power structure. Guyanese academic [[Walter Rodney]] famously defined the movement as follows: “Black Power in the West Indies means three closely related things”: 
# the break with imperialism which is historically white racist
# the assumption of power by the black masses in the islands
# the cultural reconstruction of the society in the image of the blacks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://florida.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5744/florida/9780813049090.001.0001/upso-9780813049090|title=Black Power in the Caribbean|last=Quinn|first=Kate|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=University of Florida Press|pages=2|language=en|doi=10.5744/florida/9780813049090.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Power movement in [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad &amp; Tobago]] emerged in the late-1960s and came to a head with the Black Power Revolution in February 1970. It had as a precursor the labour uprisings of the 1930s. Key figures in the Black Power movement include [[Makandal Daaga]], Clive Nunez and Basdeo Panday. The movement was responsible for bringing about significant social changes within Trinidad &amp; Tobago, in particular the upward mobility of blacks in corporate Trinidad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Power_movement|title=Black Power Movement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2017}}

== Black Power in Haiti ==
The Haitian revolution is one of the most exemplifying parts in history pertaining to black power in the Caribbean. This revolution led haiti to become the first black republic of the new world. Haitians developed a fierce vibrant and resistant culture in which they defended themselves from the British, Spanish, and French.

Bois Caïman is where a [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] ceremony took place in which the first major slave revolt of the [[Haitian Revolution]] was planned. On August 14, 1791, slaves from nearby plantations gathered to participate in a secret ceremony conducted in the woods in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]. A prominent slave leader and Vodou priest, [[Dutty Boukman]], gave the signal to begin the revolt. The ceremony began the era of black power in Haiti. The effect a couple months after the revolt was that slave rebels controlled a third of the island by 1792.

'''Bradley's Regress''' is a philosophical problem concerning the nature of [[Relation (philosophy)|relations]].  It is named after [[F. H. Bradley]] who discussed the problem in his 1893 book ''Appearance and Reality''.  It bears a close kinship to the issue of the [[unity of the proposition]].

== Description==

Bradley raises the problem while discussing the [[bundle theory]] of objects, according to which an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is merely a "bundle" of [[property|properties]].  This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object.  More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an [[infinite regress]].  

Suppose, for example, that ''a'' respects ''b''.  This [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] seems to involve three things: ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting.  For the state of affairs of ''a'' respecting ''b'' to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting) exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might say, is that ''a'' and ''b'' "stand in" the relation of respecting.  But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of ''a'' and ''b'' standing in the relation of respecting.  This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: ''a'', ''b'', the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in.  Again, however, for it to be the case that ''a'' and ''b'' stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist.  They must also be related in some way.  What is required, we might now say, is that ''a'', ''b'', and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, [[ad infinitum]].

== Responses ==

In ''Appearance and Reality'', Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are "independently real".  One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b.  It does not, in addition, involve a third item, "the relation of respecting", to which a and b must then bear some further relation ("standing in").

A different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a [[infinite regress|vicious regress]].

It was made up of both clerical and lay persons, and its members were [[Maltese people|Maltese]] as well as foreign. Its area of specialisation in philosophy was chiefly [[ethics]]. It also gave considerable importance to [[biblical studies]].&lt;ref name=Montebello89&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001|volume=1|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life of the Society==
The society was basically a joint venture between two priests, one [[French people|French]], Francis (or François) Gesualdo, and the other [[Maltese people|Maltese]], Andrew Axac (or Axiak).&lt;ref name=Vella150151&gt;{{Harvnb|Vella|1993|pp= 150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Founders===
Both priests had separate schools of their own. Gesualdo already had an up and running school at [[Birgu]], in 1526 when Axac transferred his own school there from [[Mdina]]. Though other private schools were also present, theirs became quickly known for their somewhat unorthodox teachings. Gesualdo’s and Axac’s friendship might have begun during this time.

Axac did not stay long at [[Birgu]], just a year or less. In 1527 he returned to [[Mdina]] where he continued teaching there for some twenty-five years (up till around 1533). It seems that his school, was quite popular. Gesualdo also moved his school to [[Mdina]] very shortly after Axac’s relocation.

===Proceedings===
Around 1530, Gesualdo and Axac together began the ''Society of True Christians'' at [[Mdina]]. That was the year in which the [[Knights Hospitallers]] were entrusted with the [[Maltese islands]]. The society functioned uninterruptedly for some fifteen years under the guidance of the two priests.

The society was made up of many of the students or former students, and friends, of both Gesualdo and Axac. They met regularly to read and share the writings of [[Martin Luther]], and also of some others, such as [[Melanchthon]] and [[Erasmus]]. These authors and all their writings were condemned by the [[Holy See]], and as such were fanatically sought out by the [[Inquisition]].

===Beliefs===
Inspired by the [[Reformation]] writers, the members of the society harboured an alternative view to the current model of the [[Catholic Church]], to which they all belonged. Amongst other matters, they seem to have denied the divine foundation of the [[sacraments]] and their supernatural  efficacy, the law of [[celibacy]], the veneration of [[saints]] and of sacred images, [[indulgences]], the existence of [[purgatory]], and the [[primacy of the Roman pontiff]] (the [[pope]]).

Most members of the society were in possession of a copy of the [[New Testament]] in [[vernacular]], which some had brought over from [[Sicily]]. Though it is not known which was the precise version they possessed, various editions could be found, notably those of [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther]], [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], the [[Tyndale Bible|William Tyndale]], and the [[Zürich Bible|Froschau Bible]]. This helped them to adhere to, and deepen, their own version of the ''philosophia Christi'' (the philosophy of Christ), about which they read in [[Erasmus]]’ writings.

The society thus believed in a [[religion]] which was not [[doctrinal]], and had no [[theology]], but was solely inspired from the [[spirituality]] and [[morality]] of the [[New Testament]].

===Termination===
In 1545, the [[Inquisition]] caught up with Gesualdo and Axac, and accused them and their associates of [[heresy]]. They were all held prisoners at the palace of the [[Inquisition]] at [[Birgu]] while their lengthy proceedings were ongoing. They were probably also [[tortured]].

Eventually, the larger part of the society members were let off with an admonition. However, Gesualdo and another member, Petit, who were considered to be the most pernicious (''perniciosissimus hæreticus''). They both refused to reject their beliefs, and were thus condemned to be [[burned at the stake]] (''uti pertinax et impœnitens ad ignem vivus damnatus''). Their condemnation was publicly read at the church of St. Lawrence at [[Birgu]] on November 5, 1545. The execution was implemented immediately afterwards on that same day at the main square of [[Birgu]]. These were the first and, fortunately, the last execution of the sort ever performed in [[Malta]].

After Gesualdo’s and Petit’s killing, the society was disbanded forever.

==Known members==
The following are certainly not the only member of the society. They are the ones whose names have been recorded in the records of the [[Inquisition]] since they were considered the most ‘dangerous’ of all. The students, for instance, of both Gesualdo and Axac were never formally accused of heresy, and thus their names, unfortunately, have been lost.

* '''Francis Gesualdo''' (died 1545)&lt;ref name=Montebello203&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001|volume=1|pp=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; – A [[French people|French]] [[priest]] considered by the [[Inquisition]] as the leader of the society.  He ran a private school, mostly at [[Mdina]], for over twenty years, mainly teaching ''humane lettere'' (human arts). He founded the Society of True Christians around 1530 together with Andrew Axac. In 1545, accused before the [[Inquisition]], he was found guilty of [[heresy]], deemed impenitent, and [[burned at the stake]].
* '''Andrew Axac'''&lt;ref name=Montebello39&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001|volume=1|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; – A [[Maltese people|Maltese]] [[priest]] from [[Rabat, Malta]]. Unfortunately, his dates of birth and death are not known yet. It seems probable that he studied abroad, perhaps [[Sicily]] or [[Naples]], since he was well acquainted with the philosophy of the [[humanists]]. He had a private school, majorly at [[Mdina]], before 1525 where he taught ''humane lettere'' (human arts). He founded the Society of True Christians around 1530 together with Francis Gesualdo. After 1545, when Gesualdo was [[burned at the stake]] for [[heresy]], and Axac left off with just an admonition, Axac continued with his former beliefs. In fact, in defiance to the law of celibacy, around 1550, he lived with a [[concubine]]. Before that, however, in 1553, he was entrusted with the school of the [[bishop]]’s [[cathedral]] at [[Mdina]]. In 1560, however, the [[Inquisition]] sent him to [[Rome]], [[Italy]], to face charges of [[heresy]]. He was interrogated at length and perhaps also [[tortured]]. He signed an [[abjuration]] on March 10, 1561, and awarded ‘spiritual’ punishments. His whereabouts after this are not known. He probably died abroad.
* '''Petit''' (died 1545)&lt;ref name=Montebello2-90&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001a|volume=2|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Little is known of the man, though he was probably not of [[Maltese people|Maltese]] origin. At some time, he seems to have joined the Society of True Christians, for when in 1545, formal accusations were brought before the [[Inquisition]] against its members, Petit was considered to be one of the most staunch. He was thus found guilty and, together with Francis Gesualdo, was condemned on November 5, 1545, and [[burned at the stake]] in [[Birgu]]’s main square.
* '''Matthew Falzun Sr.''' (d. ''c.'' 1574)&lt;ref name=Montebello158&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001|volume=1|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – He was a member of the popular council of [[Mdina]] intermittently between 1534 and 1570. In 1545 he was accused before the [[Inquisition]] together with its other members of the Society of True Christians, and at first was released. Then, however, he was accused once more and sentenced to keep [[Malta]] as his [[prison]]. He was very much esteemed by his contemporaries. Years later, in 1574, he was again arrested by the [[Inquisition]], probably as part of some corrupt practices on the part of the [[inquisitor]], for there were on charges of [[heresy]] against him. Eventually, he was spirited away to [[Sicily]], killed, and had his body burnt. All his considerable property in [[Malta]] was appropriated by the [[Inquisition]], and this might have been the motive of his arrest and assassination. Since it was spread about that Falzun had, by some pact with the [[devil]], mysteriously vanished from the [[Inquisition]]’s dungeons in [[Malta]], it was rumoured that he was a witch (''sahhar''). Nevertheless, his [[effigy]] was put on public trial, sentenced to death, and [[burned at the stake]] in [[Birgu]]’s main square.
* '''Matthew Falzun Jr.'''&lt;ref name=Montebello159&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001|volume=1|pp=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Son of Matthew Falzun Sr., whose fate he would have shared to the end if he had not escaped to [[Sicily]] immediately upon the arrest of his father by the [[Inquisition]] in 1574. Since the main intent of this arrest was the appropriation of his father’s property, as his principal inheritor he was likewise in mortal danger. In his absence, the [[Inquisition]] in [[Malta]] accused him of [[heresy]] just the same, brought his [[effigy]] to an open trial, passed sentence, and burned his [[effigy]] in [[Birgu]]’s main square. Falzun Jr. was never apprehended, and his whereabouts after his escape to [[Sicily]] remain known.
* '''Lawrence Falzun'''&lt;ref name=Montebello160&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001|volume=1|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; – The nephew of Matthew Falzun Sr., and the cousin of Matthew Falzun Jr. He would have shared the same fate of his uncle if he had not escaped to [[France]] immediately upon the arrest of his uncle and cousin by the [[Inquisition]] in 1574. Since the main intent of this arrest was the appropriation of his father’s property, as the next inheritor after his cousin he was likewise in mortal danger. In his absence, the [[Inquisition]] in [[Malta]] accused him of [[heresy]] just the same, brought his [[effigy]] to an open trial, passed sentence, and burned his [[effigy]] in [[Birgu]]’s main square. Falzun was never apprehended, and his whereabouts after his escape to [[France]] remain known.
* '''Peter Stunica'''&lt;ref name=Montebello2-195158&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001a|volume=2|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;– Little is known about his personal life. In 1545, he was brought before the [[Inquisition]] as a member of the Society of True Christians, and accused of [[heresy]]. He was sentenced to a fine and some temporary ‘spiritual’ punishments. Nothing else is known of his whereabouts after that.
* '''Brandan Caxaro''' (''c.'' 1508-1565)&lt;ref name=Montebello72&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001|volume=1|pp=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; – A [[Maltese people|Maltese]] priest from [[Mdina]], today he is better known as the transcriber of [[Peter Caxaro]]’s famous ''[[Il-Kantilena]]''. He studied abroad, probably at [[Naples]] or [[Palermo]]. In 1531 he was already ordained a [[priest]]. He worked as a [[notary]], and it is in one of his tomes that he transcribed his relative’s ''Il-Kantilena'' around 1535. In 1545, he was brought before the [[Inquisition]] as a member of the Society of True Christians accused of [[heresy]]. However, he pleaded guilty, declared himself penitent, demanded forgiveness, and was forgiven. Nevertheless, privately Caxaro did not give up his former beliefs. In fact, around 1550 he took a wife, Katarina Azopardo, without applying for [[dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] from the [[pope]]. She bore him five children. In 1563, he was brought before the [[Inquisition]] again, and sentenced to be indefinitely imprisoned at the dungeons of the place of the [[Inquisition]] at [[Birgu]] together with a host of other punishments, both spiritual and temporal. Caxaro submitted, and just a year later, in 1564, was allowed to work as a notary once more. Gradually, he was pardoned of the other punishments. Nevertheless, Caxaro was not to enjoy his new-found honour, for he died just two weeks after the end of the [[Great Siege of Malta]] of 1565, on September 22.
* '''Peter Cumbo'''&lt;ref name=Montebello101&gt;{{Harvnb|Montebello|2001|volume=1|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Nothing is known about his personal life except that in 1545 he was brought before the [[Inquisition]] as a member of the Society of True Christians, and accused of [[heresy]]. He was sentenced to a fine and some temporary ‘spiritual’ punishments. Nothing else is known of his whereabouts after that.

==Works==
Up till now no work is known to have survived by the society or by any of its members. Since the members were all submitted to the scrutiny of the [[Inquisition]], the likelihood of any of their writings surviving is next to nil. However, neither is it impossible.

==Appreciation==
The Society of True Christians must be appreciated against the social, political, religious and historical background of its time. Considering all of this, what Gesualdo and Axac did was certainly outstanding and amazing. The whole group was truly exceptional. It was not only up to date in terms of knowledge (considering the limitations of the time) but also philosophically engaging and interesting. Its members must be also considered to be very courageous people.

The period of their operation was indeed bleak. Nevertheless, these people dared to entertain a new philosophy and dream a new world-view. Their ruthless destruction only goes on to prove how extraordinary their endeavour was.

The main source of information about the society is practically only that of the annals of the [[Inquisition]]. This not only means that the records are extremely difficult to research (if not by a thorough expert in the field) but also taken with a pinch of salt, since the objective of the archives is not to show its victims favourably or in their true light but, on the contrary, to heap upon them shame and dishonour.

Though the members of the society had the [[New Testament]] as their basic text, this is certainly not the only reading they did. They were thoroughly familiar with the Greek and Latin classics, with major Christian philosophers, and with the new readings of people like [[Melanchthon]] and [[Erasmus]], amongst others. Their ultimate objective was, it seems, to develop a kind of ethical philosophy which was innovative and refreshing, leaving behind them the thought categories of old and discovering a philosophy which was at once more authentic and sensible.

'''Cristina Lafont''' is a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.northwestern.edu/people/continuing-faculty/lafont-cristina.html Cristina Lafont's personal page at Northwestern University's Department of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Her current research focuses on [[normative]] questions in [[political philosophy]] concerning [[democracy]] and citizen participation, [[global governance]], [[human rights]], [[religion]] and politics. She works in a framework of deliberative democratic theory, where she defends a participatory construal of the democratic ideal against proposals to insulate political decision making from the influence of the citizenry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/jopp.12031 | volume=23 | title=Deliberation, Participation, and Democratic Legitimacy: Should Deliberative Mini-publics Shape Public Policy? | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Political Philosophy | pages=40–63 | last1 = Lafont | first1 = Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conception requires the citizens to respect the priority of public reason over religious or otherwise comprehensive views in their political deliberations in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psc.sagepub.com/content/35/1-2/127.abstract C. Lafont, "Religion and the Public Sphere"]&lt;/ref&gt; At the level of global governance, she argues against the current state-centric understanding of human rights obligations because of the protection gaps it leaves open. Instead, she advocates a more ambitious construal of the [[responsibility to protect]] (R2P) human rights, which she interprets as a provisional duty of the international community as a whole until appropriate institutions are in place to close these gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/jopp.12086 | volume=24 | issue=4 | title=Sovereignty and the International Protection of Human Rights | year=2015 | journal=Journal of Political Philosophy | pages=427–445 | last1 = Lafont | first1 = Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/global-governance-and-human-rights/oclc/849899861&amp;referer=brief_results C. Lafont, Global Governance and Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lafont is also widely known for her work in [[Critical Theory]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Critical Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; especially for her critical elaboration of themes in the philosophy of [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Jürgen Habermas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/habermas-handbuch/oclc/936340089&amp;referer=brief_results Habermas Handbuch (2013), co-ed. with Hauke Brunkhorst and Regina Kreide]&lt;/ref&gt; Cristina Lafont’s earlier philosophical work in the [[philosophy of language]] of [[Heidegger]]’s [[hermeneutics]] issues in her identification of a specific form of “linguistic turn” (centered on the “world-disclosing” function of conceptual structures in language) in post-Kantian [[German philosophy]] between [[Hamann]] and Habermas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/sinq20/45/2 Author meets Critics issue of Inquiry on 'Heidegger, Language and World Disclosure', with Precis and Replies by Cristina Lafont]&lt;/ref&gt; The upshot is that the systematic idealistic and constructivist tendency of this tradition is owed to a specific set of assumptions in its linguistic philosophy. In this work, she applies select tools from the theory of meaning developed in analytic philosophy of language&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/  Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Analytic Philosophy of Language]&lt;/ref&gt;  to foundational issues from German Continental philosophy. This approach enables fruitful and precise comparisons between, e.g., [[Robert Brandom]]’s inferentialist framework and hermeneutics or Habermas’ theory of communicative action. One central tenet of Lafont’s philosophical work that runs throughout these otherwise very different works is her interest in the necessary conditions for normative rational criticism and reasoned change on this basis. This motivates her insistence on the need for realist correctives of the idealism characteristic of German philosophy of language as much as it is behind her critical examination of principles of public reason in deliberative democracy and as it drives her research in human rights (as not merely constructed by but a source of the moral quality of legal and political systems).

==Education, major professorships and Honors==
Lafont graduated ‘cum laude’ with a [[Licenciatura]] in philosophy from the Universidad de Valencia in 1987. From there, she moved to [[Goethe University of Frankfurt|Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt (Main)]], where she obtained her PhD in philosophy (Dr. phil.) ‘summa cum laude’ in 1992 under the supervision of Jürgen Habermas. At the same university, she was awarded the [[Habilitation]] in the year 2000.
Cristina Lafont has held numerous positions as a distinguished lecturer or visiting professor in the English-speaking, Spanish-speaking and German-speaking academic world. Thus, she was Visiting professor at the [[Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México|Universidad Autónoma de Mexico]] (Mexico), [[Charles III University of Madrid|Universidad Carlos III Madrid]] (Spain), [[Universidad de Oviedo]] (Spain), Lehrbeauftragte at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt. In 2008, she held a Secularity and Value Lecture at the [[London School of Economics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/events/EventsArchive/Forum%20for%20European%20Philosophy%20Seminars/forum_for_european_philosophy_2007-8.aspx#DynamicJumpMenuManager_1_Anchor_4 LSE Secularity and Value Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 the García Máynez Lectures at the Universidad Autónoma de Mexico (Ciudad de Mexico, D.F.), in 2011 she held the Spinoza chair at the [[University of Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html Amsterdam University, list of Spinoza chairs]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012-13, she was a Fellow at the [[Berlin Institute for Advanced Study]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiko-berlin.de/en/fellows/fellowfinder/detail/2012-lafont-cristina/  Fellow-profile for Cristina Lafont at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danish philosophy''' has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]].

Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[Søren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]], which inspired the philosophical movement of [[Existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald Hoffding|Harald Høffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]].  Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]].

'''Eduard Pernkopf''' (November 24, 1888 – April 17, 1955) was an Austrian professor of [[anatomy]] who later served as rector of the [[University of Vienna]], his ''alma mater''. He is best known for his seven-volume anatomical atlas, ''Topographische Anatomie des Menschen'' (translated as ''Atlas of Topographical and Applied Human Anatomy''; often colloquially known as the '''Pernkopf atlas''' or just Pernkopf), prepared by Pernkopf and four artists over a 20-year period.&lt;ref name=ditt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.case.edu/artsci/dittrick/site2/museum/online/Nazi/Pernkopf.html |title=The Pernkopf anatomical atlas controversy: issues of Nazi medicine and medical ethics. |author=[[Dittrick Museum of Medical History|Dittrick Medical History Center]] |year=2010 |work= |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate=27 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is considered a scientific and artistic masterpiece,&lt;ref name="Williams biography"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=David J.|title=The History of Eduard Pernkopf's ''Topographische Anatomie des Menschen''|journal=Journal of Biocommunication|date=Spring 1988|volume=15|issue=2|pages=2–12|url=http://www.vet.purdue.edu/brad/medill/pernkopf.html|accessdate=11 November 2013|pmid=3047110|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111084646/http://www.vet.purdue.edu/brad/medill/pernkopf.html#|archive-date=2013-11-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many of its color plates reprinted in other publications and textbooks, it has been in recent years found that Pernkopf and the artists working for him, all of them ardent [[Nazi]]s, used concentration camp inmates or condemned [[political prisoner]]s as their subjects.

==Early life==
Pernkopf was born in 1888 in the [[Lower Austria]] village of [[Rappottenstein]], near the border with [[Bavaria]]. The youngest of three sons, he seemed to be considering a career in music upon his completion of the ''[[Gymnasium (school)#Austria|Gymnasium]]'' in [[Horn, Austria|Horn]]. However, the death of his father, the village's doctor, in 1903 led him to pursue medicine instead, as his father's death caused the family considerable hardship that a career as a physician was more likely to reverse.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

He began his studies at the [[University of Vienna]]'s [[Medical University of Vienna|medical school]] in 1907. During his time there he became a member of the Student Academic Fraternity of Germany, a student group with a strong [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] persuasion. As a student he had worked under Ferdinand Hochstetter, director of the university's anatomy institute. Hochstetter became his mentor and one of his strongest influences.&lt;ref name="Hubbard article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=Chris|title=Eduard Pernkopf's ''atlas of topographical and applied human anatomy'': The continuing ethical controversy|journal=The [[Anatomical Record]]|date=October 2001|volume=265|issue=5|pages=207–211|doi=10.1002/ar.1157|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.1157/full|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912 he received his medical degree.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

For the next eight years he taught anatomy at various institutions in Austria. He served in the military as a physician for a year during [[World War I]]. In 1920 he returned to Vienna to work as one of Hochstetter's assistants, lecturing to first- and second-year students about the [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous]] and [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] systems.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

==Career and political activity==

}}
Back in Vienna he rose quickly in the academic ranks. In 1926 he earned the title of [[associate professor]], with a promotion to full professor two years later. Five years after that, in 1933, he formally succeeded Hochstetter as the anatomical institute's director. At the ceremony installing him in that position, he acknowledged Hochstetter's tutelage by dropping to his knees in front of the older man and kissing him on the hand.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

Also in 1933, he joined the [[Nazi Party#Membership outside of Germany|Nazi Party]]'s foreign organization. The following year he became a member of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'', better known as the SA, Storm Troopers or "brownshirts". In 1938 he was promoted again, becoming [[dean (education)|dean]] of the medical school. This occurred at about the same time as the ''[[Anschluss]]'', Germany's annexation of Austria into the [[Third Reich]].

In his new position, in a supportive political environment, Pernkopf put his Nazi beliefs into action. He required medical faculty to declare their ethnic lineage as either [[Nazism and race|"Aryan" or "non-Aryan"]] and swear loyalty to Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]]. He forwarded a list of those who refused the latter to the university administration, who dismissed them from their jobs. This amounted to 77% of the faculty, including three [[List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel laureates]].&lt;ref name="Pieters article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carstens|first=Pieter|title=Revisiting the Infamous Pernkopf Anatomy Atlas: Historical Lessons for Medical Law and Ethics|journal=Fundamina|year=2012|volume=18|issue=2|page=28|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/21112/Carstens_Revisiting%282012%29.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=11 November 2013|publisher=[[University of South Africa]]|location=[[Pretoria, South Africa]]|issn=1021-545X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the Jewish faculty were removed this way,&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt; making Pernkopf the first Austrian medical school dean to do so.&lt;ref name="Slate article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|authorlink=Emily Bazelon|title=The Nazi Anatomists|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2013/11/nazi_anatomy_history_the_origins_of_conservatives_anti_abortion_claims_that.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=6 November 2013|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days after becoming dean, he gave a speech to the medical faculty advocating Nazi [[racial hygiene]] theories and policies and urging his fellow physicians to implement them in their teaching and practice. They should "[promote] those whose heredity is more valuable and whose biological constitution due to heredity gives the promise of healthy offspring [and prevent] offspring to those who are racially inferior and of those who do not belong." More specifically, he said, the latter could be accomplished by "the exclusion of those who are racially inferior from the propagation of their offspring by means of sterilization and other means," language that has been seen as anticipating both the [[Action T4|Nazi euthanasia programs]] and the [[Holocaust]], the systematic extermination of European Jews and [[Romani people|Romani]]. As he had begun his speech with "Heil Hitler!" and a [[Nazi salute]], praising Hitler as "a son of Austria who had to leave Austria in order to bring it back into the family of German-speaking nations", he returned to that theme in his conclusion:
{{quote|To him who is the proclaimer of National Socialist thought and the new way of looking at the world and in whom the legend of history has blossomed and has awakened and who has the heroic spirit within him, the greatest son of our homeland, we wish to give our gratitude and also to say that we doctors with our whole life and our whole soul gladly wish to serve him. So may our call express only what each of us feels from the bottom of his heart; Adolf Hitler, Sieg Heil!, Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt;}}

==Atlas==

At the time he was first hired as Hochstetter's assistant, he began putting together an informal dissection manual for students. He kept expanding it, and it became popular with the rest of the university instructors and the Austrian medical community. As he attained his full professorship he was offered a contract to expand it into a publishable book, and he eagerly accepted.&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt; He was to deliver three volumes.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

Pernkopf began his atlas in 1933. He worked 18-hour days dissecting corpses, teaching classes and discharging his administrative responsibilities while a team of artists created the images that would eventually be in the atlas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pringle |first1=Heather |year=2010 |title=The Dilemma of Pernkopf's Atlas |journal=Science |publisher= |volume=329 |issue=5989 |pages=274–275 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/329/5989/274-b |doi=10.1126/science.329.5989.274-b |pmid=20647444|bibcode=2010Sci...329R.274P }}&lt;/ref&gt; His days began at 5 a.m., when he left notes in [[shorthand]] for his wife to type. These became the descriptive text that accompanied the images.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

At the beginning four artists—Erich Lepier, Ludwig Schrott, Karl Endtresser and Franz Batke—worked with Pernkopf. Lepier, Pernkopf's first hire, had largely learned on his own after having to cut short his architectural studies at what is now [[Vienna University of Technology]] due to the death of his father, a circumstance similar to that which had shaped Pernkopf's career choice. The other three all had some degree of formal training.&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt; Outside of these four, some other artists, mostly family members such as Schrott's father and Batke's wife, contributed some pictures during the atlas's early years.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

Pernkopf instructed them to paint the organs they saw in as much detail as possible, to make them look like living tissue in print. This was enabled by a special treatment of the paper used for [[watercolor]] images that allowed greater detail than that type of paint normally did. The only deviation from this high level of realism was the use of color, where Pernkopf instructed them to use brighter hues than those found in real cadavers so that a reader would better learn to recognize and distinguish key anatomical landmarks.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

Like Pernkopf, the four artists were also members of the Nazi Party and committed to its goals. They signaled this through the use of [[Nazi symbolism|Nazi symbols]] in their work for the atlas. In his signature, Lepier frequently used the "r" at the end of his name as the basis for a [[swastika]], and Endtrasser likewise used [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|two Sig runes]], the lightning-bolt insignia of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), for the "ss" in his name. For illustrations he made in 1944, Batke similarly dated them by stylizing the two "4"'s as Sig Runes.&lt;ref name="Pieters 30–31"&gt;Pieters, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume of the atlas was published in 1937. It was large enough that it required two books, one devoted to anatomy in general and the other covering more specifically the chest and pectoral limbs. Four years later, in 1941, the second volume, likewise requiring two books, came out. It covered the abdomen, [[pelvis]] and pelvic limbs.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

That year the war intervened. With the exception of Lepier, ineligible for service because of his severe [[varicose veins]], all the artists entered military service. Lepier nevertheless volunteered as an [[air raid warden]], as did Batke when he returned home after being wounded and receiving the [[Iron Cross]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]]. These duties interrupted their artistic work.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

==Later life==

In 1943, Pernkopf reached the pinnacle of the academic career ladder when he was named the University of Vienna's [[Rector (academia)|rector]], its highest official. He continued to serve in those positions until [[World War II]] ended two years later, with the [[surrender of Germany]], including Austria. His fortunes would change radically as a result.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

Two days after the surrender, he was dismissed from his post as head of the university's anatomical institute. Fearing that he might suffer legal or political repercussions for his previous Nazi party membership and prewar actions, he went on what he claimed was a vacation to [[Strobl]] in the [[Salzburg (state)|state of Salzburg]]. However, he was arrested by American military authorities in August 1945, and by May 1946 he had been terminated from all his remaining positions with the university.&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt;

He was held at the Allied [[prisoner of war]] (POW) camp in [[Elsbethen|Glasenbach]] for three years. Although he was ultimately never charged with any crimes, he was required to do regular hard labor throughout his imprisonment. The experience left him drained and exhausted when he returned to Vienna after his release, hoping to continue his work on the atlas.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

His former facilities at the university were unavailable to him since the anatomical institute had been bombed during the war. [[Hans Hoff (physician)|Hans Hoff]], a Jewish physician who had left the Vienna faculty in 1938, gave him two rooms at the school's neurological institute.&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt;  Pernkopf was reunited with his original artists, some of whom had also been held in POW camps, as well as some new ones, and resumed his earlier demanding schedule. They continued working in the small space Hoff gave them. There was some tension among them as the three who had served felt Lepier, with whom they had never been close personally to begin with, had had a much easier time of it during the war than they had, a bitterness aggravated by the Third Reich's defeat by the Allies. He worked by himself while Pernkopf resumed his prewar schedule despite the privations he had endured.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

They were joined by two new painters. Wilhelm Dietz, older than the others, contributed paintings of the neck and [[pharynx]] during his two years on the project. Elfie von Siber painted facial muscles. The third volume, covering the head and neck, was released in 1952.&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt;

At the time of his death, Pernkopf was hard at work on the fourth volume. Two of his former colleagues, Alexander Pickler and Werner Platzer, completed it for its 1960 publication. A few years later, the publisher brought out a condensed two-volume set with all the color plates, removing most of Pernkopf's explanatory text (and, later, [[airbrush]]ing out the Nazi symbols Lepier and the others added to their signatures). Since little translation was necessary, this was the version of the atlas which medical students and physicians elsewhere in the world came to know and revere.&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt;

==Controversial legacy and debate over continued use==

In 1995 Pernkopf and his atlas came into the focus of a controversy in [[scientific ethics]] following the publication of a paper by Professor [[Edzard Ernst]], who had recently been chair of [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|Rehabilitative Medicine]] at the [[University of Vienna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/19/edzard-ernst-outspoken-professor-of-complementary-medicine | title=Edzard Ernst: outspoken professor of complementary medicine | work=The Guardian | date=19 October 2014 | accessdate=1 December 2014 | author=Davis, Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt; that outlined the Nazi takeover of the university and highlighted the human experimentation that followed, including the role of Pernkopf himself.&lt;ref name="Edzard_Ernst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst |first1=Edzard |authorlink=Edzard Ernst|date=15 May 1995|title=A leading medical school seriously damaged: Vienna 1938.|url=http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/708666/leading-medical-school-seriously-damaged-vienna-1938?volume=122&amp;issue=10&amp;page=789 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=122 |issue=10 |pages=789-792 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-122-10-199505150-00009 |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later  Dr. Howard Israel, an [[oral surgeon]] at [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine|Columbia University]], revealed that the subject bodies may have in some cases been those of executed political prisoners. Looking at older copies in the archives, Israel discovered many of the Nazi symbols in the artists' signatures, which had been removed from more widely circulated later versions. Since then physicians have discussed whether it is ethical to use the atlas as it resulted from Nazi medical research.&lt;ref name=ditt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doctors Question Use Of Nazi's Medical Atlas |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 November 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/26/science/doctors-question-use-of-nazi-s-medical-atlas.html?pagewanted=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of other parties, Dr. Israel directed a request to the University of Vienna to investigate the issue. This resulted in the establishment of the Senatorial Project of the University of Vienna "Studies in Anatomical Science in Vienna from 1938 to 1945" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malina |first1=P |last2=Spann |first2=G |year=1999 |title=SENATORIAL PROJECT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA, "STUDIES IN ANATOMICAL SCIENCE IN VIENNA FROM 1938 TO 1945" |journal=Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift |publisher=Springer |volume=111 |pmid=10546319 |issue=18 |pages=743–753 |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=10268665 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997. The project confirmed that at least 1,377 bodies of executed persons were delivered to the University during the Nazi times and its usage cannot be excluded from at least 800 images of the atlas. As a result, the atlas' publisher directed that an insert noting this possibility be mailed to all libraries holding the atlas, and stopped printing new copies.&lt;ref name=sh&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hildebrandt |first1=Sabine |last2= |first2= |year= 2006|title=How the Pernkopf controversy facilitated a historical and ethical analysis of the anatomical sciences in Austria and Germany: A recommendation for the continued use of the Pernkopf atlas |journal=[[Clinical Anatomy]] |publisher= |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=91 |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/49530/20272_ftp.pdf;jsessionid=FA0080D30EDDE859BBA3DA58F67E711C?sequence=1 |doi=10.1002/ca.20272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some readers have wondered if the bodies shown in cutaway may have been Jewish inmates at [[concentration camp]]s,&lt;ref name="Georgetown bioethics cases"&gt;{{cite web|title= 	
Case 2 The Dilemma of Tainted Data|url=http://highschoolbioethics.georgetown.edu/units/cases/unit3_2.html|publisher=[[Kennedy Institute of Ethics]]|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since they appear gaunt and have shaved heads or close-cropped haircuts.&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt; Israel asked the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] if this might have been the case. [[Simon Wiesenthal|Wiesenthal]] himself answered that it was unlikely, since during the Third Reich the Vienna ''Landsgericht'', or district court, passed death sentences solely on "non-Jewish Austrian patriots, communists and other enemies of the Nazis."&lt;ref name="Williams biography" /&gt; Further, it has long been standard practice to shave the heads of cadavers prior to dissection.&lt;ref name="Hubbard article" /&gt;

Scientists and [[bioethics|bioethicists]] have debated whether it is acceptable to continue to use the atlas for instructional purposes in light of its possible provenance. Opponents have asserted that ''any'' use of the atlas makes the user complicit in Nazi crimes and that modern technology, such as the [[Visible Human Project]] (based on the tomographic dissection of a man executed in the United States), will make the atlas redundant if it has not done so already. Proponents have countered that the knowledge gained from the atlas can be ethically separated from its origins nor can it be in some cases easily replaced by modern technology or other atlases. "[Pernkopf's] atlas is still one of the very best in terms of accuracy, showing levels of detail concerning fascia and neurovascular structures that are of direct relevance for the actual dissection process," says Sabine Hildebrandt, a [[University of Michigan Health System#Medical school|Michigan]] anatomy professor and German native who has researched him and other Nazi-era anatomists thoroughly.&lt;ref name="Hildebrandt 97"&gt;Hildebrandt, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, they say, its paintings are artistic masterpieces regardless of the politics of the artists. Finally, forcing it out of circulation would be no less an act of censorship than that perpetrated by Hitler's regime when it [[Nazi book burnings|publicly burned books]] shortly after assuming power.&lt;ref name="Carstens 11–12"&gt;Carstens, 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the scientists who were involved in bringing the activities of Pernkopf and other Nazi-era anatomists to light advocate for the atlas' continued use. "[They] can remind us of suffering not only in the past but in the present, that we may be more compassionate physicians, more compassionate citizens of the world," says Garrett Riggs, a Florida neurologist and medical historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riggs |first1=Garrett |last2= |first2= |year= 1998|title=What should we do about Eduard Pernkopf's atlas? |journal=Academic  Medicine |publisher= |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=380–386 |url=http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Abstract/1998/04000/What_should_we_do_about_Eduard_Pernkopf_s_atlas_.10.aspx |doi= 10.1097/00001888-199804000-00010|pmid=9580714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[A] ban could not atone the great evil committed by human beings on other human beings," Hildebrandt argues. "Rather, it is up to a new human generation to glean good from this murky history by continuing to use Pernkopf's atlas in a rational, historically conscious manner."&lt;ref name="Hildebrandt 97" /&gt;

On the other hand, "There can be no doubt that Pernkopf, as head of the Anatomy Institute, was instrumental in the procurement of the bodies of the victims of Nazi terror for dissection, and ultimately, for the creation of his Atlas," argues Pieter Carstens, a professor of public law at the [[University of Pretoria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.up.ac.za/en/public-law/article/1908419/professor-pa-pieter-carstens|title=Professor PA (Pieter) Carstens|website=www.up.ac.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "In this sense he was an ''indirect perpetrator'' in the execution of the victims, but a ''direct perpetrator'' in the subsequent processing and pillaging of the bodies." Following the theories of bioethicist [[Charles A. Foster]], he sees the anatomist's fundamental crime as a violation of his subjects' dignity.&lt;ref name="Carstens 41–45"&gt;Carstens, 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes:
{{quote|
How can something so beautiful at the same time be so utterly despicable? Herein lies the paradox of the Pernkopf Atlas, as a legacy of the Third Reich: the fact that Pernkopf and his illustrators, by embracing Nazi ideology and benefiting from the atrocities committed, created a Nazi anatomy atlas in which ''irreconcilable opposites were forcibly reconciled''. Beautiful anatomical drawings were created, but this was only made possible by the unethical and unlawful procurement of the anatomical remains of murdered victims of an evil Nazi regime–thus beauty and evil were fused. This fusion not only perverts and diminishes the status and content of the Pernkopf Atlas, but also explains why it should be rejected.

[It] should be permitted to show its duplicitous face only rarely and then for very good reason in the teaching of history, medical ethics and medical law so that its lessons will be learned and its history never repeated.&lt;ref name="Carstens 48"&gt;Carstens, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5046">'''Energy democracy''' is a political, economic, social and cultural concept that merges the technological [[energy transition]] with a strengthening of [[democracy]] and [[public participation]]. The concept is connected with an ongoing decentralization of energy systems with [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy]] being used also for a strengthened local energy [[ownership]]. With new [[green technologies]] available, such a transition is possibly involving new actors: [[prosumer]]s, renewable energy [[co-operative]]s and municipal, community-owned [[power station]]s which replace centralised, power corporations.

This concept is promoted by [[renewable energy commercialization|renewable energy business sector]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantechnica.com/2013/05/14/energy-democracy-video-campaign/ CleanTechnica Energy Democracy campaign website]&lt;/ref&gt; local communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewablecommunities.org/p/energy-democracy.html Renewable Communities - Energy Democracy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[labour union]]s (e.g. [[Global Labour Institute]], [[Trade Unions for Energy Democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;http://unionsforenergydemocracy.org/&lt;/ref&gt;), [[think tank]]s (e.g. [[Green Institute Foundation]]) etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demokracjaenergetyczna.pl Energy Democracy (Demokracja energetyczna) website]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NGO]] (e.g. [[Rosa Luxemburg Foundation]]).

There are various concepts of Energy Democracy. One early concept has been published by the Berlin-based group gegenstrom 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Gegenstrom 2011, Energiepolitische Thesen http://www.gegenstromberlin.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Energiepolitische_Thesen-gsb_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis paper calls for “a 100% transition to renewable energy as quick as possible" and a reform of ownership of energy production: “dash energy corporations! Socialise energy provision! The gamete of energy democracy will be publicly owned city utilities (Stadtwerke) and energy cooperatives”.&lt;ref&gt;Gegenstrom 2011, Energiepolitische Thesen http://www.gegenstromberlin.net/2011/05/15/energiepolitische-thesen-gegen-den-fossil-nuklearen-wahn-energiedemokratie-jetzt/ and https://www.akweb.de/ak_s/ak561/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The concept inspired the German climate camps in 2011, as a collection of theses and arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitung zu den Klimacamps 2011 im deutschsprachigen Raum  http://www.klimacamp2011.de/files/klimazeitung-fin2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 climate camp Lausitzcamp in Lusatia published a short summary of the concept: “Energy Democracy means ensuring that everyone has access to enough energy. However, the energy must be produced in a way that it neither harms nor endangers the environmental or people. Concretely, this means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, socializing and democratizing the means of production and changing our attitude towards energy consumption.” &lt;ref&gt;quoted after the translation at Büro für eine demokratische Energiewende 2012 &lt;http://energie-demokratie.de/what-is-energy-democracy&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a concept of energy democracy was promoted by the city of [[Boulogne-Billancourt]] in [[France]]. For its participation in the Bloomberg mayors challenge, the city presented an innovative vision of Energy democracy based on the reduction of the use of fossil fuels and a system of incentives to encourage citizens in reducing their energy consumption.

Energy-democracy has been a successful concept of grass roots movements to combine resistance against fossil fuel exploitation like coal or shale gas with a positive alternative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Kunze, Conrad and Becker, Sören, Energy democracy in Europe: A survey and outlook, Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung Brussels Office, 2014. http://www.rosalux.de/publication/40662/energy-democracy-in-europe.html&lt;/ref&gt; "The hope, moreover, is that energy democracy might offer new spaces for collaboration between ecological movements and movements for social, economic and workplace justice."&lt;ref&gt;James Angel, Strategies of Energy Democracy, Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung Brussels Office, http://www.rosalux.de/publication/42125/strategien-der-energiedemokratie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic, James Goodman, details the difference between energy policy in Germany and India, exploring public participation in approaches to renewable energy. He concludes that 'energy policies are found to be increasingly embedded in the wider 'climate dialectic', forcing new, more transformative possibilities onto the agenda.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=James|title=The 'climate dialectic' in energy policy: Germany and India compared|journal=Energy Policy|date=2016|volume=99|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">'''Epidoseis''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιδόσεις}}) was a form of non-compulsory, non-tax financial giving in [[ancient Greece]].

These epidoseis were voluntary contributions, either in money, arms, or ships, which were made by the citizens of [[Athens]] in order to meet the extraordinary demands of the state. When the expenses of the state were greater than its revenue, it was usual for the [[prytaneis]] to summon an assembly of the people -- ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]'' -- and, after explaining the necessities of the state, to call upon the citizens to contribute according to their means.

Those who were willing to contribute then rose and said what they would give; while those who were unwilling to give anything, remained silent or retired privately from the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Alcibiades]]'' 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Phocion]]'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meid"&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''[[Against Meidias]]'' pp. 566-567. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophrastus]], ''Characters'' 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Athen. iv. p. 168, e&lt;/ref&gt; The names of those who had promised to contribute, together with the amount of their contributions, were written on tablets, which were placed before the statues of the [[Eponymous archon|Eponymi]], where they remained until the amount was paid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaeus]], ''On Dicaeogenes'' p. 111, ed. Reisk&lt;/ref&gt;

These voluntary contributions were frequently very large. Sometimes the more wealthy citizens voluntarily undertook a "trierarchy", or the expenses of equipping a [[trireme]].&lt;ref name="meid"/&gt; We read that the freedman [[Pasion]] furnished 1000 shields, together with five triremes, which he equipped at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] ''Against Stephanus'' p. 1127. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chrysippus]] presented a talent to the state, when [[Alexander the Great]] moved against Thebes during the [[Battle of Thebes]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] ''Against Phormio'' p. 918. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristophanes, son of Nicophemus]] gave 30,000 [[drachma]]e for an expedition against [[Cyprus]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Lysias]], ''On the Property of Aristophanes'' p. 644&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charidemus]] and [[Diotimus]], two commanders, made a free gift of 800 shields;&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''De Corona'' p. 265. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and similar instances of liberality are mentioned by German classical scholar [[August Böckh]], from whom the preceding examples have been taken.&lt;ref&gt;[[August Böckh]], ''The Public Economy of Athens''  pp. 586, 587, 2nd. ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ethical relationship''', in most theories of [[ethics]] that employ the term, is a basic and trustworthy relationship that one has to another human being, that cannot necessarily be characterized in terms of any abstraction other than [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] and common protection of each other's [[Human body|body]].  [[Honesty]] is very often a major focus.

== Basics ==

Usually the most basic of these relationships studied is that between the [[motherhood|mother and child]], and second most basic is between [[sexual partner]]s—the focus of [[feminism]] and [[Queer theory]] respectively, where relationships are central. Family role theory extends this to study paternalistic, maternalistic and sibling roles, and postulates that one's later relationships are formed largely in order to fill the roles one has grown to find comfortable as part of one's family environment—the family of origin thus setting pattern for the family of choice. Another type of ethical relationship is that between the student at an institution and his or her instructor. Because teaching is “leadership based upon moral and ethical principles.” The student is positioned into a role where participation means understanding and resolving multiple issues of ethics, including the actions of his or her professor or instructor.

== Contrasting theories ==

As contrasted to [[theories]] of ethics that derive from [[dispute resolution]], or the [[meta-ethics]] as defined in Western [[moral philosophy]], [[ethical tradition]]s emphasizing abstract [[moral code]]s expressed in some language with some judgmental hierarchy, ethical relationship theories tend to emphasize [[Developmental psychology|human development]].  Thus they focus on unequal [[power (sociology)|power]] and such matters as sexual [[honesty]], [[marriage|marital]] [[promise|commitment]], [[child-raising]], and responsibility to conduct such essential body and care matters as [[toilet training]], [[weaning]], forming attitudes to [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and to [[masturbation]].  Failures to consider consequences of teachings or examples set in these matters is disastrous, as it leads to failures of the most fundamental relationship any person has:  to their own body, shame in it, pride in it, care for it, etc.  Care and concern for other's bodies follows.

No [[ethical tradition]] has failed to prescribe at least some rules for the conduct of such relationships.

[[Carol Gilligan]] famously championed the role of relationships as central to [[moral reasoning]], and superior as a basis for understanding human choices than any prior linguistic or meta-ethical concept. This perspective is now commonly called the [[ethics of care]].

[[Lawrence Kohlberg]], famous for work on [[moral development]] as a part of human development, eventually joined Gilligan in starting a [[descriptive ethics]] of relationship conduct in what they called the ''ethical community'' or ''just community''. This was in effect a [[community of practice]] which, at least in Kohlberg's conception, had a core [[epistemic community]] of those trusted to define and resolve the disputes between members, and to facilitate the growth of moral development, not only in children, but in prisoners and others.

[[Donald R. C. Reed]], whose book ''Following Kohlberg: Liberalism and the Practice of Democratic Community'' (1998) outlined the extension of these principles to [[deliberative democracy]], claims that "During the four years following publication of Gilligan's ''[[In a Different Voice]]'' (1982), Kohlberg and Gilligan both revised their accounts of moral development so that they converged far more than is commonly recognized." Reed argued for "extending this convergence to include the understanding developed in the just community projects."

There is also potential for application of these methods to [[ethical tradition]].  Kohlberg's student [[Burton Visotzky]],  for instance, in ''The Genesis of Ethics'', 1997, applied the relationship approach to [[Ethics in the Bible]].  The book focuses on the choices and interactions of major characters in the ''[[Book of Genesis]]''.  Visotzky exploits much of the [[Talmud]]ic, [[midrash]] and [[magisterium]], demonstrating that these [[Jewish theology|Jewish theological traditions]] too had often focused on the ethical relationship, not only between Man and God, but between others in one's family, tribe or community.

[[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[Confucius]], [[Menno Simons]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]] are examples of figures in [[moral philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]] who focused first and foremost on the ethical choices made in the actual framing and encounter of moral interventions. [[Green movement|Greens]] and [[New Confucians]] are two examples of modern movements that are derived in part from relational traditions.

Leibniz was born in [[Altenburg]], the son of Ambrosious Leibniz, a civil servant, and a [[Leipzig]] noblewoman named Anna Deuerlin.&lt;ref name="Houston"/&gt;

He completed his [[master's degree]] at the University of Leipzig during 1622 and became an [[actuary]] in administration at the University.&lt;ref name="Continuum "/&gt; His first marriage in 1625 produced a son, Johann Friedrich, and a daughter, Anna Rosina. He was elected to the chair in moral philosophy at Leipzig in 1640.

The ''Garvald School and Training Centre'' was founded near [[West Linton]] in 1944 by Dr [[Hans Schauder]], his wife Lisl and others who decided to join him after having worked for some years at the [[Camphill]] community in [[Aberdeen]]. Dr Schauder himself was of [[Vienna|Viennese]] origin and had fled [[Austria]] some years previously as he came from a [[Jewish family]]. Connected with [[Anthroposophy]], the medical and therapeutic work of [[Rudolf Steiner]] and with the group around Dr [[Karl König]], he had been among the founders of Camphill. After working at Garvald for some years he opened his own practice in Edinburgh and developed his own method of counselling until meeting the Dominican monk, Lefébure, with whom he wrote his best known and pioneering work Conversations on Counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=1318|title=Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls - Biographien Dokumentation|author=Axel Westhagen|date=6 October 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Garvald school later became simply the Garvald Training Centre and continued to grow and expand over time into six independent communities:

: '''Garvald West Linton''', the original community established in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SCO20909|Garvald West Linton}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
: '''Garvald Edinburgh''', established in 1969, runs a bakery and confectionery delivering to whole food shops, delicatessens and cafés and private customers, which was featured in the short film ''[[Breadmakers]]'' produced by Jim Hickey and [[Robin Mitchell]] and directed by Yasmin Fedda in 2007 and won several awards. The Mulberry Bush Shop sells artisan gifts produced in their workshops as well as books, art materials and craft produced by other suppliers. Craft workshops include a glass studio, joinery, pottery, puppetry, textiles and hand tool refurbishment. In 2007 it opened the Orwell Arts building in the city, where the former Dalry Primary School had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlanders.co.uk/projects/educational/orwell-arts-the-garvald-centre/|title=Orwell Arts, the Garvald Centre, Edinburgh|author=Oberlanders Architects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC014228|Garvald Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''The Engine Shed''', an extension of Garvald Edinburgh founded in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC002245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: The '''Columcille Centre''' has a range of programmes like Edinburgh All, Columcille Esbank, Music for All, the Library project, Columcille Hall that is also available for rental and the Columcille [[Ceili Band]], which featured in the documentary ''“About A Band”'' by Jim Hickey and [[Robin Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatricalia.com/place/1z4/columcille-centre-edinburgh|title=Columcille Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it hosts the Makers Markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themakersmarkets.co.uk/MorningsideMakersMarket.html|title=The Makers Markets - Morningside Makers Market|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SCO24228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Garvald Glenesk''', a residential care centre established in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC028187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Garvald Home Farm''', a [[Biodynamic agriculture|Biodynamic farm]] associated with Garvald West Linton established in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC015243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garvald social therapy==
{{peacock|date=January 2018}}
The Centres draw their inspiration from the work of Rudolf Steiner, in particular his ideas on [[Social Therapy]] expressed through the type of opportunities provided, the approach and interdependence they try to create. It consists in giving structure and rhythm to member’s lives, bringing people together to form a solid community through common activities or the celebration of events and by emphasising the quality of what the workshops produce so that everyone can take pride in achieving the best possible. The items produced should have a value or benefit to others rather than making things for their own sake.

They provide creative working environments focusing mainly on [[craft]], [[catering]], artistic skills and [[agriculture]]. Craft offers a wide range of possibilities for people to express creativity and be connected to nature, so there is much focus on different craft activities. In addition they engage in approaches such as the [[Talking Points]] methodology, which focuses on outcomes for service-users and carers and have themselves produced Talking Points tools which have been designed specifically for people with learning disabilities. In this way there is an opportunity for anyone coming to one of the Garvald centres to affect their environment, and the local and often wider community. They become needed by others and relied upon to sustain the creativity and range of goods, art and craft work. A range of therapies like [[Eurythmy]], Creative Speech, [[Massage]] and varies other therapeutic arts are also offered.

In addition to providing structured and creative working environments the majority of their studios and workshops have an enterprise focus, returning income to offset running costs. The opportunities they provide help people to gain confidence, particularly school leavers making the transition into an adult environment. The workshops teach skills that apply in mainstream employment or help an individual develop creativity over a longer period.

They have experience in supporting people with a range of needs and syndromes including [[Autism]], [[Down syndrome]], [[Fragile X syndrome]], [[Epilepsy]], [[Prader Willi Syndrome]] and [[Dual Diagnosis]] as well as physical and communication difficulties. Members’ ages range from sixteen to the mid seventies.

==Early life and first marriage==
Harriet Hardy was born in 1807 in [[Walworth]], south London to parents Harriet and Thomas Hardy, a surgeon.&lt;ref name="works intro"&gt;“Introduction.” The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, by Jo Ellen Jacobs and Paula Harms Payne, Indiana University Press, 1998. &lt;/ref&gt; Harriet was educated at home and expressed an early interest in writing poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=History – Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807–1858)|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married her first husband, John Taylor, in 1826 at age 18. Together, they had three children: Herbert, Algernon, and [[Helen Taylor (feminist)|Helen Taylor]]. In 1831 Harriet met John Stuart Mill. Their meeting was planned by the leader of Harriet's [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/harriet-mill/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Miller|first=Dale E.|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Taylor invited Mill to dinner because of his wife's mutual interest in women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Ellen Jacobs, 'Chronology', The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, p.xlii&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor was already not only writing poetry, but was interested in social reform, and had written a lengthy ''Life of William Caxton'' (which is more of a comprehensive history of the printed and written word) for the [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]]. Around the time she met Mill, she was, or began, also writing a series of unpublished pieces on women's rights, ethics, toleration and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronology" The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, by Jo Ellen Jacobs, Indiana University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Her friendship with Mill quickly blossomed.&lt;ref name="works intro"/&gt; Taylor was attracted to Mill, who treated her as an intellectual equal. Around eighteen months later, something made Taylor break off their friendship,&lt;ref&gt;Jo Ellen Jacobs, 'Chronology', p.xlii&lt;/ref&gt; causing Mill to write her a passionate love letter in French (the only piece of correspondence we have from either for this period of their relationship) in which he refuses to accept her 'eternal adieu', and, although saying 'her wish is his command', insists 'her path and mine are separated, she says; but they can, they must, meet again'.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, Early Correspondence, CWXII, p.114. 'Sa route et la mienne sont s6par6es, elle l'a dit: mais elles peuvent, elles doivent, se rencontrer'&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, she agreed, for they were soon closer than ever, exchanging a pair of lengthy essays, ''On Marriage'', in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;The date is not certain. Watermarks date to 1831 and 1832. However, Taylor quotes a poem by Tennyson ("Eleanore") which was only published in 1833.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these essays, Taylor and Mill discuss the ethical questions of marriage, separation and divorce. Taylor insists that what needs to be done to 'rais[e] the condition of women' is 'to remove all interference with affection, or with anything which is, or which even might be supposed to be, demonstrative of affection'.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Taylor, 'On Marriage', Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; She criticises the fact that 'women are educated for one single object, to gain their living by marrying'; that 'to be married is the object of their existence'; and 'that object being gained they do really cease to exist as to anything worth calling life or any useful purpose'.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; She also criticises the hypocrisy and unfairness of the fact that any girl who is seen as 'suitable' for marriage is – because only virgins are seen as suitable – by that very fact completely ignorant as to what marriage entails.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; She argues for rights to divorce, asking 'who would wish to have the person without the inclination?'.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt; 

Going against the prevailing view that she was rather anti-sex, Taylor says that though 'certain it is that there is equality in nothing now – all the pleasure...being men's, and all the disagreeables and pains being women's', it is equally certain that 'pleasure would be infinitely heightened both in kind and degree by the perfect equality of the sexes'.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; She adds, 'Sex in its true and finest meaning, seems to be the way in which is manifested all that is highest, best and beautiful in the nature of human beings – none but poets have approached to the perception of the beauty of the material world – still less of the spiritual – and there never yet existed a poet except by the inspiration of that feeling which is the perception of beauty in all forms and by all means which are given us, as well as by sight'.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; She ends the essay by saying 'It is for you' (i.e. Mill) 'the most worthy apostle of all the loftiest virtues – to teach such as may be taught, that the higher the kind of enjoyment, the greater the degree',&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and it is noteworthy that Mill is known, in his much-later essay [[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]], for introducing the concept of differences in the quality of pleasures to a previously quantitative 'hedonic calculus' inherited from [[Jeremy Bentham]]. 

In late September, or early October, 1833, Taylor's husband agreed to a trial separation. She went to Paris where, after what appears to have been an initial onset of cold feet regarding the possible repercussions of such a move for his, and her, reputation, Mill joined her.&lt;ref&gt;See Mill's letters to Thomas Carlyle, and Taylor's letters to him.  Mill, CW XII, pp. 180–185. The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill. pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite evidently being extremely happy there with Mill, Taylor was conscience-stricken regarding her husband, keenly feeling the pain, and possible public humiliation, she was putting him through. Eventually, she decided to return to London, and her husband, yet by the summer of 1834 Harriet was living in her own house in Keston Heath.&lt;ref&gt;The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill, by Jo Ellen Jacobs, Indiana University Press, 2002, p 61&lt;/ref&gt; Mill visited Harriet frequently at her house in Keston Heath and travelled with her and sometimes her children throughout the next two decades.

==Marriage to Mill==
After John Taylor died in 1849, Taylor and Mill waited two years before marrying in 1851. Taylor was hesitant to create greater scandal than the pair already had. Mill's marriage proposal reflected his model of equality.&lt;ref&gt;"Being about, if I am so happy as to obtain her consent, to enter into the marriage relation with the only woman I have ever known, with whom I would have entered into that state; &amp; the whole character of the marriage relation as constituted by law being such as both she and I entirely &amp; conscientiously disapprove, for this amongst other reasons, that it confers upon one of the parties to the contract, legal power &amp; control over the person, property, &amp; freedom of action of the other party, independent of her own wishes and will; I, having no means of legally divesting myself of these odious powers (as I most assuredly would do if an engagement to that effect could be made legally binding on me) feel it my duty to put on record a formal protest against the existing law of marriage, in so far as conferring such powers; and a solemn promise never in any case or under any circumstances to use them. And in the event of marriage between Mrs. Taylor and me I declare it to be my will and intention, &amp; the condition of the engagement between us, that she retains in all respects whatever the same absolute freedom of action, &amp; freedom of disposal of herself and of all that does or may at any time belong to her, as if no such marriage had taken place; and I absolutely disclaim &amp; repudiate all pretension to have acquired any rights whatever by virtue of such marriage. 	6th March 1851	J.S.Mill",The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill, pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote a number of essays, including several joint-authored pieces with Mill on domestic violence&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/jsmill/diss-disc/eow.html The Enfranchisement of Women], published in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill.  pp. 51–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mill| first =Mrs. John Stuart| authorlink = | author2 =| title =The Enfranchisement of Women | publisher =Westminster &amp; Foreign Quarterly Review| publication-place = London | edition = July 1851| year =1851| pages = 27| language = | isbn =| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yKMYAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=4 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Own work==
Harriet began publishing her works when she was pregnant with her third child, Helen. She provided a variety of literature for the Unitarian journal ''[[Monthly Repository]]'' and "Enfranchisement of Women".&lt;ref name="works intro"/&gt; Though she made many contributions over the years, little of her own work was published under her own name during her lifetime. She was the co-author of several newspaper articles on domestic violence published anonymously in the ''Morning Chronicle'', ''Daily News'', and ''Sunday Times'' in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Works of Harriet Taylor Mill, pp. 75–131.&lt;/ref&gt; She read and commented on all the material produced by John Stuart Mill. In his autobiography, Mill claimed Harriet as the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He added, "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written by Mill in 1854 suggests the attribution of credit goes both ways for her and John Stuart Mill; "I shall never be satisfied unless you allow our best book, the book which is to come, to have our two names on the title page. It ought to be so with everything I publish, for the better half of it all is yours". There is speculation that this indicates some reluctance on her part, potentially in response to a philosophical text published by Mill only or as a coauthored work, but this evidence as well as John Stuart Mill's comments on collaboration in his autobiography indicates the two worked as a pair for much of their work.&lt;ref&gt; Mill, John Stuart. Autobiography. Henry Holt and Co.  &lt;/ref&gt;

J. S. Mill called her a valuable contributor to much of his work, especially ''[[On Liberty]]'', which he later dedicated to her when it was published in 1859, a year after her death.  She also contributed to ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill, pp. 195–251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harriet Taylor|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=BBC History, Historic Figures| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mill| first =John Stuart| authorlink = John Stuart Mill| author2 =| title =Autobiography | publisher =Longmans, Green, Reader &amp; Dyer| publication-place = London | edition = 1873 first| date =1873| pages = 251–252| language = | isbn =| url = https://archive.org/stream/autobiographymil00milluoft#page/250/mode/2up/search/on+liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Harriet Taylor Mill died in the [[Hotel d'Europe]] in [[Avignon]], France, on 3 November 1858 after developing severe lung congestion. [[Jo Ellen Jacobs]] has argued that Mill's cause of death may have been syphilis contracted from her first husband.&lt;ref&gt;The Voice of Harriet Taylor Mill, pp. 134–146&lt;/ref&gt; 

Upon her death, John Stuart Mill wrote:

{{Cquote|Were I but capable of interpreting to the world one half the great thoughts and noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of a greater benefit to it, than is ever likely to arise from anything that I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mill| first =John Stuart| authorlink = John Stuart Mill| author2 =| title =On Liberty | publisher =John W.

'''Jan z Jenštejna''', {{lang-de|Johann II. von Jenstein, Johannes VI. von Jenstein. Johann von Jenzenstein, Johann von Genzenstein}} (1348 in [[Prague]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Royal Bohemia]], [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] – 17 June 1400 in [[Rome]]) was the [[Archbishop of Prague]] 1379–1396. He studied in [[Bologna]], [[Padova]], [[Montpellier]] and [[Paris]]. He was also [[poet]], [[writer]] and [[composer]].

== Life ==
In 1379 he became the owner of the castle Hrádek. In 1379 he succeeded to the [[archbishopric]] of his uncle [[Jan Očko z Vlašimi]] who had stepped down. Soon he became [[Chancellor]] to [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]]. The next year the capital was struck by a [[Bubonic plague|Plague epidemic]], which struck him as well. He recovered, but this episode left deep scars on his character and he began to examine theological and philosophical problems at his castle [[Helfenburk u Úštěka]].
He had abandoned public life because of a quarrel with Wenceslav IV, which was mainly over the matter of the [[Popes of Avignon]]. Jan was still loyal to [[Pope Urban VI]], to whom the king was not. In 1384 he left his chancellor post. The quarrel with the king removed him completely from political life, and he retired to his castle and abandoned the post of archbishop on 2 July 1396. He was succeeded as archbishop by Olbram ze Škvorce.

While on his castle, he fell from a newly built tower and miraculously managed to grab hold of something before falling to the ground.
He died in [[Rome]] in 1400, and all his possessions, including his castle, passed to the Archbishops of Prague.

== Artistic works ==
His musical works were compiled in the book "Die Hymnen Johanns von Jenstein, Erzbischofs von Prag" of Q. M. Dreves. The book was published in German in 1886. His literary activity was very rich and includes not only religious and philosophical works, but also poems.

'''John Daniel Wild''' (April 10, 1902&amp;nbsp;– October 23, 1972) was a twentieth-century American [[philosopher]].  Wild began his philosophical career as an [[empiricist]] and [[philosophical realism|realist]] but became an important proponent of [[existentialism]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of SPEP"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Wild was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. After undergraduate studies at the [[University of Chicago]], he received his master's degree from [[Harvard University]] and completed his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ira Sugarman and Roger B. Duncan, eds. 'General Introduction: John Wild's Philosophical Itinerary' in ''The Promise of Phenomenology: Posthumous Papers of John Wild'' (Lexington Books, 2006), xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught for a year at the [[University of Michigan]] and then at Harvard from 1927 until 1961 when he left to assume the chairmanship of the philosophy department at [[Northwestern University]], a leading center for phenomenology and existentialism in the United States.  Wild moved to [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1963 and, in 1969, to the [[University of Florida]].

He received an honorary doctorate from [[Ripon College (Wisconsin)|Ripon College]] and served as visiting professor at the Universities of Chicago, [[University of Hawaii|Hawaii]], and [[University of Washington|Washington]].  He served as president of the Association for Realistic Philosophy (1949) and the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] (1954).  In 1962 Wild, along with  [[William A. Earle]], [[James M. Edie]], and others, founded the [http://www.spep.org Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy].

'''John Henry Muirhead''' (28 April 1855 – 24 May 1940) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] best known for having initiated the [[Muirhead Library of Philosophy]] in 1890. He became the first person named to the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1900.

==Biography==
Born in [[Glasgow, Scotland]], Muirhead was educated at the [[Glasgow Academy]] (1866–70), and proceeded to [[Glasgow University]], where he was deeply influenced by the Hegelianism of [[Edward Caird]], the Professor of Moral Philosophy. He graduated MA in 1875. The same year he won a Snell exhibition at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], to which he went up in Trinity Term 1875. His Library was originally published by [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] and continued through to the 1970s. His Library is seen as a crucial landmark in the history of modern philosophy, publishing a number of prominent 20th Century philosophers including [[Ernest Albee]], [[Brand Blanshard]], [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Axel Hagerstrom]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], [[Irving Thalberg, Jr.]], [[Georg Wilhelm Hegel]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[George Edward Moore]]. In 2002, the Library was made available in a 95 volume set ({{ISBN|0-415-27897-X}}).

This article covers the influence of [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Islamic philosophy]] on each other, focusing especially on the period from 800–1400 CE.

== Early philosophy ==
A century after the [[Qur'an]] was revealed, numerous religious schisms arose in Islam. Skeptics sought to investigate the doctrines of the Qur'an, which until then had been accepted as divine revelation. The first independent protest was that of the [[Qadar]] ("Destiny"), whose partisans affirmed the freedom of the will, in contrast with the Jabarites (''jabar'', force, constraint), who maintained the traditional belief in [[fatalism]].

In the second century of the [[Hijra year|Hegira]], a schism arose in the theological schools of [[Basra]], over which [[Hasan al-Basri]] presided. A pupil, [[Wasil ibn Ata]], who was expelled from the school because his answers were contrary to tradition, proclaimed himself leader of a new school, and systematized all the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Kadarites. This new school or sect was called [[Mutazilites]] (from 'tazala, to separate oneself, to dissent).   The sect had three principal dogmas: (1) God is an absolute unity, and no attribute can be ascribed to Him. (2) Man is a free agent.   Because of these two principles the Mutazilites designate themselves the "AsḦab al-'Adl w'al TauḦid" (The Partisans of Justice and Unity). (3) All knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason; he could acquire knowledge before as well as after Revelation, by the sole light of reason&amp;mdash;a fact which, therefore, makes knowledge obligatory upon all men and women, at all times, and in all places.

The Mutazilites, compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islamic faith, looked for support to the doctrines of [[philosophy]], and thus founded a [[rational theology]], which they designated "'' 'Ilm-al-[[Kalam]]''" (Science of the Word); and those professing it were called Motekallamin. This appellation, originally designating the Mutazilites, soon became the common name for all seeking philosophical demonstration in confirmation of religious principles. The first Motekallamin had to combat both the orthodox and the infidel parties, between whom they occupied the middle ground; but the efforts of subsequent generations were entirely concentrated against the philosophers.  The later Motekallamin formed a school known as [[Ash'ari]]sm, which regarded itself as the champion of orthodoxy, and references by the later philosophers to "Motekallamin" (theologians) should usually be taken as meaning the Ash'arites.

From the ninth century onward, owing to [[Caliph]] al-Ma'mun and his successor, Greek philosophy was introduced among the Arabs, and the [[Peripatetic school]] began to find able representatives among them; such were [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]], and [[Averroes|Ibn Roshd]], all of whose fundamental principles were considered as heresies by the Motekallamin.

== Argument for creation ==
[[Aristotle]], the prince of the philosophers, demonstrated the unity of God; but from the view which he maintained, that matter was eternal, it followed that God could not be the Creator of the world. Again, to assert, as the Peripatetics did, that God's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe, and not to individual and accidental things, is tantamount to giving denial to prophecy. One other point shocked the faith of the Motekallamin&amp;mdash;the theory of the intellect. The Peripatetics taught that the human soul was only an aptitude&amp;mdash;a faculty capable of attaining every variety of passive perfection&amp;mdash;and that through information and virtue it became qualified for union with the active intellect, which latter emanates from God. To admit this theory would be to deny the immortality of the soul (see [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]).

Wherefore the Motekallamin had, before anything else, to establish a system of philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter, and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by [[Democritus]]. They taught that atoms possess neither quantity nor extension. Originally atoms were created by God, and are created now as occasion seems to require. Bodies come into existence or die, through the aggregation or the sunderance of these atoms. But this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter. For, indeed, if it be supposed that God commenced His work at a certain definite time by His "will," and for a certain definite object, it must be admitted that He was imperfect before accomplishing His will, or before attaining His object. In order to obviate this difficulty, the Motekallamin extended their theory of the atoms to Time, and claimed that just as Space is constituted of atoms and vacuum, Time, likewise, is constituted of small indivisible moments. The creation of the world once established, it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a Creator, and that He is unique, omnipotent, and omniscient.

Toward the middle of the eighth century a dissenting sect&amp;mdash;still in existence to-day&amp;mdash;called [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], arose in Judaism. In order to give a philosophical tinge to their polemics with their opponents, they borrowed the dialectic forms of the Motekallamin, and even adopted their name (Mas'udi, in "Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la Bibliothèque Royale," viii. 349-351), and thus transplanted the Kalam gradually to Jewish soil, to undergo the same transformations there as among the Arabs.

== Saadia Gaon ==
{{main|Saadia Gaon}}

One of the most important early Jewish philosophers influenced by Islamic philosophy is Saadia Gaon (892-942). His most important work is ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'' (Book of Beliefs and Opinions). In this work Saadia treats of the questions that interested the Motekallamin so deeply&amp;mdash;such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. &amp;mdash; and he criticizes the philosophers severely.

For Saadia creation is not problematic: God created the world ''[[ex nihilo]]'', just as Scripture attests; and he contests the theory of the Motekallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter. To prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Motekallamin. Only the attributes of essence (sifat-al-datiat) can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (sifat-al-af'aliyat). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the celestial spheres. Here Saadia contradicts the Motekallamin, who considered the soul an "accident" (compare "Moreh," i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: "Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident" (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: "If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love," etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views; just as the Jewish and Muslim Peripatetics stopped short in their respective [[Aristotelianism]] whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion.

== Neoplatonic philosophy ==

Jewish philosophy entered upon a new period in the eleventh century. The works of the Peripatetics &amp;mdash;Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina ([[Avicenna]])&amp;mdash;on the one side, and the "Encyclopedia of the [[Brethren of Purity]]"&amp;mdash;a transformed Kalam founded on [[Neoplatonic]] theories&amp;mdash;on the other side, exercised considerable influence upon Jewish thinkers of that age. The two leading philosophers of the period are [[Solomon ibn Gabirol|Ibn Gabirol]] (Avicebron) and [[Bahya ibn Pakuda]] &amp;mdash; the former standing upon a purely philosophical platform, the latter upon a religio-philosophical one; and both attaining similar results. Both believe in a universal matter as the substratum of all (except God) that exists; but Bahya goes further and determines what that matter is: it is Darkness ("Ma'ani al-Nafs," translated by Broydé, p.&amp;nbsp;17). But this matter did not exist from all eternity, as the Peripatetics claimed. It is easy to perceive here the growth of the Peripatetic ideas as to substance and form; but influenced by religion, these ideas are so shaped as to admit the non-eternity of matter. In all that pertains to the soul and its action, Gabirol and Bahya are undoubtedly influenced by the "Brethren of Purity." Man (the microcosm) is in every way like the celestial spheres (the macrocosm).  Just as the heavenly spheres receive their motion from the universal soul&amp;mdash;which is a simple substance emanating from God&amp;mdash;so man receives his motion from the rational soul&amp;mdash;another simple substance emanating from Him.

In fact, creation came through emanation, and in the following sequence: (1) The active intellect; (2) the universal soul&amp;mdash;which moves the heavenly sphere; (3) nature; (4) darkness&amp;mdash;which at the beginning was but a capacity to receive form; (5) the celestial spheres; (6) the heavenly bodies; (7) fire; (8) air; (9) water; (10) earth ("Ma'ani al-Nafs," 72; compare Munk, l.c., p.&amp;nbsp;201). But as regards the question of the attributes which occupy the Jewish and Muslim theologians so much, Bahya, in his work on ethics, "Hovot ha-Levavot," written in Arabic under the title of "Kitab al-Hidayat fi faraidh al Kulub" (The Duties of the Heart), is of the same opinion as the Motazilites, that the attributes by which one attempts to describe God should be taken in a negative sense, as excluding the opposite attributes. With reference to Gabirol, a positive opinion can not be given on this point, as his "Fons Vitæ" does not deal with the question; but there is reason to believe that he felt the influence of the Asharites, who admitted attributes. In fact, in his poetical philosophy, entitled "Keter Malkut" (The Crown of Royalty), Gabirol uses numerous attributes in describing God. By way of a general statement, one may say that the Neoplatonic philosophy among the Jews of the eleventh century marks a transitional epoch, leading either to the pure philosophy of the Peripatetics or to the mysticism of the [[Kabbalah]].

== The apotheosis of philosophy ==

The twelfth century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the Kalam, which latter, being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. This supreme exaltation of philosophy was due, in great measure, to [[Al-Ghazali|Gazzali]] (1005-1111) among the Arabs, and to [[Judah ha-Levi]] (1140) among the Jews. In fact, the attacks directed against the philosophers by Gazzali in his work, "TuḦfat al-Falasafa" (The Destruction of the Philosophers), not only produced, by reaction, a current favorable to philosophy, but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism, they thereafter making their theories clearer and their logic closer. The influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the Arabic Peripatetic school ever produced, namely, [[Ibn Baja]] (Aven Pace) and Ibn Roshd ([[Averroes]]), both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy.

Since no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on Arabian soil without leaving its impress on the Jews, Gazzali found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This illustrious poet took upon himself to free religion from the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the "Cuzari," in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Motekallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, "I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them" ("Cuzari," v.&lt;!-- no source here! --&gt;). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Motekallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: "Does the Kalam give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?" (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in his eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament.

But the Hebrew Gazzali was no more successful than his Arabian prototype; and his attacks, although they certainly helped to discredit the Kalam&amp;mdash;for which no one cared any longer&amp;mdash;were altogether powerless against Peripatetic philosophy, which soon found numerous defenders. In fact, soon after the "Cuzari" made its appearance, Abraham ibn Daud published his "Emunah Ramah" (The Sublime Faith), wherein he recapitulated the teachings of the Peripatetics, Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, upon the physics and metaphysics of Aristotle, and sought to demonstrate that these theories were in perfect harmony with the doctrines of Judaism. "It is an error generally current," says Ibn Daud in the preface of his book, "that the study of speculative philosophy is dangerous to religion. True philosophy not only does not harm religion, it confirms and strengthens it."

=== Maimonides ===

The authority of Ibn Daud, however, did not suffice to give permanence to Aristotelianism in Judaism. This accomplishment was reserved for [[Maimonides]], who discussed the relevance of the philosophy of Aristotle to Judaism; and to this end he composed his immortal work, "Dalalat al-Ḥairin" ([[Guide for the Perplexed]]) &amp;mdash;known better under its Hebrew title "''Moreh Nevuchim''"&amp;mdash;which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by Jewish thinkers.

In this work, Maimonides, after refuting the propositions of the Motekallamin, considers Creation, the Unity of God, the Attributes of God, the Soul, etc., and treats them in accordance with the theories of Aristotle to the extent in which these latter do not conflict with religion. For example, while accepting the teachings of Aristotle upon matter and form, he pronounces against the eternity of matter. Nor does he accept Aristotle's theory that God can have a knowledge of universals only, and not of particulars. If He had no knowledge of particulars, He would be subject to constant change. Maimonides argues: "God perceives future events before they happen, and this perception never fails Him. Therefore there are no new ideas to present themselves to Him. He knows that such and such an individual does not yet exist, but that he will be born at such a time, exist for such a period, and then return into non-existence. When then this individual comes into being, God does not learn any new fact; nothing has happened that He knew not of, for He knew this individual, such as he is now, before his birth" ("Moreh," i. 20). While seeking thus to avoid the troublesome consequences certain Aristotelian theories would entail upon religion, Maimonides could not altogether escape those involved in Aristotle's idea of the unity of souls; and herein he laid himself open to the attacks of the orthodox.

=== Averroism ===
{{further|Averroism}}
Ibn Roshd (or Ibn Rushd or [[Averroes]]), the contemporary of Maimonides, closes the philosophical era of the Arabs. The boldness of this great commentator of Aristotle aroused the full fury of the orthodox, who, in their zeal, attacked all philosophers indiscriminately, and had all philosophical writings committed to the flames. The theories of Ibn Roshd do not differ fundamentally from those of [[Ibn Bajjah]] and [[Ibn Tufail]], who only follow the teachings of Ibn Sina and Al-Farabi. Like all Arabic Peripatetics, Ibn Roshd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world&amp;mdash;hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter. But while Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and other Arab philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on religious dogmas, Ibn Roshd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, "Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation ex nihilo (Munk, "Mélanges," p.&amp;nbsp;444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Ibn Sina declared&amp;mdash;in order to make concessions to the orthodox&amp;mdash;but also a necessity. Driven from the Arabian schools, Arabic philosophy found a refuge with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men&amp;mdash;such as the Tibbons, Narboni, Gersonides&amp;mdash;joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Roshd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil [[Joseph ben Judah]], spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Roshd's commentary.

== Influence of Andalusi mystical theosophy==
Vahid Brown states that the cross-fertilizaton among Jewish and Islamic philosophical mysticism, including [[Kabbalah]] and [[Sufism]], in [[Al-Andalus]], [[Spain]] during its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]], apart from its impact on European [[Renaissance]], had a strong influence in later developments in both philosophies in the rest of the Jewish and Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Vahid (2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25594">The '''''Madhyamakālaṃkāra''''' is an eighth-century [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist text]], believed to have been originally composed in [[Sanskrit]] by [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788),&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, James (2008). "Śāntarakṣita", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). Source: [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/saantarak-sita/] (accessed: February 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; which is extant in [[Central Tibetan language|Tibetan]]. The Tibetan text was translated from the Sanskrit by [[Surendrabodhi]] ({{bo|w=lha dbang byang chub}}) and [[Jnanasutra|Jñānasūtra]].

=={{anchor|Nature of text}}Text==
In the short-verse text of the ''Madhyamakālaṃkāra'', Śāntarakṣita details his [[two truths doctrine|philosophical synthesis]] of the conventional truth of [[Yogacara]] with the ultimate truth of the [[Madhyamaka]], assisted by [[Buddhist logic]] with a lengthy discussion of the "[[neither one nor many]]" argument.

===Dharmic dialogue===
The ''Madhyamakālaṃkāra'' is a brief [[doxography|doxographic]] reprise, a critical thumbnail survey of the philosophical [[history of Buddhism]] and its inter- and intra-Dharmic dialogue of medieval [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raul Corazzon|Corazzon, Raul]] (February, 2009).

Source: [http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/historical_interaction/pt3/history_cultures_16.html] (accessed: June 6, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Though somewhat lyrical, it is a summary and a key to his encyclopedic ''[[Tattvasamgraha]]''. It has the fullness of the [[Sutrayana]] and [[Mahayana]] traditions' development in its place of origin before the Buddhist tradition of India was transposed by the cultures of the [[Far East]] (such as China and Japan) and elsewhere (such as [[Ceylon]] and [[Kashmir]]), where Buddhism was already flourishing in culturally specific forms. The text refutes challenges of Buddhist systems and tenets from within the tradition, and is a pedagogical discourse on the development of the [[Yana (Buddhism)|yana]]; the philosophical challenges posed by the non-Buddhist [[Indian religions|religions]] and non-Dharmic traditions of India, and crystallizes a dialectical sophistication of [[Indian logic]] and the clarity of debate expected of a [[Khenpo]] of [[Nalanda]] [[Vihara]]. The text was seminal in the tradition of [[Samye]] which became known as a [[Nyingma]] institution in contrast to the emergent [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] traditions of [[Atisha]]'s (980-1054) translation phase. It documents the Nyingma [[View (Buddhism)|view]] of the [[Two Truths]], making it a canonical work. Although the text was marginalized due to the rise of the [[Prasaṅgika]] subschool of [[Mādhyamaka]], it was revived by [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham's]] (1846–1912) 1876 ''Commentary''.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor, Thomas H.

The ''Madhyamakālaṃkāra'' and its tradition survived the destruction of [[Nalanda]] [[Vihara]] and the ascendancy of the [[Muslim]] empire in India during the 13th-century eclipse of Buddhism through its transplantation to the [[Tibetan Plateau]] by Śāntarakṣita at the request of [[Trisong Detsen]]. It was taught at the [[Samye]] Monastery, which was safeguarded by the [[Himalayas]].

According to Doctor (2004: p.ix), the ''Madhyamakālaṃkāra''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;nbsp;... is renowned as the principal scripture of the Yogācāramadhyamaka. Although masters such as [[Ārya Vimuktisena]] (6th century CE) are said to have set forth their presentations of the Madhyamaka in a way that employs the assertions specific to the [[Vijñānavāda]], Śāntarakṣita was the one to found an actual system in which the ultimate freedom from constructs (Sanskrit ''niṣprapañca'', Tibetan ''spros bral'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/spros_bral|title=Spros bral|website=Dharma Dictionary|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is realized through insight into the non-existence of any external matter (''bāhyārtha'', ''phyi don'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/phyi_don|title=Phyi don|website=Dharma Dictionary|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This synthesis of Yogācāra and Madhyamaka, the two great currents of Mahāyāna philosophy, the principles of the vast and the profound as originally set forth by [[Asaṇga]] (fl. 4th century) and [[Nāgārjuna]] (possibly 150-250 CE) respectively, is also characterized by its use of the [[pramāṇa]] methods of [[Dignāga]] (5th-6th century) and [[Dharmakīrti]] (6th-7th century) as integral steps towards the realization of the ultimate.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor, Thomas H.

=={{anchor|Apoha: negation of the opposite}}Logic==
[[Indian logic]] is primarily a study of inferences and their patterns. A [[pramana]] is a means of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, Jitendra Nath (1992). ''Reason and Tradition in Indian Thought: An Essay on the Nature of Indian Philosophical Thinking''. New York, USA: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-823960-2}}, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Indian logic was influenced by grammar, and Greek (or classical) logic was influenced by mathematics.&lt;ref name="Matilal, Bimal Krishna 1998 p.14"&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna (author), Ganeri, Jonardon (editor) &amp; (Tiwari, Heeraman)(1998). ''The Character of Logic in India''. Albany, NY, USA: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3739-6}} (HC:acid free), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Vidyabhusana (1921), Randle (1930) and [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] (1930) used the terms "Indian logic" and "[[Buddhist logic]]".&lt;ref name="Matilal, Bimal Krishna 1998 p.14"/&gt;

The [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (2005: p.&amp;nbsp;157) rendered Mipham's advice that Buddhist logic is required to engage the text:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In general, it is important to be familiar with the teachings on probative signs and reasoning and, within that context, the notions of other-elimination, the three conditions of the correct sign, and all the methods of proof or refutation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the doctrine of ''apoha'' (''gshan-sel-wa'' in Tibetan), an entity is defined as the negation of its opposite; a cow is not a non-cow.

==={{anchor|Trairūpya: the triple-character of inferential sign}}Trairūpya: the three conditions===
[[Dignaga]] formulated [[trairūpya|three conditions]] (Sanskrit: ''trairūpya''; Wylie: tshul-gsum) which a logical sign or mark (''linga'') must fulfill:
#It should be present in the case or object under consideration (''pakṣa'')  
#It should be present in a similar case (homologue; ''sapakṣa'')  
#It should not be present in a dissimilar case (heterologue; ''vipakṣa'')  
When a ''linga'' is identified, there are three possibilities; the sign may be present in all, some or none of the ''sapakṣas'' or ''vipakṣas''. Identifying a sign assumes that it is present in the ''pakṣa'', and the first condition is met. Dignaga combined these in his ''[[Hetucakra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna (author), Ganeri, Jonardon (editor) &amp; (Tiwari, Heeraman)(1998). ''The Character of Logic in India''. Albany, NY, USA: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-3739-6}} (HC:acid free), p.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Commentary on Difficult Points'' (Sanskrit: Madhyamālaṃkāra-panjika, Wylie: dbu ma rgyan gyi dka' 'grel) was written by [[Kamalaśīla]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 713-763) Another commentary, ''Remembering The Ornament of the Middle Way'' (Wylie: dbu ma rgyan gyi brjed byang), was written by [[Gyaltsab Je]] (1364–1432). Lobzang Dongak Chökyi Gyatso (Wylie: blo bzang mdo sngags chos kyi rgya mtsho, 1903–1957), also known as Tulku Sungrap, wrote the commentary translated into English as ''The Sword to Cut Through False Views'' (Wylie: dbu ma rgyan gyi mchan 'grel nyung ngu lta ngan gcod pa'i ral gri).&lt;ref&gt;Rigpa Shedra (December, 2008).

===Ju Mipham===
The title of Ju Mipham's ''Commentary'' (Wylie: dbu ma rgyan gyi rnam bshad 'jam dbyangs bla ma dgyes pa'i zhal lung) conveys Mipham's [[Samaya|precepts]] in honouring the dictate of his guru (''rtsa ba'i bla ma''), [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] (1820–1892), who charged him with the commentary. [[Manjushri]] is used as a term of respect for the scholarship and understanding beyond letters and words of his [[Rimé movement|Rimé]] teacher. [[Suchness]] is the revelation of Mipham's [[vajrayana]] from the Padmakara Translation Group's [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] (2005: p.&amp;nbsp;382):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Seeing that there are many reasons for expounding the Madhyamakalankara, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, our incomparable guide, unbounded in his kindness, whose very name I hardly dare to pronounce, who is the very personification of the compassion of the abbot Bodhisattva, of the master Padmasambhava, and of King Trisongdetsen, who is the sovereign among the learned and accomplished, who is supreme Manjushri appearing in the form of a monk in saffron robes, and whose renown fills the world, gave to me the Indian and Tibetan commentaries on the Madhyamakalankara, asking me to study them well and to compose a commentary. And as his diamondlike injunction came down upon my head, I earnestly gave myself to the task.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shantarakshita]] (author);[[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005). ''The Adornment of the Middle Way: Shantarakshita's Madhyamakalankara with commentary by Jamgön Mipham.'' Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-59030-241-9}} (alk. paper), p.382&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ringu Tulku ''et al.'' (2006: pp.&amp;nbsp;193–194), in their survey of the Rimé movement, convey the importance of Mipham's ''Commentary'' to the [[Nyingma]]pa and their view of the [[Two Truths]] doctrine in light of the Svatantrika Madhyamaka ("those who assert the ultimate is the illusory nature") view and its [[Shentong]] Madhyamaka refinement as qualifying the [[Prasangika]] Madhyamaka ("those who make no assertions"):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then, for the ultimate truth, there are two schools of Madhyamaka: those who assert the ultimate is the illusory nature, and those who make no assertions. To explain further, the first says that the illusory nature is established when the perceiver of an object experiences a perception of that object as being unreal. This view was put forth by Kamalashila, Shantarakshita, and other proponents of the Svatantrika Madhyamaka school. Their view is clearly explained in Mipham Jamyang Gyatso's commentary on Shantarakshita's 'Ornament of the Middle Way.' This commentary by Mipham Rinpoche is often considered the most important philosophical text of the Nyingma lineage in Tibet, particularly for those who follow Mipham Rinpoche's understanding of the Shentong Madhyamaka view.&lt;ref&gt;Ringu Tulku (author, translator); Helm, Ann (co-translator)(2006).

=={{anchor|'Neither one nor many' (gcig du 'bral ba'i gtan tshigs)}}Neither one nor many==
The [[mindstream]] of [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] is one application of the argument, [[neither one nor many]]. 'Neither one nor many' is an application of the third function of the [[catuṣkoṭi]] of Indian logic]]. [[Jeffrey Hopkins|Hopkins]] and Napper (1983, 1996: p.&amp;nbsp;160), in ''Meditation on Emptiness'', discussed whether or not a series may be considered a unit:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When a continuum of a lifetime is sought in the individual moments of the continuum, it cannot be found. The continuum is not the individual moments nor their composite; if a continuum were a composite of the moments, either each moment would be a continuum or there would be no separate moments.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey (Ed.) &amp; [[Elizabeth Napper|Napper, Elizabeth]] (Assistant Ed.) (1983, 1996). ''Meditation on Emptiness''. Somerville, Massachusetts, USA: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-110-6}}, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mindstream===
In the ninth [[shloka]] of the ''Madhyamālaṃkāra'', Śāntarakṣita refutes personal singularity; "person" is conveyed a continuum understood as "neither one nor many". The [[Padmakara Translation Group]] qualifies the word "person" (Wylie: gang zag), extending it to all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]].&lt;ref name="Middle Way p.180"&gt;[[Shantarakshita]] (author); [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]] (commentator); [[Padmakara Translation Group]] (translators)(2005).

The conceptual mind refers to this as a 'self', a 'man' and so forth.

Based on the mental observation of those [instants], wandering beings speak of the self, the individual, and so forth, and [it is those instants] that are included in the stream of being. Thus they think, "I!" without any examination or investigation.&lt;ref name="Doctor, Thomas H. 2004 p.219"/&gt;}}

==Five assertions==
Ju Mipham made five assertions not unique to Śāntarakṣita's view:&lt;ref name="padmakara122"&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.122-141&lt;/ref&gt;
# Objects (fully qualified objects of comprehension) are posited only with respect to things able to function.
# Consciousness in the absence of an object which knows and illuminates itself is uncommon.
# The external appears through (or due to) one's own mind and is considered mind-only.
# The ultimate is divided into enumerated and non-enumerated ultimates.
# In the enumerated ultimate, objects found by individual valid cognition are understood without contradiction.

==={{anchor|First assertion}}First===
In the first assertion, Śāntarakṣita makes the [[Sautrantika]] distinction that objects of cognition are of two kinds: abstract, theoretical mental objects (including generalities, like classes of objects and their names) and actual things, defined as things which function. Although the Sautantrika made that distinction for conventional and ultimate truth, Śāntarakṣita discards theoretical or general objects and discusses actual things as conventional truth. He incorporates Dharmakirti's cognition which analyzes conventionalities, connecting that with cognition which analyzes for ultimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Second assertion}}Second===
In the second assertion, a self-reflective awareness ([[svasaṃvedana]]) exists; consciousness can be aware of objects of cognition. This position was later critiqued by [[Je Tsongkhapa]] as implying that a self-reflective awareness is separate from objects of cognition. Ju Mipham later qualified its meaning; cognition is self-aware, not a separate material thing.&lt;ref&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) p.123&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:A grand view of Samye.jpg|thumb|alt=Corner of a large Buddhist monastery|Samye Monastery, founded by Shantaraksita]]

==={{anchor|Third assertion}}Third===
In the third assertion, the [[consciousness-only]] view of conventional appearances is the best way to progress. Still affirming the supremacy of the [[Madhyamaka]] school when students analyze for ultimacy, when relating to conventionalities the mind-only position is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.123-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Fourth assertion}}Fourth===
The fourth assertion distinguishes between the ultimate way of abiding established by the Madhyamaka method (the non-enumerated ultimate) and an approximate (enumerated) ultimate: a lesser, conventional understanding of the ultimate which leads to the non-enumerated ultimate.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita125"&gt;Śāntarakṣita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.125-135&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his explanation of why this is useful, Mipham quotes [[Gorampa]] (who references the [[Catuskoti#Four Extremes|four conceptual extremes]]) (Wylie: mtha' bzhi; Sanskrit: caturanta):
{{quote|The intellect of ordinary people, which investigates ultimate reality, cannot refute in a single stroke all four conceptual extremes. But by refuting these four extremes one after the other and by meditating properly, one reaches the [[Bhumi (Buddhism)|path of seeing]]. This is called the view that sees the dharmadatu.}}

To analyze the extremes of existence and non-existence, Ju Mipham advises students to contemplate and establish the lack of inherent existence and then contemplate the extreme of non-existence. In contemplating step by step and enumerating the conceptual extremes, a student progresses toward the ultimate. When all extremes have been analyzed, they reach the non-enumerative (true) ultimate.&lt;ref name="Shantarakshita125" /&gt;

==={{anchor|Fifth assertion}}Fifth===
In the fifth assertion, analysis of objects with respect to approximate (enumerated) ultimates does not create a problem of true establishment. A distinction can be made when analyzing for each case, including the two approaches to cognition (one for the conventional domain and the other to analyze for ultimacy) which are his additions to the [[Pramana]] tradition of valid cognition. Mipham uses this demonstration in his commentary to point out a problem with Je Tsongkhapa's approach of negating the predicate of "true establishment" instead of the object of perception, which is avoided in Śāntarakṣita's approach. Mipham also notes that many [[Prasaṅgika]] writers (similar to their [[Svatantrika]] counterparts) made positive assertions to move students closer to the ultimate view, pointing out that the distinction between Prasangika and Svatantrika lies in how students are taught about conventionalities and not in the consideration of ultimate truth. He concludes that Je Tsongkhapa, in making a distinction based on true establishment, proposes a Svatantrika rather than a Prasangika approach.&lt;ref&gt;Shantarakshita &amp; Ju Mipham (2005) pp.135-147&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mihailo Đurić''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: Михаило Ђурић; 22 August 1925 &amp;ndash; 25 November 2011) was one of Serbia's most prominent philosophers.&lt;ref name=Vreme&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1021816|title=Profesor Mihailo Đurić (22. avgust 1925 – 25. novembar 2011)|date=2011-11-28|publisher=Vreme|language=Serbian|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a professor at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Law School]] and member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

Within the frame of [[ancient]] Greek culture, he studied [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[politics]] and [[history]], but also modern [[political theory]] and [[ethics]]. A majority of his works are within the field of [[philosophy]] and method of [[sociology]], history of [[Politics|political]] [[Theory|theories]] and [[political science]]. In the past two decades, his work was mainly devoted to the study of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Heidegger]].

Đurić studied law, philosophy and classic philology in [[Belgrade]], where he obtained his PhD with the thesis on ''Ideas of the Natural Law in Greek Sophists'' (1954).&lt;ref name=Vreme/&gt; He was professor at Law School from 1954 until 1973, when, for political reasons, he was removed from the University. In 1954 he was appointed as Research Fellow at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|University of Belgrade's Law School]], where he was later promoted to Assistant Professor in 1957, Associate Professor in 1964, and full Professor in 1969. He taught History of Political Theory, General Sociology and Methodology of Social Science.&lt;ref name=Official&gt;[https://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Clanstvo/Biografije/MihailoDjuric.pdf Mihailo Djurić biography, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
In 1972, Mihailo Đurić was expelled from the University, tried&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/17/archives/yugoslavia-bans-serbian-journal-quarterly-criticized-jailing-of.html|title=YUGOSLAVIA BANS SERBIAN JOURNAL; Quarterly Criticized Jailing of 'Nationalist' Professor|last=Anderson|first=Raymond H.|date=17 September 1972|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=11 April 2011|quote=...Mihajlo Djuric of the Belgrade University Law School to two years in prison on a variety of charges, including opposition to a decentralization of authority ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to 9 months in prison for his criticism of the 1971 Constitutional Amendments as well as his opposition to demolishing of the [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Petar Petrović Njegoš]] chapel on [[Lovćen|Mount Lovćen]].&lt;ref name="Miller2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Nick|title=The nonconformists: culture, politics, and nationalism in a Serbian intellectual circle, 1944-1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCgLcMmhQBAC&amp;pg=PA202|accessdate=11 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-13-5|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion at the Law Faculty was delivered in a public discussion within the University building and the article on Njegoš in a literary review written in opposition to the destruction.

During his trial and imprisonment, many public figures expressed their opposition to then Yugoslav communist government, among them philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]].

After the release from prison Đurić was formally employed at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, from 1974 until 1989, when he returned to University. From his release from prison (1972), he was also a visiting professor at the Universities of [[Vienna]], [[Berlin]] and [[Augsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Jasna Dragovic-Soso: Saviours of the Nation: Serbia's Intellectual Opposition and the Revival of Nationalism, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, Oct 9, 2002 page 44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, after rehabilitation, he returned to Law School. For many years Đurić was a member of the Institute of Philosophy at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]], the Scientific Council of which he chaired from 1986 until 1998.

==Nietzsche and Heidegger==
Starting from 1980s, Đurić's writings both in Serbian and in German fundamentally contributed to our understanding of the works of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Heidegger]] and the crucial link between these two philosophers. While his ''Nietzsche and the Metaphysics'' (1984) and ''The Challenge of Nihilism'' (1986) concentrate mainly on Nietzsche, the ''On the Need of Philosophy Today: Philosophy between East and West'' is mainly a book about Heidegger and his reading of Nietzsche.

In [[metaphysics]], the '''multiple occupancy view''' (m.o.) is a particular analysis of fission cases, which claims to be at least ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' possible, if not actually true of real cases of fission. Imagine an amoeba which undergoes symmetrical fission into two sister amoebae (call them B and C). We tend to think that before fission there was one amoeba (call it A), but what has happened to it? It has not died, for death is a biological state, and there are no dead amoebae lying around after the fission! In fact, there is more life after the fission than there was before, i.e. two live amoebae instead of just one. Has A somehow ceased to exist without dying? Is A still around, and identical with either B or C? It cannot be identified with both B and C, for identity is a [[transitive relation]], and B is certainly not the same amoeba as C. Yet, the fission was symmetrical, so neither B nor C has any more or less claim to be A than the other. This is the problem. We seem to be forced to say that A has ceased to exist, but the m.o. view provides us with another option, consistent with all of the above considerations. The m.o. view is that there were two distinct but coincident amoebae before fission, occupying the same body of matter, but which diverge upon fission into the same two distinct, but no longer coincident, amoebae. The number of amoebae hasn't increased, i.e. there were two before fission, and there are the same two after fission. The amoeba has "divided without multiplying"! The m.o. view has also been applied to hypothetical cases of symmetrical fission involving persons. On the face of it, the m.o. view contravenes the principle of [[identity of indiscernibles]]. However, one and the same physical object can be a proper part of two or more distinct objects (e.g., a road intersection is part of two distinct roads), which leads to [[four-dimensionalism]], whereby, for example, an amoeba at a time (amoeba stage) is a temporal part of an amoeba extended in time, i.e., objects have temporal parts.

In 1893 Swami Vivekananda went to United States to [[Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of the World's Religions (1893)|join Parliament of the World's Religions]]. There he got overwhelming success and public attention.{{sfn|Beversluis|2011|p=58}}{{sfn|Pandya|2008|p=121}} From 1893 to 1896, Vivekananda conducted a series of public lectures, religious classes, discourses in different states of United States and England. In the beginning of 1895, upon the requests of his disciples and followers of New York, he agreed to conduct a session of private classes for some of his selected disciples at the [[Thousand Island Park]], New York. The session of private classes ran from mid-June to early August 1895. After finishing his works, he moved to New York.&lt;ref name="Sheean p346—347"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sheean|2005|pp=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michelis p121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Michelis|2005|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IT p11—23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vivekananda|Waldo|1910|pp=11–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''My Play is Done''' (excerpt)
&lt;poem&gt;
Ever rising, ever falling with the waves of time,
            still rolling on I go
From fleeting scene to scene ephemeral,
            with life's currents' ebb and flow.
Oh! I am sick of this unending force;
            these shows they please no more.
This ever running, never reaching,
            nor e'en a distant glimpse of shore!
From life to life I'm waiting at the gates,
            alas, they open not.
Dim are my eyes with vain attempt
            to catch one ray long sought.
On little life's high, narrow bridge
            I stand and see below
The struggling, crying, laughing throng.
            For what? No one can know.
&lt;/poem&gt;
* Read '''[[:wikisource:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 6/Writings: Prose and Poems(Original and Translated)/My Play is Done|the full poem]]''' at [[Wikisource]]

== Synopsis ==
In this poem Vivekananda narrates and tries to explain the elements of human life from the aspect of philosophy and [[Vedanta]]. He observes the ''[[Bhavacakra]]'', the unending waves of ''[[Saṃsāra]]'', which are always rising and always falling. He confesses that he is sick of this unending force which is never reaching anywhere, nor can he see a distant glimpse of the shore. The poet feels, it is impossible to please the unending waves of time and life.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti p109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vivekananda 1895"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vivekananda|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He fails to understand the reason and identify the destination of all the joys, sorrows, tears and struggling of men. He thinks not only he, but no one knows the answer of the question. He realizes, a man in this world has only two choices— either forgetting everything and attempting to enjoy the world as it is, where the enjoyment will be momentary and in every step he will face obstacles, or he may attempt to find the truth.  When the poet chooses the second path and strives to find the truth, he discovers the whole world, ''(Samsara)'' is like "floating bubble", where everything is "hollow" including name, fame, life and death.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti p109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vivekananda 1895"/&gt;

Then, the poet confesses that he is tired, tired of his works, tired of the non-understandable unending ebb and flow of the life and praying to God, calling Him as "Mother", who sent the poet to the world, to provide him refuge. He prays to Mother to rescue him from the world of false aspirations, delusion and cycles to life and death, as he thinks, his play (i.e. work) is done and he should be given freedom now.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti p109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vivekananda 1895"/&gt;

[[File:Laika ac Juche Tower (12107747863).jpg|thumb|The [[Juche Tower|''Juche'' Tower]] and ''On the Juche Idea'' were both introduced for the 70th [[Day of the Sun|birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung]], whose ''[[Juche]]'' philosophy from thereon was exclusively interpreted by [[Kim Jong-il]].]]
'''''On the Juche Idea: Treatise Sent to the National Seminar on the Juche Idea Held to Mark the 70th Birthday of the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, 31 March 1982''''' ({{Korean|hangul=주체 사상 에 대하여|mr=Chuch'e sasang e taehayŏ|context=north}}) is a treatise attributed to [[North Korean leader]] [[Kim Jong-il]] on the [[North Korea]]n ''[[Juche]]'' ideology. It is considered the most authoritative work on ''Juche''.

The work, although probably ghostwritten for him,&lt;ref name="Myers2015"/&gt; legitimized Kim as the sole ''bona fide'' interpreter of the ideology. The treatise systemizes Kim Jong-il and his father [[Kim Il-sung]]'s thought on the ''Juche'' philosophy. The treatise marks ''Juche''{{'}}s departure from the [[Dialectical materialism|materialism]] of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and posits the [[Class consciousness|consciousness of the massess]] as dependent on the working class leader.

According to Kim Jong-il, the ''Juche'' idea is composed of a philosophical principle, socio-historical principles, and guiding principles. The philosophical principle can be summarized with Kim Il-sung's maxim that "man is the master of everything and decides everything."{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=386}} The socio-historical principles entail that the working masses are the subject of history. The guiding principles are: independent stance, creative method, and giving precedence to ideological consciousness. Emphasis on independence in particular has given raise to Kim's ''[[Songun]]'', or military first, politics.

== Background ==
''On the Juche Idea'' is one of Kim Jong-il's major writings on ''Juche''&lt;ref name="DavidWest2011" /&gt; and considered the most authoritative work on it.{{sfn|Kwak|Joo|2009|p=19}} It is a standard textbook on the subject.&lt;ref name="jsto_Nort1"&gt;{{cite journal| title = North Korea in 1982: Continuing Revolution under Kim Jong Il| author = Rinn-Sup Shinn | date = 1983 | doi = 10.2307/2644331 | journal=Asian Survey|volume=23|number=1|page = 103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise is a systematization of both [[President of North Korea|President]] [[Kim Il-sung]] and Kim Jong-il's thought on ''Juche'' philosophy{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=386}}{{sfn|Hale|2002|p=301}} and offers the most comprehensive account of ''Juche''.{{sfn|Kwak|Joo|2009|p=19}} Kim Il-sung's thought in particular began to be formulated as an original philosophy from the 1970s onward.{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=386}} ''On the Juche Idea'' was sent to the national seminar on the ''Juche'' idea&lt;ref name="DavidWest2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=David-West|first=Alzo|date=January 2011|title=Between Confucianism and Marxism-Leninism: Juche and the Case of Chŏng Tasan|journal=Korean Studies|volume=35|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/74541165/between-confucianism-marxism-leninism-juche-case-ch-ng-tasan|page=105|doi=10.1353/ks.2011.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 31 March 1982 held on the occasion of the 70th [[Day of the Sun|birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung]] (15 April).{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=386}} The occasion was also honored with the unveiling of the [[Juche Tower|''Juche'' Tower]] in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name="RandallRandall2004"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Annie J.|editor-last=Randall|title=Music, Power, and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLqTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113|date=22 December 2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1-135-94691-3|pages=113, 116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the treatise, Kim Jong-il links the birth of the ''Juche'' idea to Kim Il-sung's personal history as a guerrilla fighter during the [[anti-Japanese struggle]].&lt;ref name="scho_Lee:"&gt;{{cite journal| title = The Political Philosophy of Juche| last= Lee | first=Grace |journal=Stanford Journal of East Asian Affairs | volume=3|number=1|date = 2003 | accessdate = 11 September 2015 | url = https://web.stanford.edu/group/sjeaa/journal3/korea1.pdf| page = 109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On the Juche Idea'' thus furthered [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality]].{{sfn|Hale|2002|p=302}} Publishing the treatise helped Kim Jong-il to gain legitimacy,&lt;ref name="jsto_Nort2"&gt;{{cite journal| title = North Korea in 1983: Transforming 'The Hermit Kingdom'?| author = Young Whan Kihl  | date = 1984 | doi=10.2307/2644170|journal=Asian Survey|volume=24|number=1|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly emphasizing his intellectual prowess.&lt;ref name="Mathesius2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Kim Jong-un's Catchphrase? | last = Mathesius | first = Konrad  | work = NK News| date = 7 June 2011 | accessdate = 3 August 2016 | url = https://www.nknews.org/2011/06/kim-jong-uns-catchphrase/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of writing Kim Jong-il was working as the ideological chief of the country on behalf of his father.&lt;ref name="dbc._Doln"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolnośląska Digital Library – North Korea and its special economic zones: Re-establishing networks with the world economy?

Kim Jong-il explains that ''Juche'' is a departure from [[Marxism–Leninism]] rather than simply a reinterpretation of it. According to Kim, ''Juche'' offers not only an "independent and creative" direction to the Korean revolution, but also establishes a new era for human history.{{sfn|Kwak|Joo|2009|p=19}} It is [[idealist]] as opposed to the [[Dialectical materialism|materialism]] of [[Marxism]].{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=216}} The work is considered somewhat abstract in style.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=217}}

In comparison to Kim Il-sung's writings, Kim Jong-il pays particular attention to [[Class consciousness|consciousness]] and the concept of the leader. These two are often linked.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=216}} According to [[Charles K. Armstrong]], the main message of the treatise is that "regardless of material circumstances, the masses owe unquestioning obedience to the Great Leader, who alone can bring the masses to consciousness", adding that the "message would be extremely useful for the North Korean state in the difficult years ahead", referring to the [[death of Kim Il-sung]] and the [[North Korean famine]] in the 1990s, soon after the publication of ''On the Juche Idea''.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=217}}

In ''On the Juche Idea'', Kim Jong-il divides ''Juche'' into three components: the philosophical principle, the socio-historical principles, and the guiding principles of  the ''Juche'' idea.{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=386}}

=== Philosophical principle ===
The philosophical principle entails that ''Juche'' is a [[Anthropocentrism|man-centered]] philosophy. Man has independence, {{Interlanguage link multi|Creativity (Juche)|ko|3=창조성 (주체사상)|lt=creativity}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Consciousness (Juche)|ko|3=의식성 (주체사상)|lt=consciousness}}, which places man at the center of the world. This is described by the maxim coined by Kim Il-sung in a 1972 interview with Japanese journalists: "man is the master of everything and decides everything."{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=386}} Man transforms the world{{sfn|Hale|2002|p=301}} and embodies ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Chajusŏng|ko|3=자주성 (주체사상)}}'', or independence and autonomy.{{sfn|Hale|2002|p=302}} By putting man at the center, Kim Jong-il denies the existence of any supernatural power, although the ''Juche'' philosophy itself can be said to have [[Political religion|quasi-religious]] elements.{{sfn|Hale|2002|p=301}}

=== Socio-historical principles ===
The socio-historical principles of ''Juche'' can be summarized as follows: the working masses are the subject of history.{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=386}} Human history is the struggle of the masses to realize their independence and defend it. Man's socio-historical mission is to transform both nature and society.{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=387}} Here Kim departs from [[Marxism–Leninism]] by primarily setting man against nature rather than the [[proletariat]] against the [[bourgeois]] class.{{sfn|Kwak|Joo|2009|p=20}}

=== Guiding principles ===
There are three guiding principles in ''Juche'':
#First, ''independent stance'' means ''Juche'' in ideology, independence in politics, [[Autarky|self-sufficiency in economy]] and self-reliance in defence.{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=387}} These four aspects of the independent stance can be already found in Kim Il-sung's 1965 speech given in [[Indonesia]], ''[[On Socialist Construction and the South Korean Revolution in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]''.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=216}} Even though ''On the Juche Idea'' mentions economy, it is not given precedence. Words like "development" and "growth" are more often used to refer to ideology rather than economy.&lt;ref name="Kivimäki2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kivimäki|first=Timo|title=The Long Peace of East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssmaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4|date=28 May 2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|location=Farnham|isbn=978-1-4724-2229-3|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, noting that an economy built on "self-reliance does not mean building an economy in isolation", Kim does hint at limited economic reforms. Sure enough, a law on joint-ventures was passed in 1984.&lt;ref name="dbc._Doln" /&gt;
#The second principle, ''creative method'', means that all problems arising in the revolution and construction are to be solved by relying on the creativity of the masses.{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=387}}
#The third and final guiding principle is giving ''precedence to ideological consciousness'' over all other work.{{sfn|Kim|2001|p=387}}

== Legacy ==
''On the Juche Idea'' has been since used as a justification for Kim Jong-il's ''[[Songun]]'', or army-first, politics. The justification can be found in an aspect of one of the guiding principles of ''Juche'', which Kim has "elevated": self-reliance in defence.{{sfn|Kwak|Joo|2009|p=35}} Kim went on to publish "The Workers' Party of Korea Is a ''Juche''-type Revolutionary Party which Inherited the Glorious Tradition of the DIU" in October 1982 and focusing in it more on Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=217}}

'''Otto Bauer''' (5 September 1881 – 4 July 1938) was an [[Austria]]n [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrat]] who is considered one of the leading thinkers of the left-socialist [[Austro-Marxism|Austro-Marxist]] grouping. He was also an early inspiration for both the [[New Left]] movement and [[Eurocommunism]] in their attempt to find a "Third way" to [[democratic socialism]].

==Life==
Bauer was born in [[Vienna]]. Having studied at the [[University of Vienna]], he finished his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Law in 1906 and published his first book, ''Die Sozialdemokratie und die Nationalitätenfrage'', in 1907. Although he was politically active during his studies, his gradual rise in the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] began after he had finished his doctoral studies. He founded ''Der Kampf'', the theoretical journal of the party in 1907 and between 1907 and 1914 he was secretary of the party. As one of Austria's leading "left" socialists,&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, J.M. ''Who's Who In World War One''. New York: Taylor and Francis e-library, 2002. p 17. (Accessed via Google Books 2/21/11.)&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer was able to establish himself as a likely successor to [[Viktor Adler]] as party leader.

Bauer served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was captured on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] in the early months of the [[First World War]]. He spent three years as a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Russia]], returning to Austria in 1917. After Viktor Adler's death in 1918, Bauer became leader of the Austrian Social Democratic Party. From November 1918 to July 1919 the Austrian Social Democrats formed a coalition government with the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] and Otto Bauer was appointed [[Foreign Minister of Austria|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].

Despite his Marxist socialism, he had [[Pan-Germanism|pan-Germanic]] and [[nationalism|nationalist ideas]] (he negotiated with the Weimar government an eventual accession of Austria into Germany by March 1919 during the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Revolution]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/03/06/97080406.pdf AUSTRIA WILL JOIN GERMANY SPEEDILY -  Teutonic Union Will Be Proclaimed as Soon as Details Are Completed.

When [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], with the assistance of elements of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] and the ''[[Heimwehr]]'', installed an authoritarian, [[corporatism|corporatist]] dictatorship in 1933, the activities of the Austrian Social Democrats were severely curtailed. Following the Social Democrats' [[Austrian Civil War|failed uprising]] in February, 1934, Otto Bauer was forced into exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Bauer died of heart failure in [[Paris]] on 4 July 1938, aged 56, just four months after Austria had become part of the Nazi [[Third Reich]].

His sister, Ida Bauer, was a patient of [[Sigmund Freud]], who published a famous case study about her using the pseudonym [[Dora (case study)|Dora]].

'''Pandeism''' (or '''pan-deism''') is a [[Theology|theological]] [[doctrine]] first delineated in the 18th century which combines aspects of [[pantheism]] with aspects of [[deism]].&lt;ref name="Lataster"&gt;{{cite book

Pandeism views the entire universe as being from God and now the universe is the entirety of God, but the universe at some point in time will fold back into one single being which is God Himself that created all. Pandeism raises the question as to why would God create a universe and then abandon it? As this relates to pantheism, it raises the question of how did the universe come about what is its aim and purpose?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as to pantheism, the origin and purpose of the universe.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote = As with Panentheism, Pantheism is derived from the Greek: '[[wikt:pan-|pan]]'= all and '[[God|theos]]' = God, it literally means "God is All" and "All is God". Pantheist purports that everything is part of an all-inclusive, indwelling, intangible God; or that the Universe, or nature, and God are the same. Further review helps to accentuate the idea that natural law, existence, and the Universe which is the  sum total of all that is, was, and shall be, is represented in the theological principle of an abstract 'god' rather than an individual, creative Divine Being or Beings of any kind. This is the key element which distinguishes them from Panentheists and Pandeists. As such, although many religions may claim to hold Pantheistic elements, they are more commonly Panentheistic or Pandeistic in nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word pandeism is a [[hybrid word|hybrid]] [[blend word|blend]] of the [[root (linguistics)|root words]] pantheism and deism, combining {{lang-grc|πᾶν|[[wikt:pan-|pan]]|[[The All|all]]}} with {{lang-la|[[deus]]}} which means "[[god]]".

|quote=Some of us think that postmodernity represents a similar change of dominant worldviews, one which could turn out to be just as singular as modernity by being a stunning amalgam of James and Weber. If we are correct, then the changed attitudes, assumptions, and values might work together to change ways of life which in turn transform our geographies of mind and being, that is, both the actual physical landscapes and the mental valuescapes we inhabit. One increasingly common outcome of this ongoing transformation, itself a symptom perhaps of post-industrial secular societies, is the movement away from self-denial toward a denial of the supernatural. This development promises to fundamentally alter future geographies of mind and being by shifting the locus of causality from an exalted Godhead to the domain of Nature. How this Nature is ultimately defined has broad repercussions for the, at times, artificial distinction between religious and secular worldviews. For Levine (2011), "secularism is a positive, not a negative, condition, not a denial of the  world of spirit and of religion, but an affirmation of the world we're living in now ... such a world is capable of bringing us to the condition of 'fullness' that religion has always promised" (Levine quoted in Wood 2011). For others, this "fullness" is present in more religious-oriented pantheistic or pandeistic belief systems with, in the latter case, the inclusion of God as the ever unfolding expression of a complex universe with an identifiable beginning but no teleological direction necessarily present.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ancient world===
[[File:Xenophanes in Thomas Stanley History of Philosophy.jpg|thumb|right| Physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] wrote that 6th century BC philosopher [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] spoke as a pandeist in stating that there was one god which "abideth ever in the selfsame place, moving not at all" and yet "sees all over, thinks all over, and hears all over."]]
The earliest seeds of pandeism coincide with notions of [[monotheism]], which generally can be traced back to the [[Atenism]] of [[Akhenaten]], and the [[Babylonia]]n-era [[Marduk]]. Weinstein in particular identified the idea of primary matter derived from an original spirit as found by the [[ancient Egyptians]] to be a form of pandeism.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''[https://archive.org/details/WeinsteinWeltUndL Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis]'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 155: "So wird es sich wohl um eine Urmaterie in Verbindung mit einem Urgeist handeln, was der pandeisierenden Richtung der ägyptischen Anschauungen entspricht"; page 228: "Aber bei den Ägyptern soll sich der Pandeismus auch vollständiger ausgedrückt finden."&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein similarly found varieties of pandeism in the religious views held in China&lt;ref name="Weinstein-China"&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 121: "Es ist also nicht richtig, wenn die Anschauungen der Chinesen denen der Naturvölker gleichgesetzt werden, vielmehr gehören sie eigentlich dem Pandeismus statt dem Pananimismus, an, und zwar einem dualistischen."&lt;/ref&gt; (especially with respect to [[Taoism]] as expressed by [[Lao-Tze]]),&lt;ref name="Weinstein-Taoism"&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 234-235: "Pandeistische Andeutungen finden sich selbstverständlich auch bei vielen anderen Völkern. So könnte man den Taoismus der Chinesen, in der ihm von Lao-tse gegebenen Form, hierher rechnen, wenn er nicht auch dem Naturalismus zuzuzählen wäre, da bei ihm mehr die Natur als die Gottheit in den Vordergrund gestellt wird. Die Erwähnung an dieser Stelle muß genügen, zumal mit solchen Sätzen wie: "aus Tao ist alles hervorgegangen, in Tao kehrt alles zurück" nicht viel für unsere Frage anzufangen ist."&lt;/ref&gt; India, especially in the Hindu [[Bhagavad Gita]],&lt;ref name="Weinstein-India"&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 213: "Wir werden später sehen, daß die Indier auch den Pandeismus gelehrt haben. Der letzte Zustand besteht in dieser Lehre im Eingehen in die betreffende Gottheit, Brahma oder Wischnu. So sagt in der Bhagavad-Gîtâ Krishna-Wischnu, nach vielen Lehren über ein vollkommenes Dasein"; page 229: "Entschiedener tritt Pandeismus bei den Indiern hervor."&lt;/ref&gt; and among various [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] philosophers.

6th century BC philosopher [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] has also been considered a pandeistic thinker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pimdeklerk-palynology.eu/2500_yr_palaeoecology_-_de_Klerk_2017.pdf|title=2500 Years of Palaeoecology: A Note on the Work of Xenophanes of Colophon (Circa 570-475 BCE)|author=Pim de Klerk|publisher=Journal of Geography, Environment and Earth Science International|date=5 April 2017|quote=Xenophanes... wrote elaborately on his own religious views that were mainly of a pandeistic character as opposed to the dominant worshiping of multiple anthropomorphic gods of his times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein wrote that Xenophanes spoke as a pandeist in stating that there was one god which "abideth ever in the selfsame place, moving not at all" and yet "sees all over, thinks all over, and hears all over."&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 231: "Pandeistisch ist, wenn der Eleate Xenophanes (aus Kolophon um 580-492 v.

Chr.) herrühren soll, ist schon eine Verbindung mit dem Emanismus; Gott ist die Welt, insofern als diese aus seiner Substanz durch Verdichtung und Abkühlung entstanden ist und entsteht, und er sich strahlengleich mit seiner Substanz durch sie noch verbreitet. Daß Gott als feurig gedacht wird (jedoch auch als Atem oder Äther) ist dem Menschen entnommen, dessen Wärme sein Lebensprinzip bedeutet; eine Idee, die sich schon bei den ersten griechischen Philosophen und namentlich bei Heraklit findet. Der stoische Pandeismus ist namentlich darin ein erklärter Emanismus, daß auch die Götter sich nur als Äußerungen und Ausflüsse des Welt-Gott (Zeus) darstellen wie die Seelen. Und damit kam er der Volksreligion durchaus entgegen, die ja von einer Theogonie ausging. Da die Gottheit die ganze Welt durchstrahlt und ihrerseits ein Materielles ist, so war es ganz folgerichtig von den Stoikern, wenn sie auch den leblos scheinenden Körpern vom göttlichen Odem mitteilten; sie betrachteten die Eigenschaften der Körper als materiell und hauchartig."&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein also wrote that pandeism was especially expressed by the later students of the 'Platonic [[Pythagoreans]]' and the 'Pythagorean [[Platonists]].'&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 234: "Die späteren Schüler der platonisierenden Pythagoreer und der pythagorisierenden Platoniker schlossen sich zum Teil diesem Pandeismus an.

[[Religious studies]] professor, [[F. E. Peters]], however, found that "[w]hat appeared... at the center of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] tradition in philosophy, is another view of ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' that seems to owe little or nothing to the pan-vitalism or ''pan-deism'' that is the legacy of the [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===From medieval times to the Enlightenment===
Weinstein examines the philosophy of 9th century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], who proposed that "God has created the world out of his own being", and identifies this as a form of pandeism, noting in particular that Eriugena's vision of God was one which does not know what it is, and learns this through the process of existing as its creation.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 283-84: "[[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|Johannes Scotus Erigena]] (um das 9. Jahrhundert in Irland geboren) läßt in einer seiner mehreren Ansichten alles von Gott emaniert sein. Gottes Klarheit, welche mit Recht auch Dunkelheit genannt wird, breite sich über alles aus. Die ungeformte Materie soll nur das Unendliche bedeuten, welches, da es formlos sei, alle Formen in sich enthalte. Gott hat die Welt aus seinem eigenen Wesen gebildet. Jedes Geschöpf ist eine Theophanie, ein Sichoffenbarmachen Gottes. Gott sei an sich vorhanden wie ein Gedanke im Menschen bestehe; er manifestiere sich in der Welt durch sich selbst, wie ein Gedanke, der sich denkt, sich selbst zur Erkenntnis komme. So sei Gott ohne die Welt absolut negativ. Es klingt wie eine Blasphemie, wenn gesagt wird, Gott wisse nicht, was er sei, und er werde erst geschaffen mit der Schöpfung, indem er sich in seiner Schöpfung offenbart, die Schöpfung so aus Nichts hervorbringend. Das ist auch fast so abstrakt wie die indische Tad-Anschauung. Freilich bleibt es bei diesem absoluten, und ja auch nicht zu durchdringenden, Pandeismus nicht. Wie der Indier muß Scotus Gott doch etwas zuschreiben, Willen, und die Geschöpfe sind dann Willensakte. Der Wille ist persönlich als Emanation Gottes (als Christus) gedacht, wie wohl auch die Ursachen (zusammengefaßt als Heiliger Geist), die Scotus von Gott ausgehen läßt, Emanationen sind, und die Wirkungen, die wieder von ihnen ausgehen, Emanationen ihrer selbst darstellen."&lt;/ref&gt; In his great work, ''[[De divisione naturae]]'' (also called ''Periphyseon'', probably completed around 867 AD), Eriugena proposed that the nature of the universe is divisible into four distinct classes:

:1 – that which creates and is not created;
:2 – that which is created and creates;
:3 – that which is created and does not create;
:4 – that which neither is created nor creates.
 
The first stage is God as the ground or origin of all things; the second is the world of [[Platonic idealism|Platonic ideals]] or [[Theory of forms|forms]]; the third is the wholly physical manifestation of our Universe, which "does not create"; the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns to completeness with the additional knowledge of having experienced this world. A contemporary statement of this idea is that: "Since God is not a being, he is therefore not intelligible... This means not only that we cannot understand him, but also that he cannot understand himself. Creation is a kind of [[divine]] effort by God to understand himself, to see himself in a mirror."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremiah Genest]], ''[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/eriugena.html John Scottus Eriugena: Life and Works]'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; French journalist [[:fr:Jean-Jacques Gabut|Jean-Jacques Gabut]] agreed, writing that "a certain pantheism, or rather ''pandeism'', emerges from his work where Neo-Platonic inspiration perfectly complements the strict Christian orthodoxy."&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Jean-Jacques Gabut|Jean-Jacques Gabut]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=50FDDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;dq=pand%C3%A9isme&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiByZ3owbveAhULxVkKHQRbBscQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pand%C3%A9isme&amp;f=false Origines et fondements spirituels et sociologiques de la maçonnerie écossaise]'', 2017: ''Par ailleurs, un certain panthéisme, ou plutôt « pandéisme », se dégage de son œuvre où l'inspiration néoplatonicienne complète parfaitement la stricte orthodoxie chrétienne.'' ("Moreover, a certain pantheism, or rather ''pandeism'', emerges from his work where Neo-Platonic inspiration perfectly complements the strict Christian orthodoxy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinstein also found that thirteenth century [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] thinker [[Bonaventure]]—who championed the [[Platonic idealism|Platonic]] doctrine that ideas do not exist in ''rerum natura'', but as ideals exemplified by the [[Divine being|Divine Being]], according to which actual things were formed—showed strong pandeistic inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 303: "Andere Ganz- oder Halbmystiker, wie den Alanus (gegen 1200), seinerzeit ein großes Kirchenlicht und für die unseligen Waldenser von verhängnisvoller Bedeutung, den Bonaventura (1221 im Kirchenstaate geboren), der eine Reise des Geistes zu Gott geschrieben hat und stark pandeistische Neigungen zeigt, den Franzosen Johann Gersan (zu Gersan bei Rheims 1363 geboren) usf., übergehen wir, es kommt Neues nicht zum Vorschein."&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Nicholas of Cusa]], who wrote of the enfolding of creation in God and the unfolding of the divine human mind in creation, Weinstein wrote that he was, to a certain extent, a pandeist.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 306: "Er ist bis zu einem gewissen Grade Pandeist. Gott schafft die Welt nur aus sich (de nullo alio creat, sed ex se); indem er alles umfaßt, entfaltet er alles aus sich, ohne doch sich dabei irgend zu verändern."&lt;/ref&gt; And, as to [[Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont]], who had written ''A Cabbalistical Dialogue'' (Latin version first, 1677, in English 1682) placing matter and spirit on a continuum, and describing matter as a "coalition" of monads, Weinstein also found this to be a kind of pandeism.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 338: "Wie er die Seele stoisch betrachtet, so hat er sich im Grunde auch eine Art Pandeismus zurecht gelegt, indem Gott zwar von allen Dingen verschieden, aber doch nicht von allen Dingen abgetrennt oder geteilt sein soll."&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein found that pandeism was strongly expressed in the teachings of [[Giordano Bruno]], who envisioned a deity which had no particular relation to one part of the infinite universe more than any other, and was [[Immanence|immanent]], as present on Earth as in the Heavens, subsuming in itself the multiplicity of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 321: "Also darf man vielleicht glauben, daß das ganze System eine Erhebung des Physischen aus seiner Natur in das Göttliche ist oder eine Durchstrahlung des Physischen durch das Göttliche; beides eine Art Pandeismus. Und so zeigt sich auch der Begriff Gottes von dem des Universums nicht getrennt; Gott ist naturierende Natur, Weltseele, Weltkraft. Da Bruno durchaus ablehnt, gegen die Religion zu lehren, so hat man solche Angaben wohl umgekehrt zu verstehen: Weltkraft, Welt seele, naturierende Natur, Universum sind in Gott. Gott ist Kraft der Welt kraft, Seele der Weltseele, Natur der Natur, Eins des Universums. Bruno spricht ja auch von mehreren Teilen der universellen Vernunft, des Urvermögens und der Urwirklichkeit. Und damit hängt zu  sammen, daß für ihn die Welt unendlich ist und ohne Anfang und Ende; sie ist in demselben Sinne allumfassend wie Gott. Aber nicht ganz wie Gott. Gott sei in allem und im einzelnen allumfassend, die Welt jedoch wohl in allem, aber nicht im einzelnen, da sie Ja Teile in sich zuläßt."&lt;/ref&gt; This was reiterated by others including ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' editor [[Corey S. Powell]], who wrote that Bruno's [[cosmology]] was "a tool for advancing an animist or Pandeist theology."&lt;ref&gt;[[Corey S. Powell]], "[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/13/cosmos-giordano-bruno-response-steven-soter/#.Uy-qafldUdl Defending Giordano Bruno: A Response from the Co-Writer of 'Cosmos']", ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'', March 13, 2014: "Bruno imagines all planets and stars having souls (part of what he means by them all having the same "composition"), and he uses his cosmology as a tool for advancing an animist or Pandeist theology."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Sessions, "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/23/how-cosmos-bungles-the-history-of-religion-and-science.html How 'Cosmos' Bungles the History of Religion and Science]", ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', 03.23.14: "Bruno, for instance, was a 'pandeist', which is the belief that God had transformed himself into all matter and ceased to exist as a distinct entity in himself."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giordano Bruno Campo dei Fiori.jpg|thumb|left|Italian theologian [[Giordano Bruno]] was charged with heresy and burned at the stake for propounding what has been deemed by some commentators to be a pandeistic ideology.]]
In the 1820s to 1830s, pandeism received some mention in Italy. In 1834, publisher Giovanni Silvestri [[posthumous publication|posthumously published]] a volume of [[sermons]] of [[Italians|Italian]] Padre Filippo Nannetti di Bibulano (aka il Filippo Nani, Padre da Lojano; 1759–1829), who named pandeism as being among beliefs he condemned, railing against "Jews, Muslims, [[Gentiles]], [[Schism]]atics, [[Heretics]], [[Pandeists]], [[Deists]], and troubled, restless spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Padre Filippo Nannetti di Bibulano (aka il Filippo Nani, Padre da Lojano), in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4kZjAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=pandeisti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG05yUs8vJAhWuuYMKHfawCsYQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pandeisti&amp;f=false Sermons and Panegyrics of the Father Filippo Nani of Lojana]'', Giovanni Silvestri, publisher, 1834, p. 284, Sermon XVIII: Miracles: "Ma questa religione predestinta col taumaturgo segnale si trova ella nel mondo i' Dove? in qual gente? in qual lido? Nelle sinagoghe giudaiche, o nelle meschìte dell l'Asia? Nelle pagoda cinesi, o nella società di Ginevra? Giudei, Maomettani, Gentili, Scismatici, Eretici, Pandeisti, Deisti, geni torbidi, e inquieti." ("But this religion predestined by the thaumaturgist signal, where in the world is she? in which people? on which shores? In Jewish synagogues, or mosques of Asia? Pagoda in Chinese, or in society in Geneva? Jews, Muslims, Gentiles, Schismatics, Heretics, Pandeists, Deists, and troubled, restless spirits.")&lt;/ref&gt; Nannetti further specifically criticized pandeism, declaring, "To you, fatal Pandeist! the laws that create nature are contingent and mutable, not another being in substance with forces driven by motions and developments."&lt;ref&gt;Padre Filippo Nannetti di Bibulano (aka il Filippo Nani, Padre da Lojano), in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QqV75cGMYsoC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=pandeista&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9dfQUsTcMYvaoASCkoHYBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pandeista&amp;f=false Sermons and Panegyrics of the Father Filippo Nani of Lojana]'', Giovanni Silvestri, publisher, 1834, p. 286, Sermon XVIII: Miracles: "A te, fatal Pandeista! le leggi della creata natura son contingenti e mutabili; non altro essendo in sostanza che moti e sviluppi di forze motrici." ("To you, fatal Pandeist! the laws that create nature are contingent and mutable, not another being in substance with forces driven by motions and developments.")&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years thereafter came the 1838 publication of an anonymous treatise, ''Il legato di un vecchio ai giovani della sua patria'' ("The Legacy of an Old Man to the Young People of his Country"), whose author, discussing the theory of religion presented by [[Giambattista Vico]] a century earlier, mused that when man first saw [[meteor shower]]s, "his robust imagination recognized the effects as a cause, then deifying natural phenomena, he became a Pandeist, an instructor of Mythology, a priest, an Augur."&lt;ref&gt;''Il legato di un vecchio ai giovani della sua patria" ("The Legacy of an Old Man to the Young People of his Country"): "Il selvaggio Nomado ex lege arrestato nelle spelonche dallo spavento, e dall'ammirazione con l'imponente spettacolo delle meteore, per la prima volta rivolse sopra se stesso lo sguardo della debole ragione, conobbe un potere fuori di lui più colossale della sua erculea brutalità, e per la prima volta concepì un culto. La robusta immaginazione gli fe ravvisare gli effetti come causa, quindi deificando i fenomeni naturali divenne un Pandeista, un istitutore della Mitologia, un sacerdote, un Augure." ("The wild nomad (who lived outside the law) stopped in the caves with fear and admiration at the impressive meteor shower, for the first time saw that reason was powerless, experienced a most colossal power outside himself of his Herculean brutality, and for the first time he understood worship (or conceived of a cult). His robust imagination recognized the effects as a cause, then deifying natural phenomena, he became a Pandeist, an instructor of Mythology, a priest, an Augur.").&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Nannetti nor the 1838 author defines pandeism distinctly enough to cleanly distinguish it from pantheism, or possibly polytheism. But, again in 1838, another Italian, [[phrenologist]] [[Luigi Ferrarese]] in ''Memorie Riguardanti la Dottrina Frenologica'' ("Thoughts Regarding the Doctrine of Phrenology") critically described [[Victor Cousin]]'s philosophy as a doctrine which "locates reason outside the human person, declaring man a fragment of God, introducing a sort of spiritual pandeism, absurd for us, and injurious to the [[Supreme Being]]."&lt;ref name="Ferrarese"/&gt;

The 1859 German work, ''Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft'' by philosophers and frequent collaborators Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal, distinguished pandeism unequivocally, declaring: "Man stelle es also den Denkern frei, ob sie [[Theist]]en, [[Pan-theist]]en, [[Atheist]]en, [[Deist]]en (und warum nicht auch Pandeisten?)...&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt; ("Man leaves it to the philosophers, whether they are Theists, Pan-theists, Atheists, Deists (and why not also Pandeists?)..." Literary critic [[Hayden Carruth]] said of 18th century figure [[Alexander Pope]] that it was "Pope's rationalism and pandeism with which he wrote the greatest mock-epic in English literature"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Suicides and Jazzers |author = [[Hayden Carruth]] |year = 1992 |ISBN = 047209419X |page = 161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'', "later [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Christians (such as [[William Ellery Channing]]), [[transcendentalists]] (such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]), writers (such as [[Walt Whitman]]) and some pragmatists (such as [[William James]]) took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |year = 2007 |ISBN = 0415939267 |page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian poet [[Robert Vivier]] wrote of the pandeism to be found in the works of Nineteenth Century novelist and poet [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Vivier]], "[http://www.arllfb.be/bulletin/bulletinsnumerises/bulletin_1952_xxx_03.pdf La Poésie de Victor Hugo]", in ''[[:fr:Académie Royale de Langue et de Littérature Françaises]]'', BULLETIN TOME XXX-No. 3, Décembre 1952 pp. 203-214, p. 211: "Tout cela culmine dans le pandéisme affirmé éloquemment aux dernières pages de Dieu : « Il est éperdûment », et on ne peut rien en dire d'autre sans le diminuer mais cela on peut, on doit le dire et le redire indéfiniment."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in the Nineteenth Century, poet [[Alfred Tennyson]] revealed that his "religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards [[agnosticism]] and pandeism".&lt;ref name="Omnibus"&gt;{{cite book |title= Omnibus IV: The Ancient World |author1=Gene Edward Veith|authorlink1=Gene Edward Veith |author2=Douglas Wilson |author3=G.

In ''[[s:The Pilgrimage from Deism to Agnosticism|The Pilgrimage from Deism to Agnosticism]]'', [[Moncure Daniel Conway]] stated that the term, "Pandeism" is "an unscholarly combination".&lt;ref&gt;[[Moncure Daniel Conway]], "[[s:The Pilgrimage from Deism to Agnosticism|The Pilgrimage from Deism to Agnosticism]]", published in ''The Free Review'', Vol. I. October 1, 1893, pages 11 to 19. Edited by Robertson, John Mackinnon and Singer, G. Astor.&lt;/ref&gt; Ottmar Hegemann described the "New Catholicism" of [[Franz Mach]] as actually a form of pandeism, in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6z4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=pandeismus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6n7GkgIvNAhVB5YMKHTQaDM4Q6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pandeismus&amp;f=false Franz Mach und sein Altkatholizismus. Bon Dr. Ottmar Hegemann, ''Evangelische Kirchen-Zeitung für Oesterreich'', Volume 22, Page 283, 1905]: "Die von ihm vorgetragene „einheitlich-natürliche Weltanschauung des Monismus, wonach die Natur ein nach Zeitund Raum unendlich begrenzter Mechanismus oder Automat" sei, halten wir für im Grunde völlig irreligiös, für einen Pandeismus, der kaum über den Materialismus eines Höckel heraus kommt. Mach faßt sein Glaubensbekenntnis in die Worte: „Mir persönlich genügt der Glaube an den ewigen, schöpferischen Weltgeist oder Gottgeist, der sich in der mit ihm wesentlich eins seienden Natur und deren Erscheinungen betätigt, auslebt oder auswirkt." (S. 291).&lt;/ref&gt; a few years before Weinstein's own extensive review was published, in 1910. A critique of Pandeism similar to Conway's, as an 'unsightly' combination of Greek and Latin, was made in a review of Weinstein's discussion of Pandeism.&lt;ref name="Kirn"&gt;Otto Kirn, reviewer, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") in [[Emil Schürer]], [[Adolf von Harnack]], editors, ''Theologische Literaturzeitung'' ("Theological Literature Journal"), Volume 35, column 827 (1910): "Dem Verfasser hat anscheinend die Einteilung: religiöse, rationale und naturwissenschaftlich fundierte Weltanschauungen vorgeschwebt; er hat sie dann aber seinem Material gegenüber schwer durchführbar gefunden und durch die mitgeteilte ersetzt, die das Prinzip der Einteilung nur noch dunkel durchschimmern läßt. Damit hängt wohl auch das vom Verfasser gebildete unschöne griechisch-lateinische Mischwort des ,Pandeismus' zusammen. Nach S. 228 versteht er darunter im Unterschied von dem mehr metaphysisch gearteten Pantheismus einen 'gesteigerten und vereinheitlichten Animismus', also eine populäre Art religiöser Weltdeutung. Prägt man lieh dies ein, so erstaunt man über die weite Ausdehnung, die dem Begriff in der Folge gegeben wird. Nach S. 284 ist Scotus Erigena ein ganzer, nach S. 300 Anselm von Canterbury ein, halber Pandeist'; aber auch bei Nikolaus Cusanus und Giordano Bruno, ja selbst bei Mendelssohn und Lessing wird eine Art von Pandeismus gefunden (S. 306. 321. 346.)." ''Translation'': "The author apparently intended to divide up religious, rational and scientifically based philosophies, but found his material overwhelming, resulting in an effort that can shine through the principle of classification only darkly. This probably is also the source of the unsightly Greek-Latin compound word, 'Pandeism.' At page 228, he understands the difference from the more metaphysical kind of pantheism, an enhanced unified animism that is a popular religious worldview. In remembering this borrowing, we were struck by the vast expanse given the term. According to page 284, Scotus Eriugena is one entirely, at p. 300 Anselm of Canterbury is 'half Pandeist'; but also Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno, and even in Mendelssohn and Lessing a kind of Pandeism is found (p. 306 321 346.)".&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer further criticises Weinstein's broad assertions that [[Scotus Eriugena]], [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] all were Pandeists or leaned towards Pandeism.&lt;ref name="Kirn"/&gt; Towards the beginning of World War I, an article in the ''Yale Sheffield Monthly'' published by the [[Yale University]] [[Sheffield Scientific School]] commented on speculation that the war "means the death of Christianity and an era of Pandeism or perhaps even the destruction of all which we call modern civilization and culture."&lt;ref&gt;Louis S. Hardin, '17, "The Chimerical Application of Machiavelli's Principles", ''[[Yale Sheffield Monthly]]'', pp 461–465, Yale University, May 1915, p. 463: "Are we virtuous merely because we are restrained by the fetters of the law? We hear men prophecy that this war means the death of Christianity and an era of Pandeism or perhaps even the destruction of all which we call modern civilization and culture. We hear men predict that the ultimate result of the war will be a blessing to humanity."&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, early 19th-century German philosopher [[Paul Friedrich Köhler]] wrote that Pantheism, Pandeism, [[Monism]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualism]] all refer to the same God illuminated in different ways, and that whatever the label, the human soul emanates from this God.

Pandeism was noted by literary critic [[Martin Lüdke]] as a philosophy expressed by early Twentieth-Century [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], especially as to those writings made under the pseudonym of [[Alberto Caeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Lüdke]], "Ein moderner Hüter der Dinge; Die Entdeckung des großen Portugiesen geht weiter: [[Fernando Pessoa]] hat in der Poesie Alberto Caeiros seinen Meister gesehen", ("A modern guardian of things; The discovery of the great Portuguese continues: Fernando Pessoa saw its master in the poetry of Alberto Caeiros"), ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', August 18, 2004. "Caeiro unterläuft die Unterscheidung zwischen dem Schein und dem, was etwa "Denkerge-danken" hinter ihm ausmachen wollen. Die Dinge, wie er sie sieht, sind als was sie scheinen. Sein Pan-Deismus basiert auf einer Ding-[[metaphysics|Metaphysik]], die in der modernen Dichtung des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts noch Schule machen sollte." ''Translation'': "Caeiro interposes the distinction between the light and what "philosopher thoughts" want to constitute behind him. The things, as he sees them, are as they seem. His pandeism is based on a metaphysical thing, which should still become a school of thought under the modern seal of the twentieth century."&lt;/ref&gt; Pandeism was likewise noted by authors like Brazilian journalist and writer [[Otávio de Faria]], and British scholar and translator of Portuguese fiction [[Giovanni Pontiero]], among others, to be an influence on the writings of noted mid-Twentieth-Century Brazilian poet [[Carlos Nejar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Quote: "Se Deus é tudo isso, envolve tudo, a palavra andorinha, a palavra poço o a palavra amor, é que Deus é muito grande, enorme, infinito; é Deus realmente e o pandeismo de Nejar é uma das mais fortes ideias poéticas que nos têm chegado do mundo da Poesia.

''Translation'': "If God is all, involves everything, swallows every word, the deep word, the word love, then God is very big, huge, infinite; and for a God really like this, the pandeism of Nejar is one of the strongest poetic ideas that we have reached in the world of poetry.

Pandeism was also examined by theologian [[Charles Hartshorne]], one of the chief disciples of [[process philosophy|process philosopher]] [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. In his [[process theology]], an extension of Whitehead's work, Hartshorne preferred pandeism to pantheism, explaining that "it is not really the [[God (word)|theos]] that is described".&lt;ref name="Hartshorne"&gt;{{Cite book

Several theologians examined the relationship between the [[Catholic Church and pandeism]]. [[Charles Anselm Bolton]] states in a 1963 article, ''Beyond the Ecumenical: Pan-deism?''&lt;ref name="Bolton"&gt;[[Charles Anselm Bolton]], "[https://archive.org/details/BeyondTheEcumenical?q=%22pan-deism%22 Beyond the Ecumenical: Pan-deism?]", ''Christianity Today'', 1963, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; that he "first came upon this extension of [[ecumenism]] into pan-deism among some [[Roman Catholic]] [[scholar]]s interested primarily in the 'reunion of the churches,' [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Anglican]]", and wondered, "what is the ultimate aim of the Curia in promoting the pan-deist movement."&lt;ref name="Bolton"/&gt; Bolton noted that "to unite with Hindus and Buddhists, Christians should explore the hidden reality—the “ultimate reality,” the infinite, the absolute, the everlasting, the all-pervading spirit that marks the religious experience of the Orient."&lt;ref name="Bolton"/&gt; The impact of this line of thought on Christianity was examined by [[Rousas John Rushdoony]], who wrote in his 1971 ''The One and the Many: Studies in the Philosophy of Order and Ultimacy'' that “The position of [[Pope Paul VI|Pope Paul]] came close to being a pan-Deism, and pan-Deism is the logical development of the virus of Hellenic thought,” and further that “a sincere idealist, implicitly pan-Deist in faith, deeply concerned with the problems of the world and of time, can be a Ghibelline pope, and Dante's Ghibellines have at last triumphed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rousas John Rushdoony]], [https://chalcedon.edu/store/39991-the-one-and-the-many-studies-in-the-philosophy-of-order-and-ultimacy The One and the Many: Studies in the Philosophy of Order and Ultimacy] (1971 [2007]), Ch. VIII-7, p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[Bert B. Beach]] wrote in 1974 that "during the Vatican Council there was criticism from WCC Circles" to the effect that "ecumenism was being contaminated by “pan-Deist” and syncretistic tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bert Beverly Beach]], ''Ecumenism: Boon Or Bane?'' (1974), p. 259 (quoting George H. Williams, ''Dimensions of Roman Catholic Ecumenism'' (1965), p. 31-32).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert A. Heinlein]] especially enjoyed this idea, and raised it in several of his works. Literary critic [[Dan Schneider (writer)|Dan Schneider]] wrote of Heinlein's ''[[Stranger In A Strange Land]]'' that [[Jubal Harshaw]]'s belief in his own [[free will]], was one "which Mike, Jill, and the Fosterites misinterpret as a pandeistic urge, '[[Thou art God]]!{{'"}}&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;[[Dan Schneider (writer)|Dan Schneider]], [http://www.hackwriters.com/strangerH.htm ''Review of Stranger In A Strange Land (The Uncut Version), by Robert A. Heinlein''] (7/29/05).&lt;/ref&gt; Heinlein himself, in his "Aphorisms of [[Lazarus Long]]", in his 1973 book ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' wrote, "God split himself into a myriad parts that he might have friends. This may not be true, but it sounds good—and is no sillier than any other theology."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Heinlein]], Aphorisms of [[Lazarus Long]], in "[[Time Enough for Love]]" (1978 [1973]), page 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 news article quoted this use of the term by Jim Garvin, a [[Vietnam veteran]] who became a [[Trappist monk]] in the [[Holy Cross Abbey, Virginia|Holy Cross Abbey]] of [[Berryville, Virginia]]. Garvin described his spiritual position as "'pandeism' or 'pan-en-deism,' something very close to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] concept of the all- pervading [[Great Spirit]]..."&lt;ref&gt;''Albuquerque Journal'', Saturday, November 11, 1995, B-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Pastor Bob Burridge of the Geneven Institute for Reformed Studies wrote that: "If God was the proximate cause of every act it would make all events to be "God in motion". That is nothing less than pantheism, or more exactly, pandeism."&lt;ref name="Burridge"&gt;Bob Burridge, "[http://www.genevaninstitute.org/syllabus/unit-two-theology-proper/lesson-4-the-decrees-of-god/ Theology Proper: Lesson 4 – The Decrees of God]", ''Survey Studies in Reformed Theology'', Genevan Institute for Reformed Studies (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Burridge rejects this model, observing that in Christianity, "The Creator is distinct from his creation. The reality of secondary causes is what separates Christian theism from pandeism."&lt;ref name="Burridge"/&gt; Burridge concludes by challenging that "calling God the author of sin demand[s] a pandeistic understanding of the universe effectively removing the reality of sin and moral law."&lt;ref name="Burridge"/&gt;

===Twenty-first century developments===
More recently, pandeism has been classed as a logical derivation of German philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s proposition that ours was the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 | doi = | accessdate = 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, author William C. Lane contended that:
{{quote|If divine becoming were complete, God's ''[[kenosis]]''--God's self-emptying for the sake of love--would be total. In this ''pandeistic'' view, nothing of God would remain separate and apart from what God would become. Any separate divine existence would be inconsistent with God's unreserved participation in the lives and fortunes of the actualized phenomena."&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;{{rp|67}}}}

Acknowledging that American philosopher [[William L. Rowe|William Rowe]] has raised "a powerful, evidential argument against ethical theism", Lane further contended that pandeism offers an escape from the [[evidential argument from evil]]:
{{quote|However, it does not count against pandeism. In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above", God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. Instead God ''bears'' all suffering, whether the fawn's&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Rowe|William Rowe]] used, as an example of needless suffering, a fawn horribly burned in a forest fire and unable to move, yet suffering for additional days before its death.&lt;/ref&gt; or anyone else's.

Even so, a skeptic might ask, "Why must there be ''so'' much suffering,? Why could not the world's design omit or modify the events that cause it?" In pandeism, the reason is clear: to remain unified, a world must convey information through transactions. Reliable conveyance requires relatively simple, uniform laws. Laws designed to skip around suffering-causing events or to alter their natural consequences (i.e., their consequences under simple laws) would need to be vastly complicated or (equivalently) to contain numerous exceptions.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;{{rp|76–77}}}}


Cartoonist and pundit [[Scott Adams]] has written two books on religion, ''[[God's Debris]]'' (2001), and ''The Religion War'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/actually-the-dilbert-guys-ultimate-legacy-will-be-the-1793522673 |work=Concourse |title= Actually The "Dilbert" Guy's Ultimate Legacy Will Be These Great Religion Books He Wrote |date=March 22, 2017 |access-date=October 23, 2018 | first=Hamilton |last=Nolan}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which ''God's Debris'' lays out a theory of pandeism, in which God blows itself up to see what will happen, which becomes the cause of our universe.&lt;ref&gt;Knujon Mapson, "A Brief History of Pandeism," ''Pandeism: An Anthology'' (2017), p. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''God's Debris'', Adams suggests that followers of theistic religions such as [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] are inherently subconsciously aware that their religions are false, and that this awareness is reflected in their consistently acting like these religions, and their threats of damnation for sinners, are false. In a 2017 interview Adams said these books would be "his ultimate legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-03-22/how-dilbert-s-scott-adams-got-hypnotized-by-trump |title=How Scott Adams Got Hypnotized by Trump |publisher= ''Bloomberg'' |date= March 22, 2017 |access-date= October 23, 2018 |first= Caroline |last=Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[Germans|German]] astrophysicist and popular scientist [[Harald Lesch]] observed in a debate on the role of faith in science:
{{quote|Suppose we would find the all-encompassing law of nature, we are looking for so that finally we could assure proudly, the world is built up this way and no differently -- immediately it would create a new question: What is behind this law, why is the world set up just so?

Others would say that God authored this law, that created the universe. A Pandeist might say that the all-encompassing law is God."&lt;ref&gt;Southwest Broadcasting SWR2 Aula – Manuscript service (Transcript of a conversation) "God plus Big Bang = X; Astrophysics and faith" Discussants: Professor [[Hans Küng]] and Professor [[Harald Lesch]], Editor: Ralf Caspary, broadcast: Sunday, 16th May 2010 at 8.30 clock, SWR2 ([[Harald Lesch]] referencing 1970 [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Hannes Alfvén]]); [http://swrmediathek.de/player.htm?show=73ab41a0-dac5-11df-950c-0026b975f2e6 Quote in the show "Gott plus Urknall" ("God plus Big Bang") (SWR2 Hall of 16/05/2010), at 1:32 seconds]: "Nehmen wir einmal an, wir würden das allumfassende Gesetz der Natur finden, nach dem wir suchen, so dass wir schließlich voller Stolz versichern könnten, so und nicht anders ist die Welt aufgebaut – sofort entstünde eine neue Frage: Was steht hinter diesem Gesetz, warum ist die Welt gerade so aufgebaut? Dieses Warum führt uns über die Grenzen der Naturwissenschaft in den Bereich der Religion. Als Fachmann sollte ein Physiker antworten: Wir wissen es nicht, wir werden es niemals wissen. Andere würden sagen, dass Gott dieses Gesetz aufstellte, also das Universum schuf. Ein Pandeist würde vielleicht sagen, dass das allumfassende Gesetz eben Gott sei."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2011, social scientist Niall Douglas wrote that in pandeism, "God ''is'' growth, God ''is'' structure/knowledge, God ''is'' everything and nothing simultaneously. And, rather heretically for the Abrahamic religions, to perceive i.e. to cognate i.e. to be of matter i.e. to be structured energy generating a gravimetric field is an aspect of God relating to another aspect of God through light, which is of course God. In this, the underlying metaphysics are most definitely Pandeist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Pluriculturalism''' is an approach to the self and others as complex rich beings which act and react from the perspective of multiple identifications. In this case, identity or identities are the by-products of experiences in different cultures.  As an effect, multiple identifications create a unique personality instead of or more than a static identity.&lt;ref name=Scribd&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/48131676/pluriculturalism-2 pluriculturalism (2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on multiple-identity, wherein people have multiple identities who belong to multiple groups with different degrees of identification.&lt;ref name=UGR&gt;Trujillo Sáez, Fernando. [http://www.ugr.es/~ftsaez/aspectos/LEA.pdf Culture Awareness and the development of the pluricultural competence], page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The term '''pluricultural competence''' is a consequence of the idea of [[plurilingualism]].&lt;ref name=COE&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/SourcePublications/CompetencePlurilingue09web_en.pdf 5.1.

'''Pyotr Ivanovich Bartenev''' (Пётр Иванович Бартенев; 1829-1912) was a Russian historian and collector of unpublished memoirs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =  | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url =  | title =Imperial Moscow University: 1755-1917: encyclopedic dictionary | orig-year = | agency = A.

Of noble birth, Bartenev attended the [[Moscow University]]. In 1856, he undertook the first publication of the correspondence of [[Tsar Alexis]], which brought him to the attention of the leading [[Slavophiles]]. These connections helped him secure the post of director at the [[Chertkov Library]], then the only public library in [[Moscow]].

At this position he consulted [[Leo Tolstoy]] on the details of the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Tolstoy, then at work on ''[[War and Peace]]'', said that "turning to Bartenev with a research query was like turning on the tap of a [[samovar]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosamund Bartlett. ''Tolstoy: A Russian Life''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011. Page 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, Bartenev founded ''[[The Russian Archive]]'', the first [[history journal]] in Russia. Like its rival, ''[[Russkaya Starina|Old Times in Russia]]'', Bartenev's journal brought to light scores of unknown documents and memoirs from the 18th and early 19th centuries. [[Prince Vorontsov]]'s entire family archive was published in 40 volumes as a supplement to this periodical.

Bartenev is perhaps best remembered today as the founder of the [[Pushkin studies]]. He  collected numerous testimonials relating to [[Alexander Pushkin]], from his relatives and friends. Bartenev and [[Pavel Annenkov]] represent the first generation of amateur Pushkinists.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Horowitz. ''The Myth of A.S. Pushkin in Russia's Silver Age''. Northwestern University Press, 1996. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hein &amp; Co. |isbn=9780899417073 |edition=1986 reprint |location=Buffalo, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a question is distinct from a '''question of fact''', which must be answered by reference to facts and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] as well as inferences arising from those facts. Answers to questions of law are generally expressed in terms of broad legal principles and can be applied to many situations rather than be dependent on particular circumstances or factual situations. An answer to a question of law as applied to the particular facts of a case is often referred to as a "conclusion of law."

In several civil law jurisdictions, the highest courts consider questions of fact settled by the lower court and will only consider questions of law. They thus may refer a case back to a lower court to re-apply the law and answer any fact-based evaluations based on their answer on the application of the law. International courts such as the [[Benelux Court of Justice]] and the [[European Court of Justice]] will only answer questions of law, asked by judges of national courts if they are not certain about the interpretation of the law of multilateral organizations.

While questions of fact are resolved by a ''trier of fact'', which in the [[common law]] system is often a [[jury]], questions of law are always resolved by a [[judge]] or equivalent. Whereas findings of fact in a common law legal system are rarely overturned by an [[appellate court]], conclusions of law are more readily reconsidered.

==Question of fact==
In [[law]], a question of fact, also known as a point of fact, is a question that must be answered by reference to facts and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] as well as inferences arising from those facts. Such a question is distinct from a question of law, which must be answered by applying relevant legal principles. The answer to a question of fact (a "'''finding of fact'''") usually depends on particular circumstances or factual situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Question of fact|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/question_of_fact|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=[[Cornell University Law School]]|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All questions of fact are capable of proof or disproof by reference to a certain standard of proof. Depending on the nature of the matter, the standard of proof may require that a fact be proven to be "more likely than not" (there is barely more evidence for the fact than against, as established by a preponderance of the evidence) or true beyond [[legal burden of proof|reasonable doubt]].

Answers to questions of fact are determined by a ''[[trier of fact]]'' such as a [[jury]], or a [[judge]]. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[appellate court]]s generally do not consider appeals based on errors of fact (errors in answering a question of fact). Rather, the findings of fact of the first venue are usually given great [[deference]] by [[appellate court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharma|first1=Riecha|last2=Tacey|first2=Sam|title=The Decision is Final: English High Court Rules That There Can Be No Appeal Against Arbitration Awards on Issues of Fact|url=http://www.edwardswildman.com/insights/PublicationDetail.aspx?publication=2112|website=edwardswildman.com|publisher=[[Edwards Wildman Palmer]]|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The distinction between "law" and "fact" has proved obscure wherever it is employed. For instance, the common law used to require that a plaintiff's complaint in a civil action only state the "facts" of his case, not any "legal conclusions." Unfortunately, no one has ever been able to tell whether the allegation that "on November 9, the defendant negligently ran over the plaintiff with his car at the intersection of State Street and Chestnut Street" is a statement of fact or a legal conclusion. In fact, the distinction between law and fact is just the legal version of the philosophical distinction between "empirical" and "analytical" statements, a distinction on whose existence philosophers have been unable to agree to this day.... we will see that many defendants charged with impossible attempts are not in fact attempting the crime they are charged with attempting. They merely think they are committing a crime.... It would be merely foolish to assert that it is of no interest whatever to know that ''The Disciples'' is a forgery. But to the man who has never heard of either Vermeer or van Meegeren and who stands in front of ''The Disciples'' admiring it, it can make no difference whether he is told that it is a seventeenth-century Vermeer or a twentieth-century van Meegeren in the style of Vermeer. And when some deny this and argue vehemently that, indeed, it does make a great deal of difference, they are only admitting that ''they'' do know something about Vermeer and van Meegeren and the history of art and the value and reputation of certain masters. They are only admitting that they do not judge a work of art on purely aesthetic grounds, but also take into account when it was created, by whom, and how great a reputation it or its creator has.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bad Acts and Guilt Minds: Conundrums of Criminal Law |last=Katz |first=Leo |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1987 |isbn=9780226425924 |location=Chicago, IL |pages=276–293 |chapter=The Crime That Never Was: a Fake Opinion in Case involving Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">'''Red Sea rig''', sometimes known as '''gulf rig''' or '''schooner rig''', is a [[dress code]] for [[semi-formal]] evening events, which in general consists of [[black tie]] attire with the jacket removed, a red [[bow tie]] and red [[cummerbund]], although there are local variations.

==History==
Red Sea rig was originally a [[Royal Navy]] concept appearing during the nineteenth century. Historically, it was felt that Royal Navy officers, like their British Army counterparts, should wear the full appropriate uniform for all formal events, whatever the temperature. The sole exception was in the [[Red Sea]], where the heat and humidity often made this physically impossible. Here, officers were permitted to remove their jackets in the [[wardroom]], provided they added a cummerbund to temper the somewhat informal look. Royal Air Force officers serving on Navy ships follow the naval tradition wearing a Red Sea rig version of their own [[mess dress]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/9649A8EB_F8E2_CD83_3BEF4E3778E75CF3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In his reminiscences ''For King and Country'', [[Nelson Albert Tomalin]] describes a rather home-made version of Red Sea rig worn on board the whaler Southern Sea in 1943 as  "...white shirt with epaulettes and long blue trousers with a black scarf as a cummerbund...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://samilitaryhistory.org/diaries/nat5.html For King and Country &amp;ndash; Nelson Albert Tomalin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its obvious practicality, Red Sea rig was adopted into civilian life, first by British diplomats in the [[Red Sea]] town of [[Jeddah]], and later by the local [[British business group|British Business Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbg-jed.org/dress_code.htm BBG Jeddah Dress code]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now widely worn by many military and civilian organisations and is often the dress code of choice for dinner parties in British expatriate communities in the [[Middle East]] and [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;Speech by David Lyman,[http://www.amchamthailand.com/asp/view_doc.asp?DocCID=1219 "Yesteryear – Bangkok 1956 What Life Was Like When AMCHAM Thailand Was Born"], reproduced in ''Thai-American Business'', March–April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Sea rig originated prior to [[air conditioning]] as a purely practical measure, but has now become a dress-style in its own right, even if the party or function is held in an air conditioned venue.

[[British and Commonwealth orders and decorations|Decorations]], even in miniature, are not normally worn with Red Sea rig, although [[medal]] miniature ribbons are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irfc-nausena.nic.in/irfc/ezine/Trans2Trimph/chapters/21_personnel-1.htm Example from Indian Navy regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221043103/http://www.irfc-nausena.nic.in/irfc/ezine/Trans2Trimph/chapters/21_personnel-1.htm |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
There are many military and civilian variations of Red Sea rig:

*'''Original Navy:''' Short-sleeved white shirt (open neck), formal dress trousers and black cummerbund&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readyayeready.com/jackspeak/alphabetic.php?alpha=R&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''P&amp;O Cruises &amp; Princess Cruises officers:''' Short-sleeved white shirt (open neck) with shoulder boards, formal dress trousers and black cummerbund; however a black belt is being substituted for the cummerbund more often than not.
*'''[[British business group|BBG]] / British Diplomatic:''' Long-sleeved white dress shirt, red bow tie, formal dress trousers and red cummerbund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg-jed.org/dress_code.htm |accessdate=June 25, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''American diplomatic''' (also known as Gulf Rig): Simply black-tie attire, minus the jacket, although cummerbunds are often worn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/protocol/dressing.htm Dressing] on eDiplomat.com, adapted from material published by the Overseas Briefing Center of the U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Scottish Highland''': The military version consists of a long sleeved white dress shirt, black bow tie, [[tartan]] [[trews]] and a silk cummerbund in the regimental tartan (unless this is the very dark [[Clan Campbell#Tartans|Campbell tartan]], in which case a red, green or blue cummerbund may be substituted).

[[File:SOGLogo1a.jpg|thumb|Sea of Faith logo.]]
The '''Sea of Faith Network''' ('''SoF''') is an organisation with the stated aim to explore and promote  religious faith as a human creation.

==History==
The SoF movement started in 1984 as a response to [[Don Cupitt]]'s book and [[Sea of Faith (TV series)|television series]], both titled ''Sea of Faith''.&lt;ref name="Bill Cooke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Bill|title=Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, and Humanism|year=2005|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst NY|isbn=978-1591022992|pages=470|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sA6_jqohqRUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cupitt was educated in both science and theology at the University of Cambridge in the 1950s, and is a philosopher, theologian, [[Anglican]] priest, and former Dean of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt: Life Fellow and former Dean of Emmanuel College Cambridge, England|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/Fellows/cupitt.html|publisher=Westar Institute|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book and TV series, he surveyed western thinking about religion and charted a transition from traditional realist religion to the  view that religion is simply a human creation.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Stangroom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stangroom|first1=Jeremy|last2=Baggini|first2=Julian|authorlink1=Jeremy Stangroom|authorlink2=Julian Baggini|title=What Philosophers Think|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=978-0826484741|pages=95–104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P6jT10cRPXQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Sea of Faith is taken from [[Matthew Arnold]]'s nostalgic mid 19th century poem "[[Dover Beach]]", in which the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the "sea of faith" is withdrawing like the ebbing tide.&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt sea of faith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cupitt|first=Don|title=The Sea of Faith|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521344203|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCXcdgWck_8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=don+cupitt+dover+beach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fLrsUL3zC6j22gWH_YGICw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the television series, a small group of radical Christian clergy and laity began meeting to explore how they might promote this new understanding of religious faith. Starting with a mailing list of 143 sympathisers, they organised the first UK conference in 1988.&lt;ref name="Peter B. Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Peter B.|title=Encyclopedia Of New Religious Movements|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415453837|pages=595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second conference was held in the following year shortly after which the SoF Network was officially launched. Annual national conferences have been a key event of the network ever since.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts|url=http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Religious_Studies/Phil_of_Rel/Atheism_Agnosticism/sea_of_faith_network.php|work=That Religious Studies Website|publisher=Pelusa Media Group|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Sea Of Faith Network holds national and regional conferences and promotional events each year. There is an active network of local groups who meet regularly for discussion and exploration.&lt;ref name=sofn&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith Network] retrieved 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's magazine ''Sofia'' is published bi-monthly in the United Kingdom. It has a circulation beyond the SoF membership. The group also maintains a web site and an on-line discussion group.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

Currently there are national networks in the UK, New Zealand and Australia with scattered membership in the USA, Northern Ireland, South Africa, France and The Netherlands. The world-wide membership, as of 2004, stood at about 2,000. Each national network is run by a steering committee elected from its members.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Beliefs==
SoF has no official creed or statement of belief to which members are required to assent, seeing itself as a loose network rather than a formal religious movement or organisation. Its stated aim is to "explore and promote religious faith as a human creation".&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are|url=http://www.sofn.org.uk/sof/who_we_are.html|publisher=Sea of Faith Network|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this it spans a broad spectrum of faith positions from uncompromising non-realism at one end to critical realism at the other.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are" /&gt;  Some members describe themselves as on the liberal or radical wing of conventional belief (see [[liberal Christianity]]) while others choose to call themselves [[religious humanism|religious]] or [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] (see [[humanism]]). Some even refer to themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply nontheist (see [[Christian atheism]]).

SoF possesses no religious writings or ceremonies of its own; many members remain active in their own religion (mainly but not exclusively Christian) while others have no religious affiliation at all.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Philosophy==
A number of commentators have identified SoF as closely associated with the non-realist approach to religion.&lt;ref name="andrew moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Andrew|title=Realism and Christian Faith: God, Grammar, and Meaning|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521524155|pages=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54AgRQ0QbZIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cathey&gt;{{cite book|last=Cathey|first=Robert Andrew|title=God In Postliberal Perspective: Between Realism and Non-Realism|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Burlington VT|isbn=978-0754616801|pages=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkVppp6cfcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the belief that God has no "real", objective, or empirical existence, independent of human language and culture; God is "real" in the sense that he is a potent symbol, metaphor or projection, but he has no objective existence outside and beyond the practice of religion.&lt;ref name="peter mullen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mullen|first=Peter|title=Faith and Reason Cupitt's arrows lie blunted by the reality of reasoned discussion|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/faith-and-reason-cupitts-arrows-lie-blunted-by-the-reality-of-reasoned-discussion-1391036.html|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=31 Dec 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-realism therefore entails a rejection of all supernaturalism, including concepts such as miracles, the afterlife, and the agency of spirits.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network|url=http://www.stoa.org.uk/topics/sof/sea-of-faith-network.html|publisher=Faversham Stoa|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupitt wrote, "God is the sum of our values, representing to us their ideal unity, their claims upon us and their creative power".&lt;ref&gt;''Taking Leave of God'', Don Cupitt, SCM, 1980, 2001 edition: {{ISBN|0-334-02840-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cupitt calls this "a voluntarist interpretation of faith: a fully demythologized version of Christianity".&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt; It entails the claim that even after we have given up the idea that religious beliefs can be grounded in anything beyond the human realm, religion can still be believed and practised in new ways.&lt;ref name="Gail Vines"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vines|first=Gail|title=A Godless creed|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=99906&amp;sectioncode=26|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=19 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder's influence==
Since he began writing in 1971, Cupitt has produced 36 books. During this time his views have continued to evolve and change.&lt;ref name="nigel leaves"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaves|first=Nigel|title=Odyssey on the Sea of Faith: The Life &amp; Writings of Don Cupitt|year=2004|publisher=Polebridge Press|location=Santa Rosa CA|isbn=978-0944344620|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his early books such as ''Taking Leave of God'' and ''The Sea of Faith'' Cupitt talks of God alone as non-real,&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God|url=http://philosophybites.com/2008/11/don-cupitt-on-nonrealism-about-god.html|work=philosophy bites|publisher=Institute of Philosophy|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the 1980s he moved into [[postmodernism]], describing his position as empty radical humanism:&lt;ref name="About Non-Realism"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Non-Realism|url=http://www.doncupitt.com/non-realism|publisher=Don Cupitt|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, there is nothing but our language, our world, and the meanings, truths and interpretations that we have generated. Everything is non-real, including God.&lt;ref name=hyman&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyman|first=Gavin|title=The Predicament of Postmodern Theology: Radical Orthodoxy or Nihilist Textualism?|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville KY|isbn=978-0664223663|pages=44–49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VuXIL7amXvIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Cupitt was the founding influence of SoF and is much respected for his work for the network, it would not be true to say that he is regarded as a guru or leader of SoF. Members are free to dissent from his views and Cupitt himself has argued strongly that SoF should never be a fan club.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;  Both Cupitt and the network emphasise the importance of autonomous critical thought and reject authoritarianism in all forms.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;

'''Kwame Ture''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɑː|m|eɪ|_|ˈ|t|ʊər|eɪ}}; born '''Stokely Carmichael''', June 29, 1941{{spaced ndash}}November 15, 1998) was a Trinidadian-born prominent organizer in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the [[United States]] and the global [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African movement]].  Born in [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], he grew up in the United States from the age of 11 and became an activist while attending [[Howard University]].  He eventually developed the [[Black Power movement]], first while leading the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), later serving as the "Honorary Prime Minister" of the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP), and lastly as a leader of the [[All-African People's Revolutionary Party]] (A-APRP).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/people/stokely-carmichael "Stokely Carmichael" biography], ''Freedom Riders'', American Experience website (PBS).&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael was one of the original SNCC [[freedom riders]] of 1961 under [[Diane Nash]]'s leadership. He became a major voting rights activist in [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] after being mentored by [[Ella Baker]] and [[Robert Parris Moses]]. Like most young people in SNCC, he became disillusioned with the [[two-party system]] after the 1964 Democratic National Convention failed to recognize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] as official delegates from the state. Carmichael chose to develop independent black political organizations, such as the Lowndes County Freedom Organization and, for a time, the national Black Panther Party. Inspired by [[Malcolm X]]'s example, he articulated a philosophy of "[[black power]]," and popularized it both by provocative speeches and more sober writings. Carmichael became one of the most popular and controversial Black leaders of the late 1960s. [[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the FBI, secretly identified Carmichael as the man most likely to succeed Malcolm X as America's "black messiah." The FBI targeted him for personal destruction through its [[COINTELPRO]] program, and Carmichael fled to Africa in 1968. He re-established himself in [[Ghana]], and then [[Guinea]] by 1969, where he adopted the new name of Kwame Ture.

==Early life==
Born in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], Stokely Carmichael attended Tranquility School there before moving to [[Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]], in 1952 at the age of 11, to rejoin his parents. They had immigrated to the United States when he was age two, and he was raised by his grandmother and two aunts.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;Kaufman, Michael T. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/16/us/stokely-carmichael-rights-leader-who-coined-black-power-dies-at-57.html "Stokely Carmichael, Rights Leader Who Coined 'Black Power,' Dies at 57"], ''[[New York Times]]'', November 16, 1998. Accessed March 27, 2008. [http://www.interchange.org/Kwameture/nytimes111698.html (alternate url)]&lt;/ref&gt; He had three sisters.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/stokely-carmichael "Stokely Carmichael Facts"], YourDictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother, Mabel R. Carmichael,&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt; was a stewardess for a [[steamship]] line.  His father, Adolphus, was a carpenter who also worked as a taxi driver.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;  The reunited Carmichael family eventually left Harlem to live in [[Van Nest]] in the [[East Bronx]], at that time an aging neighborhood with residents who were primarily Jewish and Italian immigrants and descendants.  According to a 1967 interview Carmichael gave to ''[[Life Magazine]]'', he was the only black member of the Morris Park Dukes, a youth gang involved in alcohol and petty theft.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;  He and his family were members of the [[Westchester United Methodist Church]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Carmichael attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in New York, being selected through high achievement on its standardized entrance examination.  While at Bronx Science, he participated in a boycott of a local White Castle restaurant, which did not hire blacks. On student recognition Sunday at his church, Carmichael gave an eye-opening&lt;!-- why? --&gt; student sermon to the almost totally white congregation. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Carmichael was acquainted with fellow Bronx Science student [[Samuel R. Delany]] during his time there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55142525|title=The motion of light in water : sex and science fiction writing in the East Village|last=R.,|first=Delany, Samuel|isbn=0816645248|edition=  1st University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis|oclc=55142525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation in 1960, Carmichael enrolled at [[Howard University]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] university in [[Washington, D.C.]]. His professors included [[Sterling Allen Brown|Sterling Brown]],&lt;ref name="SBrown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuckey, Sterling. ''Going Through the Storm: The Influence of African American Art in History''.

Twenty-First Century Books, 2002, p. 44, {{ISBN|0-7613-1852-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7613-1852-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael and [[Tom Kahn]], a Jewish-American student and civil-rights activist, helped to fund a five-day run of the ''[[Three Penny Opera]]'', by [[Berthold Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tom Kahn—very shrewdly—had captured the position of Treasurer of the Liberal Arts Student Council and the infinitely charismatic and popular Carmichael as floor whip was good at lining up the votes. Before they knew what hit them the Student Council had become a patron of the arts, having voted to buy out the remaining performances. It was a classic win/win. Members of the Council got patronage packets of tickets for distribution to friends and constituents.&lt;ref name="SBrown"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The professor and the activists: A memoir of Sterling Brown|first= Ekwueme Michael|last=Thelwell|journal=The Massachusetts Review|volume=40|number=4|year=1999–2000|pages=634–636|jstor=25091592|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carmichael's apartment on Euclid Street was a gathering place for his activist classmates.&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt; He graduated in 1964 with a degree in philosophy.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; Carmichael was offered a full graduate scholarship to [[Harvard University]] but turned it down.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Watson, ''Freedom Summer: The Savage Season That Made Mississippi Burn and Made America a Democracy'', p. 177 (Viking, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Howard, Carmichael had joined the [[Nonviolent Action Group]] (NAG), the Howard campus affiliate of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).&lt;ref name=King&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021104093038/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/carmichael_stokely.html "Stokely Carmichael"], ''King Encyclopedia'', The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University.

==1961: Freedom Rides==
In his first year at the university, in 1961, Carmichael participated in the [[Freedom Rides]] that the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) organized to desegregate the interstate buses and bus station restaurants along U.S. Route 40 between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., as they came under federal rather than state law. They had been segregated by custom. He was frequently arrested, and spent time in jail.  He was arrested so many times for his activism that he lost count, sometimes estimating at least 29 or 32. In 1998, he told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that he thought the total was fewer than 36.&lt;ref name="WPOST"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.interchange.org/KwameTure/washpoststory.html | last=Span | first=Paula | title=The Undying Revolutionary: As Stokely Carmichael, He Fought for Black Power. Now Kwame Ture's Fighting For His Life | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | page=D01 | date=April 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with eight other riders, on June 4, 1961, Carmichael traveled by train from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Jackson, Mississippi, to integrate the formerly "white" section on the train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carmichael|first=Stokely|title=Ready for Revolution|year=2005|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|pages=171–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before getting on the train in New Orleans, they encountered white protestors blocking the way. Carmichael says: "They were shouting. Throwing cans and lit cigarettes at us. Spitting on us."&lt;ref name="Arsenault 2006 362–363"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arsenault|first=Raymond|title=Freedom Riders|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn=978-0-19-513674-6|pages=362–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, ''Ready for Revolution'' (2003), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the group was able to board the train. When the group arrived in Jackson, Carmichael and the eight other riders entered a "white" cafeteria. They were charged with disturbing the peace, arrested, and taken to jail.

Eventually, Carmichael was transferred to the infamous [[Parchman Penitentiary|Parchman Farm]] in [[Sunflower County, Mississippi]], along with other Freedom Riders.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Stokely, and Michael Thelwell.

Retrieved from [[Google Books]] July 23, 2010. {{ISBN|0-684-85003-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-684-85003-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained notoriety for being a witty and hard-nosed leader among the prisoners.&lt;ref name="carmichael"&gt;{{cite web |last=PBS|title=Stokely Carmichael Biography|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/people/stokely-carmichael|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served 49 days with other activists at the Parchman State Prison Farm. At 19, Carmichael was the youngest detainee in the summer of 1961. He spent 53 days at Parchman Farm in a six-by-nine cell. He and his colleagues were only allowed to shower twice a week, were not allowed books or any other personal effects, and were at times placed in maximum security to isolate them from one another.&lt;ref name=FreedomRides&amp;WhiteBacklash&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Rides and White Backlash|url=http://stokely-carmichael.com/stokely-carmichael-part-6-freedom-rides-and-white-backlash/|accessdate=April 8, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508085731/http://stokely-carmichael.com/stokely-carmichael-part-6-freedom-rides-and-white-backlash/#|archive-date=2011-05-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael said about the Parchman Farm sheriff:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The sheriff acted like he was scared of black folks and he came up with some beautiful things. One night he opened up all the windows, put on ten big fans and an air conditioner and dropped the temperature to 38 degrees [Fahrenheit; 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C]. All we had on was T-shirts and shorts.&lt;ref name=FreedomRides&amp;WhiteBacklash/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While being hurt one time, Carmichael began singing to the guards, "I'm gonna tell God how you treat me," to which the rest of the prisoners joined in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cwiklik|first=Robert|title=Stokely Carmichael and Black Power|year=1993|publisher=The Millbrook Press|location=Brookfield, Connecticut|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael kept the group's morale up while in prison, often telling jokes with Steve Green and the other Freedom Riders, and making light of their situation. He knew their situation was serious.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What with the range of ideology, religious belief, political commitment and background, age, and experience, something interesting was always going on. Because no matter our differences, this group had one thing in common, moral stubbornness. Whatever we believed, we really believed and were not at all shy about advancing. We were where we were only because of our willingness to affirm our beliefs even at the risk of physical injury. So it was never dull on death row.&lt;ref name="Arsenault 2006 362–363"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1964 interview with author [[Robert Penn Warren]], Carmichael reflected on his motives for going on the rides, saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought I have to go because you've got to keep the issue alive, and you've got to show the Southerners that you're not gonna be scared off, as we've been scared off in the past. And no matter what they do, we're still gonna keep coming back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities|title=Stokely Carmichael|url=http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/interview/stokely-carmichael|website=Robert Penn Warren's Who Speaks for the Negro?

==1964–67: SNCC==

===Mississippi and Cambridge, Maryland===
In 1964, Carmichael became a full-time field organizer for SNCC in Mississippi.  He worked on the [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]] voting rights project under [[Robert Parris Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_stokely_carmichael_1941_1998/ "Stokely Carmichael"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006113934/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_stokely_carmichael_1941_1998/ |date=2014-10-06 }}, King Encyclopedia, Martin Luther King Jr. Institute for Research and Education.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout [[Freedom Summer]], he worked with [[grassroots]] African-American activists, including [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], whom Carmichael named as one of his personal heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://millercenter.org/events/2014/stokely-carmichael-and-the-freedom-summer-that-changed-history "American Forum - Stokely Carmichael, Freedom Summer and the Rise of Black Militancy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006123033/http://millercenter.org/events/2014/stokely-carmichael-and-the-freedom-summer-that-changed-history |date=2014-10-06 }}, Miller Center of the Humanities, University of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; SNCC organizer Joann Gavin wrote that Hamer and Carmichael "understood one another as perhaps no one else could."&lt;ref&gt;Joann Gavin, [http://www.crmvet.org/mem/stokely3.htm "Kwame Ture-Memories"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked closely with [[Gloria Richardson]], who led the SNCC chapter in [[Cambridge, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;Faith S. Holsaert, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ngSC1iaW_x8C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=gloria+richardson,+stokely&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-A6XrrqiEV&amp;sig=u8pE90kZfC3WvrbL4QL-5pX7kM4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0SksVNC1K7TGsQS18oHoAw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=gloria%20richardson%2C%20stokely&amp;f=false et al, ''Hands on the Freedom Plow: Voices of Women in SNCC''] (University of Illinois Press, 2010), pp. 285–287.&lt;/ref&gt; During a protest with Richardson in Maryland in June 1964, Carmichael was hit directly in a chemical gas attack by the National Guard and had to be hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964cambridge "Cambridge, Maryland &amp; The White Backlash"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon became project director for [[Mississippi's 2nd congressional district]], made up largely of the counties of the Mississippi Delta. At that time, most blacks in Mississippi had been disenfranchised since passage of a new constitution in 1890. The summer project was to prepare them to register to vote and to conduct a parallel registration movement to demonstrate how much people wanted to vote. Grassroots activists organized the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP), as the regular Democratic Party did not represent African Americans in the state. At the end of Freedom Summer, Carmichael went to the [[1964 Democratic Convention]] in support of the MFDP, which sought to have its delegation seated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim64b.htm#1964fsfs "Mississippi Summer Project"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.&lt;/ref&gt; But, the MFDP delegates were refused voting rights by the [[Democratic National Committee]], who chose to seat the regular white [[Jim Crow]] delegation. Carmichael, along with many SNCC staff members, left the convention with a profound sense of disillusionment in the American political system, and what he later called "totalitarian liberal opinion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim64b.htm#1964b-fsmfdpfallout "MFDP Challenge to the Democratic Convention"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selma to Montgomery marches===
Having developed aversion to working with the Democratic Party after the 1964 convention experience, Carmichael decided to leave the MFDP.  Instead he began exploring SNCC projects in Alabama in 1965. During the period of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery Marches]], he was recruited by [[James Forman]] to participate in a "second front" to stage protests at the Alabama State Capitol in March 1965. Carmichael became disillusioned with the growing struggles between SNCC and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), who opposed Forman's strategy. He thought SCLC was working with affiliated black churches to undercut it.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Ture, ''Ready for Revolution: The Life and Struggles of Stokely Carmichael'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003), p. 441–446&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also frustrated to be drawn again into nonviolent confrontations with police, which he no longer found empowering.  After seeing protesters brutally beaten again, he collapsed from stress, and his colleagues urged him to leave the city.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Branch, ''At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965–1968'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2006), pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a week, Carmichael returned to protesting, this time in Selma, to participate in the final march along Route 80 to the state capital.  He initiated a grassroots project in "Bloody Lowndes" County, along the march route.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Branch, ''At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years 1965–1968'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2006), pp. 132, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a county known for white violence against blacks during this era, where SCLC and Dr. King had tried and failed to organize its black residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim65b.htm#1965lowndes "1965-Cracking Lowndes" Civil Rights Movement Veterans timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; In the period from 1877 to 1950, Lowndes County had 14  documented [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African Americans]].&lt;ref name="eji"&gt;[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf ''Lynching in America'', 2nd edition], Supplement by County, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowndes County Freedom Organization===
In 1965, working as a SNCC activist in the black-majority [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]], Carmichael helped to increase the number of registered black voters from 70 to 2,600—300 more than the number of registered white voters.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; Black voters had essentially been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] by Alabama's constitution passed by white Democrats in 1901. After Congressional passage in August of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the federal government was authorized to oversee and enforce their rights. But there was still tremendous resistance by whites in the area, which endangered activists. Black residents and voters organized and widely supported the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), a party that had the [[black panther]] as its mascot, over the white-dominated local [[Southern Democrats#American Civil War and post-Reconstruction|Democratic Party]], whose mascot was a white rooster. Since federal protection from violent voter suppression by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other white opponents was sporadic, most Lowndes County activists openly carried arms.

Although black residents and voters outnumbered whites in Lowndes, their candidate lost the county-wide election of 1965. In 1966, several LCFO candidates ran for office in the general election but failed to win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackpast.org/aah/lowndes-county-freedom-organization Lowndes County Freedom Organization] Black Past.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the LCFO merged with the statewide Democratic Party, and former LCFO candidates won their first offices in the county.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1781 Lowndes County Freedom Organization"], ''Encyclopedia of Alabama''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC513_scans/Lowndes_Co/513.LowndesCO.bpp.6.1966.pdf "The Black Panther Party" (pamphlet)], Merrit Publishers, June 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Anything more to say about this? Not enough people registered in 1966 who supported the candidates, or was there fraud? --&gt;

===Chair of SNCC and Black Power===
Carmichael became chairman of SNCC in 1966, taking over from [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], an activist who later was elected to the US Congress, and has served since then. [[James Meredith]] had initiated a solitary [[March Against Fear]] in early June of that year from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. He did not want the big civil rights organizations or leaders involved, but was willing to have individual black men join him. On his second day out, Meredith was shot and wounded by a white sniper, and had to be hospitalized. Civil rights leaders vowed to finish the march in his name.

Carmichael joined [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Floyd McKissick]], [[Cleveland Sellers]] and others to continue Meredith's march. He was arrested in [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]] during the march. After his release, he gave his first "[[Black Power]]" speech at a rally that night, using the phrase to urge [[black pride]] and socio-economic independence:

{{quote|It is a call for black people in this country to unite, to recognize their heritage, to build a sense of community. It is a call for black people to define their own goals, to lead their own organizations.}}

According to historian [[David J. Garrow]], a few days after Carmichael spoke about "Black Power" slogan at the rally during "Meredith March Against Fear," he reportedly told King: "Martin, I deliberately decided to raise this issue on the march in order to give it a national forum and force you to take a stand for Black Power." King responded, "I have been used before. One more time won't hurt."&lt;ref&gt;David J. Garrow, ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2012}}

While Black Power was not a new concept, Carmichael's speech brought it into the spotlight. It became a rallying cry for young [[African Americans]] across the country who were frustrated about slow progress in civil rights, even after federal legislation had been passed to strengthen the effort. Everywhere that Black Power spread, if accepted, credit was given to the prominent Carmichael. If the concept was condemned, he was held responsible and blamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennet Jr.|first=Lerone|title=Stokely Carmichael Architect of Black Power|newspaper=Ebony Magazine|date=September 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carmichael: "Black Power meant black people coming together to form a political force and either electing representatives or forcing their representatives to speak to their needs [rather than relying on established parties]".&lt;ref&gt;"Stokely Carmichael," ''King Encyclopedia'', The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University. Accessed November 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Strongly influenced by the work of [[Frantz Fanon]] and his landmark book ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'', along with others such as [[Malcolm X]], Carmichael led SNCC to become more radical. The group focused on Black Power as its core goal and ideology.

During the controversial [[Atlanta Project]] in 1966, SNCC, under the local leadership of Bill Ware, engaged in a voter drive to promote the candidacy of [[Julian Bond]] from an Atlanta district for a seat in the [[Georgia State Legislature]]. Ware excluded Northern white SNCC members from working on this drive. Initially, Carmichael opposed him and voted against this decision, but eventually changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantahighered.org/civilrights/essay_detail.asp?phase=4 |title=Quest for Black Power (1966-1970) |publisher=Atlanta in the Civil Rights Movement |accessdate=April 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616083304/http://www.atlantahighered.org/civilrights/essay_detail.asp?phase=4 |archivedate=June 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the urging of the Atlanta Project, the issue of whites being members in SNCC came up for a vote. Carmichael ultimately sided with those calling for the expulsion of whites. He said that whites should organize poor white southern communities, of which there were plenty, while SNCC focused on promoting African-American self-reliance through Black Power.&lt;ref name=forman&gt;James Forman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2RIhBEy7dEC&amp;pg=PP16&amp;lpg=PP16&amp;dq=sncc+expulsion+of+whites&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kQWEr8lbss&amp;sig=qal9cfxnU9U01uivL-mAJrraj2k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result ''The Making of Black Revolutionaries''], pp. xvi-xv (2nd edn 1997). Accessed March 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael considered [[nonviolence]] to be a tactic, as opposed to an underlying principle, which separated him from civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Carmichael criticized civil rights leaders who called for the [[Racial integration|integration]] of African Americans into existing institutions of the [[middle-class]] mainstream.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, several people have been upset because we've said that integration was irrelevant when initiated by blacks, and that in fact it was a subterfuge, an insidious subterfuge, for the maintenance of [[white supremacy]]. Now we maintain that in the past six years or so, this country has been feeding us a "[[thalidomide]] drug of integration," and that some Negroes have been walking down a dream street talking about sitting next to white people; and that that does not begin to solve the problem; that when we went to Mississippi we did not go to sit next to [[Ross Barnett]]; we did not go to sit next to [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]]; we went to get them out of our way; and that people ought to understand that; that we were never fighting for the right to integrate, we were fighting against [[white supremacy]]. Now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom. No man can give anybody his freedom. A man is born free. You may enslave a man after he is born free, and that is in fact what this country does. It enslaves black people after they're born, so that the only acts that white people can do is to stop denying black people their freedom; that is, they must stop ''denying'' freedom. They never give it to anyone.&lt;ref name=Speech&gt;Stokely Carmichael, [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stokelycarmichaelblackpower.html "Black Power" speech]. Accessed March 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During Carmichael's leadership, SNCC continued to maintain a coalition with several white radical organizations, most notably [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). It encouraged the SDS to focus on militant [[Draft resistance|anti-draft]] resistance. At an SDS-organized conference at [[UC Berkeley]] in October 1966, Carmichael challenged the white left to escalate their resistance to the military draft in a manner similar to the black movement.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Bloom and Waldo E. Martin, ''Black Against Empire: The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party'' (University of California Press, 2013), pp. 29, 41-42, 102-103, 128-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a time in 1967, Carmichael considered an alliance with [[Saul Alinsky]]'s [[Industrial Areas Foundation]], and generally supported IAF's work in Rochester's and Buffalo's black communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/docs/alinsky.htm "Excerpt From SNCC Central Committee Meeting Regarding Forging a Relation With Saul Alinsky January, 1967" Jan 20, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Plotkin, [http://comm-org.wisc.edu/papers96/alinsky/woodlawn.html "Alinsky TWO: 1960s Organizing in an African-American Community"], H-Net/H-Urban Seminar on History of Community Organizing &amp; Community-Based Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
SNCC conducted its first actions against the military draft and the Vietnam War under Carmichael's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/docs/6608_sncc_draft-resist.pdf "Report on Draft Program" August 1966, Civil Rights Movement Veterans' website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Carmichael popularized the oft-repeated anti-draft slogan, "Hell no-We won't go!" during this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wgbhnews.org/post/stokely-carmichael-and-black-power-america "Of Stokely Carmichael And Black Power In America"], Boston Public Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael encouraged Martin Luther King Jr. to demand an unconditional withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam, even as some King advisers cautioned him that such opposition might have an adverse effect on financial contributions to the SCLC.  King preached one of his earliest speeches calling for unconditional withdrawal with Carmichael seated in the front row at his invitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/kingweb/about_king/encyclopedia/carmichael_stokely.html "Stokely Carmichael"], ''King Encyclopedia'', Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael privately took credit for pushing King towards [[anti-imperialism]], and historians such as Dr. [[Peniel Joseph]] and Eric Dyson agree.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/peniel-e-joseph/ "African-American History Scholar Dr. Peniel Joseph"], Tavis Smiley Show, March 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Michael Dyson, '' 'I May Not Get There With You:' The True Martin Luther King Jr.,''(Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael joined King in New York on April 15, 1967, to share his views with protesters on race related to the Vietnam War:

{{quote|The [[Conscription|draft]] exemplifies as much as racism the [[totalitarianism]] which prevails in this nation in the disguise of consensus democracy.

===Stepping down as chair===
In May 1967, Carmichael stepped down as chairman of SNCC and was replaced by [[H. Rap Brown]]. SNCC was a collective and worked by group consensus rather than hierarchically; many members had become displeased with Carmichael's celebrity status. SNCC leaders had begun to refer to him as "Stokely Starmichael" and criticize his habit of making policy announcements independently, before achieving internal agreement.&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt; According to historian [[Clayborne Carson]], Carmichael did not protest the transfer of power and was "eager to relinquish the chair."&lt;ref&gt;Clayborne Carson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fm9v7KKj_UQC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=stokely,+expelled,+1968&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hJ8pVLmdIeSCsQTetYHAAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=relinquish&amp;f=false ''In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s''] (Harvard University Press, 1981), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is sometimes mistakenly reported that Carmichael left SNCC completely at this time and joined the Black Panther Party, but those events did not occur until 1968.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kwame-ture-dead-57-cancer-fells-stokely-carmichael-article-1.818886 "KWAME TURE DEAD AT 57 CANCER FELLS FORMER STOKELY CARMICHAEL"], Associated Press (''New York Daily News''), November 16, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; SNCC officially ended its relationship with Carmichael in August 1968; in a statement, Philip Hutchings wrote, "It has been apparent for some time that SNCC and Stokely Carmichael were moving in different directions."&lt;ref name="SNCC History and Geography"&gt;{{cite web|title=SNCC History and Geography|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/SNCC_intro.shtml|website=Mapping American Social Movements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Targeted by FBI COINTELPRO===
During this period, Carmichael was targeted by a section of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s [[COINTELPRO]] (counter-intelligence program) which focused on black activists; the program promoted slander and violence against targets whom Hoover considered to be enemies of the US government. It attempted to discredit them and worse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iD6rL_e8VZMC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=cointelpro,+racism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wQjqXoaD8T&amp;sig=iwZ9T1BVGcAMZP6CjeIv5doasHw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k4EoVa-THoSogwSD3YGoCA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=cointelpro%2C%20racism&amp;f=false Jay Feldman, ''Manufacturing Hysteria: A History of Scapegoating, Surveillance, and Secrecy in Modern America'' (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2012), p. 275-278]&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael accepted the position of Honorary Prime Minister in the Black Panther Party, but also remained on the staff of SNCC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19670819&amp;id=Bo4gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8WYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2725,5283290 "SNCC Says Carmichael Now Enroute to Hanoi"], Associated Press, ''Lewiston Daily Sun'', August 19, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0wp587sj#page-11 Seidman, Sarah.

A March 4, 1968 memo from Hoover states his fear of the rise of a black nationalist "messiah" and said that Carmichael alone had the "necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way."&lt;ref name=Warden76&gt;{{cite news |last=Warden|first=Rob|title=Hoover rated Carmichael as 'black messiah'|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/F%20Disk/FBI/FBI%20Hampton%20Case%20ONeil%20William%20Jr/Item%2005.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 10, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1968, Hoover stepped up his efforts to divide the black power movement. Declassifed documents show he launched a plan to undermine the SNCC-Panther merger, as well as to "[[bad-jacketing|bad-jacket]]" Carmichael as a CIA agent. Both efforts were largely successful: Carmichael was expelled from SNCC that year, and the rival Panthers began to denounce him, putting him at grave personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kathleen Cleaver]] and George Katsiaficas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_tNQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=carmichael,+sncc,+expulsion,+cia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DNZnEkoSXi&amp;sig=Aqh6NaTmMyL9qHEiLY_68tzeJgM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0fOAU6HyLZPksATY_4DoBQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=carmichael%2C%20sncc%2C%20expulsion%2C%20cia&amp;f=false ''Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party''] (Routledge, 2014 edition), pp. 89-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Bloom and Waldo E. Martin, ''Black Against Empire: The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party'' (University of California Press, 2013), pp. 122-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International activism===
After stepping down as SNCC chair, Carmichael wrote the book ''[[Black Power: The Politics of Liberation]]'' (1967) with [[Charles V. Hamilton]], while clarifying his thinking. It is a first-person reflection on his experiences in [[SNCC]] and his dissatisfaction with the direction of the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1960s.  Throughout the work he directly and indirectly criticizes the established leadership of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] and [[NAACP]] for their tactics and results, often claiming that they were accepting symbols instead of change.

He promoted what he calls "political modernization."  This idea included three major concepts: "1) questioning old values and institutions of the society; 2) searching for new and different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems; and, 3) broadening the base of political participation to include more people in the decision-making process".&lt;ref name="1941-1998. 1992"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26096713|title=Black power : the politics of liberation in America|last=1941-1998.|first=Carmichael, Stokely,|date=1992|publisher=Vintage Books|others=Hamilton, Charles V.|isbn=0679743138|edition=  Vintage |location=New York|oclc=26096713}}&lt;/ref&gt; By questioning "old values and institutions", Carmichael was referring not only to the established Black leadership of the time, but also to the values and institutions of the nation as a whole. He criticized the emphasis on the American "middle-class."  "The values," he said, "of that class are based on material aggrandizement, not the expansion of humanity." (40)  Carmichael believed that blacks were being lured to enter the "middle-class" as a trap, in which they would be assimilated into the white world by turning their backs on others of their race who were still suffering.  This assimilation, he thought, was an inherent indictment of blackness and validation of whiteness as the preferred state. He said, "Thus we reject the goal of assimilation into middle-class America because the values of that class are in themselves anti-humanist and because that class as a social force perpetuates racism."&lt;ref name="1941-1998. 1992"/&gt;

Secondly, Carmichael discussed searching for different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems.  At the time, the established forms of political structure were the SCLC and the NAACP.  These groups were religiously and academically based and focused their attention on the concepts of non-violence and steady legal and legislative change, situated within the established systems and structures of the United States. Carmichael rejected these ideas, basing his assertions on his lived experience. He explores the development of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Mississippi Freedom Democrats]], the 1966 local election in [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County, AL]], and the political history of the town of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]].  He chose these examples as places where blacks changed the system by way of political and legal maneuvering within the system. But Carmichael said that they ultimately failed to achieve more than the bare minimum change. In the process, he believed they reinforced the political and legal structures that were perpetuating the racism they were fighting.

In response to these failures and to offer a way forward, Carmichael discussed the concept of coalition with regard to the Civil Rights Movement. The leadership of the movement had affirmed that anyone who truly believed in their cause was welcome to join and march. Carmichael offered a different vision. Influenced by the ideas of [[Frantz Fanon|Franz Fanon]] in ''[[The Wretched of the Earth|Wretched of the Earth]]'', wherein two groups were not "complementary" (could have no overlap) until they were mutually exclusive (were on an equal power footing economically, socially, politically, etc.), Carmichael said that blacks in the United States had to unite and build their power independent of the white structure. Otherwise they would never be able to build a coalition that would function for both parties, not just the dominant one. He said that "we want to establish the grounds on which we feel political coalitions can be viable."&lt;ref name="1941-1998. 1992"/&gt;  For this to happen, Carmichael argued that blacks had to address three myths regarding coalition. First, "that the interests of black people are identical with the interests of certain liberal, labor, or other reform groups." Second, that a viable coalition can be created between "the politically and economically secure and the politically and economically insecure." And third, that a coalition can be "sustained on a moral, friendly, sentimental basis; by appeals to conscience." He believed that each of these myths showed the need for two groups to be mutually exclusive, and on relatively equal footing, for them to be in a viable coalition.

This philosophy, grounded in the independence literature of Africa and Latin America (Fanon), became the basis for a great deal of Carmichael's work. He believed that the Black Power Movement had to be developed outside the white power structure.

He also continued as a strong critic of the [[Vietnam War]], and imperialism in general. During this period he traveled and lectured extensively throughout the world; visiting [[Guinea]], [[North Vietnam]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and [[Cuba]]. Carmichael became more clearly identified with the [[Black Panther Party]] as its "Honorary Prime Minister."&lt;ref name="WPOST" /&gt; During this period, he acted more as a speaker than an organizer, traveling throughout the country and internationally advocating for his vision of Black Power.&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/473.html Charlie Cobb, "From Stokely Carmichael to Kwame Ture"], ''Hartford '',  Accessed March 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael lamented the 1967 execution of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], saying:

{{quote|The death of Che Guevara places a responsibility on all revolutionaries of the World to redouble their decision to fight on to the final defeat of [[Imperialism]]. That is why in essence Che Guevara is not dead, his ideas are with us.&lt;ref name="VivaCheSinclair"&gt;[[Andrew Sinclair]], ''Viva Che!: The Strange Death and Life of Che Guevara'', 1968/re-released in 2006, Sutton Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7509-4310-6}}, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carmichael visited the [[United Kingdom]] in July 1967 to attend the [[Dialectics of Liberation]] conference. After recordings of his speeches were released by the organizers, the [[Institute of Phenomenological Studies]], he was banned from re-entering Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Norman Fowler|Fowler]]|first=Norman|title=Carmichael recordings for sale|journal=The Times|date=August 5, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1967, a Cuban government magazine reported that Carmichael met with Fidel Castro for three days and called it "the most educational, most interesting, and the best apprenticeship of [my] public life." Because relations with Cuba were prohibited at the time, after his return to the US, the government withdrew his passport. In December 1967, he traveled to France to attend an antiwar rally. There, he was detained by police and ordered to leave the next day, but government officials eventually intervened and allowed him to stay.&lt;ref name="SNCC History and Geography"/&gt;

===1968 D.C. riots===
Carmichael was present in Washington, D.C. the night after [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|King's assassination]] in April 1968. He led a group through the streets, demanding that businesses close out of respect. Although he tried to prevent violence, the situation escalated beyond his control. Due to his reputation as a provocateur, the news media blamed Carmichael for the ensuing violence as mobs rioted along U Street and other areas of black commercial development.&lt;ref name=Risen2009ch4&gt;{{cite book |last=Risen|first=Clay|title=A Nation on Fire: America in the Wake of the King Assassination|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-17710-5|chapter=April 4: U and Fourteenth|page=63|quote=Even as he was holding the line in front of Peoples, several young men were inside the pharmacy ransacking it...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael held a press conference the next day, at which he predicted mass racial violence in the streets.&lt;ref name=Risen2009ch6&gt;{{cite book |last=Risen|first=Clay|title=A Nation on Fire: America in the wake of the King assassination|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-17710-5|chapter=April 5: 'Any Man's Death Diminishes Me'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since moving to [[Washington, D.C.]], Carmichael had been under nearly constant surveillance by the FBI. After the eruption of riots, [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[J. Edgar Hoover]] instructed a team of agents to find evidence connecting Carmichael to these [[King assassination riots|events]]. He was also subjected to [[COINTELPRO]]'s [[bad-jacketing]] technique. [[Huey P. Newton]] suggested Carmichael was a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agent, a slander that led to Carmichael's break with the Panthers, and his exile from the U.S. the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher = South End Press|isbn = 978-0896086463|title = Agents of Repression: The FBI's Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement|url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL25433596M/Agents_of_Repression_The_FBI's_Secret_Wars_Against_the_Black_Panther_Party_and_the_American_Indian_M|author = Ward Churchill|edition = |publication-date = 2002|oclc = 50985124|id = 0896086461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1969–98: Travel to Africa==
Carmichael soon began to distance himself from the Panthers.  He disagreed with them about whether white activists should be allowed to participate in the movement. The Panthers believed that white activists could help the movement, while Carmichael had come to agree with [[Malcolm X]], and said that the white activists should organize their own communities first.

In 1968, he married [[Miriam Makeba]], a noted singer from [[South Africa]]. They left the US for [[Guinea]] the next year. Carmichael became an aide to the Guinean president [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], and a student of the exiled [[Ghanaian]] president-for-life [[Kwame Nkrumah]].&lt;ref name=Review&gt;Robert Weisbrot, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E6DD1438F930A15752C1A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Stokely Speaks" (review of ''Ready for Revolution'')], ''New York Times'', November 23, 2003.

Carmichael changed his name to "Kwame Ture", to honor the African leaders Nkrumah and Touré, who had become his patrons.  At the end of his life, friends still referred to him interchangeably by both names, "and he doesn't seem to mind".&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt;

Carmichael's suspicions about the CIA were affirmed in 2007, when previously secret CIA documents were declassified, revealing that the agency had tracked Carmichael from 1968 as part of their surveillance of black activists abroad. The surveillance continued for years.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-26-cia-misconduct-glance_N.htm Associated Press, "Some Examples of CIA Misconduct"], ''[[USA Today]]'', June 27, 2007. Accessed January 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael remained in Guinea after separation from the Black Panther Party. He continued to travel, write, and speak in support of international [[leftist]] movements. In 1971 he published his collected essays in a second book, ''Stokely Speaks: Black Power Back to Pan-Africanism''. This book expounds an explicitly [[socialism|socialist]], [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] vision, which he retained for the rest of his life.  From the late 1970s until the day he died, he answered his phone by announcing, "Ready for the revolution!"&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

In 1986, two years after Sékou Touré's death in 1984, the [[Lansana Conté#The Conté Presidency#1984 coup and military rule|military regime]] that took his place arrested Carmichael, for his past association with Touré, and jailed him for three days on suspicion of attempting to overthrow the government. Although Touré was known for jailing and torturing his opponents (some 50,000 people are believed to have been killed under his regime) Carmichael had never publicly criticized the man he had named himself after.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

===All-African People's Revolutionary Party===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?104471-1/life-career-kwame-ture "Life and Career of Kwame Ture"], [[C-SPAN]]&lt;ref name="cspan"&gt;{{cite web | title =Life and Career of Kwame Ture| work = | publisher =[[C-SPAN]] | date = April 15, 1998 | url =https://www.c-span.org/video/?104471-1/life-career-kwame-ture | accessdate =September 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For the final 30 years of his life, Kwame Ture was devoted to the All-African People's Revolutionary Party (A-APRP). His mentor Kwame Nkrumah had many ideas for unifying the African continent, and Ture used those ideas in a broader scope involving the entire African diaspora. He was a central committee member for the entire time that he participated in the A-APRP and made many speeches in the Party's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialjustice.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/index.php/All-African_People's_Revolutionary_Party "Social Justice Movements: All-African People's Revolutionary Party"], Columbia University website&lt;/ref&gt;

Ture did not simply study with Sékou Touré and Kwame Nkrumah. The latter had been designated honorary co-president of Guinea after he was deposed by the US-backed coup in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/kwame-nkrumah-fathered-pan-africanism "Kwame Nkrumah"] at African American Registry.&lt;/ref&gt; Ture worked overtly and covertly to "Take Nkrumah Back to Ghana" (according to the movement's slogan). He became a member of the Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG), the revolutionary ruling party of Guinea. He sought Nkrumah's permission to launch the All-African People's Revolutionary Party (A-APRP), which Nkrumah had called for in his book ''Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare.'' After several discussions, Nkrumah gave his blessing.

Ture was convinced that the A-APRP was needed as a permanent mass-based organization on all continents and in all countries in which people of African descent lived. For the remainder of his life, a period often ignored by popular media, Ture worked for decades on a full-time basis as an "organizer" of the Party. He spoke on its behalf on several continents at innumerable college campuses, in community centers, and other venues. He was instrumental in strengthening ties between the African/Black liberation movement and several revolutionary or progressive organizations, both African and non-African. Notable among them were the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) of the United States, [[New Jewel Movement]] ([[Grenada]]), [[National Joint Action Committee]] (NJAC) of Trinidad and Tobago, [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (South Africa) and the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]].

Routinely, Ture was regarded as the leader of the A-APRP, but his only title was "Organizer", and he was a member of the Central Committee. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the A-APRP began each May to sponsor African Liberation Day (ALD), a continuation of African Freedom Day begun by Kwame Nkrumah in 1958 in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanliberationday.net/?q=history ALD History], African Liberation Day.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the party was involved in or was primary or co-sponsor of other ALD annual observances, marches and rallies around the world, the best-known and largest celebration of the event was held annually in Washington, DC, usually at [[Meridian Hill Park]] (also known as Malcolm X Park) at 16th and W Streets, NW.

While based in Guinea as home, Ture traveled a good part of the time. Britain and his birth country, Trinidad and Tobago, barred him from speaking at one time or another for fear that he would arouse African-descended people in those countries. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Ture became the world's most active and prominent exponent of pan-Africanism, defined by Nkrumah and the A-APRP as "The Liberation and Unification of Africa Under Scientific Socialism."

Ture often returned to speak to large (1,000+) audiences at his alma mater, Howard University, which generally included students and community residents, and at other campuses. The Party worked to recruit students and other youth, and Ture hoped to attract them through his speeches. He also worked to raise the political consciousness of African/Black people in general. Shortly after the A-APRP was formed, he said that an initial goal was to put "Africa" on the lips of Black people throughout the [[African Diaspora]]. He knew that many may not have consciously related to the continent in a positive way after generations away. Ture was convinced, according to those who worked closely with him, that the party played a significant role in helping to raise international black consciousness of Pan-Africanism.

Under his leadership, the A-APRP organized the All African Women's Revolutionary Union and the [[Sammy Younge Jr.]] Brigade (named after the first black college student to die during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement) as component organizations.

Ture and Cuba's president [[Fidel Castro]] were mutual admirers, sharing a common opposition to imperialism. In Ture's final letter, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was Fidel Castro who before the OLAS (Organization of Latin American States) Conference said "if imperialism touches one grain of hair on his head, we shall not let the fact pass without retaliation." It was he, who on his own behalf, asked them all to stay in contact with me when I returned to the United States to offer me protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kwameture.com/ "Stokely Carmichael Interview Part 1"], KwameTure.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ture was ill when he gave his final speech at Howard University.  A standing-room-only crowd in Rankin Chapel paid tribute to him and he spoke boldly, as usual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW45PbSXyMM "Kwame Ture's last fire side chat from the Meeca-Howard Univ part 1"]. YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; A small group of student leaders from Howard University and a former Party member traveled to Harlem (Sugar Hill) in New York City to bid farewell to Kwame Ture shortly before what was his final return to Guinea. Also present that evening were [[Kathleen Cleaver]] and another Black Panther, Dhoruba bin Wahad. Ture was in good spirits though in pain. The group bidding farewell to Kwame Ture included African/Black men and women born in Africa, South America, the Caribbean, and the USA.

==Illness and death==
After his diagnosis of [[prostate cancer]] in 1996, Ture was treated for a period in Cuba, while receiving some support from the [[Nation of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaefer|first=Richard T.|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks California|page=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benefit concert]]s for Ture were held in Denver; New York; Atlanta; and Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt; to help defray his medical expenses. The government of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], where he was born, awarded him a grant of $1,000 a month for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew C. Whitaker (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RSGhEUq5bp0C&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%22kwame+ture%22+$1000+a+month&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q3ZPVoxiy1&amp;sig=tel3L_L743Zo4-1ga2onqw0jGNw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFyOjagrPLAhVBoRQKHTaCDewQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kwame%20ture%22%20%241000%20a%20month&amp;f=false ''Icons of Black America: Breaking Barriers and Crossing Boundaries''], Vol. 1, ABC-CLIO, 2011, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; He went to New York, where he was treated for two years at the [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]], before returning to Guinea.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

In a final interview given in April 1998 to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Ture had criticized the limited economic and electoral progress made by African Americans in the U.S. during the previous 30 years. He acknowledged that blacks had won election to the mayor's office in major cities, but said that, as the mayors' power had generally diminished over earlier decades, such progress was essentially meaningless.&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt;

The civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]] spoke in celebration of Ture's life, stating: "He was one of our generation who was determined to give his life to transforming America and Africa. He was committed to ending racial [[apartheid]] in our country. He helped to bring those walls down".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/215245.stm "Black Panther Leader Dies"], BBC News, November 16, 1998.

==Personal life==

Carmichael had married [[Miriam Makeba]], the noted singer from South Africa, while in the US in 1968. They divorced in Guinea after separating in 1973.

Later he married Marlyatou Barry, a Guinean doctor. They divorced some time after having a son, Bokar, in 1981. By 1998, Marlyatou Barry and Bokar were living in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], near Washington, DC. Relying on a statement from the [[All-African People's Revolutionary Party]], Carmichael's 1998 obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to his survivors as two sons, three sisters, and his mother, without further details.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Kwame Ture, along with [[Charles V. Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhavnani, Mirza, Meetoo|first=Reena, Heidi, Veena|title=Tackling the Roots of Racism: Lessons for Success|year=2005|publisher=The Policy Press|location=Bristol, England|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; is credited with coining the phrase "[[institutional racism]]"---defined as racism that occurs through institutions such as public bodies and corporations, including universities. In the late 1960s Ture defined "institutional racism" as "the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin."&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Race, [http://www.shef.ac.uk/socst/Shop/race_article.pdf "Analyzing ethnic education policy-making in England and Wales"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618142942/http://www.shef.ac.uk/socst/Shop/race_article.pdf |date=2006-06-18 }} (pdf), ''Sheffield Online Papers in Social Research'', University of Sheffield, p. 12. Accessed June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book on Martin Luther King, Jr., David J. Garrow criticized Ture's handling of the Black Power movement as "more destructive than constructive."&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt;  Garrow described the period in 1966 where Ture and other members of the SNCC managed to successfully register 2,600 African American voters in Lowndes County, Alabama, as the most consequential period in Ture's life "in terms of real, positive, tangible influence on people's lives."&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt;  Evaluations from Ture's associates are also mixed, with most praising his efforts and others criticizing him for failing to find constructive ways to achieve his objectives.&lt;ref name=stokelyfailure /&gt; SNCC's final Chair, Phil Hutchings, who expelled Ture over a dispute concerning the Black Panther Party, wrote that, "Even though we kidded and called him 'Starmichael,' he could sublimate his ego to get done what was needed to be done....He would say what he thought, and you could disagree with it but you wouldn't cease being a human being and someone with whom he wanted to be in relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Mike Miller (1999), [http://www.crmvet.org/mem/stokely1.htm "Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael) – Memories"], Civil Rights Movement Veterans website.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Washington Post'' staff writer Paula Span described Carmichael as someone who was rarely hesitant to push his own ideology.&lt;ref name="WPOST"/&gt;
[[Tufts University]] historian Peniel Joseph credits Ture with expanding the parameters of the civil rights movement, asserting that his black power strategy "didn't disrupt the civil rights movement. It spoke truth to power to what so many millions of young people were feeling. It actually cast a light on people who were in prisons, people who were welfare rights activists, tenants' rights activists, and also in the international arena." [[Tavis Smiley]] calls Ture "one of the most underappreciated, misunderstood, undervalued personalities this country's ever produced."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

In 2002, the American-born scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] listed Kwame Ture as one of his [[100 Greatest African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Asante, Molefi Kete (2002), ''10 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia''. Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-963-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Views on Adolf Hitler===
Although he stated in his posthumously published memoirs that he had never been anti-semitic, in 1970 Carmichael proclaimed: "I have never admired a white man, but the greatest of them, to my mind, was Hitler."&lt;ref name="Sundquist2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric J Sundquist|title=Strangers in the Land: Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dI8cUKQplgC&amp;pg=PA316|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04414-2|pages=315–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carmichael in the same speech condemned Hitler on moral grounds, Carmichael himself stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adolph Hitler—I'm not putting a judgment on what he did—if you asked me for my judgment morally, I would say it was bad, what he did was wrong, was evil, etc. But I would say he was a genius, nevertheless . . . . You say he's not a genius because he committed bad acts. That's not the question. The question is, he does have genius. Now when we condemn him morally or ethically, we will say, well, he was absolutely wrong, he should be killed, he should be murdered, etc., etc. . . . But if we're judging his genius objectively, we have to admit that the man was a genius. He forced the entire world to fight him. He was fighting America, France, Britain, Russia, Italy once— then they switched sides—all of them at the same time, and whipping them. That's a genius, you cannot deny that.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreti, Fred [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/14/archives/carmichael-in-objective-view-sees-hitler-as-greatest-white.html "Carmichael, in ‘Objective’ View, Sees Hitler as ‘Greatest White’"], "The New York Times", 14 April 1970. Retrieved 9 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Views on women===
In November 1964 Carmichael made a joking remark in response to a SNCC [[position paper]] written by his friends Casey Hayden and Mary E. King on the position of women in the movement. In the course of an irreverent comedy monologue he performed at a party after SNCC's Waveland conference, Carmichael said, "The position of women in the movement is prone."&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Lynn Greenberg, [http://www.crmvet.org/nars/maryking.htm#mk-women "SNCC: Born of the Sit-Ins, Dedicated to Action-Remembrances of Mary Elizabeth King"], Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement website.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of women were offended. In a 2006 ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' article, historian [[Peniel E. Joseph]] later wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While the remark was made in jest during a 1964 conference, Carmichael and black-power activists did embrace an aggressive vision of manhood — one centered on black men's ability to deploy authority, punishment, and power. In that, they generally reflected their wider society's blinders about women and politics.&lt;ref name=stoksexist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penielejoseph.com/legacy.html|title=Black Power's Powerful Legacy|author=Peniel E. Joseph|publisher=''The Chronicle Review''|date=July 21, 2006|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carmichael's colleague, [[John Lewis (civil rights leader)|John Lewis]], stated in his autobiography, ''[[March (comics)|March]]'', that the comment was a joke, uttered during moment when Carmichael and other SNCC officials were "blowing off steam" following the adjournment of a meeting at a staff retreat in [[Waveland, Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lewis (civil rights leader)|Lewis, John]] (2016). ''[[March (comics)|March: Book Three]]'', [[Top Shelf Productions]] ([[Marietta, Georgia]]), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the comment, former SNCC field secretary Casey Hayden stated: "Our paper on the position of women came up, and Stokely in his hipster rap comedic way joked that 'the proper position of women in SNCC is prone'. I laughed, he laughed, we all laughed. Stokely was a friend of mine."&lt;ref name=stokelyfailure&gt;Mike Miller, [http://www.crmvet.org/mem/stokely1.htm "Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael) - Memories"], January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Mar2004/engler0304.html]--&gt; In her memoir, [[Mary King (political scientist)|Mary E. King]] wrote that Carmichael was "poking fun at his own attitudes" and that "Casey and I felt, and continue to feel, that Stokely was one of the most responsive men at the time that our anonymous paper appeared in 1964."&lt;ref&gt;Mary E. King, ''Freedom Song: A Personal Story of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement'' (William Morrow Co., 1988), pp. 451–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmichael appointed several women to posts as project directors during his tenure as chairman of SNCC; by the latter half of the 1960s (considered to be the "Black Power era"), more women were in charge of SNCC projects than during the first half.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Ransby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fC7--GihF5AC&amp;q=stokely#v=snippet&amp;q=off-handed%20remark&amp;f=false ''Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision''], University of North Carolina Press, 2003, pp. 310–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
However, independent Tamil observers and critics have claimed it to be an attempt by Tamil nationalist politicians to outster moderate [[R. Sampanthan|R.Sampanthan]] and [[M. A. Sumanthiran]] from the leadership of the Tamil National Alliance despite denial by Vigneswaran. Moderate Tamils have expressed fears that the actions of the TPC will result in another era of ethnic violence and the accommodative Sirisena government and its liberal Sinhalese supporters clamming up as extremist slogans failed to bring a meaningful solution to the Tamil question in the past and only resulted in destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Ezhuga Tamizh' rally seen as jockeying for power in Tamil nationalistic politics irrespective of consequences| url= http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/Ezhuga-Tamizh-rally-seen-as-jockeying-for-power-in-Tamil-nationalistic-politics-irrespective-of-consequences/2016/09/25/article3629546.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boehme Portrait 1730.jpeg|thumb|right|An idealised portrait of Jakob Böhme]]

'''Theosophy''', also known as '''Christian theosophy''' and '''Boehmian theosophy''', refers to a range of positions within [[Christianity]] which focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of [[divinity]] and the origin and purpose of the universe.
They have been characterized as [[mystical]] and [[occult]]ist philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Forward, to the East: Mapthali Herz Imber's Perception of Kabbalah|last=Huss|first=Boaz|year=2013|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|volume=12|issue=3|page=398|doi=10.1080/14725886.2013.826464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy is considered part of [[Western esotericism]], which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and salvation.

The foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher [[Jakob Böhme]].

In 1875, the term "theosophy" was adopted and revived by the [[Theosophical Society]], an esoteric organisation which spawned a spiritual movement also called [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt; "Following a period of obscurity, it was then revived at the end of the nineteenth century by the Russian occultist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky" Partridge, C. (2013). Understanding the Dark Side. Chester: University of Chester. page 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.

==Etymology and terminology==
Theosophy comes from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|theosophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|θεοσοφία}}), which combines ''{{lang|grc|theos}}'' (θεός), "God"&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott: ''Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{lang|grc|sophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|σοφία}}), "wisdom". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theosophy |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion/theosophy |website=Encylopedia.com |publisher=Encylopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymological meaning is thus "wisdom of God."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}} 

The term ''theosophia'' appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early [[church fathers]], as a synonym for [[theology]]:{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name = "Lobel"&gt;{{harvnb|Lobel|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''theosophoi'' are "those knowing divine things".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "theosophos" (θεόσοφος) "wise in divine things" was applied by [[Iamblichus]] to the [[gymnosophists]] (Γυμνοσοφισταί), i.e. the Indian [[yogi]]s or [[sadhu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]] (''De mysteriis'' 7.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of esotericism such as [[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin]] and [[Antoine Faivre|Faivre]] differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by [[Helena Blavatsky]] by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Causing some confusion was the fact that a few Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey — were also theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt;

Antoine Faivre suggested that it be called "Boehmian theosophy".{{sfn|Faivre|1998|p=116}}

==Historical development==
{{see also|Transcendent theosophy}}
===Antiquity and medieval ending c. 1450 CE===
The term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name = "Lobel" /&gt; The 13th century work ''[[Summa philosophiae]]'' attributed to [[Robert Grosseteste]] made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In Summa, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Origen]] were described as persons whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms were the opposite of the present-day meaning.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th to 19th century===
During the [[Renaissance]], use of the term diverged to refer to [[gnostic]] knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century ''Theosophia'' by [[Johannes Arboreus]] provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.&lt;ref name="Faivre1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Christian theosophy and [[Pietism]] arose in response to the orthodoxy of the [[Lutheran Reformation]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=87}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="[I]n the first decades of the seventeenth century, the German cobbler Jacob Böhme (1575–1624) wrote an oeuvre of impressive depth and originality that has become foundational for one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism: Christian theosophy. In a heartfelt attempt to understand how a good God could have created a world so full of evil and suffering, Böhme developed a dramatic visionary cosmogony filled with alchemical and Paracelsian references, that described the 'birth of God' himself out of the unfathomable mysteries of the ''Ungrund''."|source=— Religious studies scholar Wouter Hanegraaff{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} }}

The work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic [[Jakob Boehme]] (1575–1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word "theosophy", even though Boehme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Boehme himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13, see also p.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Boehme gave the word "theosophy" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating [[nature]] with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehme's work has been described as being "foundational" for Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=10–11 Faivre's list of 17th century theosophers in North-Western Europe (including Germany) consists of roughly ten names.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1618–1699), [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637), [[John Pordage]] (1608–1681), [[Jane Leade]] (1623–1704), [[Henry More]] (1614–1687), [[Pierre Poiret]] (1646–1719), and [[Antoinette Bourignon]] (1616–1680).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=10-11 Henry More is added to the list by Faivre with some reservations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying [[active imagination]] in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OED|1989|}} v. XVII, p. 903.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in [[ancient Egypt]], and to [[Neo-Platonism]], and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term "theosophy" was still "practically absent" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=47 (Diderot is the one exception Faivre mentions)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Jakob Brucker]] (1696–1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work {{cite book|title=Historia critica philosophia}} (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word ''theosophy'' was often used in conjunction with {{clarify span|panosophy, i.e., a knowledge of divine things that is acquired by deciphering the supposed hieroglyphics of the concrete universe.|explain=panosophy vs. pansophy?|date=January 2015}} The term ''theosophy'' is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Robert Hindmarsh]], a printer with a Methodist background, formed a "Theosophical Society" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Hindmarsh, Robert, ''Rise and Progress of The New Jerusalem Church In England, America and Other Parts,'' Hoderson and Sons, London 1861; {{ISBN|1-4021-3146-1}}.

Groups such as the [[Martinist Order]] founded by [[Papus]] in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] (1853–1900), whose views have been described as follows: "although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nemeth IEP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common characteristics==

Faivre stated that "Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=23}}

Theosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the "theosophic current" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought  (i.e., [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], Neo-Alexandrian [[hermetism|Hermeticism]], [[Christian Kabbalah]], Paracelsism (i.e., the studying of the "prognostications" of [[Paracelsus]]), [[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|philosophia occulta]] and [[Rosicrucianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faivre noted that there are "obvious similarities" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier  theosophy "belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type", while that of modern Theosophy "reveals a more universal aspect".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences "are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern theosophy retains its western Hermetic motive, logic and end.... The continuities are greater than the differences." Handbook of the Theosophical Current , Olav Hammer, Mikael Rothstein, BRILL, 2013 {{ISBN|9789004235977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. The starting point for theosophers may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences and the aim of the theosopher is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. [[Antoine Faivre]] notes, "the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail."&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt; The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Faivre identified three characteristics of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.

''Theosophy'':
# Divine/Human/Nature Triangle: The inspired analysis which circles through these three angles. The intradivine within; the origin, death and placement of the human relating to Divinity and Nature; Nature as alive, the external, intellectual and material. All three complex correlations synthesize via the intellect and imaginative processes of Mind.  
# Primacy of the Mythic: The creative Imagination, an external world of symbols, glyphs, myths, synchronicities and the myriad, along with image, all as a universal reality for the interplay conjoined by creative mind.
# Access to Supreme Worlds: The awakening within, inherently possessing the faculty to directly connect to the Divine world(s). The existence of a special human ability to create this connection. The ability to connect and explore all levels of reality; co-penetrate the human with the divine; to bond to all reality and experience a unique inner awakening.

==Legacy and reception==

The scholar of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] described Christian theosophy as "one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} 

===Academic study===

Christian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=31, also xxx.(Preface)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French scholar [[Antoine Faivre]] had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on [[Karl von Eckartshausen]] and Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=6}}
Scholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre's definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic ''Naturphilosophie'' and therefore creates an "ideal" type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=11}}

'''Victorino Tejera''' (born Tejera Márquez; November 2, 1922 - August 25, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/newsday/obituary.aspx?n=victorino-tejera&amp;pid=190097559|title=Newsday Legacy|last=|first=|date=August 25, 2018|work=Newsday Newspaper|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a writer, scholar, and professor of philosophy with specializations in ancient Greek thought, [[Metaphysics]], [[Aesthetics]], and [[American philosophy]] ([[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]], [[Semiotics]]).

== Early life, education and diplomacy ==
Tejera attended St. Mary's College in [[Southampton|Southampton, England]], a boarding school, from 1930-1938, receiving his Matriculate (university entry status certificate) in London in 1939. He received a fellowship to study at [[Columbia University]] in the U.S., completing his Bachelor of Arts degree at the undergraduate college in philosophy ([[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]]) in 1948 and his doctorate at the graduate school in philosophy in 1956 with a dissertation on "Philosophy and the Art of Poetry". He also completed his ''docente'' (teacher's training) at the Central University of Venezuela in 1951.
 
In his early career, Tejera held the following diplomatic posts:

*United Nations Secretariat, NY (Linguistic Consultant, 1946–49). He engaged in the first simultaneous translations from French and Spanish to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_card_of_acknowledgement_.jpg|title=United Nations Certificate for Language Translation|last=Tejera|first=Victorino|date=1946|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served under UN Secretary [[Trygve Lie]] performing&amp;nbsp;simultaneous translations from French and Spanish into English.

== Intellectual influences and academic career ==

=== Years at Columbia ===
As a student at Columbia University, some of the principal teachers and direct influences on his work included the renowned intellectual and cultural historians [[John Herman Randall Jr.|John H. Randall Jr.]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Herman-Randall-Jr|title=John Herman Randall Jr.|last=Randall|first=John|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus Buchler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_Buchler|title=Justus Buchler|last=Buchler|first=Justus|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Schneider (philosopher)|Herbert W.

His early philosophic passion was Greek Philosophy, and he received instruction in Classical Greek from [[Fred Householder]]. He studied History of Philosophy, Aesthetics, and Literary Theory. He also attended summer sessions in the late 1940's at the Kenyon School of English. He was profoundly affected by the writings of [[John Dewey]] and [[George Santayana]], as well as by the work and literature of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] [[John Crowe Ransom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Crowe_Ransom|title=John Crowe Ransom|last=Ransom|first=John|date=|website=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ivor Winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvor_Winters|title=Ivor Winters|last=Winters|first=Ivor|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His art and literary interests in New York City enabled encounters with noted artists, writers, and poets of the beat generation such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Fritz Stern]], and artist [[Jacob Kainen]], with whom he formed an enduring friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/jacob-kainen-papers-9025|title=Papers of Jacob Kainen|last=Kainen|first=Jacob|date=|website=Smithsonian Archives of American Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was identified as the character 'Victor Villanueva' in Kerouac's ''[[On the Road]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beatbookcovers.com/kercomp/ontheroad.htm|title=Beat Book Covers "On the Road"|last=|first=|date=|website=Beat Book Covers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Latin American poet. Tejera published and translated poems as well.

A portrait of a gathering at Columbia mid-century with Tejera was printed in Fritz Stern's autobiography&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/books/chapters/1008-1st-ster.html|title=The Five Germanys I Have Known|last=Stern|first=Fritz|date=October 8, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the authors, and republished in the New York Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/books/review/Reiss.t.html|title=Can It Happen Here?|last=Stern|first=Fritz|date=October 8, 2006|work=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic highlights ===
Above all, Tejera felt strongly influenced by Justus Buchler's metaphysics of literary art (metaphysics of human production) and the exhibitive nature of philosophy reflected in Buchler's ''Metaphysics of Natural Complexes''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metaphysics of Natural Complexes|last=Buchler|first=Justus|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Main of Light.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Main of Light|last=Buchler|first=Justus|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of Buchler is one of the most apparent in Tejera's published works. Buchler was his dissertation adviser at Columbia when he wrote ''Philosophy and the Art of Poetry'' (1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1941882|title=Philosophy and the Art of Poetry|last=Tejera|first=Victorino|publisher=Dissertation|year=1958|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tejera|first=V|date=December 1956|title=Doctoral Dissertations 1956|jstor=20123579|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume= 10| issue = 2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and longtime colleague and correspondent.

Tejera lectured in History at Georgetown University from 1951 to 1954, and then taught Philosophy at Rensselaer Polytechnic from 1956 to 1960, Farleigh Dickinson University 1960 to 1961, and Howard University from 1961 to 1966. Afterward he accepted a permanent position of Professor of Philosophy and Comparative Literature at the State University of New York (SUNY) campus at Stony Brook. He was conferred the title of Stony Brook University Professor of Humanities in 1991, and has since received the title of University Professor Emeritus (1996).

At Stony Brook, he taught Ancient Greek Philosophy, History of Philosophy, Aesthetics, Classical Political Philosophy, American Philosophy, Ancient Greek, Philosophy of History, and [[Plato]]'s Dialogues, in a teaching career spanning 40 years.

== Research and publications ==
Tejera's extensive and varied research in the Humanities culminated in books including:

* ''Modes of Greek Thought'' (1971),&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
*''Rewriting the History of Ancient Greek Philosophy'' (1997),&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Randall Jr,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; this original work had become an important volume of Naturalist scholarship in America on the dramatic and dialogical reading of Plato. It helped groom a new generation of Plato students, and has redirected the traditional reading plan usually associated with Plato.

He added to the arts and human sciences with:

*&amp;nbsp;''History as a Human Science'' (1984),&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Contributions to Classic American philosophy ===
Tejera is the first American philosopher to apply Justus Buchler's modes of judgment to the study of history&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and aesthetics. Along with Beth J. Singer, [[Thelma Z. Lavine]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Horace S. Thayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-e-962?rskey=J6gYfy&amp;result=6|title=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|last=Thayer|first=Horace S.|date=|website=Oxford Reference|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-06-20|title=Horace Standish Thayer|url=https://sk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Horace_Standish_Thayer&amp;oldid=1025944|journal=Wikipédia|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; he helped revive interest in classic American thought via the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy (SAAP). He renewed interest in a John Dewey's philosophy of culture with an emphasis on poetics and rhetoric, Buchler's coordinative analysis, and philosophic historiography.

He contributed to the recovery of the [[Semiotics]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], especially its application to literary theory and philosophy ([[Semiotic literary criticism|Semiotics of Literature]]). Tejera's Semiotics books are a significant effort to mend the gap between scholars engaged in literary discourse and those who work in the social (or human) sciences and natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houser|first=Nathan|date=|title=Review of Literature, Criticism, and the Theory of Signs|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/houser/TEJERA.HTM|journal=Arisbe|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of art and spirituality in American philosophy permeates his Semiotics books, ''American Modern: The Path Not Taken,'' as well as later works.

His later work in American philosophy had taken two paths: (1) a theory of creative rationality via the aesthetically-aware [[Metaphysical naturalism|metaphysical Naturalism]] of Justus Buchler and Peirce's semiotics, and (2) a fuller aesthetics and poetics-oriented theory in the human sciences and in interpretation theory ([[Hermeneutics]]). His latest book, ''Two Metaphysical Naturalisms,'' serves as a companion to ''American Modern,'' dwelling on some of the practical functions of American philosophical reflection. This alignment with classic American Philosophy also contrasts with the cognitivist aesthetics of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] which turns the aesthetic object into a cognitive object while failing to recognize its dimension of feeling, or the cognitive gain available in art as art in the fullest sense which both [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]] and [[Justus Buchler]] defend.

== Plato's ''Dialogues'' and ''Rewriting the History of Ancient Greek Philosophy'' ==
Tejera's work in Plato studies emphasizes the nature of Plato's ''Dialogues'' as the dramatized conversational encounters and communicative interactions that their design shows them to be, as well as their character as literary works of art. He attends to the tone in which Plato's Socrates addresses his interlocutors to obtain satirical effects by persistent dialogical wit, humor and irony, often missed by readers. His published works on Plato establish that the dialogues are satirical of Spartan militarism and Pythagorean intellectuality, as well as of faction (reactionary dissent, partisanship, etc.) whether democratic or oligarchical. He has advanced this line of scholarship to counter the traditionalist reading of Plato with its predilection for ethical or political propositions, and supplanted it with the Columbia University School reading of the ''Dialogues'' through their literary construction and expressive speech.

Tejera offers the argument that nothing qualifies the works of Plato as expository tracts. Rather, they give every sign of being ''dialogical'' ''Dialogues''. That is, they are self-discovering works, highly orchestrated original queries''.'' Instead of supporting the dogma often labeled as "Platonic Idealism," Tejera follows internal clues and self-focusing devices in examining the formative prose of the ''Dialogues'' in line with the interpretational poetics developed in his literary theory volume (''Literature, Criticism, and the Theory of Signs'').

Tejera's most widely recognized book ''Plato's Dialogues: A Dialogical Interpretation'' (c. 1984, updated and revised 1999)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1990|title=Plato's Dialogues One by One: A Structural Analysis|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=intstudphil&amp;id=intstudphil_1990_0022_0001_0139_0140|journal=International Studies in Philosophy|volume= 22| issue = 1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced the dramatic and dialogical reading of Plato which influenced and precipitated a generation of Plato studies (cf. Gerald A. Press  editions in Further reading below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Columbia History of Western Philosophy|last=Popkin|first=Richard|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tejera invented and invoked a unique notation to address the confusion in Plato scholarship to address the Socratic problem in these and other papers, to disambiguate Plato's Socrates from the Historical Socrates, Xenophon's Socrates, and the various interpretations claimed to be Plato's own views. "To keep track of the many ''composite'' Socrates, both of "the tradition" and of individual commentators, we use the label SocC, "[[Socrates]] sub upper-case C." (cf. ''The Philosophy of Socrates Program Guide'' p.&amp;nbsp;106).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.hri.org/iagp/books/vol05.html|title="Dialogical Dynamics, Socrates, and Source-Criticism" from The Philosophy of Socrates, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Greek Philosophy in Samos Greece 1990|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=Athens, Greece|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tejera's notations for keeping track of Socrates ===
The conventions (subscripts) he used to note the ''kinds'' of Socrates that we are liable to encounter in discussions of Greek literature and philosophy include the following: 
* SocP - [[Plato]]'s Socrates - as a dramatic character in Plato's Dialogues. Plato's Socrates teases or is polite, refutes or rationalizes, is logical in argument or paralogical, tells stories to his interlocutors, allusively satirizes, or suspends judgment, and appears as seeking for definitions which he then cannot accept. Plato's Socrates was inductive, interrogative, skeptical, anti-dogmatic and in that sense anti-systematic. He is also a story-teller, poet-quoter, myth-maker, punster, ironic etymologizer, and intellectually scrupulous. SocP frequently quotes the poets he is misinterpreted as hating.
* SocH - Historical Socrates - as a questioner, or knowledge seeker, a critical non-conformist, a critical seeker after truth and competence. The Socrates who claimed to know only that he did not know is both SocH and SocP. We only know a small number of facts regarding SocH. We do not know enough about SocH to state that there was any such thing as a "circle of Socrates". 
* SocX - [[Xenophon]]'s Socrates - based on Xenophon's testimony in his works, that Socrates is a Spartanizer, chauvinist, conventional tutor of a militarist, but not a philosopher.
* SocHc - [[Cicero]]'s Socrates - based on Cicero's testimony, as in ''Academic''a ''I''. 
* SocC - Composite Socrates - the traditional Socrates that had been handed down by the Pythagorizing or Platonist tradition of Plato-interpretation. The conventional composite reading of Plato. Also, the view of Socratism (or Socraticism) associated with the composite view, often limited to the practice of interrogation and induction, or the theory of ideas as in [[Socratic Club|I.M. Crombie]] (Doctrines), [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J.N. Findlay]] (Unwritten Doctrines), et al.  
* SocC + (x) is the notation used to specify a Plato scholar. For more instances of this notation, we found SocCa for [[John P. Anton|Anton's Socrates]], and SocCr for Rossetti's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rossettiweb.it/livio/|title=Livio Rossetti|last=Rossetti|first=Livio|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates.  
* SocD - Doctrinal Socrates - Socrates derived from a literalistic reading, as a advancing a system of doctrine.  
* SocCn - [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s Socrates - Nietzsche's attitude to Socrates. Nietzsche had characterized Plato as a doctrinal system builder of the Idealist tradition. The aphoristic Nietzsche is anti-systematic, an anti-system builder in order to be free to question his own assumptions. Nietzsche both liked and disliked the undisambiguated SocC of the 'tradition'.   
* SocDn - Nietzsche's Socrates doctrinal subscript - 'Socrates' that is found to hold different doctrines by different expositors. The Socrates that Nietzsche disliked, a composite of traits derived from Diogenes Laertius and Xenophon, a composite both a culture hero ''and'' attached to some rationalist dogmas.  
* SocU - Socrates Undisambiguated - an unknown or uncritically formed Socrates. A Socrates to which fabulous predicates are attached, as in SocC. The undistributed Socrates of "the tradition". (An undistributed middle term), e.g., "Socrates was the first to discourse on the conduct of life". This label is for the complexly ambiguous, difficult to disambiguate (or not worth disambiguating) "Socrates" of much anti-dialogical writing about Socrates that fails to practice source-criticism. This "undistributed" Socrates, as in the fallacy of the undistributed middle term, because it is so often used as such. It sanctions the avoidance of distinction between SocP and SocH, or the other [[Socrates]]. 
* SocLy - Socrates in the ''Lysis'' - the fictional report by Socrates himself of a conversation he once held. These are sophistical traits that are incompatible traits with SocP. An un-Socratic Socrates, using un-Socratic language.
* SocL - [[Diogenes Laërtius|Diogenes Laertius's]] Socrates - Socrates of the Biographical tradition, which is also historically unreliable. A view of Socrates via popular beliefs, and by beliefs, doctrines, as Laertius does. Socrates as a mishmash of contradictory attributes, but some traits coincide with traits of both SocP and SocX, all hearsay good or bad recorded about Socrates. 
* SocA - [[Aristophanes]] Socrates - the dramatic character in Aristophanes comedy ''[[The Clouds]]''.  
* SocAs - [[Leo Strauss|Strauss]]'s Aristophanean Socrates - an interpretive construction formed in response to "the ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy", derived from a non-dialogical reading of Plato.   
* SocXs - Strauss's Xenophantean Socrates - A Socrates that is accepting of the views of Ischomachus in Xenophon. Strauss's Socrates that is in the main SocX with some traits of SocP super-added and derived from a literalist reading of both which reinforce doctrines of [[Laws (dialogue)|Plato's ''Laws'']] (''Laws'' is a "posthumous" work not by Plato himself. External and internal evidence point to it as an Academic production likely issued under the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] head of [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]] [[Speusippus|Speusippos]] after Plato's death). Another notation, SocPs, Plato's Socrates according to Strauss.

Tejera is the first to utilize such conventions and standards of source-critical practices in the study of Greek Philosophy. It was the first substantial utility since the writing of [[Eric A. Havelock|Eric Havelock]] on the Socratic problem&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orb.binghamton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1083&amp;context=sagp|title=The Socratic Problem: Some Second Thoughts|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1979|website=Binghampton University Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which modern scholars were plagued, and which had ended "in a dilemma of contradiction" (Havelock).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1990|title=Plato's Dialogues One by One A Structural Analysis|url=|journal=International Studies in Philosophy|volume= 22| issue = 1|pages=139–140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric A. Havelock|Eric Havelock]] had grouped the efforts of Plato interpretation scholars among the following 1) Sceptics, [[Olof Gigon]] and [[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], 2) Alternatives to the Sceptics, [[Gregory Vlastos]], [[Terence Irwin]], and Gerasimos X. Santas 3) and the Reconstructionists of Socraticism, [[Kenneth Dover|Kenneth J. Dover]] and [[W. K. C. Guthrie|W.K.C. Gutherie]]. This was ushered in by the earlier and now century old tradition of Plato interpretation via the [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] - [[Alfred Edward Taylor|A.E. Taylor]] thesis (my terminology, and first cited in an early article by Havelock&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havelock|first=Eric|date=1934|title=The Evidence for the Teaching of Socrates|url=https://monoskop.org/images/b/ba/Havelock_Eric_A_1934_The_Evidence_for_the_Teaching_of_Socrates.pdf|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=65|pages=287–292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fifty Years (And Twelve) of Classical Scholarship|last=Ross|first=Sir David|publisher=Basil Blackwell - Oxford|year=1968|isbn=|location=Great Britain|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which in effect had rendered Plato as a mere reporter of the doctrines of Socrates (Theory of Forms, Ideas), and with the middle dialogues together comprising all of the historical Socrates, SocH. These concerns are also addressed in the recent works of Charles H. Kahn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/plato-and-the-socratic-dialogue/E5D70E71413FE839481C150667847A15|title=Plato and the Socratic Dialogue|last=Kahn|first=Charles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are in contradistinction with Tejera's and Havelock's works that minimize the value of the early-middle-late dialogue categorization, and the [[Stylometry|stylometrics]] enforced accounts. With the utility of Tejera's conventions, modern scholars have the advantage of addressing such dilemmas in a progressive and orderly fashion, whether from classicist, philosophical and historical orientations. A fuller examination and citations of these approaches may be found in the recent work of the philologist Holger Thesleff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Thesleff|title=Holger Thesleff|last=Thesleff|first=Holger|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he notes Tejera's observations about the dogmatic interpretations of Plato, and the "Post-Platonic dogmatization of Platonism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Plato's Two-Level Model|last=Thesleff|first=Holger|publisher=The Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters|year=1999|isbn=|location=Helsinki, Finland|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tejera's Naturalistic view of Aristotle ===
Tejera's three books on [[Aristotle]] (''Return of the King''&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/978-0-7618-0926-5|title=The Return of the King: The Intellectual Warfare Over Democratic Athens|last=Tejera|first=Victorino|publisher=Rowman Littlefield|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', Two Metaphysical Naturalisms''&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;'','' and ''Aristotle in Epitome''&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;) show how Aristotle was turned into a Platonizing logician by a long series of Alexandrian, Latin and Byzantine commentators, who in turn used Aristotle as a proper "introduction to Plato", a Plato that had been Pythagorized by the Academy (as an Academic reinterpretation of the dialogues) and initiated after his lifetime, in secondary literature. This long tradition of rendering Aristotle and misshaping of Plato is contested by Tejera as the dogmatic anti-dialogical and doxographical tradition of interpretation, and forms the basis of his inquiry into the pre-Scholastic Aristotle. These books help the reader to recover the Naturalist (nature-inquirer), and humanist Aristotle, lover of poetic drama.

== Honors ==
Professor Tejera was a founding member of the International Plato Society in [[Perugia]], Italy in 1989, a member of the International Organizing Committee for the International Conference on [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek Philosophy]], and was made an Honorary Citizen of [[Lindos]], [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]] for his work on Greek Culture in 1992. He served as Program Chair for the Committee for Aesthetics in 1968 and on the Executive Committee of the Long Island Philosophy Society in 1976. In 1986, he was Program Director for the Society for Advancement of American Philosophy conference honoring [[John Herman Randall Jr.|John H. Randall Jr.]], and [[Herbert Schneider (philosopher)|Herbert W. Schneider]].

'''William Ellery Channing''' (April 7, 1780 – October 2, 1842) was the foremost [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher in the [[United States]] in the early nineteenth century and, along with [[Andrews Norton]] (1786–1853), one of Unitarianism's leading theologians. Channing was known for his articulate and impassioned sermons and public speeches, and as a prominent thinker in the liberal theology of the day. His religion and thought were among the chief influences on the [[New England]] [[Transcendentalist]]s although he never countenanced their views, which he saw as extreme. He espoused, especially in his "Baltimore Sermon"&lt;ref name="American Unitarian Conference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/unitarianchristianity.htm|work=Unitarian Christianity|title=American Unitarian Conference|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of May{{nbsp}}5, 1819, given at the ordination of the theologian and educator [[Jared Sparks]] (1789–1866) as the first minister of the newly organized [[First Unitarian Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|First Independent Church of Baltimore]], the principles and tenets of the developing philosophy and theology of [[Unitarianism]], leading to the organization in 1825 of the first Unitarian denomination in America ([[American Unitarian Association]]) and the later developments and mergers between Unitarians and Universalists, resulting finally in the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association of America]] in 1961.

==Life and work==

===Early life===

Channing, the son of William Channing and Lucy Ellery, was born April{{nbsp}}7, 1780, in [[Newport, Newport County, Rhode Island]]. He was a grandson of [[William Ellery]] (1727–1820), a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], Deputy Governor of Rhode Island, Chief Justice, and influential citizen. He became a [[New England]] [[Liberalism|liberal]], rejecting the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrines of [[total depravity]] and [[divine election]].

Channing enrolled at [[Harvard College]] at a troubled time, particularly because of the recent [[French Revolution]]. He later wrote of these years:

{{quote|College was never in a worse state than when I entered it. Society was passing through a most critical stage. The French Revolution had diseased the imagination and unsettled the understanding of men everywhere. The old foundations of social order, loyalty, tradition, habit, reverence for antiquity, were everywhere shaken, if not subverted. The authority of the past was gone.&lt;ref name=Broaddus22&gt;Broaddus, Dorothy C. ''Genteel Rhetoric: Writing High Culture in Nineteenth-Century Boston''. Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina, 1999: 22. {{ISBN|1-57003-244-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Graduating first in his class in 1798, he was elected commencement speaker though he was prohibited by the Harvard College faculty from mentioning the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and other political subjects in his address.&lt;ref name=Broaddus22/&gt;

===As theologian===
[[Image:William Ellery Channing.JPG|thumb|Statue of William Ellery Channing standing on the edge of the [[Public Garden (Boston)|Boston Public Garden]], in Boston, Massachusetts]]

In opposition to traditional American Calvinist orthodoxy, Channing preferred a gentle, loving relationship with God. He opposed [[Portal:Calvinism|Calvinism]] for

{{quote|… proclaiming a God who is to be dreaded. We are told to love and imitate God, but also that God does things we would consider most cruel in any human parent, "were he to bring his children into life totally depraved and then to pursue them with endless punishment" (Channing 1957: 56).&lt;ref name=Channing39&gt;Channing, William Ellery. "The Moral Argument Against Calvinism". pp.  39–59 in ''Unitarian Christianity and Other Essays''. Edited by Irving H. Bartlett. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill; 1957 [1820]. Cited in Finlan, Stephen. "Jesus in Atonement Theories". In ''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus''.  Edited by Delbert Burkett. London: Blackwell; 2010: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Channing's inner struggle continued through two years during which he lived in [[Richmond, Virginia]], working as a tutor for [[David Meade Randolph]]. He came to his definitive faith only through much spiritual turmoil and difficulty. Channing was called as pastor of the [[Federal Street Church (Boston)|Federal Street Church]] in Boston in 1803, where he remained for the rest of his life. He lived through the increasing tension between religious liberals and conservatives and took a moderate position, rejecting the extremes of both groups. In 1809 he was elected a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815 Channing engaged in a noted controversy on the principles of [[Unitarianism]] with [[Samuel Worcester (theologian)|Samuel Worcester]], (1770–1821).&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Worcester, Noah (clergyman)|display=Worcester, Noah, clergyman|year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of a pamphlet on American Unitarianism (''American Unitarianism; or a Brief History of the Progress and Present State of the Unitarian Churches of America''), attributed to [[Jeremiah Evarts]], was published in ''[[The Panoplist]]'' in June 1815. Channing objected to the way Unitarians in the United States were portrayed in the review. Worcester replied to this objection, and an exchange of pamphlets followed.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Worcester, Samuel|author=Harris Elwood Starr|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding his moderate position, Channing later became the primary spokesman and interpreter of Unitarianism, after sixteen years at Boston's Federal Street Church. He was invited to come south again to [[Maryland]] to preach the ordination sermon of the future noted educator and theologian [[Jared Sparks]] (1789–1866), the first minister (1819–1823) called to the newly organized congregation (1817) in [[Baltimore]] known as the [[First Unitarian Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|First Independent Church of Baltimore]] (located at West Franklin and North Charles Streets, in a landmark two-year-old structure designed by noted French émigré architect [[Maximilian Godefroy|J. Maximilian M. Godefroy]]), later known, after a merger with Second Universalist Church in 1935, as the [[First Unitarian Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist)]], which was forever after known as "The Baltimore Sermon".&lt;ref name="American Unitarian Conference"/&gt; The sermon, or address, was given on Wednesday, May{{nbsp}}5, 1819, and was entitled "Unitarian Christianity". In it, he explicated the distinctive tenets of the developing Unitarian movement, one of which was the rejection of the [[Trinity]]. Other important tenets were the belief in human goodness and the subjection of theological ideas to the light of [[reason]]. (The anniversary of the address is celebrated and observed annually by the [[Maryland]] churches of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and its [[Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association|Joseph Priestley District]] as "Union Sunday", with occasional [[ecumenical]] guests from other Christian bodies.)

In 1828 he gave another famous ordination sermon, entitled "Likeness to God". The idea of the human potential to be like God, which Channing advocated as grounded firmly in scripture, was seen as heretical by the [[Portal:Calvinism|Calvinist]] religious establishment of his day. It is in this address that Channing first advocated the possibility for revelation through reason rather than solely from Scripture. ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |year = 2007 |ISBN = 0415939267 |page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at the end of his life he adhered to the non-[[Socinianism|Socinian]] belief in the [[preexistence of Christ]]:

{{quote|I have always inclined to the doctrine of the preexistence of Christ, though am not insensible to the weight of your objections" (Boston, March&amp;nbsp;31, 1832)&lt;ref&gt;''Memoir of William Ellery Channing: with extracts from his correspondence'', Volume{{nbsp}}2 p.{{nbsp}}416&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Later years===

In later years Channing addressed the topic of [[slavery]] although he was never an ardent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. Channing wrote a book in 1835 entitled ''Slavery.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/slavery02changoog SLAVERY]&lt;/ref&gt; Channing has, however, been described as a [[Romantic racism|romantic racist]].&lt;ref&gt;''Black Abolitionism: A Quest for Human Dignity'', Beverly Eileen Mitchell, pp. 133–38&lt;/ref&gt; He held a common American belief about the inferiority of African people and slaves and held a belief that once freed, Africans would need overseers. The overseers (largely former slave masters) were necessary because the slaves would lapse into laziness. Furthermore, he did not join the abolitionist movement because he did not agree with their way of conducting themselves, and he felt that voluntary associations limited a person's autonomy. Therefore, he often chose to remain separate from organizations and reform movements. This middle position characterized his attitude about most questions although his eloquence and strong influence on the religious world incurred the enmity of many extremists. Channing had an enormous influence over the religious (and social) life of New England, and America, in the nineteenth century.

Toward the end of his life Channing embraced immediate abolitionism. His evolving view of abolitionism was fostered by the success of British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition]] in the [[British West Indies]] in 1834 and the absence of the expected social and economic upheaval in the post-emancipated [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].

Channing wrote extensively about the emerging new national literature of the United States, saying that national literature is "the expression of a nation's mind in writing", and "the concentration of intellect for the purpose of spreading itself abroad and multiplying its energy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F_MilVnnDugC&amp;pg=PA1242 Remarks on National Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[Image:WilliamEChanningGrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of William Ellery Channing at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts]]
Channing died in [[Old Bennington, Vermont]], where a [[cenotaph]] is placed in his memory. He is buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/190 "William Ellery Channing"], ''Find a Grave Memorial'', August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:William Ellery Channing statue and Channing Memorial Church, Touro Park, Newport, Rhode Island.jpg|thumb|right|Channing Memorial Church and statue in Newport]]
* In 1880, a young Unitarian minister in Newport, [[Charles Timothy Brooks]], published a biography, ''William Ellery Channing, A Centennial Memory''. 

* The Channing Memorial Church&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channingchurch.org Channing Memorial Church]&lt;/ref&gt; was built in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in 1880 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth.

* In 1885 the [[Channing School For Girls]] opened in London, primarily for the daughters of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|British]] Unitarian ministers. 

* A bronze statue of Channing by [[William Clark Noble]] was erected in 1892 in Newport's [[Touro Park]] across from the Channing Memorial Church. 

* A bronze statue of Channing by [[Herbert Adams (sculptor)|Herbert Adams]] was erected in 1903 on the edge of the [[Boston Public Garden]], at Arlington St. and [[Boylston Street|Boylston St.]] It stands across the street from the [[Arlington Street Church]] that he served (and from the [[Federal Street Church (Boston)|Federal Street Church]]).

* A portrait of him also hangs in the foyer of the [[First Unitarian Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist)]] at North Charles and West Franklin Streets in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], along with the aforementioned "Union Sunday" annual commemoration services in May.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

* Channing had a profound impact on the [[Transcendentalism]] movement though he never officially subscribed to its views. However, two of Channing's nephews, [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]] (1818–1901) and [[William Henry Channing]] (1810–1884), became prominent members of the movement.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Definition==
As a noun, Zenga is a style of Japanese calligraphy and painting, done in [[ink]]. In many instances, both calligraphy and image will be in the same piece. The calligraphy denotes a poem, or saying, that teaches some element of the true path of Zen. The brush painting is characteristically simple, bold and abstract.
==History==
Though [[Zen Buddhism]] had arrived in [[Japan]] at the end of the 12th-century, Zenga (as here described) didn't come into its own until the beginning of the [[Edo period]] in 1600.

==Subject matter==
In keeping with individual paths to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], nearly any subject matter can lend (and has lent) itself to Zenga. Everything from a cat, to a [[bamboo]] shoot, to a man defecating in a field has been used to illustrate a particular point - although [[Ensō|enso]], sticks and [[Mt. Fuji]] are the most common elements.
