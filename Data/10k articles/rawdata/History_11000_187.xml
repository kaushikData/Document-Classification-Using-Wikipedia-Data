'''/r/IAmA''' is a [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] for question-and-answer interactive interviews termed "AMA" (short for "Ask Me Anything"). AMA interviewees have ranged from various celebrities to everyday people in several lines of work. Founded in May 2009, the subreddit has gone on to become one of [[Reddit]]'s most popular communities.

== Concept ==
IAmA is based around posting "AMAs" (for "Ask Me Anything"), or similarly "AMAAs" (Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything)&amp;nbsp;– prompts for others to ask questions about any topic. AMAs are open to all Reddit users, but interviewees require proof that they are who/what they claim to be. They use the site's comment system for both questions and answers; this process has been equated to an online press conference.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Like the rest of [[Reddit]], users can also upvote and downvote potential candidates - with the most favoured being more likely to receive an answer.

=== History ===
According to ''[[The Atlantic]]'', this concept is new to the digital age. They deemed the closest equivalents to be [[game show]]s, and radio [[call-in]] shows, which placed a heavy focus on the interviewees.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Contrastingly, /r/IAmA places more emphasis on users answering the questions.

The concept's genesis on the internet began in the 1990s; [[Slashdot]] launched similar interviews in 1999, but only 10 questions per person were allowed. Participants included free software advocate [[Bruce Perens]] and [[Linux]] developer [[Alan Cox]]. This was followed by [[Something Awful]]'s Ask/Tell forums, which was more focused on interviews with everyday people. 

Reddit built on this idea with video interviews with site staff [[Alexis Ohanian]] and [[Erik Martin]]. The following demand for AMAs led to the creation of the current /r/IAmA subreddit in May 2009. Unlike its precursors, it requires proof of identity.  Since its founding, similar features have appeared in other [[social media]] sites, like [[Tumblr]] and [[Ask.fm]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participants ==
Initially, AMAs focused more on ordinary citizens; these interviews still make up some of the subreddit's content today.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As Reddit expanded, its staff attempted to bring in celebrity guests—early examples include businesswoman [[Caterina Fake]]. Since then, a number of individuals have been interviewed in the IAmA subreddit, some of whom have appeared multiple times. Notable participants include then-United States President [[Barack Obama]] (while campaigning for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]]),&lt;ref name="potus-telegraph"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Gates]] (multiple times),&lt;ref name="gatesAMA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;,  and [[Bernie Sanders]] (amidst the 2018 midterm elections).{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Other people, including [[Donald Trump]], have conducted AMAs in a similar fashion on other parts of Reddit.&lt;ref name="trumpAMA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased traffic for Obama's AMA brought down many parts of the website when it occurred on August 29, 2012.&lt;ref name="ITWorld"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities participating in AMAs have seen both positive and negative responses. In 2012, [[Woody Harrelson]]'s AMA was criticized after Harrelson declined to answer questions that were unrelated to the movie he was then promoting.&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt; By contrast, rapper Snoop Dogg's 2012 AMA attracted 1.6 million page views&lt;ref name="Mashable"/&gt; after he provided several candid responses to the community's questions.&lt;ref name="AtlanticWire"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
{{see also|Reddit#2015|}}
From 2013 to 2015, Victoria Taylor assisted reddit's volunteer community in presenting interviews.&lt;ref name="Adweek"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Dot"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She primarily transcribed spoken celebrity responses, but also helped organize timing, affirmed best practices, and assisted in preparation.&lt;ref name="Observer Victoria"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 2, 2015, hundreds of subreddits, including several with over a million subscribers, were set to private by their respective volunteer moderators after Taylor was dismissed.&lt;ref name="Verge"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These moderators stated that a primary factor for the shutdown was a lack of warning for Reddit's decision; Reddit provided no immediate replacement for Taylor's services. Sources closer to Reddit users cited an increased focus on commercializing AMAs as the most likely reason.&lt;ref name="Observer Victoria"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Agranat Commission''' (Hebrew: ועדת אגרנט) was a National Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate failings in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in the prelude to the [[Yom Kippur War]], when Israel was found unprepared for the Egyptian attack against the [[Bar Lev Line]] and a simultaneous attack by Syria in the [[Golan]]—the first phase in a war in which 2,812 Israeli soldiers were killed.

==The Commission==
The commission was an official National Commission of Inquiry appointed by the [[Israel]]i government to investigate the circumstances leading to the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War]]. The [[Public Committee (Israel)|Committee]] was headed by [[Shimon Agranat]], Chief Justice of [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israel's Supreme Court]]. Its other members were Justice [[Moshe Landau]], State [[Comptroller]] [[Yitzchak Nebenzahl]], and former Chiefs of Staff [[Yigael Yadin]] and [[Chaim Laskov]]. The Committee sat for 140 sessions, during which they listened to the testimony of 58 witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, William, ''Israel Observed: An Anatomy of the State''. Thames and Hudson, 1980. Page 271.&lt;/ref&gt; It was established on 21 November 1973 with a remit to investigate:
# The intelligence information for the days preceding the Yom Kippur War on the enemy's moves and intentions to launch the war, the evaluation of this information, and the decisions taken by the responsible military and civil authorities in response thereto.
# The general deployment of the IDF in case of war, its state of readiness during the days preceding the Yom Kippur War, and its operations up to the containment of the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Moshe, ''Story of My Life''. {{ISBN|0-688-03076-9}}. 1976. Page 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

It did not examine the later stages of the war when the IDF went on the offensive.

On 31 December 1973, elections that had been delayed by the war took place. [[Likud]], a new political party, won 39 seats in the Knesset. Newly elected Member of [[Knesset]] and one of the Likud founders, Reserve General [[Ariel Sharon]] gave a newspaper interview in which he was quoted as saying that he would disobey orders that he felt were against the interests of the State or his subordinates. This caused so much public concern that Sharon was asked to appear before the Commission,&lt;ref&gt;Peri, Yoram. ''Between Battle and Ballots: Israeli Military in politics''. {{ISBN|0-521-24414-5}}. 1983. Page 118. Interview in ''Maariv'', 25 January 1974. "When I receive an order, I treat it according to three values: the first, and most important, is the good of the state. The state is the supreme thing. The second value is my obligation to my subordinates, and the third value is my obligation to my superiors."&lt;/ref&gt; which accepted his testimony that the quote was in the context of a specific event which occurred under very exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Laquer, Rubin. Page 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
The commission's report was published in three parts. The interim report, released 1 April 1974, called for the dismissal of a number of senior officers in the IDF and caused such controversy that Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] was forced to resign. The second part was published 10 July 1974 and contained the reasons for the conclusions of the first report. The final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter and Rubin, Barry, ''The Israeli-Arab Reader: A Documentary History of the Middle East Conflict''. 1984, {{ISBN|0-14-022588-9}}. Page 487.&lt;/ref&gt; One consequence of the Commission's investigation was the "Basic Law: The Army (1975)", clarifying the IDF's legal status.

===The Interim Report===
Published on 1 April 1974, the Interim Report caused a sensation. Its headline recommendation was the dismissal of four senior officers in [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|military intelligence]]: The Chief of Military Intelligence Major General [[Eli Zeira|Eliyahu Zeira]], his deputy Brigadier Aryeh Shalev, the head of the Egyptian Department Lt Colonel Yona Bendman, and the chief intelligence officer in the Southern Command Lt Colonel David Gedalia.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, page 606.&lt;/ref&gt; The report also was critical of what it called the "concept" in military intelligence thinking. The "concept" was based on the assumption that Egypt would only attack if it had the air-power to take on the [[Israeli Air Force]]. Military intelligence also thought that Syria would only attack if Egypt did. In the absence of any upgrading of Egypt's air force, the directorate concluded there was no threat of imminent war.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, page 271. Shlaim, Avi ''The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World''. 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-140-28870-4}}. Page 319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven, Stewart, ''The Spymasters of Israel''. 1980, ninth printing 1988. {{ISBN|0-345-33927-4}}. Page 358:" [Zeira] was one of the architects of what was known as 'the concept.'

Simply stated, the concept laid down first that the Arabs were not ready for an all-out war with Israel. Though they had the ability to launch a limited war, they knew perfectly well that Israel would not feel itself bound by the rules of that game, and a limited war would quickly escalate into a general one. Second, Zeira's concept laid down, if there was to be a war, it would be a short one. The third assumption was that in an overall war, the Arabs would be quickly defeated."&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption  led to complacency and evidence being ignored. For example, on 1 October and again on 3 October 1973, Lieutenant [[Benjamin Siman Yov]], order of battle intelligence officer for the Southern Command, gave his superior Lt Colonel Gadalia documents indicating Egypt's war preparations.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Chaim, ''The Arab-Israeli Wars: War and Peace in the Middle East''.  1982, {{ISBN|0-85368-367-0}}. page 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its examination of the senior echelons of the IDF, the commission also concluded that GOC Southern Command [[Shmuel Gonen]] should be dismissed. After his departure, Gonen argued that he had only been in the post for a few months and that the command had been neglected by his predecessor Ariel Sharon.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, page 158.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commission also found Chief of Staff [[David Elazar]] responsible, but it refused to give an opinion on the responsibility of the Minister of Defense [[Moshe Dayan]], arguing that this was beyond its remit.

This report caused public uproar and unhappiness in the army. In [[Abba Eban]]'s words "The conclusions ... did not seem to accord with the narrative"&lt;ref&gt;Eban, Abba, ''An Autobiography''. 1977, {{ISBN|0-297-77270-8}}. page 568.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yitzhak Rabin]] walked out of the cabinet with Elazar.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, Leah, ''Rabin: Our Life, His Legacy''. 1997, {{ISBN|0-399-14217-7}}.  page 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim, page 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days after the publication of the Interim Report, [[Golda Meir]] announced the resignation of her government.

After his dismissal, Elazar maintained that had he been given more of the information, he would have mobilized the IDF sooner. This only confirmed the Commission's criticisms about the reliance on a single avenue for intelligence analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, page 359: "At the end of the war, Chief of Staff Elazar claimed that 'some two hundred cables' from Israeli agents around the world indicating that war was imminent never reached him."&lt;/ref&gt; Elazar died two years later aged 48.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Final Report===
The final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975. The completed report was 1,500 pages long, with 746 pages devoted to the fighting in the south and 311 to the northern front. Forty two pages were made public, the remainder being classified.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, page 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laquer, Pages 491–492.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the IDF's failures, it looked at the issues around civilian and political control of the army and found a "lack of clear definitions...". Surprisingly, they could not find a clear statement of civilian control over the military. They argued that the Basic Law: The Cabinet (1968) implied authority when it stated that the Cabinet has authority over all areas not covered by other legislation. Later critics argued that the Cabinet's authority stemmed from the IDF Order (1948), which authorised the Minister of Defence to set up the army. Further questions arose over hundreds of orders issued by Chiefs of Staff since 1948 without authorisation from the Minister of Defence. These discoveries led to the swift enactment of Basic Law: The Army (1975). Its main clause stated:
* The Army is subject to the authority of the Cabinet.
* The Minister responsible is the Minister of Defense.
* The supreme commander of the Army is the Chief of Staff.
* The Chief of Staff is subject to the authority of Cabinet and subordinate to the Minister of Defence.

The new law still left some issues unresolved, such as who appoints a Chief of Staff and whether the Chief of Staff was the most senior officer in the army.

In practice, the controversy about the report's absence of criticism of Moshe Dayan led to a strengthening of the Chief of Staff's position since he could argue that if the Chief of Staff had sole responsibility, it must be the Chief of Staff's decision. The Chief of Staff was now a regular attender of cabinet meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Peri, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was critical of the standard of everyday discipline in the IDF: "Discipline is indivisible. For example, a soldier who becomes accustomed in time of peace not to observe the minor rules, such as in matters of personal appearance, without being alerted to this failure by his superior officer, will in the end be negligent in carrying out operational orders."&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Page 494.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the Commission's criticism of using military intelligence as the sole route for analysis of information, the Foreign Ministry established a Research and Planning Department.&lt;ref&gt;Eban, page 579.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, five years later the 29th Comptrollers Report into the conduct of the IDF during [[Operation Litani]], which left 21 IDF soldiers dead, concluded that conditions remained the same as in 1973. The Report's author was [[Yitzhak Nebenzahl]], a member of the Agranat Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, page 117. Published May 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full text of the report, except for 48 pages, was made public 1 January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/agranat_eng.htm Agranat Commission lexicon entry] Knesset website {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of the report==
The findings of the Agranat Commission have been the focus of sharp debate among the Israeli public up until today. Particular criticism relates to its exoneration of the country's political leadership, especially Defense Minister Dayan. According to the Report: "As long as he accepts the opinions of his advisers, he does not bear any personal responsibility."

Further criticism responds to the Commission's recommendations, stemming from the failure of military intelligence to assess the Arab states' intent, that the IDF should not consider the intentions of hostile states, but rather their capacity for war. Thirty years later, [[Giora Eiland]], head of the National Security Council, wrote: "Both the proscription against considering intent and the concentration on the prevention of threats—two central messages of the Agranat Commission [Report]—frustrated and delayed the rebuilding and preparedness of the IDF for years."

}}'''Bern Dibner''' (18{{nbsp}}August 1897{{snd}}6{{nbsp}}January 1988) was an electrical engineer, industrialist, and historian of science and technology. He originated two major US library collections in the [[history of science and technology]].

==Early life and education==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
&lt;!-- Any connection to Hebrew Technical Institute? (need references) --&gt;
Dibner was born in Lisianka, near [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] in 1897. His family was [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Avrich]], ''The Modern School Movement: Anarchism and Education in the United States'', Princeton University Press (2014), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the [[United States]] with his family at the age of 7. In 1921, he graduated from the [[Polytechnic University of New York|Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]] with a degree in Electrical Engineering.  

==Career==
Soon after graduating, Dibner designed and patented the first [[crimp connector|solderless electrical connector]]s and founded the [[BURNDY|Burndy Engineering Company]] in 1924.  The company later became the Burndy Corporation and was bought by the French corporation Framatome Connectors International (FCI) in 1988.&lt;ref name=nytimes_burndy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/06/business/company-news-burndy-takes-bid-from-framatome.html |title=COMPANY NEWS; Burndy Takes Bid From Framatome |publisher=New York Times |date=1988-12-06 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Burndy was acquired and became a subsidiary of Hubbell Incorporated.&lt;ref name=busnesswire_burndy&gt;{{cite web|author=Business Wire |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090722005559/en/Hubbell-Reaches-Agreement-Acquire-Burndy%C2%AE |title=COMPANY NEWS; Hubbell Agrees to Acquire Burndy |publisher=Businesswire.com |date=2009-07-22 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dibner died at his home in [[Wilton, Connecticut]] on January 6, 1988.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3105470|title=Bern Dibner (1897-1988)|first=Silvio A.|last=Bedini|date=1 January 1989|publisher=|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=30|issue=1|pages=189–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Burndy" appellation, used for both his company and the library he would found, was invented by Dibner himself and represents a [[portmanteau]] or blend of his first and last names.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Historical research and libraries==
In addition to electrical engineering, Dibner studied the history of technology.  He was an avid collector of original scientific works and of books on the history of science, as well as thousands of portraits of various scientists. Bern Dibner also wrote a great number of books on the history of science, such as ''The Atlantic Cable'' in 1955.&lt;ref name=ac_at_si&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/hst/atlantic-cable/ |title=The Atlantic Cable by Bern Dibner |publisher=Sil.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976 he was awarded the [[George Sarton Medal|Sarton Medal]] by the [[History of Science Society]].

Dibner, who was fascinated by both art and technology, found great pleasure in studying [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. This interest led him to obtain a small library of works about da Vinci which grew over the years as Dibner's interests expanded into the [[history of electricity]], the history of [[Renaissance]] technology, and finally the [[history of science and technology]] in general. His collection continued to grow, and in 1941 he formally set up the [[Burndy Library]] as a separate institution "to advance scholarship in the history of science."   By 1964, the Burndy Library collection totaled over 40,000 volumes and Dibner opened a new building in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], to house the Library.

In 1974, Bern Dibner donated one-quarter of the Burndy Library's then holdings to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to form the nucleus of a research library in the history of science and technology, to be located in the decade-old [[National Museum of History and Technology]] (now called [[National Museum of American History|The National Museum of American History: Kenneth E. Behring Center]]). In 1976, the Smithsonian's [[The Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology|Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/libraries/Dibner/about.cfm|title=History of the Dibner Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established, providing the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]] with its first rare book collection, containing many of the major works dating from the fifteenth to the early nineteenth centuries in the history of science and technology including engineering, transportation, chemistry, mathematics, physics, electricity and astronomy.  The Smithsonian Dibner Library, then numbering 35,000 volumes, was reopened after construction in spring 2010, and is located in the [[National Museum of American History]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref name="DibnerLibraryReopen2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.americanhistory.si.edu/osaycanyousee/2010/05/reopening-the-dibner-library-of-science-and-technology.html |title=Reopening the Dibner Library of Science and Technology - O Say Can You See? |publisher=Blog.americanhistory.si.edu |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Smithsonian Institution Libraries have cataloged the books and manuscripts of the Dibner Library and entered the records into the international database [[OCLC]] and the Smithsonian's own online catalog, SIRIS.&lt;ref name="DibnerLibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/libraries/Dibner/about.cfm |title=History of the Dibner Library &amp;#124; Smithsonian Libraries |publisher=Sil.si.edu |date=2012-04-05 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bern Dibner's death in 1988, the Burndy Library moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1992, where it became the research library for the [[Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  In November 2006, the complete Burndy Library collection, by then consisting of 67,000 rare volumes and a collection of scientific instruments, was donated to and became part of the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]], where it is available to scholars. The Huntington Library now offers a Dibner History of Science Program to fund fellowships, a lecture series and annual conference.&lt;ref name=DibnerProgram&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dibner History of Science Program|url=http://huntington.org/uploadedFiles/Files/PDFs/pr_dibner_program.pdf|work=Huntington Library [website]|publisher=The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">The '''Black Audio Film Collective''' ('''BAFC'''), founded in 1982 and active until 1998, comprised seven [[Black British]] and diaspora [[multimedia artist]]s and film makers: [[John Akomfrah]], Lina Gopaul, Avril Johnson, Reece Auguiste, Trevor Mathison, Edward George and Claire Joseph. Joseph left in 1985 and was replaced by David Lawson. The group initially came together as students at [[Portsmouth Polytechnic]] (their backgrounds included sociology, fine art and psychology),&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Clark, [http://www.filmcomment.com/entry/rep-diary-black-audio-film-collective "Rep Diary: Black Audio Film Collective"], Film Comment, 3 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and after graduation relocated to [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] in [[east London]].

==Background==
The formation of the Black Audio Film Collective, like that of [[Sankofa Film and Video Collective]], was a response to the social unrest in Britain in the 1980s: "Influenced by contemporary debate on post-colonialism and social theorists such as [[Homi_K._Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]] and [[Stuart_Hall_(cultural_theorist)|Stuart Hall]], both groups centered around investigations of black identity/culture within the British experience and reworked the documentary to articulate new voices in British cinema."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinemaproject.org/screenings/fall/2004/black-audio-and-sankofa/ "Black Audio &amp; Sankofa Film Collectives"], Cinema Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The BAFC's output has been variously described as "an extraordinary body of poetic, allusive, and intensely personal films, videos, and 'slide-tape texts' that chronicled England’s multicultural past and present and pushed the boundaries of the documentary form",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bam.org/film/2014/black-audio-film-collective "Black Audio Film Collective"], BAMcinématek.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the expression of a generation of diasporic subjects that seized the idea of 'blackness' as an identity marker as well as a claim to political visibility."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cencia.gsu.edu/black-audio-film-collective/ “Black Audio Film Collective”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028180345/http://cencia.gsu.edu/black-audio-film-collective/ |date=October 28, 2014 }}, CENCIA, Georgia State University.&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneering films they produced are still considered influential.&lt;ref&gt;The Otolith Group, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/this_day_remains/ "This Day Remains"], Frieze, Issue 106, April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Celluloid Liberation Front, [http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/film/2012/09/handsworth-1985-re-writing-riots "Handsworth, 1985: Re-writing the riots – The Black Audio Film Collective's film still resonates"], ''New Statesman'', 24 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' critic [[Adrian Searle]], "the works the BAFC made during the 80s and early 1990s are almost shocking in their range.... The collective was heavily informed by film and psychoanalytic theory, by political discussion and debate.... Perhaps the most significant achievement of the group was the formulation of a poetic, a tone of voice, a particular kind of filmic space that resisted categorisation."&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;Adrian Searle, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/27/art.features "Voices of the rising tide"], ''The Guardian'', 27 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Kodwo Eshun]], they "projected a stance of high seriousness with seductive stylishness".&lt;ref name=Searle /&gt;

BAFC produced what the [[British Film Institute]] identifies as "some of the most challenging and experimental documentaries in Britain in the 1980s".&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;Paul Ward, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/502424/ "Black Audio Film Collective (1982-98)"], BFScreenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among their oeuvre is 1986's ''[[Handsworth Songs]]'', a [[essay#film|film essay]] that makes unconventional use of newsreel and archive material of the [[1985 Handsworth riots|autumn 1985 civil disturbances in Birmingham]] and London to explore memories of immigration and the different ways in which race was experienced and British society dealt with the black presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbohp.org.uk/node/20 "Handsworth Songs. Film by John Akomfrah and the Black Audio Film Collective, 1986"]. Birmingham Black Oral history project.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ogidi, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/441093/index.html "Handsworth Songs (1986)"], BFI Screenonline.&lt;/ref&gt; Kodwo Eshun, writing in 2004, referred to the reputation of ''Handsworth Songs'' "as the most important and influential art film to emerge from England in the last twenty years."&lt;ref&gt;Kodwo Eshun, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nka/summary/v019/19.eshun.html "Untimely Meditations: Reflections on the Black Audio Film Collective"], ''Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art'', Number 19, Summer 2004, pp. 38-45. Excerpt at Project Muse.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective was dissolved in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iniva.org/library/archive/people/b/black_audio_film_collective "Black Audio Film Collective"], Iniva.&lt;/ref&gt; after which John Akomfrah, Lina Gopaul and David Lawson went on to found Smoking Dogs Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smokingdogsfilms.com/01home.htm |title=Smoking Dogs Films. |access-date=2014-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220155445/http://smokingdogsfilms.com/01home.htm |archive-date=2015-02-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major retrospective of the BAFC, entitled "The Ghosts of Songs", toured between 2 February and 1 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smokingdogsfilms.com/bafc/ "The Ghosts of Songs: A Retrospective of the BLack Audio Film Collective 1982 – 1998.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3404">The '''Cave of Euripides''' is a narrow cave, approximately 47 meters deep with ten small chambers, on a hillside overlooking the [[Saronic Gulf]] in the area of Peristeria on the south coast of [[Salamis Island]], [[Greece]]. Its name derives from its reputation since ancient times as the place where the playwright [[Euripides]] came to write his [[tragedy|tragedies]]. The ancient authors [[Philochorus]] and [[Satyrus the Peripatetic|Satyrus]] described Euripides as a misanthrope who avoided society by lurking in a cave. The second century Roman author [[Aulus Gellius]] claimed to have visited the "grim and gloomy cavern" during his visit to Athens (Attic Nights XV.20).

==Archaeology==
In the 1990s, excavations were carried out under the direction of Yannos G. Lolos, Assistant Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the [[University of Ioannina]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], in collaboration with the Department of [[Palaeoanthropology]] of the Greek Ministry of Culture.

Finds date from the late [[Neolithic]] onward. They include stone implements and arrowheads; [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] burials; 5th century BC Attic [[Pottery of ancient Greece|black glaze pottery]]; Roman period coins and [[votive]] figurines; and jewellery from the Frankish period, generally suggesting its long-term use as a place of refuge and worship. The most notable discovery was a fragmentary black-glaze [[skyphos]] dating from the late 5th century BC, with the letters ΕΥΡΙΠΠ, clearly part of the name Euripides, carefully inscribed in letters of the [[Hellenistic]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. Lolos interpreted the cup as a votive offering to Euripides, confirmation of the devotion his poetry inspired in later periods.

Lolos also uncovered the foundations of a small rural sanctuary about 70 meters southwest of the cave, on the trail from the shore. Based on a marble phallus and other finds, he interpreted it as a sanctuary of [[Dionysus]], the patron god of Greek theatre.

The cave, unsignposted, is located between the settlements of [[Salamis Island#Peristeria|Peristeria]] and Kolones, about 350 meters northwest of the north end of Euripides Street, up a clear footpath. There is a steel door.

'''Choghadiya''' Panchang is a [[Vedic]] [[Hindu]] calendar. Showing [[Dina (pancanga)|Dina]], [[Nakshatra]], [[Tithi]], [[Yoga]], [[Karana (pancanga)|Karana]] for everyday,  with automatic adjustment for any city in the world based on Sunset and sunrise of every city in the world. 

==Etymology ==
''Ghadi'' (now used for a clock in Hindi) is an ancient measure for calculations of time in India roughly equivalent to 24 minutes. ''Cho-ghadiya'' means four ''ghadi'' which totals to 96 minutes. Most of choghadiya are of a figure around 96 minutes.

==About==
As per Vedic Astrology, it is advisable to perform necessary prayers, on a particular time phase of the day to get maximum benefits of health, wealth and prosperity. One can get the appropriate time of [[Muhurta]] (Auspicious Occasion)  from the [[Panchanga|Panchang]].

==Types of Choghadiya==
There are totally seven types of Choghdiya.
* Amrut, Shubh and Labh are considered the most auspicious Choghadiyas. (Time Period)
* Char is considered as good Choghadiya . (Time Period)
* Udveg, Kal and Rog is considered inauspicious.(NB: Udveg means Trepidation i.e a feeling of fear or anxiety about something that may happen.)

==Method of calculation==
Each day is divided into two time periods: 
[[Daytime (astronomy)|Daytime]]   - the period from sunrise to sunset  
[[Nighttime]] - the period from sunset to sunrise. 

Each period contains eight Choghadiya's. The daytime difference is arrived at by calculating the difference between [[Sunrise]] and [[Sunset]] and dividing the same by 8.

===Example===

Day 1: [[Sunrise]] at 6:00 AM and [[Sunset ]] at 6:01 pm
Day 2: [[Sunrise]]  at 6:00 am

based on the above 
The daytime period is 12 hours and 01 minutes (721 minutes).
The nighttime period is 11 hours and 59 minutes (719 minutes).

Therefore, each daytime Choghadiya lasts 721/8 = 90.125 minutes = 1 hour 30 minutes 7.5 seconds
And each night-time Choghadiya last 719/8 = 89.87  minutes = 1 hour 29 minutes 52.5 second

The '''Codex Huamantla''' also known as the '''Codex of Huamantla''' and '''Códice de Huamantla''' is a [[Otomi people|Otomi]] [[codex]]. It contains the work of two artists, and is believed to have been completed in 1592 [[Common Era]], during the [[Postclassical Era|Post-Classical period]]. The first artist depicts the story migration of the Otomi people from [[Chiapan]] to [[Huamantla]]. A second artist later depicted the Otomi's participation in the conquest of Mexico and life under Spanish domination. Seven fragments of the codex are currently held in Mexico's [[National Museum of Anthropology and History]], and two fragments are in Germany's [[Deutsche Staatsbibliothek]].

== The Codex ==
The center of the painting depicts the migration of a group of [[Otomi people]] from [[Chiapan]] to [[Huamantla]], under the protection of the goddess [[Xochiquétzal]] and of [[Otontecuhtli]], lord of the Otomi and of fire.&lt;ref name="wdl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3244/ | title=Codex of Huamantla | publisher=World Digital Library | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work depicts the path taken by the pilgrims with footsteps and the places marked by toponymic glyphs and in some cases by their founding myths.&lt;ref name="MDL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bdmx.mx/detalle.php?id_cod=20 | title=Códice de Huamantla | publisher=Mexican Digital Library | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tenochtitlan]], the Aztec capital is represented with its glyph and tutelary god, possibly [[Huitzilopochtli]].&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt;

A second pictograph was made above the first by a different artist.&lt;ref name=wdl /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt; It shows the participation of the Otomi in the conquest of Mexico and the lives of the Otomi under Spanish domination.&lt;ref name=wdl /&gt; Fragments of the codex include a Franciscan monastery, church and a friar believed to depict Pedro Melendez, who initiated the construction of the buildings in 1570.&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt;

== Date of creation ==
The exact date of the original work is unknown, but the addition of the second part by a different artist is presumed to have been completed in 1592.&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt; The work contains a line in [[Nahuatl]] which is read in Spanish as "''Aquí llegó el capitán hace setenta y tres años''".&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt; This is a direct reference to [[Hernán Cortés]] and the passage of seventy-three years, which indicates the year was 1592.&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt; It is presumed that because this portion is on the edge of the work that was added last.&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt;

== Fragments ==
The manuscript consists of several fragments with several of portion having been lost.&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt; The codex is made of bark paper which was painted.&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt; The original work measures 8.5 meters long and 1.90 meters wide.&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt; Seven of the fragments are in Mexico's [[National Museum of Anthropology and History]] and the remaining two fragments are in the [[Deutsche Staatsbibliothek]] in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref name="MDL" /&gt;

'''Colleen Margaretta McCullough''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Australia|AO]]}} ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|ə}}; married name '''Robinson''', previously '''Ion-Robinson''';&lt;ref name="tehageobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=peerage&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p16301.htm#i163007 The Peerage]. Retrieved 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 1 June 1937{{spaced ndash}}29 January 2015) was an Australian author known for her novels, her most well-known being ''[[The Thorn Birds]]'' and ''[[The Ladies of Missalonghi]]'', the latter of which was involved in a plagiarism controversy.

==Life==
McCullough was born in 1937 in [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]], in the [[Central West (New South Wales)|Central West]] region of [[New South Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/colleen-mccullough "About Colleen McCullough"], fantasticfiction.co.uk; retrieved 3 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; to James and Laurie McCullough.&lt;ref name="rope"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2041318.htm ''Enough Rope'' - Transcript of McCullough interview with [[Andrew Denton]]] (24 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was of Irish descent and her mother was a New Zealander of part-[[Māori people|Māori]] descent. During her childhood, the family moved around a great deal and she was also "a voracious reader".&lt;ref name="Mary Jean DeMarr Page 2"&gt;Mary Jean DeMarr, Colleen McCullough: a critical companion, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Her family eventually settled in [[Sydney]] where she attended Holy Cross College, [[Woollahra]],&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/30/colleen-mccullough|title=Colleen McCullough obituary|work=The Guardian|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=30 January 2015|author=Cheetham, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; having a strong interest in both science and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-29/australian-author-colleen-mccullough-dies/6055952|title=Colleen McCullough: Internationally acclaimed Australian Thorn Birds author dies aged 77|publisher=ABC News|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a younger brother, Carl, who drowned off the coast of [[Crete]] when he was 25 while trying to rescue tourists in difficulty. She based a character in ''The Thorn Birds'' on him, and also wrote about him in ''Life Without the Boring Bits''.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Steger, "McCullough cut through the small talk". [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-thorn-birds-author-colleen-mccullough-cut-through-the-small-talk-20150130-131smu.html Profile], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 31 January 2015; retrieved 2 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before her tertiary education, McCullough earned a living as a teacher, librarian and journalist.&lt;ref name="Mary Jean DeMarr Page 2"/&gt; In her first year of medical studies at the [[University of Sydney]] she suffered [[dermatitis]] from surgical soap and was told to abandon her dreams of becoming a medical doctor. Instead, she switched to [[neuroscience]] and worked at [[Royal North Shore Hospital]] in Sydney.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

In 1963, McCullough moved for four years to the United Kingdom; at the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] in London she met the chairman of the neurology department at [[Yale University]] who offered her a research associate job at Yale. She spent 10 years (April 1967 to 1976) researching and teaching in the Department of Neurology at the [[Yale Medical School]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], United States. While at Yale she wrote her first two books. One of these, ''[[The Thorn Birds]]'', became an international best seller and one of the best selling books in history, with sales of over 30 million copies worldwide, that in 1983 inspired one of the most-watched television miniseries of all time.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

The success of these books enabled her to give up her medical-scientific career and to try to "live on [her] own terms."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jean DeMarr, ''Colleen McCullough: a critical companion'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, after stints in London and Connecticut, she settled on the isolation of [[Norfolk Island]], off the coast of mainland Australia, where she met her husband, Ric Robinson.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; They married in April 1984.&lt;ref name=peerage/&gt; Under his birth name Cedric Newton Ion-Robinson, he was a member of the [[Norfolk Legislative Assembly]]. He changed his name formally to Ric Newton Ion Robinson in 2002.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

McCullough's 2008 novel, ''The Independence of Miss Mary Bennet'' engendered controversy with her reworking of characters from [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. [[Susannah Fullerton]], the president of the Jane Austen Society of Australia, said she "shuddered" while reading the novel, as she felt that [[Elizabeth Bennet]] was rewritten as weak, and [[Mr. Darcy]] as savage. Fullerton said: "[Elizabeth] is one of the strongest, liveliest heroines in literature … [and] Darcy's generosity of spirit and nobility of character make her fall in love with him – why should those essential traits in both of them change in 20 years?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevedow.com.au/Default.aspx?id=360 ''The Independence of Miss Mary Bennet''], stevedow.com.au; accessed 3 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

McCullough died on 29 January 2015, at the age of 77, in the Norfolk Island Hospital from apparent renal failure after suffering from a series of small strokes. She had suffered from failing eyesight due to hemorrhagic [[macular degeneration]], osteoporosis, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetes and uterine cancer, and was confined to a wheelchair.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Colleen McCullough, Author of ''The Thorn Birds'', Dies at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/books/colleen-mccullough-author-of-the-thorn-birds-dies-at-77.html?ref=obituaries|accessdate=29 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tehageobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/books/colleen-mccullough-author-of-the-thorn-birds-dies-20150129-131dka.html|title=Colleen McCullough, author of The Thorn Birds, dies|author=Susan Wyndham|work=The Age|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 1984, a portrait of McCullough, painted by Wesley Walters, was a finalist in the [[List of Archibald Prize winners|Archibald Prize]]. The prize is awarded for the "best portrait painting preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics".&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archibald Prize 07|publisher=Art Gallery NSW|url=http://www.thearchibaldprize.com.au/finalists|accessdate=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depth of historical research for the novels on ancient Rome led to her being awarded a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree by [[Macquarie University]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/nsw/stories/s376367.htm McCullough awarded Doctor of Letters], abc.net.au; accessed 3 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] on 12 June 2006, "[f]or service to the arts as an author and to the community through roles supporting national and international educational programs, medico-scientific disciplines and charitable organisations and causes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1132828&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true McCullough profile], itsanhonour.gov.au; retrieved 2 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past [[precedent]]ial decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as ''[[stare decisis]]''). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a "[[Case of first impression|matter of first impression]]"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v.

By the early 20th century, legal professionals had come to reject any idea of a higher or natural law, or a law above the law.

== Definitions ==
The term ''common law'' has many connotations. The first three set out here are the most-common usages within the legal community. Other connotations from past centuries are sometimes seen, and are sometimes heard in everyday speech.

=== Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law {{Anchor|Disambiguate_statute}} ===
The first definition of "common law" given in ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 10th edition, 2014, is "The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASELAW, [contrast] STATUTORY LAW."  &lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=1. The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASE LAW [contrast to] STATUTORY LAW.}}  ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' is the most-used legal dictionary used among legal professionals in the U.S.{{cite web|url=https://library.law.yale.edu/us-legal-dictionaries|title=U.S. Legal Dictionaries|last=|first=|date=|website=library.law.yale.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries, is characterized as the “most common” usage among legal professionals, and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuhaimeDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonProbateDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USvTexas"&gt;For an example of this usage in a decision of the United States Supreme Court, see the quote from ''United States v Texas'' in the section “[[Common law#Interaction with statute|Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law]]” below.&lt;/ref&gt; In this connotation, "common law" distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, the law in most [[Anglo-America]]n [[jurisdiction]]s includes "[[statute|statutory law]]" enacted by a [[legislature]], "[[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]]" (in the U.S.) or “[[Primary and secondary legislation|delegated legislation]]” (in the U.K.) promulgated by [[executive branch]] agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or "[[case law]]", ''i.e.'', decisions issued by [[courts]] (or [[quasi-judicial]] [[tribunal]]s within agencies).&lt;ref name="salmond32"&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|first connotation]] can be further differentiated into
; (a) pure common law: arising from the traditional and inherent authority of courts to define what the law is, even in the absence of an underlying statute or regulation. Examples include most [[criminal law]] and [[procedural law]] before the 20th century, and even today, most [[contract law]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Allen Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts, §&amp;nbsp;1.7, Aspen (2004) (although certain fields of contract law have been modified by statute, "judicial decisions [remain] the dominant primary source of contract law.")&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of torts]].&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts"&gt;Stuart Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts, §§&amp;nbsp;1:2, 1:5, and 1:6, Thompson Reuters (2013) (describing common law development of tort law in England and the United States, and the "little reluctance [of courts] to overrule (or disapprove statements in) decisions in tort law either now deemed wrong or inadvisedly considered" and disinclination toward any contention that change must be by legislation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute"&gt;''E.g.'', Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341 (defining a new rule of contract law with no basis in statute); ''Marbury v. Madison'', 137 5 U.S. 137 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.");''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916) (discussed [[common law#CL Common Law Evolves|elsewhere in this article]], adjudicating the tort of negligence that existed in no statute, and expanding the law to cover parties that had never been addressed by statute);  Alexander Hamilton, ''[[The Federalist]]'', Nos. 78 and 81 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), 521–530, 541–55 ("The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body."); see [[rule against perpetuities]] for a judicially created law originating in 1682 that governs the validity of trusts and [[future interests]] in [[real property]], [[Rule in Shelley's Case]] for a rule created by judges in 1366 or before, and [[life estate]] and [[fee simple]] for rules of real property ownership that were judicially created in the late 12th century as the crown began to give law-making power to courts.&lt;/ref&gt;
; (b) interstitial common law: court decisions that analyze, interpret and determine the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies. This body of common law, sometimes called "interstitial common law", includes judicial interpretation of the [[Constitution]], of legislative statutes, and of [[Regulation (law)|agency regulations]], and the application of law to specific facts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;
Publication of decisions, and indexing, is essential to the development of common law, and thus governments and private publishers publish [[law reports]].&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, large legal publishers include West Publishing and Lexis. In the UK, examples of private reports are the [[All England Law Reports]] and the [[Lloyd's Law Reports]]&lt;/ref&gt; While all decisions in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions]] are precedent (at varying levels and scope as discussed throughout the article on [[precedent]]), some become "leading cases" or "landmark decisions" that are cited especially often.

=== Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems {{Anchor|Disambiguate_civil_law}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 2, differentiates "common law" jurisdictions and legal systems from "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" or "[[Codification (law)|code]]" jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef1"/&gt; Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered "law" with the same force of law as statutes—for nearly a millennium, common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists, and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean.&lt;ref&gt;It is characteristic of the common law to adopt an approach based "on precedent, and on the development of the law incrementally and by analogy with established authorities".  ''Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police'', Supreme Court, [2018] UKSC 4, para.21.[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails, or is combined with common law, in Europe and most non-Islamic, non-common law countries), courts lack authority to act if there is no statute.  Civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent, which means that a civil law judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently (compared to a common law judge in the same circumstances), and therefore less predictably. For example, the [[Napoleonic code]] expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law.&lt;ref&gt;"5. The judges are forbidden to pronounce, by way of general and legislative determination, on the causes submitted to them." [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book1/c_preliminary.html Code of Napoleon, Decree of March 5, 1803, Law 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of providing overarching principles, which in common law jurisdictions is provided in judicial opinions, in civil law jurisdictions is filled by giving greater weight to scholarly literature, as explained [[Common law#CL academic writings|below]].

Common law systems trace their history to England, while civil law systems trace their history through the [[Napoleonic Code]] back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radford.edu/~junnever/law/commonlaw.htm|title=Description and History of Common Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html|title=The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law as opposed to equity {{Anchor|3. Law as opposed to equity}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 4, differentiates "common law" (or just "law") from "[[equity (law)|equity]]".&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=4. The body of law derived from law courts as opposed to those sitting in equity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salmond32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef2"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage | last = Garner | first= Bryan A. | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = New York | edition = 2nd, revised | ref = harv|p=177|quote=Second, with the development of equity and equitable rights and remedies, ''common law'' and equitable courts, procedure, rights, and remedies, etc., are frequently contrasted, and in this sense ''common law'' is distinguished from ''equity.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1873, [[England and Wales|England]] had two complementary court systems: courts of "law" which could only award [[Monetary damages|money damages]] and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of "equity" ([[courts of chancery]]) that could issue [[injunction|injunctive relief]] (that is, a [[court order]] to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized [[trust (law)|trusts]] of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule2.htm Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 2] ("There is one form of action—the civil action.") (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedmanxix"&gt;{{harvnb|Friedman|2005|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law. Nonetheless, the historical distinction between "law" and "equity" remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following:
* categorizing and prioritizing [[rights to property]]—for example, the same article of property often has a "[[Equitable title#Equitable versus legal title|legal title]]" and an "[[equitable title]]", and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people.
* in the United States, determining whether [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Seventh Amendment's]] right to a [[jury trial]] applies (a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a "common law" claim)&lt;ref&gt;"In Suits at common law ... the right of [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."&lt;/ref&gt; vs. whether the issue will be decided by a [[judge]] (issues of what the law is, and all issues relating to equity).
* the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review (issues of law are reviewed ''de novo'', that is, "as if new" from scratch by the appellate tribunal, while most issues of equity are reviewed for "abuse of discretion", that is, with great deference to the tribunal below).
* the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied.
Courts of equity rely on common law principles of binding precedent.

=== Archaic meanings and historical uses {{Anchor|4. Historical uses}} ===

In addition, there are several historical (but now archaic) uses of the term that, while no longer current, provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of "common law" today.

In one usage that is now archaic, but that gives insight into the history of the common law, "common law" referred to the pre-Christian system of law, imported by the Saxons to England, and dating to before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], and before there was any consistent law to be applied.&lt;ref name="JeffersonToCooper"&gt;One example of this usage is in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper. {{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_cooper.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=February 10, 1814|quote=Authorities for what is common law may therefore be as well cited, as for any part of the Lex Scripta, and there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present; where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none, and to submit us at one stroke to a whole system, no particle of which has its foundation in the common law. For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JeffersonToCartwright&gt;Another example of this usage is in another letter of Jefferson, to John Cartright.{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter To Major John Cartwright|url=http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/jefferson/cartwright.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=June 5, 1824|quote=I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary, which you have adduced, is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That usage is obsolete today. It is both underinclusive and overinclusive.

"Common law" as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with ''[[ius commune]]''. While historically the ''ius commune'' became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref name="Ius Commune' p.20"&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'' p.20 (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-85423-165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.

''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 3 is "General law common to a country as a whole, as opposed to special law that has only local application."&lt;ref name="Blacks10th"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by [[Circuit court|itinerant judges]] who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice in "[[assize]]s". The term "common law" was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt; The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt;

== Basic principles of common law ==

=== Common law adjudication ===

In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine "what the law is" in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kent Gionfriddo, Thinking Like a Lawyer: The Heuristics of Case Synthesis, 40 Texas Tech. L.Rev. 1 (Sep. 2007) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012220] [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209]&lt;/ref&gt; First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines "what the law is". Then, one applies that law to the facts.

In practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular [[jurisdiction]], and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by [[appellate courts]] are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, [[constitutional law]], [[statutory law]] and [[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]] also give rise to considerable complexity.

=== The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding {{anchor|CL_Common_Law_Evolves}} ===
[[File:Holmes Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902.]]
[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] cautioned that "the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions."&lt;ref&gt;Frederic R. Kellog, Law, Morals, and Justice Holmes, 69 Judicature 214 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] noted the "common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively", but "[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 22–23 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and [[social philosophy]]. Second, the common law evolves through a series of [[incrementalism|gradual steps]], that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.&lt;ref&gt;The beneficial qualities of the common law's incrementalist evolution was most eloquently expressed by the future [[Lord Mansfield]], then Solicitor General Murray, in the case of ''Omychund v. Barker'', who contended that "a statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is for that reason superior to an [[Act of Parliament|act of parliament]]." I Atk. 21, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 22–23 (Ch. 1744)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).

One example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in [[privity of contract]]. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Winterbottom v. Wright'', 10 M&amp;W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842)&lt;/ref&gt; the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The ''Winterbottom'' court recognized that there would be "absurd and outrageous consequences" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.

A first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm ''Thomas v. Winchester''], 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852)&lt;/ref&gt; when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put "human life in imminent danger". ''Thomas'' relied on this reason to create an exception to the "privity" rule. In, 1909, New York held in ''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.'', 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn "was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed".

Yet the privity rule survived. In ''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'', 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915)&lt;/ref&gt; (decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was "no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes." The ''Cadillac'' court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for "an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor". However, held the ''Cadillac'' court, "one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,"
[[File:Cardozo Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Benjamin Cardozo to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1932.]]
Finally, in the famous case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916)[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1916, [[Benjamin Cardozo|Judge Benjamin Cardozo]] for New York's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to ''Cadillac'' a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:

{{quote|It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgesen v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.

We hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.}}

Cardozo's new "rule" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the "thing of danger" principle stated in them, merely extending it to "foreseeable danger" even if "the purposes for which it was designed" were not themselves "a source of great danger". ''MacPherson'' takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright|Winterbottom]]'', that "absurd and outrageous consequences" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." But while adhering to the underlying principle that ''some'' boundary is necessary, ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.|MacPherson]]'' overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.

The example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles: (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have "made law" for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts" /&gt; (b) The [[ratio decidendi|reasons given for a decision]] are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.

=== Publication of decisions ===

All law systems rely on written publication of the law,&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil" /&gt; so that it is accessible to all. Common law decisions are published in [[law reports]] for use by lawyers, courts and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=148|title=Legal Dictionary – Law.com|work=Law.com Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American Revolution, Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law.&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil"&gt;Social Law Library, Common Law or Civil Code?, Boston Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function [[United States Reports#history|in 1874]]. [[West (publisher)|West Publishing in Minnesota]] is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions "in the raw," while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.

=== Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law{{anchor|Interaction_with_statute}} ===

In common law legal systems, the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in [[English law|England and Wales]], in English Canada, and in most states of the [[Law of the United States|United States]], the basic law of [[contract]]s, [[tort]]s and [[property law|property]] do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;''Meister v. Moore'', 96 U.S. 76 (1877) ("No doubt a statute may take away a common law right, but there is always a presumption that the legislature has no such intention unless it be plainly expressed.")&lt;/ref&gt; held that a [[Michigan]] statute that established rules for [[solemnization]] of marriages did not abolish pre-existing [[common-law marriage]], because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law.

In almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, on Contracts for the Sales of Goods]&lt;/ref&gt; or the criminal law),&lt;ref&gt;[[Model Penal Code]] as adopted in several states, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/nycodes/c82.html New York's Penal Law]&lt;/ref&gt; legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]]. To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate [[precedent]]ial decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by [[analogy]].

In ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions (in the sense opposed to "civil law")]], legislatures operate under the assumption that [[statute]]s will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law. As the United States Supreme Court explained in ''United States v Texas'', 507 U.S. 529 (1993):

:Just as longstanding is the principle that "[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident." ''Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson'', 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952); ''Astoria Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino'', 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. ''Astoria'', 501 U.S. at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must "speak directly" to the question addressed by the common law. ''Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham'', 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', 451 U. S. 304, 315 (1981).

For example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. ([[Codification (law)|Codification]] is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)

With the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibited [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of [[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']],&lt;ref name="USvHudson"&gt;[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']], {{ussc|11|32|1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.

Still, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Commonwealth'', 209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, ___ (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Code of Virginia|Virginia Code]] section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that "The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly."

By contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new [[cause of action]] that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the [[tort]] of [[wrongful death]], which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or [[estate (law)|estate]], to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly—that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some "second order" constitutional law provision (''cf''. [[judicial activism]]).

Where a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those [[damages]] in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the [[negligence]] of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of [[quality of life]], disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.

In the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority..." The first [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] on "the judicial power" was ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}. Later cases interpreted the "judicial power" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution.

The interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on [[precedent]].

=== Overruling precedent—the limits of ''stare decisis'' ===
The [[Common law#United States federal system (1789 and 1938)|United States federal courts]] are divided into twelve regional circuits, each with a [[United States courts of appeals|circuit court of appeals]] (plus a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government, without geographic limitation). Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself, but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits. District court decisions are not binding precedent at all, only persuasive.

Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting ''en banc'' (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (''en banc'' in relevant part) (explaining order of precedent binding on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); ''Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama'', 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (''en banc'') (after the Eleventh Circuit was split off from the Fifth Circuit, adopting precedent of Fifth Circuit as binding until overruled by the Eleventh Circuit ''en banc'': "The [pre-split] Fifth followed the absolute rule that a prior decision of the circuit (panel or ''en banc'') could not be overruled by a panel but only by the court sitting ''en banc''. The Eleventh Circuit decides in this case that it chooses, and will follow, this rule."); ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office).&lt;/ref&gt; In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.

Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit ''en banc'', and thus the ''later'' decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.

In the jurisdictions of [[England and Wales]] and of [[Northern Ireland]], since 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] has the authority to overrule and unify criminal law decisions of lower courts; it is the final court of appeal for civil law cases in all three of the UK jurisdictions but not for criminal law cases in Scotland. From 1966 to 2009, this [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|power]] lay with the [[House of Lords]], granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;83 Cr App R 191, 73 Cr App R 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's federal system, described [[Common law#CL Canada federal|below]], avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts.

=== Common law as a foundation for commercial economies ===

The reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As [[Justice Brandeis]] famously expressed it, "in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right."&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Yeo Tiong Min, "[http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html A Note on Some Differences in English Law, New York Law, and Singapore Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502093747/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html |date=2007-05-02 }}" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] rights apply.

In contrast, in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent,&lt;ref&gt;for example, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] issues very few of its decisions in precedential form, Kate Gaudry &amp; Thomas Franklin, Only 1 in 20,631 ex parte appeals designated precedential by PTAB, IPWatchdog (Sep. 27, 2015), and various lower tribunals in the Patent Office give very weak respect to earlier superior decisions.&lt;/ref&gt; fine [[Question of law|questions of law]] are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less ''a priori'' guidance (unless the written law is very clear and kept updated) and must often leave a bigger "safety margin" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.

This is the reason&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork" /&gt; for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States.&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork"&gt;Theodore Eisenberg &amp; Geoffrey P. Miller, The Flight to New York: An Empirical Study of Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses in {{Sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Held Companies’ Contracts (2008). New York University Law and Economics Working Papers. Paper 124, http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/124 (based on a survey of 2882 contracts, "New York law plays a role for major corporate contracts similar to the role Delaware law plays in the limited setting of corporate governance disputes. ... New York's dominance is striking. It is the choice of law in approximately 46 percent of contracts," and if merger contracts excluded, over half)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial contracts almost always include a "choice of law clause" to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware [[Corporations law|corporate law]], and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ([[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware [[choice of law]] clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19–20 (Delaware is chosen in about 15% of contracts, "Delaware dominates for one type of contract—[merger] trust agreements. ... The dominance of Delaware for this specialized type of contract is apparently due to the advantages and flexibility which Delaware's business trust statute.")&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19, only about 5% of commercial contracts designate California choice of law, where nearly 50% designate New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.

Likewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, [[London]] is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-becomes-litigation-capital-of-the-world-1031231.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Osley | title=London becomes litigation capital of the world | date=2008-11-23}}. London is also forum for many defamation cases, because UK law is more plaintiff-friendly—in the United States, the First Amendment protection for freedom of the press allows for statements concerning public figures of questionable veracity, where in the UK, those same statements support a judgment for libel.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 2008 Report to Congress, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/08_tas_arc_msp_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The common law{{mdash}}so named because it was "common" to all the king's courts across England{{mdash}}originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Prior to the Norman Conquest, much of England's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various [[shires]] and [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land: urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts, as did the [[University of Oxford|universities of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Additionally, the [[Catholic Church]] operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}

The main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the [[plea rolls]] and the [[Year Books]]. The plea rolls, which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, were written in Latin. The rolls were made up in bundles by law term: Hilary, Easter, Trinity, and Michaelmas, or winter, spring, summer, and autumn. They are currently deposited in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|the UK National Archives]], by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas, King's Bench, and Exchequer of Pleas, from the 13th century to the 17th, can be viewed online at the Anglo-American Legal Tradition site (The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center).&lt;ref&gt;Documents from Medieval and Early Modern England from the National Archives in London.[http://aalt.law.uh.edu/]  Publications of the [[Selden Society]] include a Year Books series and other volumes transcribing and translating the original manuscripts of early common law cases and law reports, each volume having its editor's scholarly introduction.

The form of reasoning used in common law is known as [[casuistry]] or [[case-based reasoning]]. The common law, as applied in [[civil case]]s (as distinct from [[criminal case]]s), was devised as a means of [[damages|compensating]] someone for wrongful acts known as [[tort]]s, including both [[intentional tort]]s and torts caused by [[negligence]], and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating [[contract]]s. The type of [[legal procedure|procedure]] practiced in common law courts is known as the [[adversarial system]]; this is also a development of the common law.

=== Medieval English common law ===

The early development of case-law in the thirteenth century has been traced to [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] ''On the Laws and Customs of England'' and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as [[Year Books]], of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Plucknett|T. F. T. Plucknett]], ''A Concise History of the Common Law, 5th edition, 1956, London and Boston, pp.260-261&lt;/ref&gt; The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England, and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines, concepts, and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries, when the common law developed into recognizable form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty-scholarship/legal-history-the-year-books/ BUSL, ''Legal History: The Year Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of English and American Literature ''The Year Books and their Value''[http://www.bartleby.com/218/1309.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1154, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] became the first [[Plantagenet]] king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law "common" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a [[jury]] system—citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its [[verdict]] through evaluating common [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], not necessarily through the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.

Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an [[ad hoc]] basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as ''stare decisis'' (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name "common law".

Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of [[canon law|canonical]] (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]).

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] was established after [[Magna Carta]] to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest. Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king's [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Palace of Westminster]], permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the [[Legal year]].

Judge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] acquired legislative powers to create [[statutory law]]. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006"&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, Thomson West, 2006), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;—"legislating from the bench" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate."&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate"&gt;''Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, the view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.

In England, judges have devised a number of rules as to [[Mechanisms of the English common law|how to deal with precedent decisions]].

=== Influence of Roman law ===
The term "common law" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived "civil law", and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.

By the time of the rediscovery of the [[Roman law]] in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., R. C. van Caenegem, ''The Birth of the English Common Law'' 89–92 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first common law scholars, most notably [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Birks]], Grant McLeod, ''Justinian's Institutes'' 7 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton's ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Institutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., George E. Woodbine (ed.), Samuel E. Thorne (transl.), ''Bracton on the Laws and Customs of England'', Vol. I (Introduction) 46 (1968); Carl Güterbock, ''Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law'' 35–38 (1866).&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into ''[[in rem]]'' (typically, actions against a ''thing'' or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and ''[[in personam]]'' (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stein, ''Continental Influences on English Legal thought, 1600–1900'', ''in'' Peter Stein, ''The Character and Influence of the Roman Civil Law'' 223 ''et seq''. (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent [[unjust enrichment]]) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke and Blackstone ===

The first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], in his treatise, ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' in the 17th century.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769.

=== Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes ===

{{anchor|CL_Reception_Statutes}}A [[reception statute]] is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent, by which the new nation adopts (i.e. receives) pre-independence common law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]], have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of reception statutes in the United States, the states of the U.S., Canada and its provinces, and Hong Kong, are discussed in the [[reception statute]] article.

Yet, adoption of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt; Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law under the control of the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that—by design—were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he "suffered very much for the want of books". To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system—knowable, written law—in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;  A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward "all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [will be founded] on the high monarchical system [to] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... [The library] may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose."&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;

=== Decline of Latin maxims and "blind imitation of the past", and adding flexibility to ''stare decisis'' {{Anchor|History_and_Holmes}} ===
Well into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, "[[Nemo iudex in causa sua|One cannot be a judge in one's own cause]]" (see [[Dr. Bonham's Case]]), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], presented the common law as a collection of such maxims.

Reliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, came under critical discussion in the late 19th century, starting in the United States. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his famous article, "The Path of the Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=10 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=457, 469 |year=1897|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2373|title=The Path of the Law|first=Oliver Wendell |last=Holmes, Jr.|doi=10.2307/1322028|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented, "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for "the man of the present", but "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics". In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] [https://archive.org/details/commonlaw00holmuoft O. W. Holmes, Jr., ''The Common Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the [[:w:syllogism|syllogism]] in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the [[:w:axiom|axioms]] and corollaries of a book of mathematics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Louis Brandeis]], later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in [[Brandeis Brief|his briefs]], and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.

Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''Acree v. Republic of Iraq'', 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors ''should'' influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but it is indisputable that judges ''do'' draw on experience and learning from everyday life, from other fields, and from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roper v. Simmons]], 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (holding unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed while under the age of 18, based on "evolving standards of decency", largely based on other nations' law)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity ===
&lt;!-- "Fusion of law and equity" redirects here. Please edit redirect if changing the name of this section header --&gt;
As early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of [[Equity (law)|equity]], administered by the [[Lord Chancellor]], in the courts of [[Court of equity|chancery]]. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.

In England, courts of law ([[Common law#Disambiguate equity|as opposed to equity]]) were combined with [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, with equity prevailing in case of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Lobban, Michael "Preparing for Fusion: Reforming the Nineteenth-Century Court of Chancery, Part II | year=2004 | work=Law and History Review, 2004 (University of Illinois Press) . {{ISSN|0738-2480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parallel systems of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] (providing money [[damages]], with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The [[United States federal courts]] procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] combined [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity into one form of action, the "civil action". Fed.R.Civ.P. {{frcp|2}}. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were "[[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and "equity" issues are decided by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) ("[W]e [the U.S. Supreme Court] have understood that the right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]] when the Amendment was adopted. In keeping with our longstanding adherence to this 'historical test,', we ask, first, whether we are dealing with a cause of action that either was tried at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law (as opposed to equity)]] at the time of the founding or is at least analogous to one that was. If the action in question belongs in the law category, we then ask whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791." citations and quotations omitted, holding that interpretation of the scope of a patent had no analogy in 1790, and is thus a question to be decided by a judge, not a jury)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delaware]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Tennessee]] still have separate courts of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity, for example, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]]. In many [[U.S. state|states]] there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.

=== Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century ===

For centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific [[Form of action|forms of action]], and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a [[writ]]) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Maitland, ''The Forms of Action at Common Law'', 1909, Lecture I, online [https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/basis/maitland-formsofaction.asp] or John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common Law Pleading (1894) or [[James Barr Ames|Ames]], [[Joseph Chitty|Chitty]], [[Henry John Stephen|Stephen]], [[James Bradley Thayer|Thayer]] and other writers named in the preface of Perry's ''Common-law Pleading: its history and principles'' (Boston, 1897)[http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/commonlawpleadin00perr.pdf] or [https://kateofgaia.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/handbook-of-common-law-pleadings1.pdf ''Handbook of Common Law Pleading, Koffler and Reppy, 1969, online'']&lt;/ref&gt; To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific "magic words" encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a ''pro se'' ("for oneself," without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.

One of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the remainder of the "common law" discussed in the rest of the article remained intact; all that was abolished were the highly technical requirements for language of the paper provided by the plaintiff to the defendant to initiate a case.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant "a short and plain statement" of facts that constitute an alleged wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 4, a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."&lt;/ref&gt; This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, civil procedure rules "should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to common law systems ==

=== Civil law systems--comparisons and contrasts to common law{{anchor|Contrasts between common law and civil law systems}} ===
[[File:Corpus Iuris Civilis 02.jpg|thumb|A 16th century edition of ''Corpus Juris Civilis Romani'' (1583)]]

The main alternative to the common law system is the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is used in [[Continental Europe]], and most of the rest of the world.

==== Judicial decisions play only a minor role in shaping civil law ====
The primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent.

In common law jurisdictions, nearly every case that presents a ''bona fide'' disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. The legal reasoning for the decision, known as ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions, and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, H. Law, Liberty and the Constitution: A Brief History of the common Law (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
In common law systems, a single decided case is binding [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]] to the same extent as statute or regulation, under the principle of ''stare decisis''. In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not binding effect. In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''. Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.

For that reason, statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive, detailed, and continuously updated, covering all matters capable of being brought before a court.&lt;ref&gt;''The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions'', Robbins Collection, University of California at Berkeley.[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system ====
[[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common law systems]] tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch. In contrast, civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers.  One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/constitutional-law/inquisitorial-and-adversarial-system-of-law-constitutional-law-essay.php|title=Inquisitorial And Adversarial System Of Law|website=lawteacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/c7ffec37-0632-475f-84ba-ae018a2f0f38/1/Types_of_law_IMSLRN.zip/page_10.htm|title=Types of Legal System: Adversarial v. Investigatory Trial Systems|first=|last=LangstoT|website=compass.port.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law courts usually use an [[adversarial system]], in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt; In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, criminal proceedings proceed under an [[inquisitorial system]] in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt;

The examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.

The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.

There are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (''e.g.'', a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.

==== Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems{{anchor|CL academic writings}} ====
The role of the legal academy presents a significant "cultural" difference between common law ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|connotation 2]]) and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.  In both systems, treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases.  In neither system are treatises considered "law," but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different.

In common law jurisdictions, lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only "finding aids" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.&lt;ref&gt;At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use "law professor" or "law review article" as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality—every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write "law review articles," but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice Roberts noted the "great disconnect between the academy and the profession."&lt;ref&gt;A Conversation with Chief Justice Roberts, June 11, 2011 [https://www.c-span.org/video/?300203-1/conversation-chief-justice-roberts] at 30:30.&lt;/ref&gt; When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the [[Legal history|history and evolution of the law]], but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.

In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, courts give the writings of [[law school|law professors]] significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to come from somewhere else: the academy often filled that role.

==== Narrowing of differences between common law and civil law ====
The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of [[jurisprudence]] (similar to [[case law]] but not binding) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.

Examples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include [[Common law offence#United States|criminal law]] (since 1812,&lt;ref name="USvHudson" /&gt; U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), [[commercial law]] (the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the early 1960s) and procedure (the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in the 1930s and the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]] process determines the scope and application of the statute.

An example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision ''Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1982:335}}), in which the [[European Court of Justice]] held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges (at that time) of essentially civil law jurisdiction.

and many other generally [[English-speaking countries]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (except the UK's [[Common law#CL Scotland|Scotland]], which is [[bijuridicial law|bijuridicial]], and [[Malta]]). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]] (which follows the [[bijuridicial law|law]] of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow [[Common law#CL Roman Dutch|Roman Dutch law]]), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the [[civil rights]] of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.

The remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction-specific variants, arranged chronologically.

=== Scotland{{anchor|CL Scotland}} ===
[[Scotland]] is often said to use the civil law system, but it has [[Scots law|a unique system]] that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] with an element of its own common law long predating the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1707 (see [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages]]), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, [[Scots Law|Scottish common law]] differed in that the use of ''precedent'' was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a ''precedent'',&lt;ref&gt;Stair Memorial Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; and principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a ''stare decisis'' akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.

Scotland shares the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], with England, Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases; the court's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland. This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas. For instance, the modern UK [[negligence|law of negligence]] is based on ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', a case originating in Paisley, Scotland.

Scotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK, with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] being the final court for criminal appeals. The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (before October 2009, final appellate jurisdiction lay with the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/role-of-the-supreme-court.html|title=Role of The Supreme Court – The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|website=www.supremecourt.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
==== States of the United States (17th century on){{anchor|CL United States}} ====
The centuries-old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006" /&gt;—"legislating from the bench"— is a traditional function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate” (in the federal courts, only interstitially, in state courts, to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority).&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate" /&gt;

===== New York (17th century) =====
The state of [[New York (state)|New York]], which also has a civil law history from its [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] days, began a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the [[Field Code]] applying to [[civil procedure]]. The original colony of [[New Netherland]] was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|recaptured]] by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the [[patroon]] system of land holding, based on the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of [[Roman-Dutch law]] continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.

===== Louisiana (1700s){{anchor|Louisiana (1700s)}} =====

Under [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana's codified system]], the [[Louisiana Civil Code]], private law—that is, [[substantive law]] between private sector parties—is based on principles of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from [[Roman law]], transmitted through [[Law of France|French law]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], as the state's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the [[Napoleonic Code]], as the latter was enacted in 1804, one year after the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.

Louisiana's [[criminal law]] largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's [[administrative law]] is generally similar to the [[administrative Procedure Act (United States)|administrative law of the U.S. federal government]] and other U.S. states. Louisiana's [[procedural law]] is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Historically notable among the Louisiana code's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.

===== California (1850s) =====
The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] has a system based on common law, but it has [[Codification (law)|codified]] the law in the manner of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the [[California Codes]] in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other [[Western United States|Western states]], however, have retained the concept of [[community property]] derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case ''[[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]]'', 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the principle of [[comparative negligence]] in the face of a [[California Civil Code]] provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of [[contributory negligence]].)

==== United States federal courts (1789 and 1938){{anchor|CL United States federal}} ====
[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|USCA: some annotated volumes of the [[United States Code|official compilation]] and codification of federal statutes.]]

The United States federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. [[United States federal courts]] only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language ([[Common law#Disambiguate statute|connotation 1(b)]] above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law.

Before 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.

In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64, 78] (1938), overruled earlier precedent,&lt;ref&gt;''Swift v. Tyson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=41&amp;page=1 41 U.S. 1] (1842). In ''Swift'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their [[diversity jurisdiction]] (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ''Erie v. Tompkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64] (1938). ''Erie'' overruled ''Swift v. Tyson'', and instead held that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction had to use all of the same [[substantive law]] as the courts of the states in which they were located. As the ''Erie'' Court put it, there is no "general federal common law", the key word here being '''''general'''''. This history is elaborated in
[[federal common law]].&lt;/ref&gt; and held "There is no federal general common law," thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. ''E.g.'', ''Texas Industries v. Radcliff'', {{ussc|451|630|1981}} (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.

Later courts have limited ''Erie'' slightly, to create a few situations where [[United States federal courts]] are permitted to create [[federal common law]] rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. ''See, e.g.'', ''[[Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|318|363|1943}} (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case [[negotiable instrument]]s backed by the federal government); ''see also'' ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=248&amp;page=215 248 U.S. 215] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of "hot news" that lacks any statutory grounding); ''but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 843–44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of ''INS'' "hot news" tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Boerne v. Flores'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=521&amp;invol=507 521 U.S. 507] (1997) (invalidating the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], in which Congress had attempted to redefine the court's jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=451&amp;invol=304 451 U.S. 304] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States executive branch agencies (1946) ====
Most executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority. To greater or lesser extent, agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results. Agency decision making is governed by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1946.

For example, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] issues relatively few [[regulations]], but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]].

=== India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (19th century and 1948){{anchor|CL India and Pakistan}} ===
The law of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are largely based on [[English law|English]] common law because of the long period of [[British Empire|British colonial influence]] during the period of the [[British India|British Raj]].

[[History of India|Ancient India]] represented a distinct tradition of law, and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from 400 BCE and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'s central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the [[Gupta Empire]], relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition.{{sfn|Alexander|1952|pp=289–300}} Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanatha, S.T., ''International Law in Ancient India'', 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

When India became part of the [[British Empire]], there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] against the British in 1857, the [[British Parliament]] took over control of India from the [[British East India Company]], and [[British India]] came under the direct rule of [[the Crown]]. The British Parliament passed the [[Government of India Act 1858|Government of India Act of 1858]] to this effect, which set up the structure of British government in India.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It established in Britain the office of the [[Secretary of State for India]] through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule, along with a [[Council of India]] to aid him. It also established the office of the [[Governor-General of India]] along with an Executive Council in India, which consisted of high officials of the British Government. As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|date=August 2015}}

==== Post-partition India (1948){{anchor|CL India}} ====

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 395 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Post-partition, [[Law of India|India]] retained its common law system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|author=[[K. G. Balakrishnan]]|title=An Overview of the Indian Justice Delivery Mechanism|url=http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/speeches/speeches_2008/abu_dhabi__as_delivered.pdf|event=International Conference of the Presidents of the Supreme Courts of the World|location=Abu Dhabi|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=23–24 March 2008|quote=India, being a common law country, derives most of its modern judicial framework from the British legal system.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102153013/http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/speeches/speeches_2008/abu_dhabi__as_delivered.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of contemporary Indian law shows substantial European and American influence. Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today. During the drafting of the [[Indian Constitution]], laws from Ireland, the United States, Britain, and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws. Indian laws also adhere to the [[United Nations]] guidelines on [[human rights law]] and [[environmental law]]. Certain [[international trade law]]s, such as those on [[intellectual property]], are also enforced in India.

The exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s. In Goa, a Portuguese [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.

==== Post-partition Pakistan (1948){{anchor|CL Pakistan}} ====

Post-partition, [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]] retained its common law system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/REVIEW_P_46&amp;47_2011_full.pdf |title=Federation of Pakistan v.

==== Post-partition Bangladesh (1968){{anchor|CL Bangladesh}} ====

Post-partition, Bangladesh retained its common law system.

=== Canada (1867){{anchor|CL Canada}} ===

[[Canadian law|Canada]] has separate federal and provincial legal systems. The division of [[jurisdiction]] between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_91 Constitution Act, 1867], s. 91(10), (18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canadian provincial law{{anchor|CL Canada provinces}} ====

Each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All but one of the provinces of [[Law of Canada|Canada]] use a common law system (the exception being [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]], which uses a French-heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).

==== Canadian federal law{{anchor|CL Canada federal}} ====

Canadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml |title=Federal Court of Appeal – Home |publisher=Fca-caf.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law is uniform throughout Canada. It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code, as interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces.

Canadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/harmonization/bijurilex/aboutb-aproposb.html|title=Department of Justice – About Bijuralism|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=canada.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicaragua ===
[[Nicaragua]]'s legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the mid-17th century until about 1894, the [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the [[Somoza family]] administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Israel (1948){{anchor|CL Israel}} ===
[[Israeli law|Israel]] has a common law legal system. Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|supreme court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lawofisrael.com/israeli-supreme-court-decisions | title=Supreme court decisions database}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the [[Constitution of Israel|Israeli constitution]] remains [[unwritten constitution|unwritten]] is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the [[Knesset]] (which, following the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], holds near-unlimited power).{{sfn|Mahler|2004|p=126}}

=== Roman Dutch Common law{{anchor|CL Roman Dutch}} ===
[[Roman Dutch law|Roman Dutch Common law]] is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in [[Scotland]] and [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]]. Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sri-Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law, and in some, such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights. Roman Dutch common law is a development of [[Roman Dutch law]] by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions. During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French ''code civil'' in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] and [[Johannes Voet|Voet]]. In practice, the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent.

=== Ghana ===
Ghana follows the English common-law&lt;ref&gt;The common law as used in this paper designates the English common-law as a legal tradition which is made up of law (generally referred to as the common law), and the doctrine of equity.&lt;/ref&gt; tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation. Consequently, the laws of Ghana are, for the most part, a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio-economic and political realities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Obiri-Korang P "Private international law of contract in Ghana: the need for a paradigm shift" (2017) P 8; Quansah ''The Ghana Legal System'' (2011) P 51&lt;/ref&gt; The Bond of 184&lt;ref&gt;The Bond was a pact between the British and some chiefs from the southern states of the Gold Coast under which British protection was extended to the signatories in exchange for judicial authority over them.&lt;/ref&gt; 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana (then Gold Coast) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Benion ''The Constitutional Law of Ghana'' (1962). Boahen, however, submits that the Bond of 1844 is not as important as held by some Ghanaian historians. He further posits that it cannot be the Mgna Carta of Ghana or the basis for British rule or law – see Boahen ''Ghana: Evolution and Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century'' (1975) 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the British judicial authority. Later, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 “formally” introduced British law, be it the common law or statutory law, in the Gold Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Asante “Over a hundred years of a national legal system in Ghana: a review and critique” 1988 ''Journal of African Law'' 31 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14&lt;ref&gt;This states that “the common law, the doctrines of equity, and Statutes of general application which were in force in England at the date when the colony obtained a local legislature, that is to say, on the 24th of July 1874, shall be in force within the jurisdiction of the court”.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common-law tradition in the country.

Ghana, after independence, did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British, and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country. Chapter four of Ghana's Constitution, entitled “The Laws of Ghana”, has in Article 11(1) the list of laws applicable in the state. This comprises (a) the Constitution; (b) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution; (c) any Orders, Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution; (d) the existing law; and (e) the common law.&lt;ref&gt;According to Article 11(2) of Ghana’s Constitution, the common law of Ghana shall comprise the rule of law generally known as the common law, the rules generally known as the doctrine of equity and the rules of customary law, including those determined by the Superior Court of Judicature.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the modern-day Constitution of Ghana, like those before it, embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions. The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of ''stare decisis'' as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana.

== Scholarly works ==
[[File:WilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir William Blackstone]] as illustrated in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.]]
[[Edward Coke]], a 17th-century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a [[Member of Parliament]], wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law. Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Institutes]]'' and ''Reports'' until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] that covers both common and statutory English law.

While he was still on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and before being named to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] published a short volume called ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]'', which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law ''is''; rather, Holmes describes the common law ''process''. Law professor [[John Chipman Gray]]'s ''The Nature and Sources of the Law'', an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]].

In the United States, [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements]] of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the [[American Law Institute]], collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.

Scots ''common law'' covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called ''Institutional Texts'' and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, ''Jus Feudale'' (1655) and Stair, ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).

The '''Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations''' ('''CCAAA''') is an umbrella group of international private organizations working on audiovisual archiving. These professional organizations have a common goal of promoting and encouraging the preservation and the accessibility of the world's audiovisual heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccaaa.org/who.html Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221211858/http://www.ccaaa.org/who.html |date=2014-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCAAA member organisations work with many AV materials including: [[films]], [[TV]], [[radio]], photographs and audio recordings.

==History==
The Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations traces its origins to the Roundtable of Audiovisual Records, which was organized in 1982 in response to the UNESCO report "Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images" (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Benedict S. Olgado, Creating and Sustaining a Platform for Discourse and Cooperation: The History, Development and Future Direction of CCAAA (2011). At http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/preservation/program/student_work/2011spring/11s_3049_olgado_a3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The report called for cooperation and coordination between organizations tasked with preserving the world's audiovisual heritage. The five founding members were the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF), the [[International Federation of Television Archives]] (FIAT/IFTA), the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives|International Association of Sound Archives]] (IASA), and the [[International Council on Archives]] (ICA). A major early project was organizing a Joint Technical Symposium of preservation experts from around the world, to be held every few years. The first JTS was held in Stockholm in 1983, with later editions in Berlin (1987), Ottawa (1990), London (1995), and Paris (2000). The Roundtable also produced papers on archival matters, and worked closely with UNESCO on audiovisual preservation.

By 1999 it was felt that the Roundtable needed to become more proactive in shaping policy in the audiovisual archive field, to include lobbying for greater preservation efforts worldwide. To accomplish this it was reconstituted as the CCAAA in 2000, and new members were added. The Joint Technical Symposiums continued, with new conferences held in Toronto (2004, 2007), Oslo (2010), and Singapore (2016). The CCAAA was instrumental in the establishment and management of UNESCO's "World Day for Audiovisual Heritage" (observed on October 27 each year), which was approved in 2005 and first observed in 2007. It has also launched an "Archives at Risk" initiative to aid endangered archives, and taken positions on subjects as disparate as the impact of copyright on preservation and access and the repatriation of audiovisual heritage items to originating countries.

Since the CCAAA is an "association of associations," its membership generally consists of the president and secretary general (or equivalent) of each of its member organizations. The presidency rotates among the members, and there is also a secretary general and a treasurer. All positions are filled by volunteers and there is no paid staff.

The current Chair of the CCAAA is Rachael Stoeltje, representing [[International Federation of Film Archives|FIAF]].

==Joint Technical Symposium==

The Joint Technical Symposium (JTS) is organised by CCAAA for AV specialists interested in audio-visual, cinema and sound heritage.

'''David Richard Thomas''' or '''Archdeacon D H Thomas'''  (1833 &amp;ndash; 11 October 1916) was a Welsh clergyman and historian.  He was a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[St Asaph's Cathedral]] and [[Archdeacon of Montgomery]], as well as being a [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]].  His major publication was the ''History of the Diocese of St Asaph'', the first such history of a Welsh diocese.

==Life==
Thomas was the son of Owen and Mary Thomas of Bodyfoel, [[Llanfechain]] in [[Montgomeryshire]], and he was baptised on 14 September 1833.  He was educated at [[Ruthin School]] under [[Edward Barnwell]] before [[matriculation|matriculating]] at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Anon. " Archdeacon D R Thomas", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis" 1897, 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;  His father died during his time at Oxford and Thomas taught during the university vacations to support himself.  He graduated in 1856, but failed to obtain a college [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellowship]] in 1859. After his ordination, he became [[curate]] of [[Rhuddlan]] in 1857, then curate from 1859 to 1864 of [[Selattyn and Gobowen|Selattyn]] in [[Shropshire]] (which was at the time part of the [[Diocese of St Asaph]]).  He was then in 1864 appointed [[vicar]] of [[Cefn Meiriadog]] in [[Denbighshire]], a post he held until 1877 when he became vicar of [[Meifod]], [[Powys]].  He was appointed a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[St Asaph's Cathedral|St Asaph]] in 1881 and [[archdeacon]] of Montgomery in 1886.  In 1892, he left Meifod to become [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Llandrinio]], in Montgomeryshire, where he remained until his death on 11 October 1916.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-THOM-RIC-1833.html| title=Thomas, David Richard (1833&amp;ndash;1916), cleric and historian |last=Jenkins|first=Robert Thomas|authorlink=Robert Thomas Jenkins |work=Welsh Biography Online| publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
In addition to his clerical duties, Thomas was an active historian and [[antiquarian]]. He was a stalwart member of the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]], who chaired its committee, served as editor of its journal for two periods (1875&amp;ndash;1880 and 1884&amp;ndash;1888), and wrote more than 25 articles for the journal. His major work, published between 1870 and 1874, was a ''History of the Diocese of St Asaph''; it was enlarged and printed in three volumes between 1906 and 1913. It was the first such diocesan history in Wales. He also wrote a ''History of the Parish of Llandrinio'' (1895), ''The Life and Work of Bishop Richard Davies and William Salesbury'' (1902), four religious works, and other publications. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6086">'''Dreux Wine-growers and Craftsmen Ecomuseum''' is located in [[Dreux]], on the previous site of Saint-Thibault priory. The museum was founded in 1987 by the cultural association Flora Gallica. It features 12th-century vaulted wine cellars, collections dedicated to wine-growing and local crafts as well as a medieval garden.

== Site history ==
In the 12th century, Earl of Dreux Robert the First asked the Cistercian monks of [[Le Breuil-Benoît Abbey]] (located in Marcilly-sur-Eure) to found a [[Conventual]] priory in Dreux at the foot of his castle (situated where the current day Chapelle royale is) in order to grow wine. 
In the Middle Ages, 250 hectares were dedicated to wine-growing in Dreux and 7,249 in the county (department) of [[Eure-et-Loir]] (currently less than a hectare). The Earl of Dreux owned six grape presses, one of which operated at the priory. In the 12th century, a harbour was built on the [[Blaise (Eure)|Blaise river]]: ships used the (connecting) [[Eure (river)|Eure river]] to transport wine and other goods to Rouen, Paris or England. 
The monks dug rib-vaulted cellars into the flint and chalky marl; they were reinforced with double arches based on stone corbels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Rotrou |first=Eustache |date=1987 |title=Histoire de Dreux et de son comté |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Les éditions du Bastion |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used special pickaxes whose notches can still be seen. The cellars were used to store tithe wine, and had side chambers which inhabitants used to take shelter in case of attack.

Dreux was a stop-over on the way to [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]]: rolled maps deposited/put in the holes of the vaults' arch supports were available to the pilgrims. Some pilgrims would take small pieces of rock from the walls as a souvenir of their stay. One of the cellars seems to have been dug into the chalky cliff to house the press.

The monks collected the tithe on wine-growing products until the French Revolution. In 1791, the priory was sold as a ''bien national'' (national property) and transformed into a rural inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maillié |first=Charles |date=1996 |title=Dreux et le pays drouais |language=fr |publisher=Jean-Marc Maillié |location=Dreux |page=189 |isbn=2-9510604-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel was razed in 1852. 
The ecomuseum set up a vineyard again in 1989 and organises a grape-harvest celebration in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Les bénévoles de l'association Flora Gallica ont récolté le raisin qui donnera le vin drouais |url=http://www.lechorepublicain.fr/eure-et-loir/actualite/pays/pays-drouais/2014/10/19/les-benevoles-de-lassociation-flora-gallica-ont-recolte-le-raisin-qui-donnera-le-vin-drouais_11187996.html |language=fr |newspaper={{Interlanguage link multi|L'Écho républicain|fr}} |date=19 October 2014 |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Façade de lécomusée des vignerons et artisans drouais, Dreux.JPG|thumb|Boat in courtyard of Dreux Wine-growers and Craftsmen Ecomuseum]]
In the courtyard, a life-size reproduction of a 13th-century flat-bottomed boat was built by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=L’Écomusée des vignerons et des artisans drouais rassemble des pépites du passé |url=http://www.lechorepublicain.fr/eure-et-loir/actualite/pays/pays-drouais/dreux/2013/08/10/lecomusee-des-vignerons-et-des-artisans-drouais-rassemble-des-pepites-du-passe_1653406.html |language=fr |newspaper={{Interlanguage link multi|L'Écho républicain|fr}} |date=10 August 2013 |access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of boat could be towed when the river wasn't deep enough. The door of the king's tax collector's house (set on fire by wine-growers in 1789) can also be seen, as well as a {{convert|7,150|l}} cask, a cart and presses. 
An outbuilding has a display of a 19th-century habitat with a stable, a bakery, a laundry room and two living areas. 
Various collections can be seen inside. 

The ground floor section is dedicated to wine-growing tools and to vineyard work. The stained-glass windows that are exhibited here reproduce those of [[Chartres Cathedral]], which represent, among other occupations, those of wine traders, coopers and wine-growers. A 17th-century wood and plaster statue called "Our Lady of the Bunch" can be seen. The first bunch of grapes was set in its hand for luck. Initially placed in a street of the town, it was sold to a Parisian second-hand goods dealer. Flora Gallica bought it thanks to a contribution.

On the first floor, ancient bathroom linen and toiletries (curling iron, laces), wine watercolours and clockmaker tools are displayed.

The "craftsmen's attic" houses various spaces showing the traditional trades and their tools (clog maker, saddler, blacksmith, potter etc.) Another room houses a restored apothecary.

== Medieval garden ==
In the Middle Ages, the Saint-Thibault priory owned a garden cultivated according to [[Hildegard of Bingen]]'s rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moulinier |first=Laurence |date=1989 |title=La botanique d'Hildergarde de Bingen |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/medi_0751-2708_1989_num_8_16_1142 |language=fr |journal={{Interlanguage link multi|Médiévales|fr}} |volume=8 |issue=16 |pages=113–129 |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecomuseum has recreated a medieval garden on a {{convert|600|sqm}} plot on the hill with ancient plants which had been used for aromatic, textile and medicinal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le musée du vignoble Flora Gallica se modernise |url=http://www.lechorepublicain.fr/eure-et-loir/actualite/pays/pays-drouais/2012/05/18/le-musee-du-vignoble-drouais-flora-gallica-se-modernise_1170701.html |language=fr |newspaper={{Interlanguage link multi|L'Écho républicain|fr}} |date=18 May 2012 |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drogön Chogyal Phagpa''' (''{{bo|t=འགྲོ་མགོན་ཆོས་རྒྱལ་འཕགས་པ་|w='gro mgon chos rgyal 'phags pa}}''', 1235 – 15 December 1280), was the fifth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hhthesakyatrizin.org/tradition_founder5.html|title=The Sakya Tradition: Drogon Chogyal Phagpa|website=www.hhthesakyatrizin.org|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; leader of the [[Sakya]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. He was also the first [[Imperial Preceptor]] of [[Kublai Khan]]'s [[Yuan dynasty]], division of the [[Mongol Empire]], and was concurrently named the director of the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]]. Historical tradition remembers him as the first vice-ruler of [[Tibet]] under the Mongol [[Khagan]] as well as one of the Five Sakya patriarchs ({{bo|t=ས་སྐྱ་གོང་མ་རྣམ་ལྔ་|w=sa skya gong ma rnam lnga}}). Although this is historically disputed, he played a very important political role.

==Early life==
{{See also|Mongol conquest of Tibet}}
Phagpa was born in [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari]] (West Tibet) in 1235 as the son of Sönam Gyeltsen ({{bo|t=བསོད་ནམས་རྒྱལ་མཚན་|w=bsod nams rgyal mtshan}}, 1184-1239), a member of the [[Khön clan of Sakya|Khon family]] ({{bo|t=འཁོན་|w='khon}}) which held hereditary power over the [[Sakya Monastery]] in the [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] region, and his mother was Kunga Kyi ({{bo|t=ཀུན་དགའ་ཀྱིད་|w=kun dga' kyid}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Dominique|title=Pakpa Lodro Gyeltsen|url=http://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Pakpa-Lodro-Gyeltsen/2051|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Red annals'' name his mother as Jomo Konchog Kyi.&lt;ref&gt;Shoju Inaba (1963) "The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals", ''Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko'' 22, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the nephew of [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182-1251), who began the relationship between Sakya and the Mongol conquerors after their first invasion of Tibet in 1240.

In 1244, [[Sakya Pandita]] left Sakya in order to visit the royal camp of [[Godan Khan]], son of [[Ögedei Khan]], to act as intermediary between the Mongols and Tibetans. He brought with him his young nephews, the ten years-old Phagpa and his brother, the six years-old Chakna Dorje. On the way, they stopped in [[Lhasa]], where Phagpa took the vows of a [[śrāmaṇera]] at the [[Jokhang]] in front of the statue of the [[Jowo (statue)|Jowo]] offered by the [[Princess Wencheng]], the Chinese wife of [[Songtsen Gampo]].&lt;ref name="Thomas Laird"&gt;Thomas Laird (2006) ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', pp. 114-117. Grove Press, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakya Pandita preached sermons along his way and arrived at Godan's camp in [[Liang (realm)|Liangzhou]] in 1247, where Mongol troops were exterminating [[Han Chinese]] by throwing them in a river.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa]] (1967) ''Tibet: A Political History''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Sakya Pandita, horrified, gave religious instructions, in particular stressing that killing a sentient being is one of the worst acts according to Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Thomas Laird" /&gt; He gave religious instruction to the prince and greatly impressed the court with his personality and powerful teachings. He is also said to have cured Godan of a serious illness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thubten Jigme Norbu]] and [[Colin Turnbull]] (1969) ''Tibet: Its History, Religion and People''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In return, Drogon Chogyel Phagpa was supposedly given "temporal authority over the 13 myriarchies [''Trikor Chuksum''] of Central Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa]] (1967) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the myriarchies had not yet emerged as a territorial unit, this cannot be entirely correct. Tibetan historians quote a letter that Sakya Pandita wrote to the local leaders of Tibet in 1249 where he stated that they henceforth must carry out the administration of their fiefs in consultation with the Sakya envoys and in accordance with Mongol law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luciano Petech]] (1990) ''Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Yüan-Sa skya pa period in Tibetan history''. Rome, p. 9. There are some questions about the authencity of the letter that Sakya Pandita wrote to the Tibetans; see David P. Jackson (1987) [http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/jts/pdf/JTS_06_02.pdf 'Sa-skya Pandita's letter to the Tibetans'].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entering the service of Kublai Khan==
After the death of Sakya Pandita, the Mongol ruler [[Möngke Khan]] dispatched new military campaigns against parts of Tibet in 1252-53. He furthermore shared up the main Tibetan sects among the ruling clan. While he patronized the [[Drikung Kagyu]], Godan protected Sakya and there were at least nine further appanages. Phagpa and his brother remained at the camp of Godan, learned the [[Middle Mongol language|Mongolian language]] and took up Mongol dress.

Möngke's brother Kublai, after a brief flirtation with [[Chan Buddhism]], found Tibetan Buddhism more to his liking. In 1253 he asked Godan to give him Chögyal Phagpa, who was then 18. Kublai was subsequently converted to Buddhism by his efforts and Phagpa became his tantric guru in 1258. Under the influence of Kublai's wife [[Chabi]], their mutual relation was defined so that Phagpa had a precedence in religious matters and Kublai in temporal affairs. When the prince received religious instruction from his lama, the latter sat on a higher seat, while Kublai sat higher than Phagpa when he conducted court business. Phagpa further strengthened his case by defeating his [[Daoism|Daoist]] opponents in a great debate in Kublai's newly built city [[Shangdu|Kaiping]] in 1258.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Rossabi (1988) ''Khubilai Khan: His life and times''. Berkeley, p. 41-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, [[Kublai Khan]] took power in a succession struggle after the death of his brother Möngke in 1259. He thereby became the Khagan, the ruler of the Mongols; later on, he became the [[Emperor of China]]. Phagpa supported the new lord by presenting him as a [[chakravartin]] or universal ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Kapstein (2006) ''The Tibetans''. Oxford, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai Khan in turn appointed Chögyal Phagpa as his National Preceptor (''Guoshi'') in 1260, the year when he was proclaimed Khagan. According to Mongol sources, Phagpa was the first one "to initiate the political theology politics of the relationship between state and religion in the Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhist world"&lt;ref name="Thomas Laird" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Mote (1999) ''Imperial China 900-1800''. Harvard University Press, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; - that is to say, he developed the concept of the [[patron and priest relationship]]. With the support of Kublai Khan, Chögyal Phagpa established himself and the Sakya as the preeminent political power in Tibet.

==The development of the Phagpa script==
Kublai Khan commissioned Chögyal Phagpa to design a new [[writing system]] to unify the writing of the multilingual Yuan China. Phagpa modified the [[Tibetan alphabet]] to create his [['Phags-pa script]], which was completed in 1268. Kublai Khan decided to use the 'Phags-pa script as the official writing system of the empire, including when he became Emperor of China in 1271, instead of [[Chinese characters]] or the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] formerly used for Mongolian.&lt;ref name="Thomas Laird" /&gt; However, he encountered major resistances and difficulties when trying to promote this script and never achieved his original goal. As a result, only a small amount of texts were written in this script, and the majority (including most official documents) were still written in Chinese ideograms or the Uyghur alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Rossabi (1988) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The script fell into disuse after the collapse of the Yuan in 1368.&lt;ref name="Thomas Laird" /&gt;{{sfn|Mote|2003|p=501}} The script was used for about a century and is thought to have influenced the development of [[Hangul]].

Phagpa's diaries for 1271 mention a foreign friend of Kublai Khan, who was quite possibly one of the elder Polos or even [[Marco Polo]], although, unfortunately, no name is given.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Klafkowski (1977). "History of Buddhism in Mongolia—A Preliminary Survey", ''Buddhist Studies. The Journal of the Department of Buddhist Studies'', University of Delhi. May, 1977, p. 28 and note.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the Sakya-Yuan administrative system==
[[File:Yuan dynasty and Tibet.jpg|thumb|Tibet within the Yuan dynasty under the top-level department known as the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] (Xuanzheng Yuan).]]
The Sakya-Mongol alliance was strong, and the see ({{bo|w=grwa sa ''or'' gdan sa}}) of the Sakya became the capital of Tibet. According to later historiography, [[Kublai Khan]] (who founded of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1271) granted the three ''cholka'' or regions of Tibet ([[Ü-Tsang]], [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]]) to Phagpa as a reward for the initiation in the Buddhist faith.&lt;ref&gt;George Roerich (1976) ''The Blue Annals''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The donation would have taken place in 1253. However, this tradition has been qualified by recent research. As mentioned above, Kublai's brother and predecessor [[Möngke Khan]] divided Central Tibet into appanages obedient under various Mongol princes in 1251. In the next year he issued a decree saying that the main Buddhist precepts to be followed in Tibet were to be those of Sakya.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Petech (1990) pp. 10-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1260 the appanage system was withdrawn, and Phagpa, receiving the title State Preceptor (Guoshi), was acknowledged as the supreme head of the Buddhist clergy.

In 1264, Kublai Khan established the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]]. At about the same time, Phagpa was sent from the court to Tibet in order to persuade the local leaders to accept the imposition of Mongol administration. It was his first visit to his homeland since childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Rossabi (1988) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Phagpa received the new title of [[Imperial Preceptor]] (Dishi) in 1270, partly as a reward for his invention of the Phagpa script. As such, he was expected to stay close to the emperor and had a paramount influence over the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. His decrees carried the weight of the imperial court which gave him a strong authority over Tibetan affairs.

However, Phagpa mostly resided in [[Lintao County|Lintao]] in Gansu and apparently had desultory contacts with the emperor. He vacated the post by 1274 and returned to Sakya, leaving the title to his brother, [[Rinchen Gyaltsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Petech (1990) pp. 16-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kublai Khan made Phagpa's other brother Chakna Dorje viceroy of Tibet in 1264. However, he died in 1267 and no new viceroy was appointed for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Petech (1990) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; His untimely death was followed by a rebellion led by the Drikung Kagyu, the main opponents of the Sakya. Kublai Khan sent a punitive force to Tibet, which suppressed the uprising by 1268.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Rossabi (1988) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporal administration of Tibet was actually in the hands of officials from Sakya known as ''[[dpon-chen]]'' or ''pönchen''. Their functions were defined as follows: "He governs by order of the lama and by the mandate of the emperor. He protects the two laws (religious and civil) and keeps the realm tranquil and the religion flourishing."&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Petech (1990) p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''dpon-chen'' with responsibility for Central Tibet was stationed in Sakya from c. 1264. An implemented Mongol rule began about 1268-69 when a census was carried out and a Mongol administrative structure was set up. By this time Central Tibet was divided into 13 ''trikor'', usually rendered in English as "myriarchies", each under a local lord called ''tripon''. Meanwhile, other Sakya ''dpon-chen'' resided in Gongyo in Doto (Kham) and Lingtsang in Doma (Amdo).&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Petech (1990) pp. 43-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''dpon-chen'' of Ü-Tsang in this period were:
* Shakya Zangpo (c. 1264-1270)
* Kunga Zangpo (c. 1270-1275)
* Zhangtsun (c. 1275-?)
* Chukpo Gangkarwa (?-1280)

==Last years and death==
Phagpa and his successors as Sakya lamas were not literally viceroys under the Yuan although they were at the center of the Yuan administrative system in Tibet. Moreover, after Phagpa the offices of Imperial Preceptor and [[Sakya Trizin]] were kept strictly separate. While the later chronicles depict Phagpa and his successors as ruling over the 13 myriarchies and in an extended sense over the three ''cholka'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Tucci]] (1949) ''Tibetan painted scrolls''. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt; the authority of the Sakya Trizin was restricted to spiritual affairs. Given the paramount importance of the Buddhist religious hierarchy in Tibet, this still gave him an amount of influence.

Phagpa spent his last years in Tibet, where he was busy strengthening Sakya-Yuan authority over the still-restless country. He convened a general conference of the Buddhist hierarchs in 1277 with both spiritual and political leanings. He died in the Lhakhang palace in Sakya on 15 December 1280. There was an unsubstantiated rumour that he had been poisoned by the former ''pönchen'' Kunga Zangpo, whom he had dismissed some years previously for highhanded conduct. This led to an armed intervention by an army of Mongols and Amdo Tibetans in the next year, resulting in the execution of Kunga Zangpo and the strengthening of Mongol military presence in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Petech (1990) pp. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=kun dga' bzang po|url=http://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P1132|publisher=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system lasted until about the middle of the 14th century. During the reign of the 14th [[Sakya Trizin]], [[Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen]], the myriarch [[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]] of the [[Phagmodrupa Dynasty]] began to expand his power in the central province of Ü, marking the "beginning of the end of the period of Sakya power in Central Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Penny-Dimri (1995) "The Lineage of His Holiness Sakya Trizin Ngawang-Kunga", ''The Tibet Journal'', Vol. XX No. 4, Winter 1995, pp. 71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa|1967|p=86}}

Phagpa is played by [[James Hong]] in the 1982 miniseries [[Marco Polo (miniseries)|Marco Polo]]. In the series he is erroneously depicted as alive at the time of the departure of Marco Polo from China in 1293.

'''''Dulcitius''''' is a Latin comedy written by [[Hrotsvitha|Hrosvitha of Gandersheim]], a member of the female [[Gandersheim Abbey|Abbey of Gandersheim]] in [[Lower Saxony]].  Written between 935-973, ''Dulcitius'' is widely believed to be her most comic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre Histories: An Introduction|last=Zarrilli|first=Phillip B.|last2=McConachie|first2=Bruce|last3=Williams|first3=Gary Jay|last4=Sorgenfrei|first4=Carol Fisher|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0-415-22727-5|location=New York|pages=73|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play treats the figure of [[Dulcitius]], governor of [[Thessalonica]], as a subject for a comedy in the style of [[Terence]]. Although the play is dark, with a plot depicts the imprisonment and [[martyrdom]] of the three sisters, [[Agape, Chionia, and Irene|Agape, Chionia, and Irena]], nevertheless its content is presumably deemed less grave because of the reward awaiting the [[Christian]] sufferers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Plot ==
[[File:Menologion of Basil 065.jpg|right|thumb|Agape, Chionia, and Irena depicted in the ''[[Menologion of Basil II]]'']]
The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] wants to arrange marriages to members of his [[Court (royal)|imperial court]] for three virgin sisters, Agape, Chionia, and Irena. He insists they must renounce their [[Christian faith]] and worship the [[Roman gods]]. When the sisters refuse, the emperor orders them imprisoned and examined by Governor Dulcitius. When Dulcitius sees how beautiful the sisters are, he declares that he is in love. He tells his soldiers to lock them in the kitchen so he "can visit them oftener".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/roswitha-dulcitius.asp |title=The Plays of Roswitha: ''Dulcitus'' |publisher=Fordham University |access-date=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That night, in the darkness of the kitchen, Dulcitius embraces the pots and pans, thinking they are the women.

When he leaves the kitchen, Dulcitius is covered in soot and unrecognizable. The soldiers think he is [[Demonic possession|possessed]] and run away from him. Not realizing he is covered in soot, Dulcitius goes to the palace to tell the imperial court how he has been insulted. He is beaten and denied admittance to the palace because the ushers do not recognize him.

When Dulcitius goes to his wife, he realizes what has happened. In retaliation for his embarrassment, he commands that Agape, Chionia, and Irena be stripped in public. However, the soldiers are unable to remove the robes from the women's bodies. Since Dulcitius is sleeping, the soldiers tell Diocletian what has happened. The enraged emperor orders Count Sisinnius to punish the sisters.

Sisinnius has Agape and Chionia brought to him, believing that the younger Irena will change her views if she is no longer influenced by her older sisters. He orders Agape and Chionia burned alive when they refuse to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Their spirits leave their bodies, but their bodies and clothes miraculously are not burned.

Sisinnius threatens Irena with execution, but she refuses to renounce her faith. He orders the soldiers to "drag her to the lowest brothel you can find".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the soldiers quickly return and tell Sisinnius that Irena has escaped. Two well-dressed men came to them on the way to the brothel, saying Sisinnius wanted her taken to the top of a mountain. Sisinnius and the soldiers go to the mountain, but are unable to go up it. As Irena stands at the top, Sisinnius orders one of the soldiers to shoot her with an arrow. She dies looking forward to heaven.

== Background and writing ==
[[File:Roswitha of Gandersheim.jpg|thumb|upright|Hrosvitha of Gandersheim]]
There is little information on [[Hrosvitha]]'s life and background. According to information she provided in ''Carmen de Primordiis Coenobii Gandersheimensis'', she was born a long time after the death of [[Otto the Illustrious]] (November 30, 912), but was older than the daughter of [[Duke of Bavaria|Henry, Duke of Bavaria, Gerberga II]] (born after the year 940). Based on this information, Hrosvitha was born between 912 and 940, though historians generally agree that her date of birth is closer to 935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hrotsvitha: The Theatricality of Her Plays |last=Butler |first=Mary Marguerite |publisher=University of Michigan |year=1960 |isbn=1-258-18180-0 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonald|first=Irving T.|date=June 22, 1929|title=The Strong Voice of Gandersheim |journal=American Press Inc.|volume=|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hrosvitha divided her work into three books: ''Liber Primus'', ''Liber Secundus'', and ''Liber Tertius''. The first book is poetry, while the second book has the six plays she is largely known for, including ''Dulcitius''. The third book contains poetry and also the text from which historians have been able to deduce her approximate year of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeydel|first=Edwin H.|year=1947|title=A Chronological Hrotsvitha Bibliography Through 1700 with Annotations|url=|journal=The Journal of English and Germanic Philosophy|volume=46|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The playwright [[Terence]] was an influence on Hrosvitha. She copied his style in the praising of virgins. In Hrosvitha's preface to her collection, she acknowledges Terence's influence, noting that her plays provide an alternative for those who appreciate Terence's style. Her approach substitutes "the laudable chastity of holy maidens" for his "unchaste actions of sensual women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wailes |first=Stephen L. |title=Beyond Virginity: Flesh and Spirit in the Plays of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim |journal=Speculum |volume=76 |issue=1 |date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship between Terence and Hrosvitha represent a link between classical drama and the medieval morality plays.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Katharina M. |journal=Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature |title=The Old Hungarian Translation of Hrotsvit's Dulcitius: History and Analysis |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=Autumn 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==

=== Title and genre ===

The play's original title was ''Passio Sanctarum Virginum Agapis Chioniae Et Hirenae'' ("The Passion of the Holy Virgins Agape, Chionia, and Irena"), but has become more commonly known as ''Dulcitius'' because he serves as the central character in the comedic scenes. ''Dulcitius'' is considered to be Hrosvitha's most comedic work. However, just 56 lines out of 286 lines in the play are considered to be comedic and Dulcitius is only present in the first part of the play. Because of his limited presence, some have criticized Hrosvitha for creating no connection between the plotline of Dulcitius' adventures and that of the martyrdom of the three girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4173324 |journal=Studies in Philology |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=October 1960 |first=Douglas |last=Cole |title=Hrosvitha's most 'Comic' Play: ''Dulcitius''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portrayal of women ===

Hrosvitha's plays are believed to be aimed towards the Christian ideal of the [[Virginity|virginal woman]], and intended for reading rather than for performance.  Her intention was likely for her plays to be read aloud by the Sisters of her convent. However, some scholars dismiss the solely Christian context of Hrosvitha's writings, instead claiming that her plays provided women with models for female integrity, thus encouraging more positive views of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Case |first=Sue-Ellen |title=Re-Viewing Hrotsvit |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=35 |issue=4 |date=December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graham Bruce Hancock''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|n|k|ɒ|k}}; born 2 August 1950) is a British author and reporter. Hancock specialises in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific theories]]&lt;!--This is NPOV. Do not change it to softer words (e.g., unconventional) or it will be reverted.--&gt;&lt;ref name=Regal&gt;Brian Regal, ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009). {{ISBN|0-313-35507-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving [[Lost lands|ancient civilisations]], stone monuments or [[megalith]]s, [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]], ancient myths, and astronomical or astrological data from the past.

One theme of his works proposes a connection with a 'mother culture' from which he believes other ancient civilisations sprang.&lt;ref&gt;"...the belief of Hancock and other writers in a lost civilisation that passed its wisdom on to ancient Egypt or the Maya repeats the theme of ''Atlantis: the antediluvian world'' popularised by [[Ignatius Donnelly]] from 1882."

==Early life==
Born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, Hancock spent his formative years in India, where his father worked as a surgeon. Having returned to the UK, he graduated from [[Durham University]] in 1973, receiving a First Class Honours degree in sociology.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://grahamhancock.com/bio/ | title=Biography | accessdate=12 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Durham University gazette, XX |url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=bookreader/DU_Gazettes/DUGazette20_3/dg203METS.xml#page/22/mode/2up |website=reed.dur.ac.uk |accessdate=7 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Graham Hancock is married to Santha Faiia. Santha Faiia is a Malaysian of [[Tamils|Tamil]] origin from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], and she is also a professional photographer specializing in ancient cultures and monuments.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They have six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?2,368891,368891 | title=Biography | accessdate=12 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
As a journalist, Hancock worked for many British papers, such as ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. He co-edited ''[[New Internationalist]]'' magazine from 1976 to 1979, and served as the East Africa correspondent of ''[[The Economist]]'' from 1981 to 1983.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Works==

Hancock describes himself as an "unconventional thinker who raises controversial questions about humanity's past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahamhancock.com/library/default.htm|title=Books by Graham Hancock - Graham Hancock Official Website|website=grahamhancock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1990 his works dealt mainly with problems of economic and social development.  Since 1990 his works have focused mainly on speculative connections he makes between various archaeological, historical, and cross-cultural phenomena.

His books include ''Lords of Poverty'', ''[[The Sign and the Seal]]'', ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', ''[[Keeper of Genesis]]'' (released in the US as ''Message of the Sphinx''), ''The Mars Mystery'', ''Heaven's Mirror'' (with wife [[Santha Faiia]]), ''Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization'', and  ''Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith'' (with co-author [[Robert Bauval]]). In 1996 he appeared in ''[[The Mysterious Origins of Man]]''.&lt;ref name="SkepticalOrigins"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/9603/origins.html |title=NBC's Origins Show |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |date=March 1996 |first=Dave |last=Thomas |accessdate=19 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203134301/http://www.csicop.org/sb/9603/origins.html |archivedate=3 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote and presented the documentaries ''Underworld: Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age'' (2002) and ''Quest for the Lost Civilisation'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252165/|title=Quest for the Lost Civilization|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown on [[Channel 4]].

In Hancock's book ''Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith'',&lt;ref&gt;London: Michael Joseph, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7181-4315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with [[Robert Bauval]], the two put forward what sociologist of religion [[David V. Barrett]] called "a version of the old Jewish-Masonic plot so beloved by ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/preformtalisman-sacred-cities-secret-faith-by-graham-hancock--robert-bauvalpreform-557110.html | work=The Independent | first=David V | last=Barrett | title=Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith | date=19 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest a connection between the pillars of [[Solomon's Temple]] and the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]], and between the [[Star of David]] and [[The Pentagon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575347/How-Da-Vinci-Code-tapped-pseudo-fact-hunger.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Damian | last=Thompson | title=How Da Vinci Code tapped pseudo-fact hunger | date=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary review of ''Talisman'' by David V. Barrett for ''The Independent'' pointed to a lack of originality as well as basic factual errors, concluding that it was "a mish-mash of badly-connected, half-argued theories".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/talisman-sacred-cities-secret-faith-by-graham-hancock-robert-bauval-557110.html. Retrieved 27 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 piece for ''The Telegraph'' referencing ''Talisman'', Damian Thompson described Hancock and Bauval as fantasists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575347/How-Da-Vinci-Code-tapped-pseudo-fact-hunger.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Damian | last=Thompson | title=How Da Vinci Code tapped pseudo-fact hunger | date=12 January 2008}} Retrieved 27 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock's ''Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers of Mankind'', was published in the UK in October 2005 and in the US in 2006.  In it, Hancock examines [[paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|cave art]] in the light of [[David Lewis-Williams]]' [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] model, exploring its relation to the development of the fully modern human mind.

In 2015, his ''[[Magicians of the Gods|Magicians of the Gods: The Forgotten Wisdom of Earth's Lost Civilization]]'' was published by St. Martin's Press.

His first novel, ''Entangled: The Eater of Souls'', the first in a fantasy series, was published in the UK in April 2010 and in the US in October 2010. The novel makes use of Hancock's prior research interests and as he has noted, "What was there to lose, I asked myself, when my critics already described my factual books as fiction?"

His books have sold more than five million copies worldwide and have been translated into 27 languages. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017|reason= This seems to come from http://grahamhancock.com/bio/}}

Canadian author [[Heather Pringle]] has placed Hancock within a particular pseudo-intellectual tradition going back at least to [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s infamous research institute, the ''[[Ahnenerbe]]''.  She specifically links Hancock's book ''Fingerprints of the Gods'' to the work of [[Nazism|Nazi]] archaeologist [[Edmund Kiss]], a man described by mainstream scientists of the time as a "complete idiot".&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, Heather, ''The Masterplan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'' (2006), Fourth Estate, London p310&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Do not delete this without discussion on talk page.--&gt;

==Orion correlation theory==
{{main|Orion correlation theory}}

[[File:orion - pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|Representation of the central tenet of the [[Orion Correlation Theory|OCT]] – the outline of the Giza pyramids superimposed over a photograph of the stars in Orion's Belt. To achieve this concordance the pyramids have been rotated and scaled to suit. The validity of this match has been called into question by Hancock's critics, as noted in the text.]]

One of the many recurring themes in several of Hancock's works has been an exposition on the "[[Orion correlation theory]]" (or OCT),&lt;ref&gt;Graham Hancock, Santha Faiia.''Heaven's Mirror: Quest For The Lost Civilization'' (London: Michael Joseph, 1998). {{ISBN|0-7181-4332-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Kreisberg (editor), ''Lost Knowledge of the Ancients: A Graham Hancock Reader'' (Bear &amp; Company, 2010). {{ISBN|978-1-59143-117-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by Belgian writer [[Robert Bauval]] and then further expounded in collaborative works with Hancock, as well as in their separate publications.

==BBC ''Horizon'' controversy==
[[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' TV series broadcast a programme, ''Atlantis Reborn'', on 4 November 1999 that challenged the ideas presented by Hancock.  It detailed one of Hancock's claims that the arrangement of an ancient temple complex was designed to mirror astronomical features and attempted to demonstrate that the same thing could be done with perhaps equal justification using famous landmarks in New York. It also alleged that Hancock had selectively moved or ignored the locations of some of the temples to fit his own theories (see below).&lt;ref name="synop"&gt;{{cite web |year=2000 |title= Atlantis Reborn Again &amp;#123;programme synopsis&amp;#125; |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisrebornagain.shtml |work= Science &amp; Nature: Horizon |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate= 1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock claimed he was misrepresented by the programme, and he and [[Robert Bauval]] made complaints to the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] against the way ''Horizon'' had portrayed them and their work. Eight points were raised by Hancock, two by Bauval (one of which duplicated a complaint of Hancock's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Science &amp; Nature: Horizon |year=2000 |title=''Horizon: Atlantis Reborn'' and the Broadcasting Standards Commission |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisreborn_bsc.shtml |publisher= BBC |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the complaint that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The programme had created the impression that he [Hancock] was an intellectual fraudster who had put forward half-baked theories and ideas in bad faith, and that he was incompetent to defend his own arguments.
Adjudication: [The Commission] finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock in these matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Broadcasting Standards Commission  |year=2000 |title=Synopsis of adjudication: ''Horizon: Atlantis Reborn'' (November 4th 1999) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisreborn_bsc_synopsis.shtml |format=reproduced at BBC Online|work=Science &amp; Nature: Horizon |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The BSC dismissed all but one of the complaints. Overall, the BSC concluded that "the programme makers acted in good faith in their examination of the theories of Mr Hancock and Mr Bauval".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=30 November 2000|title=Fairness Complaints|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/bsc/pdfs/bulletin/bulletin37.pdf|format=PDF online reproduction|journal=The Bulletin|location=London|publisher=[[Broadcasting Standards Commission]]|volume=37|pages=1–3|author=Broadcasting Standards Commission|accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint which was upheld was that &lt;blockquote&gt;The programme unfairly omitted one of their arguments in rebuttal of a speaker who criticised the theory of a significant correlation between the Giza pyramids and the belt stars of the constellation Orion (the "correlation theory")&lt;/blockquote&gt; which the Commission did find to be unfair.  That speaker was the astronomer [[Edwin Krupp]]. Krupp argued that Bauval had fudged the maps of Orion and the Pyramids by placing them upside down in terms of stellar directionality to make the theory work.&lt;ref name=synop/&gt; The BBC was not obligated to do more than broadcast an apology for the single point of unfairness but made a decision to modify the Orion sequence to demonstrate that the overall argument of the film remained intact.

In ''Atlantis Reborn Again'', shown on 14 December 2000, Hancock and Bauval provided further rebuttals to Krupp and argued that the ancient Egyptians had made the Pyramids correlate with the three stars of Orion's Belt. However, the documentary as a whole continued to present serious doubts about Hancock's claims, demonstrating as an example how, by using his methods, the constellation of Leo may be 'discovered' among landmarks of modern Manhattan, concluding: "As long as you have enough points and you don't need to make every point fit, you can find virtually any pattern you want."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisrebornagain_transcript.shtml ''Atlantis Reborn Again''] BBC documentary transcript&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEDx talk==
Hancock gave a [[TEDx]] lecture titled "The War on Consciousness", in which he described his use of [[ayahuasca]], an amazonian brew containing a hallucinogenic compound [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and argued that adults should be allowed to responsibly use it for self-improvement and spiritual growth. At the recommendation of TED's Science Board, the lecture was removed from the TEDx YouTube channel and moved to TED's main website where it "can be framed to highlight both [Hancock's] provocative ideas and the factual problems with [his] arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/14/open-for-discussion-graham-hancock-and-rupert-sheldrake|title=News TEDx – Open for discussion: Graham Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake from TEDx Whitechapel|date=14 March 2013|website=TED Blog|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In 2009, [[Roland Emmerich]] released his blockbuster disaster movie ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'', citing ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' in the credits as an inspiration for the film,&lt;ref name="2012-credit-list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf|title=2012 (2009) – Credit List|accessdate=25 November 2009|publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: "I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook.

'''John Angarrack''' is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] [[Cornish self-government movement|nationalist]] who campaigns for greater recognition of [[Cornish people|Cornish identity]] and is a self-published author on Cornish affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Deacon|Deacon, Bernard]] (2007) ''Cornwall: the Concise History'', (The Histories of Europe series) [[University of Wales Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-7083-2032-7}} (hardback) 978-0-7083-2031-0 (paperback), page 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cornish nationalism==
Angarrack's campaign to revive Cornish culture and language featured in a 2005 article in the European edition of ''[[Time Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1096430,00.html "The Lost Tribes of Europe" an article in ''Time magazine'' Europe edition, 29 August 2005 by [[James Geary]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political campaigns==
Angarrack was one of the founder members of [[Cornwall 2000]], an organisation based in [[Bodmin]], [[Cornwall]]. The group lobbied the [[UK government]] over the specific exclusion of the Cornish from the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]].
They were, however, unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to take matters to court, and the campaign was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mudhook.wordpress.com/category/cornish-fighting-fund/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kutjevo 01.jpg|thumb|Kutjevo Abbey]]
'''Kutjevo Abbey''', also known as '''Gotó''' ({{lang-la|Vallis honesta de Gotho}}) was a [[Cistercian]] monastery in what is now [[Croatia]], in the area of [[Slavonia]], 23 km north-east of [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]].

== History ==
The monastery was founded in 1232 as a daughter-house of [[Zirc Abbey]] in [[Hungary]], of the filiation of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]]. The Cistercians planted the vineyards, which are still cultivated today. After the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] attack of 1521 (or 1529) the monastery was dissolved and subsequently destroyed.

In 1689 the monastery estate was granted by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] to Ivan Babić, a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Zagreb]], who was named titular abbot. In 1698 the site was re-settled by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who remained there until 1773. In 1882 the property was acquired by Vjenceslav Turković and Franjo Türk who developed a significant wine production on it. After [[World War II]] this was conducted as a [[Socialist]] enterprise.

== Buildings and precinct ==
The existing building complex was built by the Jesuits in the 18th century on the ruins of the Cistercian monastery. The former monastery church, dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], still stands.

'''List of World War I memorials and cemeteries in the area of the [[Saint-Mihiel]] [[salient (geography)|salient]]''', in the present day [[Meuse department]] of the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine region]], located in northeastern [[France]].

In this region the monuments and cemeteries are divided into: those linked to the efforts of the French to regain the ridge at [[Les Éparges]], from 1915−1918; and those linked to the American offensive of the St Mihiel salient, the [[Battle of St Mihiel]] in September 1918.

==War Memorials and Cemeteries: Saint-Mihiel and the area of the St Mihiel salient==

After the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and on 13 September 1914, the 5th German Army went into retreat and retrenched east of Verdun on the Woëvre plain and at the foot of the "Heights of the Meuse" (the Hauts de Meuse). From here they intended to relaunch their offensive and reach the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse river]]. From 20 September, the Germans attacked on a line from Étain to Pont-à-Mousson and in several days had effectively created a bulge in the French line reaching as far as [[Saint-Mihiel]], where they were halted by General Taverna's 16th Army Corps. What was to be known as the "St Mihiel Salient" was formed.

Part of the area taken by the Germans was the ridge or "Crête" at Les Éparges. This ridge was of great strategic importance because of the views in gave over the Woëvre plain and the French knew that they would never be able to retake the plain without first taking Hauts de Meuse and in particular the ridge at Les Éparges .

In the 1914-1918 war, the ridge at Les Éparges at 346 meters high was to serve as a counterpoint to the Butte de Vauquois. Both these areas of high ground served as eastern and western ends to the Verdun sector of the Western Front. Both were fought over fiercely and both were the scene of intensive mine warfare after head to head encounters produced no noticeable break through for either side.

==The Crête des Éparges and its memorials and monuments==
The main French attempts to take the ridge were launched by General Joffre in 1915 and that year saw a series of French attacks, all fought with fierce intensity and resulting in much loss of life. The encounters embraced the Tranchée de Calonne, the woods of Chavalier and the wood at Brûlée. The ridge itself saw many bitter encounters and the terrain was soon changed for ever by the detonation of mines the digging of tunnels and constant artillery shelling.

From 5 to 14 April 1915, the 1st French Army under General Roques engaged the Germans on the ridge and the Woëvre plain but they were unable to take the ridge. At one point they advanced as far as "Point X", the furthest point east on the ridge and that giving the best views over the plain but they were soon forced back. The ridge was divided by the French into various areas gauged in their distance from the original French front line. Thus "Point A" was the nearest to the French trenches and "Point X" the furthest away. These attacks absorbed the attention of the entire French 1st Army and they lost the equivalent of an entire division – almost 18,000 men. It was no accident that Maurice Genevoix, the French novelist, was to call his narrative of the battle, "La Morte"- Death.

The trench fighting was not restricted to the Les Éparges ridge and south of St Mihiel there were encounters in the Ailly wood and that at Brûlée. Here the fighting involved General Bourges' 8th Army Corps.

Once the many encounters of 1915 had produced no major breakthrough for either side, the fighting on the surface was less intense and fighting moved underground and over the years of the war the ridge continued to be mined comprehensively from  Point C to Point X. Now the fighting was to go underground to an even greater extent, with a war of tunnels and mines and in this period, 46 German mines and 32 French mines were detonated but still without producing any change in the front line.

In 1916, the waging of the Battle of Verdun saw the French withdraw voluntarily from the Woëvre plain area from 22 to 26 February and the French took up their main defensive position around the Fort at Moulainville which was bombarded by the German 420mm guns.

There was no great change to the front line in 1917 and it was only when the Americans attacked on 12 September 1918 that the salient was to again hear the roar of the guns and be finally freed from German occupation.

Today one can see many reminders of these encounters in the ridge's terrain and there are several monuments and memorials to mark the contributions of those who fought here and this list will identify and describe some of them

===Monument to the 106th French Regiment of Infantry===

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|Monument to the 106th French Regiment of Infantry
|-
|This monument, entitled "Les Revenants du 106e. R.I" ( a "revenant" could be translated as one who has gone missing) and dating to 1935, remembers the actions of the 106th French Infantry here at Les Éparges between September 1914 and April 1915. The monument carries the words {{Quotation|"Je Crois”}} or "I believe".

It takes the form of a pyramid with a death mask at the top looking towards heaven and below and from a pile of skulls and bones, skeletal hands claw upwards towards the death mask. Given that many of those who died would have been buried alive in the many explosions and artillery bombardments, the sculptor creates a macabre suggestion of a corpse trying to escape from an enforced and unwanted tomb.

One attack here was made by the 106th on 17 February 1915, following the detonation of a huge mine. The Bavarian defenders withdrew from their first trench line when the attack began and then their artillery, knowing the exact coordinates of their old trench line, poured shellfire on to the French. The result was carnage and this bombardment, and a series of German counterattacks over the next few days, destroyed the regiment – the 106th lost 300 men killed, 300 men went missing and their bodies were never found and over 1,000 men were wounded. The misery was not over however and the regiment would be given reinforcements and sent to take part in the attempts to take Point X in March and April, 1915. This monument is the work of the great French sculptor Maxime Real Del Sarte and at the base there is a bronze bas-relief by him which depicts a helmeted woman cradling a soldier in her arms, the work reminiscent of an ancient "Pieta". It will however be the death mask, the skulls and the upward reaching skeletal hands that will linger long in the mind.

The monument was erected in 1935 and on the left hand side there is a quotation taken from the writings of Maurice Genevoix  {{Quotation|"VOUS QUI AVEZ PRIS VOTRE VIE A DEUX MAINS ET L'AVEZ PORTEE D'UN ELAN JUSQU'AUX LEVRES DE L'ENTONNOIR SOUS LES BALLES"}}

|On 22 September 1914, the young author Alain Fournier – the writer of the novel "Le Grand Meaulnes" – and twenty comrades of the 288th French Infantry disappeared. Fournier had been a tutor to T. S. Eliot and friend to Charles Peguy, another young French writer who would die in September 1914.

Fournier's body was not discovered until the 1990s. It is thought that he and the others lying in a mass grave alongside him were shot in reprisal for their shooting at a German ambulance company. Fournier and his companions are buried today in the nearby French military cemetery at St Remy-la-Calonne.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:5pxQ9a0MmeYJ:www.saintmihiel-tourisme.fr/medias/files/circuit-autour-de-saint-mihiel-ang-1.pdf+Memorial+to+Alain+Fornier+and+companions&amp;gl=fr&amp;pid=bl Memorial to Alain Fornier and companions] St Mihiel Tourism.

|The fort at Troyon was built between 1878 and 1879 as part of the defensive line between Nancy and Verdun. It was designed by [[Séré de Rivières]] and is unusually made entirely from bricks, not concrete. The fort successfully resisted the German attacks in September 1914 and so protected the rear flank of the French troops taking part in the Battle of the Marne and saved Verdun from being surrounded and taken. Some 450 soldiers had held on for 6 days against heavy Austro-German artillery fire and a division of the German 5th Army. It was the only fort along the line from Verdun to Toul that did not fall into German hands. The Troyon Fort lay forgotten for 80 years, but is now looked after by the "Ceux de Troyon" Association. In 1916, a small obelisk was erected in memory of those who defended the fort and in 1918 the Fort at Troyon served as a hospital for American soldiers fighting to liberate Saint Mihiel and to take Mount Montsec.

|In 1870, France was partly occupied by the [[Prussia|Prussian army]] as a result of the latter's victory in the Franco-Prussian war. As a result of this defeat, the [[Séré de Rivières system]] of fortifications was planned and various forts were constructed to defend the nation and the fort at Liouville was one such fortification. The fort dominates the [[Woëvre]] valley and blocks the Marbotte and Lérouville gaps in the Hauts de Meuse, watching over the rail line to [[Lérouville]]. The fort was bombarded by German artillery for a large portion of the war, with the heaviest fire between 22 September and 16 October 1914. The 'Fort de Liouville  was also known as Fort Stengel and is located between the communes of Saint-Agnant-sous-les-Côtes and Saint-Julien-sous-les-Côtes, near the town of [[Commercy]] in the [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meusetourism.com/en/705/3/0/PCULOR055FS00004/sit/detail/northern-france-holidays-lorraine-tour-verdun-tourism/fort-de-liouville-apremont-la-foret Fort de Liouville] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305000545/http://www.meusetourism.com/en/705/3/0/PCULOR055FS00004/sit/detail/northern-france-holidays-lorraine-tour-verdun-tourism/fort-de-liouville-apremont-la-foret |date=5 March 2016 }} Meuse Tourism.

==The Saint-Mihiel salient. The American Offensive of 1918 and the Monuments and Cemeteries linked it==
When the German armies launched their five great offensives of 1918, the Allies realised that the situation was perilous and that the arrival of the American troops was now crucial but when these troops began to reach France, General John. J. Pershing, the Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces, was reluctant to allow his men to be rushed into action and used piecemeal but wanted to concentrate on consolidation and acclimatisation and getting his men organised as an effective fighting units. He did however release to French control some of his troops when the German third and fifth offensives put the French Army under great pressure and these contributions and the efforts of the units involved are recorded at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and on the Chateau-Thierry Monument.

Once the success of the Second Battle of the Marne had seen the German Army retreating, the Allied Command were determined to keep the Germans on the back foot and several major offensives were planned at an Allied conference on 24 July. 1918. The British and French forces were allocated the sector around Amiens and the St Mihiel sector was allocated to the Americans. This salient projected roughly 16 miles into the Allied line and ran from Verdun in the north, south to St Mihiel and then east to Pont-a-Mousson on the Moselle River. The area was bordered by a line of hills known as the Heights of the Meuse and a succession of marshes and lakes situated across deep ravines and dense forests. The salient also protected the strategic rail centre of Metz and the Briey iron basin, a rich source for the Germans of raw material for munitions production. It also constituted an ongoing threat to Verdun and Nancy. It was essential that the salient be reduced before any larger offensive be launched against Metz or Briery or in the Argonne sector further north which had also been allocated to the Americans.

On 30 August,  the U.S.First Army was asked to limit its efforts to the reduction of the salient so that very soon after it could undertake the larger task presented in the Meuse/Argonne area.

The St. Mihiel offensive began on 12 September with a threefold assault on the salient. The main attack was made against the south face by two American corps. The First Corps was on the right(from right to left the 82nd, 90th, 5th, and 2nd Divisions in line with the 78th in reserve) and covered a front from Pont-à-Mousson on the Moselle,  westward to Limey, while on the left, the Fourth Corps (from right to left the 89th, 42nd, and 1st Divisions in line with the 3rd in reserve) extended along a front from Limey westward to Marvoisin. A secondary thrust was carried out against the west face of the salient along the Heights of the Meuse, from Mouilly north to Haudimont, by the Fifth Corps (from right to left the 26th Division, the French 15th Colonial Division, and the 8th Brigade, 4th Division in line with the rest of the 4th in reserve). A holding attack against the apex, to keep the enemy in the salient, was made by the French II Colonial Corps (from right to left the French 39th Colonial Division, the French 26th Division, and the French 2d Cavalry Division in line). In the First Army reserve were the American 35th, 80th, and 91st Divisions. The Allies also mobilized 1,481 aircraft to provide air superiority and close air support over the front.

Defending the salient was German "Army Detachment C", consisting of eight divisions and a brigade in the line and about two divisions in reserve. The Germans had begun a step-by-step withdrawal from the salient the day before.

By 16 September, the salient was eliminated and now the Americans would need to move their focus to the Meuse-Argonne.

|-
|This monument in Euville stone was erected in 1932 on the Butte de Montsec which offers a magnificent, wide panorama over the Madine Lake and the Côtes de Meuses. The monument celebrates the capture of the St Mihiel salient by the American First Army, the operations of the American Second Army from 9 to 11 November 1918 and other combat services of American divisions both in this region and in Alsace and Lorraine. The monument consists of a large circular colonnade at the centre of which, on a raised platform, is a bronze relief map of the St.Mihiel Salient.

On the right side of a flight of steps leading to the monument is engraved {{Quotation|“This monument has been erected by the United States of America to commemorate the capture of the St Mihiel Salient by the troops of her First Army and to record the services of the American Expeditionary Forces on the battlefront in this region and elsewhere in Lorraine and in Alsace. It stands as a lasting symbol of the friendship and cooperation between the French and American armies."}}

The same inscription is repeated in French on the left side of the flight of steps and near the top of the monument and on the outside lintel are engraved the names of villages and towns where battles were fought in this region {{Quotation|"THIAUCOURT – VIGNEULLES – FRESNES – VIEVILE – ST. BENOIT – NORROY – BENEY – JAULNY – FRAPELLE – HAUMONT – ST. HILAIRE – XAMMES – NONSARD – VILCEY – ST. BAUSSANT – VANDIERES."}}

===St Mihiel American Cemetery and Memorial===
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"| St Mihiel American Cemetery and Memorial
|-
|The cemetery is located at the western edge of Thiaucourt-Regniéville and covers an area of 40.1/2 acres. It sits in the centre of what was the St Mihiel salient and the majority of the 4,153 soldiers buried here were killed in the capture of the salient. It is the third largest of the eight permanent World War I American military cemeteries. It is run by the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] to whom administration was passed in 1934. The buildings in the cemetery are made from Euville limestone and the architects used were Thomas Harlan Ellett of New York.

At the intersection of the central mall and transverse axis in the centre of the cemetery is a large sundial on which sits an eagle gnomon and the shadow cast by the eagle gnomon in relation to the lead Roman numerals set in the flat surface of the base indicates the time of day. Around the sundial's circular base is inscribed {{Quotation|"Time will not dim the glory of their deeds"}}

At the west end of the transverse axis is a sculptured stone figure of a young American officer. It is the work of the New York sculptor [[Paul Manship]]. The soldier stands in his field uniform with his trench helmet held in his hand. He carries side arms and a map case and above his head are the words {{Quotation|"”IL DORT/LOIN DES SIENS/DANS LA DOUCE/TERRE DE FRANCE."}}. (Translation:" He sleeps far from his family in the gentle land of France.")

On the pedestal below him are the words  {{Quotation|”Blessed are they that have the home longing for they shall go home"}}

At the centre of the peristyle is a large rose-granite urn similar to an ancient funereal vase. The winged horse Pegasus is one of the vase's decorative features.

There is also a small museum and on the side walls are black marble panels, and at the top of each panel is written {{Quotation|“In memory of those American soldiers who fought in this region and who sleep in unknown graves. Listed below are the names of the 284 American soldiers who gave their lives in this area, but whose remains were not recovered or identified."}}

The '''Lwów pogrom''' ({{lang-pl|pogrom lwowski}}, {{lang-de|Lemberg pogrom}}) was a [[pogrom]] of the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish population]] of the city of [[Lwów]] (since 1945, [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]) that took place on  September 27, 1914 during the [[World War I]]. Following a reported robbery, or shots, involving Russian military in the Lviv's Jewish neighbourhood, [[Russian Cossacks]] assaulted nearby Jewish civilians, resulting in about 40 civilian casualties and a number of injuries. In the aftermath, no Cossacks were persecuted, but several Jews were arrested, through released shortly afterward. &lt;ref name="Mick2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Mick|title=Lemberg, Lwow, and Lviv 1914-1947: Violence and Ethnicity in a Contested City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VEfDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|year=2016|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-671-6|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constance Mary Turnbull''' (February 9, 1927 – September 5, 2008) was a British [[historian]] lauded for her lifetime of literary research writing contributing to the documentation of Asian history, and for her documentary work on ''The History of Singapore''. Her expertise on Singapore history and citations from her book ''The Straits Settlements'' was instrumental to the case presented by the Singapore legal team to the [[International Court of Justice]], in claiming sovereignty over [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|Pedra Branca]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=expert&gt;{{cite news|title=Expert on S'pore history dies at 81|last=Liaw|first=Wy-Cin|publisher=Straits Times|date=2008-09-11|page=B7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary was born the only child to David Turnbull (1900-1961), a native farm-owner in the [[Cheviot Hills]], and Edna Mary Williamson (1901-1991), a schoolteacher from [[Laxey]] in the [[Isle of Man]], on a farm not far from [[Wooler]], [[Northumberland]]. In the 1920s [[Coventry]] grew to be the centre of UK motor industry, and her family moved to the thriving city when her father, who had been forced give up farming as a result of the [[Great Depression]], found a job in [[motorcar]] engineering at the [[Rootes Arrow|Rootes]] car factory. Throughout her childhood Mary led a happy but simple life despite having to live with different relatives during the [[Great Depression]] while her parents were both looking for work in Coventry, and being evacuated several times during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Revathy|first=C.|editor-last=Jayakumar|editor-first=Shashi|title=Prof Mary Turnbull|volume= accession no. 003025 (reel 1)|year=2006|accessdate=2008-12-24|publisher=National Archives|location=Singapore|url=http://www.a2o.com.sg/a2o/public/search/ohcDetail.jsp?id=027246&amp;siteIndex=1&amp;total=2&amp;keyword=mary+turnbull&amp;matchType=1&amp;dateFromStr=1900&amp;dateToStr=2000&amp;index=0&amp;index=1&amp;index=2&amp;index=3&amp;index=4&amp;index=5&amp;index=6&amp;index=7|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; She often described the experience of living through the [[Coventry Blitz]] and later, as a university student, the "doodlebugs" ([[V-1 flying bombs]]) in London.

On leaving Bedford College, London,  she worked for [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in what would now be termed the Human Resources department. Looking for a more adventurous life, she joined the Malayan Civil Service, the first female administrative officer to be recruited to the Service, and one of only two women who would ever work in that capacity for the colonial authorities. She later joined the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, but on her marriage to businessman Leonard Rayner in 1962, moved to Singapore. Here she was a member of the History Department until 1971 when she moved to Hong Kong to take up a post as lecturer at the University's History Department. It was during her time in Hong Kong that Mary first published her 'History of Singapore'.

In 1988 Mary retired from her position as Head of the History Department at Hong Kong University, although she remained in Hong Kong until her husband, Leonard, also retired in 1990. The couple moved back to the UK and settled in the village of [[Sulgrave]], Northamptonshire. Mary continued to write, and travel around Britain, Europe, the United States, Australia and New Zealand and on occasions, visited Singapore and Malaysia. In the 1990s she was commissioned by [[The Straits Times]] to compile the history of the Singapore newspaper company and in 1995,  ''Dateline Singapore: 150 Years Of The Straits Times'' that resulted from nearly 3 years' of work, was launched to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the newspaper title.&lt;ref name=expert/&gt;

Following the death of her husband in 1995, Mary moved to Oxford where she became a fellow of St Antony's College and a member of Oxford University's International Strategic Studies Committee. On the afternoon of September 5, 2008, she was diagnosed with a serious heart condition during a routine check-up and died hours later of a ruptured [[aorta]] while awaiting surgery. She had completed the final revisions for the third edition of ''A History of Singapore'' just days before her death.,&lt;ref name=expert/&gt;

'''Peter the Patrician''' ({{lang-la|Petrus Patricius}}, {{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Πέτρος ὁ Πατρίκιος}}}}, ''Petros ho Patrikios''; {{circa|500}}–565) was a senior East Roman or [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] official, [[diplomat]], and [[historian]]. A well-educated and successful [[lawyer]], he was repeatedly sent as envoy to [[Ostrogothic Italy]] in the prelude to the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War of 535–554]]. Despite his diplomatic skill, he was not able to avert war, and was imprisoned by the [[Goths]] in [[Ravenna]] for a few years. Upon his release, he was appointed to the post of ''[[magister officiorum]]'', head of the imperial secretariat, which he held for an unparalleled 26 years. In this capacity, he was one of the leading ministers of Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527–565), playing an important role in the Byzantine emperor's religious policies and the relations with [[Sassanid Persia]]; most notably he led the negotiations for the [[Fifty-Year Peace Treaty|peace agreement]] of 562 that ended the 20-year-long [[Lazic War]].&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{harvnb|ODB|p=1641}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical writings survive only in fragments, but provide unique source material on early Byzantine ceremonies and diplomatic issues between Byzantium and the Sassanids.

==Biography==

===Early career: envoy to Italy===
[[File:Sanvitale03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) and his entourage, mosaic from the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].]]

Peter was born in [[Thessalonica]] about the year 500, and was of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] origin according to [[Procopius]]; according to [[Theophylact Simocatta]], however, his origin was from Solachon, near [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="PLRE994"&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1992|p=994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying [[law]], he embarked on a successful career as a lawyer in [[Constantinople]], which brought him to the attention of Empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; In 534, on account of his rhetorical skills, he was employed as an imperial envoy to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic court]] at [[Ravenna]]. At the time, a power struggle was developing there between Queen [[Amalasuntha]], regent to the young king [[Athalaric]], and her cousin [[Theodahad]]. Following the death of Athalaric, Theodahad usurped the throne, imprisoned Amalasuntha, and sent messages to Emperor Justinian hoping for recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1923|pp=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/18A*.html#2 161–164]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter met the envoys at [[Vlorë|Aulon]], on his way to Italy, and notified Constantinople, seeking new instructions. Emperor Justinian ordered him to convey the message to Theodahad that Amalasuntha was under the Emperor's protection and not to be harmed. Nevertheless, at the time Peter arrived in Italy, Amalasuntha had been killed; Procopius's narrative in the ''Gothic War'' is ambiguous here, but in his ''Secret History'', he explicitly claims that Peter arranged the murder of Amalasuntha on instructions from Theodora, who feared her as a potential rival for Justinian's attentions.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1923|pp=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/18A*.html#2 164–166]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever assurances might have been privately given by Theodora to Theodahad, in public, Peter strongly condemned the act, and declared that there would be "war without truce between the emperor and themselves" as a result.&lt;ref name="BGI4"&gt;Procopius. ''De Bello Gothico'', [[s:History of the Wars/Book V#IV|I.4]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter then returned to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the [[Roman Senate]] to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, but by the time he reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an [[ultimatum]]: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1923|pp=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/18B*.html 168–169]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: [[Belisarius]] took [[Sicily]], while [[Mundus (general)|Mundus]] invaded [[Dalmatia]]. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1923|pp=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/18B*.html 172–173]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with [[Athanasius (praetorian prefect)|Athanasius]], bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1923|pp=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/18B*.html 173–175]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Magister officiorum''===
Peter remained imprisoned in Ravenna for three years, until released in June/July 539 by the new Gothic king, [[Witigis]], in exchange for Gothic envoys sent to [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]] who had been captured by the Byzantines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bury|1923|p=[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/18D*.html#9 206]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a reward for his services, Emperor Justinian then appointed Peter to the post of ''[[magister officiorum]]'' ("Master of the Offices"), one of the highest positions in the state, heading the palace secretariat, the imperial guards (the ''[[Scholae Palatinae]]''), and the [[cursus publicus|Public Post]] with the dreaded ''[[agentes in rebus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ODB|p=1267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He would hold this post for 26 consecutive years, longer by a wide margin than any other before or after.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1993|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time or shortly thereafter, he was raised to the supreme title of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and the supreme senatorial rank of ''[[gloriosissimus]]'' ("most glorious one"). He was also awarded an honorary [[Roman consul|consulship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1992|p=996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As ''magister'', he took part in the discussions with Western bishops in 548 on the [[Three-Chapter Controversy]], and was repeatedly sent as an envoy in 551–553 to [[Pope Vigilius]], who opposed the emperor on the issue. Peter is also recorded as attending the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in May 553.&lt;ref name="PLRE1"&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1992|pp=996–997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier, 565 AD.png|thumb|right|300px|The Roman–Persian border as agreed in 561–562.]]

In 550, he was sent as envoy by Justinian to negotiate a peace treaty with Persia, a role he reprised in 561, when he met the Persian envoy Izedh Gushnap at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]], to end the [[Lazic War]].&lt;ref name="PLRE1"/&gt; Reaching an agreement over the Persian evacuation of [[Lazica]] and the delineation of the border in [[Armenian Highlands|Armenia]], the two envoys concluded a fifty-year peace between the two empires and their respective allies. The annual Roman subsidies to Persia would resume, but the amount was lowered from 500 to 420 pounds of gold. Further clauses regulated cross-border trade, which was to be limited to the two cities of Dara and [[Nisibis]], the return of fugitives, and the protection of the respective religious minorities (Christians in the Persian Empire and [[Zoroastrians]] in Byzantium). In exchange for Persian recognition for the existence of Dara, whose construction had originally sparked a [[Anastasian War|brief war]], the Byzantines agreed to limit their troops there and remove the seat of the ''[[magister militum per Orientem]]'' from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1996|p=259}}; {{harvnb|Dignas|Winter|2007|pp=144–148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As disagreements remained on two border areas, [[Suania]] and Ambros, in spring 562, Peter travelled to Persia to negotiate directly with the Persian Shah, [[Chosroes I]], without however achieving a result.&lt;ref name="PLRE997"&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1992|p=997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Constantinople, where he died sometime after March 565.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1992|pp=997–998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Theodore, nicknamed Kontocheres or Zetonoumios, would succeed him as ''magister officiorum'' in 566, after a brief interval where the post was held by the ''[[quaestor sacri palatii]]'' ("Quaestor of the Sacred Palace") [[Anastasius of Samaria|Anastasius]]. He held the post until some time before 576, being appointed as ''[[comes sacrarum largitionum]]'' ("Count of the Sacred Largess") thereafter; in the same year, he also led an unsuccessful embassy to Persia to end the ongoing [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 572–591|war over the Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1992|pp=1255–1256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
As one of the leading officials of the age, Peter was a controversial figure, receiving greatly differing assessments from his contemporaries. To [[John Lydus]], a mid-level bureaucrat of the [[praetorian prefecture of the East]], Peter was a paragon of every virtue, an intelligent, firm but fair administrator and a kind man.&lt;ref name="PLRE997"/&gt; Procopius in his public histories attests his mild manners and desire to avoid giving insult,&lt;ref name="BGI4"/&gt; but in his private ''Secret History'' he accuses him of "robbing the ''scholares''" (the members of the ''Scholae'') and being "the biggest thief in the world and absolutely filled with shameful avarice", as well as being responsible for the murder of Amalasuntha.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius. ''Secret History'', [[s:The Secret History/Part 5#Chapter XXIV|XXIV.24]].&lt;/ref&gt;

From quite early in his career, Peter was renowned for his learning, his passion for reading, and his discussions with scholars.&lt;ref name="PLRE998"&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|1992|p=998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a speaker, he was eloquent and persuasive; Procopius calls him "fitted by nature to persuade men",&lt;ref&gt;Procopius. ''De Bello Gothico'', [[s:History of the Wars/Book V#III|I.3]].&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cassiodorus]], who witnessed his embassies to the Ostrogoth court, also praises him as ''vir eloquentissimus'' and ''disertissimus'' ("most eloquent man"), and as ''sapientissimus'' ("most wise").&lt;ref name="PLRE994"/&gt; On the other hand, the late 6th-century historian [[Menander Protector]], who relied on Peter's work for his own history, accuses him of boastfulness and of rewriting the records to enhance his own role and performance in the negotiations with the Persians.&lt;ref name="Cam390"&gt;{{harvnb|Maas|2005|p=390}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Peter wrote three books, all of which survive only in fragments: a history of the first four centuries of the [[Roman Empire]], from the death of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC to the death of Emperor [[Constantius II]] in 361 AD, of which about twenty fragments are extant (it has been suggested that the third-century material in this was taken from [[Philostratus]]&lt;ref&gt;Prophecy and History in the Crisis of the Roman Empire: A Historical Commentary on the Thirteenth Sibylline Oracle. By David S. Potter. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990: Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;); a history of the office of ''magister officiorum'' from its institution under [[Constantine the Great]] (r. 306–337) to the time of Justinian, containing a list of its holders and descriptions of various imperial ceremonies, several of which are reproduced in chapters 84–95 of the first volume of the 10th-century ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' of Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] (r. 913–959); and an account of his diplomatic mission to the Persian Empire in 561–562, which has been used as a source by Menander Protector.&lt;ref name="PLRE998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cam390"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ODB|pp=596, 1641}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, Peter was also ascribed the authorship of the 6th-century ''Peri Politikes Epistemes'' ("On Political Science"), a six-volume book discussing political theory, drawing extensively from Classical texts such as [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' and [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De re publica]]''. It too survives only in fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ODB|pp=1629–1630}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter was the first late Roman/Byzantine author to write on imperial ceremonies,&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; beginning a tradition that lasted unto the 14th century. His histories are also an important historical source; for instance, his work alone preserves the negotiations and provisions of the Roman–Persian treaty of 298 between [[Galerius]] and [[Narseh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dignas|Winter|2007|p=122}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Lost'' History ''of Peter the Patrician'', published by Routledge in 2015, is an annotated translation from the Greek by [[Thomas M. Banchich]] of the fragments of Peter’s ''History'', including additional fragments which used to be considered the work of the Roman historian Cassius Dio's so-called Anonymous Continuer.

'''Potápky''' ("The Grebes") or '''bedly''' ("The Parasol Mushrooms") were a Czech urban [[youth subculture]] primarily defined by the interest in [[American culture]], primarily in [[swing music]] It corresponsed to the subcultures of ''[[Swingjugend]]'' (literally "Swing Youth", commonly translated as "Swing Kids") in [[Nazi Germany]] and ''[[zazou]]'' in [[France]] at the same time period.&lt;ref name=koura&gt;Petr Koura, ''[https://is.cuni.cz/webapps/zzp/detail/24326/ Swingová mládež a nacistická okupační moc v protektorátu Čechy a Morava''] ("The swing kids and the Nazi occupational power in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia"), Ph.D. Thesis, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skolakemvprotektoratu.pamatnik-terezin.cz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89&amp;Itemid=95 "Protektorátní školák a jeho volný čas"] ("A Student in the Protectorate and His Free Time")&lt;/ref&gt;

Potápky were distinguished by their eccentric fashion ("[[zoot suit]]", deformed hat, colored socks), long hair, body postures, and slang.&lt;ref name=koura/&gt;

As many youth subcultures it was characterized by the rebellion against the older generation, and since [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] occupation ([[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], since 1940), it was rebellion against the Nazis.&lt;ref name=koura/&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Coat of Arms of the Spanish Heir apparent as Prince of Girona.svg|thumb|right|200px|Coat of arms of [[Leonor, Princess of Asturias]] as Princess of Girona (unofficial)&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://blogdeheraldica.blogspot.com/2010/06/articulo.html The arms of the Spanish Heir apparent as Princess of Girona.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]--&gt;

The '''Prince''' or '''Princess of Girona''' ({{lang-ca|Príncep o Princesa de Girona}}) was historically the title accorded to the [[heir apparent]] or [[heir presumptive]] to the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Current legislation mandates the title of [[Prince of Asturias]] to the heir of the Spanish throne but allows for the use of other traditional titles; The current title-holder therefore, is [[Leonor, Princess of Asturias]].

==Origin of the title==
It originated in 1351 when King [[Peter IV of Aragon]] named his successor, to whom he conceded the title of Duke of [[Girona]]; the title embraced territories of the [[Girona|counties of Girona]], [[Besalú]], [[Empúries]] and [[Ausona]].

In part I of the ''Constitucions i Altres Drets de Cathalunya'', the section headed ''Genealogia dels Reys d'Aragó i Comtes de Barcelona'' speaks of the genealogy of [[John I of Aragon]], son of Peter IV, saying that John and [[Violant of Bar|Violant]] had a son named James, "lo qual intitularen Delphi de Girona".  On 19 February 1416, [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]], considering the title of duke insufficient,  raised it to the rank of '''Principality of Girona'''.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, there has never been a "Principality of Girona" independent of the Crown of Aragon.&lt;/ref&gt;    However, these titles fell into gradual disuse until the 20th century as the heir of the King of Spain became better known by the hereditary title of the [[Crown of Castile]], "[[Prince of Asturias]]."

==Modern usage==
In 1961, when announcing the wedding the future [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] and [[Sofia of Greece]], the Spanish Royal House issued the young prince, as titles of pretense, the style of "Prince of Asturias," "Prince of Girona," and "[[Prince of Viana]]" — these three titles referring to his status as [[heir apparent]] to the kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Navarre]] respectively.  He started using the titles of "Prince of Girona" on his passport during the rule of [[caudillo]] Franco, to avoid the more contentious title [[Prince of Asturias]] which was well known to be reserved for the heir of the throne of Spain.  His father had adopted a similar tactic, styling himself [[Juan, Count of Barcelona]]; using the title of [[King of Spain]] would have been seen as directly subersive to the [[Francoist State]].  However, calling himself [[Count of Barcelona]] was a clear attempt at asserting his hereditary rights to then defunct Spanish throne, as there had been no Count of Barcelona who was not either King of Aragon or of Spain since the Middle Ages.

When Juan Carlos was finally given an official capacity in the Spanish state as heir to the kingdom by General Franco, he received the title of "Prince of Spain" and thus began to use this until he became King of Spain. On 21 January 1977 his son, Felipe, would be the first to use all of these titles in any official capacity for over 250 years.

With the accession of Felipe to the throne in 2014, his elder daughter Leonor became Princess of Girona, as heiress presumptive to the throne of Aragon. 
The Princess of Girona Foundation was created in 2009 and is now run on behalf of Princess Leonor: it funds programmes to aid young people. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Princess of Girona Foundation|url=https://en.fpdgi.org/who-we-are/presentation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[surgeon]], board-certified in [[urology]] having earned a doctorate in [[biochemistry]] and [[nutrition]] from [[Cornell University]]. Cornum worked at Letterman Army Institute of Research at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] and entered the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]], Bethesda, Maryland in 1982.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=For Military Merit - Recipients of the Purple Heart|last=Borch|first=Fred L.|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59114-086-3|location=Annapolis, MD|pages=81-83}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired in 2012 as a [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier General]] the Director of [[Comprehensive Soldier Fitness]] in the Army Staff G-3/5/7 division.&lt;ref name=usacac&gt;{{cite web

She commanded the [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]], was president of her class at the [[National War College]], and then became the command surgeon for [[United States Army Forces Command]]. As a brigadier general, she was [[U.S. Army Surgeon General|U.S. Army Assistant Surgeon General for Force Protection]] before working in the joint soldier fitness program. Brigadier General Cornum retired on 31 January 2012.

==Early life and education==
After her training in biochemistry, she attended the national military medical school. During her studies, she met her future husband, Kory Cornum, who would have a parallel military career in the [[U.S. Air Force]] and also attain the rank of brigadier general.

==Career==
At the U.S. Army Aviation Center, Cornum both researched and worked as a flight surgeon at the [[United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence]]. Her interests were focused on the human factors of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Persian Gulf War===
As a [[flight surgeon]] with the 229th Attack Helicopter Regiment, then-Major Cornum was aboard a [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk helicopter]] on a search and rescue mission, looking for a downed F-16 pilot, during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,438760,00.html |title=A Woman's Burden |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine |date=March 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the helicopter was shot down on February 27, 1991, she suffered two broken arms, a broken finger, a gunshot wound in the back, and other injuries.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; After regaining consciousness, she said her first thought was "Nobody’s ever died from pain."&lt;ref name=USAR&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://myarmyreserve.dodlive.mil/2011/05/21/nobody-has-ever-died-from-pain/
| accessdate = August 4, 2012
| title = Nobody has ever died from Pain
| publisher = U.S. Army Reserve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornum  was captured, made a [[prisoner of war]] (POW), and sexually assaulted by one of her Iraqi captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/war/5.html |title=war story: rhonda cornum |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was first taken to Basra and then held prisoner for a week in Baghdad and released on March 5, 1991.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, she was subjected, with other prisoners, to a [[mock execution]].&lt;ref name=USAR/&gt; Nevertheless, when she was the senior-ranking prisoner, she took responsibility for other POWs. She later co-wrote a book about her experiences, ''She Went to War: the Rhonda Cornum Story'' ({{ISBN|0891415076}}), with Peter Copeland.

In an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'', she said the sexual assault "ranks as unpleasant; that's all it ranks....everyone's made such a big deal about this indecent assault, but the only thing that makes it indecent is that it was non-consensual. I asked myself, 'Is it going to prevent me from getting out of here? Is there a risk of death attached to it? Is it permanently disabling? Is it permanently disfiguring? Lastly, is it excruciating?' If it doesn't fit one of those five categories, then it isn't important." She continued, "there's a phenomenal amount of focus on this for the women but not for the men," citing that the "mistreatment of [fellow POW] Major Jeffrey S. Tice of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], who had a tooth explode from its socket when he was [[torture]]d with jolts of electricity."

Cornum resumed her military career after she returned to the United States. She also served as the staff Urologist at Eisenhower Army medical Center at Fort Gordon, Georgia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She testified about this to the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Services. Initially, she did not mention this abuse, at the request of her chain of command, when first repatriated. She gave additional detail in her book.

==Awards and decorations==
Cornum's decorations include the [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhonda L.

'''Russian ballet''' ({{lang-fr|Ballet russe}}) is a form of [[ballet]] characteristic of or originating from [[Russia]].

==Imperial Russian Ballet==
Until 1689, ballet in Russia was nonexistent.  The Tsarist control and isolationism in Russia allowed for little influence from the West. It wasn't until the rise of [[Peter the Great]] that Russian society opened up to the West. [[St. Petersburg]] was erected to embrace the West and compete against Moscow’s isolationism. Peter the Great created a new Russia which rivaled the society of the West with magnificent courts and palaces. His vision was to challenge the west. Classical ballet entered the realm of Russia not as entertainment, but as a “standard of physical comportment to be emulated and internalized-an idealized way of behaving.”&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Homans (2010), 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim was not to entertain the masses of Russians, but to cultivate a new Russian people. 
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Lande.jpg|thumb|Jean-Baptiste Landé founded Russian ballet.]]

[[Anna of Russia|Empress Anna]], (1730 – 1740) was devoted to ostentatious amusements (balls, fireworks, tableaux), and in the summer of 1734 ordered the appointment of [[Jean-Baptiste Landé]] as dancing-master in the military academy she had founded in 1731 for sons of the nobility. In 1738, he became ballet master and head of the new ballet school, launching the advanced study of ballet in Russia, and winning the patronage of elite families.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel H. Cross, "The Russian Ballet Before Dyagilev." ''Slavonic and East European Review. American Series'' 3.4 (1944): 19-49. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3020187 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

France provided many leaders such as [[Charles Didelot]] in St Petersburg (1801-1831),  [[Jules Perrot]] (1848-1859) and [[Arthur Saint-Léon]] (1859-69).

In the early 19th century, the theaters were opened up to anyone who could afford a ticket. A seating section called a rayok, or 'paradise gallery', consisted of simple wooden benches. This allowed non-wealthy people access to the ballet, because tickets in this section were inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;Roslavleva, Natalia. ''Era of the Russian Ballet''&lt;/ref&gt;

One author describes the Imperial ballet as “unlike that of any other country in the world…the most prestigious of the ballet troupes were those attached to the state-supported theatres.  The directors of these companies were personally appointed by the tsar, and all the dancers were, in a sense, Imperial servants.  In the theatre, the men in the audience always remained standing until the tsar entered his box and, out of respect, after the performance they remained in their places until he had departed.  Curtain calls were arranged according to a strict pattern:  first, the ballerina bowed to the tsar’s box, then to that of the theater director, and finally to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992), 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1900s the Russian ballet went beyond its borders and infiltrated Paris. It had become its own force and was distinctly Russian, while still being embraced by the Parisian society. In 1903 Ivan Clustine, a Russian dancer and choreographer who had started his career at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]], was appointed [[Ballet master|Maître de ballet]] at the [[Paris Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;Roslavleva (1966), 154-55&lt;/ref&gt; Clustine's hiring promoted a frenzy of questions about his nationality and choreographic agenda: “His hiring was thought a direct attempt by the Opera to imitate the Russian company; even he thought as much, maintaining, not without despondency, that inspiration too often came from the north:  ‘A revolution!  A method that people often apply in the country of the tsars.’  Clustine, although acknowledging his nationality with pride, harbored none of the revolutionary intentions that some thought an inevitable consequence of being Russian.”&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Davinia Caddy, The Ballets Russes and Beyond:  Music and Dance in Belle-Epoque Paris (Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2012), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parisians, while denying adoption of the backwards Russian troupe, had distinct Russian influence in their theater.  “Despite Clustine’s protestations, several features of the Opera’s post-1909 ballets, along with its institutional conventions and balletic policy, appeared to betray a Russian influence.”&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Caddy (2012), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma of Russian brutality and force was applied even in Paris.  While their style was not only being accepted in Paris, but implemented in Paris theaters, the [[Ballets Russes]] were still considered dangerous, even in the theatre of performing art.  “The Ballets Russes, at base, became a metaphor for invasion, an eternal force that could engulf and control, could penetrate the membrane of French society, culture and even art itself.”&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  The embracing of Russian ballet in the Paris society became a point of contention and French nationalism collided with Russian determination.  Questions arose about the Russian intention in the Paris theaters under the title “cultural politics” including “the delimitation of boundaries, the preservation of identity and the nature of relational engagements.”&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;   Russia was incapable of simply bringing Russian culture to the West, but created a paranoia of intentions wherever they went.  In the beginning, the relationship between Russia and France through the arts was a testimony to their political allegiances.  “French critics acknowledged a shared choreographic heritage:  French ballet had migrated to Russia in the nineteenth century, only to return, decades later, under the guise of the Ballets Russes.  The company, then, moored in a history that intertwined both nations, not only contributed to a cultural programme of exchange.  The Ballets Russes were a testament to Franco-Russian cooperation, goodwill and support; they represented ‘un nouveau resserrement de l’alliance’ (a further strengthening of the alliance).”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   However, the relationship made a negative turn when duplicity amongst the alliance arose.  While Russia continued to borrow money from the French banks, “the Russians no longer interested in supporting French culture and colonial politics.”   This duplicity gave fuel for the paranoia and lack of trust we see in the relationship concerning the arts.  The Parisian press spoke of the Ballets Russes in terms of both “enchantement’, ‘bouleversement’ and ‘fantaisie’.  Yet they also invoked metaphors of invasion, describing the company’s Parisian presence in terms of ‘assaut’ (onslaught) and ‘conquete’ (conquest).”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   The dual-faceted relationship can be seen in this expression of both enrapture and contention.  One French journalist, Maurice Lefevre, called on his fellow Parisians to see the reality of the Russian invasion as though it was an infestation, “We need to do some soul-searching and ask whether our guests are not about to become our masters.”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  To imply that Russia was about to take over France through performing arts seems to be irrational, but evidence would suggest the fears were real among those in Paris.

==Ballet companies==
The first ballet company was the Imperial School of Ballet in St. Petersburg in the 1740s. [[Sergey Diaghilev]], (1872-1929), an enormously important figure in the Russian ballet scene, founded the ballet company [[Ballets Russes]] in the 1909. Diaghilev intervened in every aspect of ballet - direction, production, lighting, scenery, and performance.  He headquartered his ballet company in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Sergeĭ Leonidovich Grigorʹev, ''The Diaghilev Ballet, 1909-1929'' (Constable, 1953). &lt;/ref&gt; A protégé of Diaghilev, [[George Balanchine]], founded the [[New York City Ballet]] in 1948.  Today, the Kirov Ballet company (now known as the [[Mariinsky Ballet]]) and the Bolshoi company are two world-renowned Russian ballet companies that tour the world.
*[[Mariinsky Ballet]] (formerly Kirov ballet)
*[[Bolshoi Ballet]]

Other Russian ballet companies include:

*[[Ballets Russes]], founded in 1909
*[[Moscow State Academy of Choreography]], commonly known as The Bolshoi Ballet Academy, founded in 1773
*[[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet]], founded in 1738 as the Imperial Ballet School
*[[Boris Eifman|Saint Petersburg Eifman Ballet]], founded in 1977
*[[Mikhailovsky Theatre|Mikhailovsky Theatre Ballet]], founded in the 1930s
*[[Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre|Perm Theatre Ballet]], founded in 1896
*[[Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre|Novosibirsk Theatre Ballet]], founded in 1945
*[[Russian State Ballet of Siberia]], founded in 1978

A number of companies have been called, or included in their name, ''[[Moscow Ballet]]''.

==Methods==
Several methods exist in Russian ballet. The most widely used is the [[Vaganova method]], named after the ballerina and teacher, [[Agrippina Vaganova]].&lt;ref&gt;Willia-Aarnio, Peggy.

'''Salimbene di Adam, [[Franciscans|O.F.M.]]''', (or '''Salimbene of Parma''') (9 October 1221 – {{circa}} 1290) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Franciscan]] friar, theologian, and [[chronicler]] who is a  source for [[Italy|Italian]] history of the 13th century.

==Life==

He was born in [[Parma]], the son of Guido di Adam, a [[crusade]]r. Salimbene was a follower of [[Joachim de Fiore]], and a believer in his apocalyptic teachings.  Salimbene joined the Franciscan order in 1238 at the [[friary]] of [[Fano]].

He then led a life of wandering, avoiding his father who did not wish him to join the Order, and visited Pisa and other Italian towns; then in 1247 he was sent to [[Lyon]], and visited [[Paris]], [[Ferrara]] [[Cremona]], [[Troyes]], [[Florence]], [[Ravenna]], [[Genoa]], [[Reggio Emilia|Reggio]] and the [[Montefalcone Abbey|friary of Montefalcone]] (near [[San Polo d'Enza]] in the region of [[Emilia-Romagna]]).  The last was the probable site of his death.

==Works==

Salimbene's main work was his ''Cronica'' ("Chronicle"), covering the years 1167&amp;ndash;1287.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by G. Scalia in the series "Scrittori d'Italia", Bari 1966, and earlier in the same series by F. Bernini, 1942 (see link below).; G.C. Coulton, ''From St Francis to Dante: translations from the chronicle of the Franciscan Salimbene'' (London 1907; reprinted Philadelphia 1972) is called a "paraphrase" by David Abulafia, ''Frederick II: A Medieval Emperor'' (Oxford 1988) p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was begun around 1282 and begins with the founding of [[Alessandria]].  His extensive travels meant that he met many important people of the time including [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Louis IX of France]] and [[Pope Innocent IV]].  He also describes everyday life vividly and gives unrivalled detail into internal disputes in the Franciscan order at the time.

He also wrote ''The Twelve Calamities of Emperor Frederick II'' and several treatises now lost. "The Twelve Calamities" is set up as a kind of servant's narrative (Exempla, examples), made to demonstrate the faults of Frederick II - often with loosely fitted biblical quotations.  One of the major themes of the work is Salimbene's emphasis on [[numerology]]. The chronicle itself is set up to demonstrate the parallel between the ten plagues and the ten calamities of Frederick II (conveniently he tacked on the last two after the parallel).  Emphasizing the Christian nature of his narrative and the non-Christian nature of Frederick, Salimbene turns a phrase used during the crusades claiming that “if he had been a good Catholic and had loved God, the Church, and his own soul, he would scarcely have had an equal as an emperor in the world.”&lt;ref&gt;Di Adam, Salimbene.

The popularity of genealogy, encouraged by the increasing use of the [[Internet]] is encouraging a number of people to mass-market what authorities regard as '''scam "genealogical books"''' which are sometimes promoted by affiliated websites. They tend to contain a general introduction, a section about the origin of surnames in general, a section about heraldry, a couple of blank charts for the purchaser to copy and complete once he has done his own research, a few recipes and (sometimes) a list of names, addresses and telephone numbers culled from the publicly available telephone directories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com/library/view/columns/eastman/3538.asp Ancestry.com - Genealogy Scams&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The books are not unique to a particular surname, are not published annually and contain no pictures of the buyer's family members. In a recent case, Jeffery Scism, a San Bernardino, California genealogist, said the fines for such practises are puny when compared with the hundreds of thousands of dollars he believes such vendors rake in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4455021,00.html Album seller settles case : More Business : The Rocky Mountain News]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109075556/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4455021,00.html |date=January 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subcomandante Elisa''' (born '''María Gloria Benavides Guevara''') is a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] activist who, before her arrest and the revelation of her identity, was a subcomandante in [[Mexico]]'s Zapatista Army of National Liberation. Her arrest has been considered illegal, and her detention and indictment, controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Viento de Libertad - Los saldos de la represión por motivos políticos en México: "''Benavides, María Gloria (Elisa)''". February 8, 1996 [http://www.vientodelibertad.org/spip.php?article1203] Accessed April 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1996, the Human Rights Watch published that the police had arrested María Gloria Benavides, at approximately 4:15 pm on February 8, 1995 after they raided her home in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch: "''Torture and Other Abuses During the 1995 Crackdown on Alleged Zapatistas.''" Vol 8. No. 3 (B) Mexico, February 1996 [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Mexico1.htm] Accessed April 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She was acquitted of all charges on November 1.&lt;ref&gt;''idem''&lt;/ref&gt;

She remains active within the Zapatista community and currently resides in [[Mexico City]].

== Biography and activities ==

Benavides was born in the northern city of [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]], probably sometime in January 1955. She joined the movement in her teens. She was first arrested in 1974, in a raid on a house. She was found alive, but next to her was her first husband's body. After her release she rejoined the movement only to lose her second husband and baby daughter in another military raid.

Early in the 1980s she was working  as a translator with [[Catholic]] peasants in the small villages of [[Chiapas]]. She met Elorriaga when he joined the movement in the mid 1980s. They were later married. Benavides took charge of training the native Mayans. Sometime in the early 1990s she moved to Mexico City, and worked from the university spreading political information on behalf of the EZLN. Sometime in 1993 she gave birth to her son.

In February 1994 she was arrested in connection with the Zapatista uprising, but later cleared of charges.

She is married to [[Javier Elorriaga]] Berdegue. Today she and her husband continue to work on behalf of the indigenous people of [[Chiapas]].

Sanderson, Civilizations and world systems: studying world-historical change, 1995, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://teacherweb.ftl.pinecrest.edu/snyderd/MWH/readings/Urban/City%20Pop%20-%20History.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes estimates of the population of cities since ancient times. Although the book has been widely quoted,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, Migration in world history, 2005, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marks, The origins of the modern world: a global and ecological narrative from the fifteenth to the twenty-first century, 2007, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; urban historians have criticized Chandler's superficial and uncritical use of sources, leading to unreliable population estimates for many past cities.&lt;ref&gt;Jan de Vries, European urbanization 1500-1800, 1984, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bairoch, Cities and economic development: From the dawn of history to the present, 1988, pp.116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==

Outside of his mainstream work on populations of ancient cities, Chandler held many alternative ideas on history which he discussed in his book ''Godly Kings and Early Ethics'' where he presented his ideas on Moses and his belief that [[Zeus]] and other figures in [[Greek mythology]] were actual people. He developed these claims in some of his other books as well, some of his claims included:

*That Zeus was a king in Moses' time.
*That Tubal of ancient Spain may have built Stonehenge.
*That Moses was Ikhnaton's vizier Ramose.
*That Chinese writing was derived from that of Moses.
*That Hindu reincarnation concepts came from Egypt.
*That Noah was the same person as the ancient Greek Aeneas.

'''''Two Actors in Samurai Roles from the series "Tales of Brave Warriors of Renown"''''' is an ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[woodblock print]] diptych by Osaka-based late [[Edo period]] print designer {{Nihongo|[[Konishi Hirosada|Gosōtei Hirosada]]| 五粽亭廣貞|}} ([[floruit|fl.]] c. 1819-1863). Each sheet depicts a ''[[kabuki]]'' actor as a [[samurai]], and belongs to a series of prints celebrating illustrious figures in Japan's martial tradition. The print belongs to the permanent collection of the [[Prince Takamado]] Gallery of Japanese Art in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], Canada.

===Series===
The prints are taken from the print series {{Nihongo|高名武勇伝|''Kōmei buyūden''|}}, which is translated as "Tales of Brave Warriors of Renown" or "Tales of Renowned Heroes." Hirosada produced multiple albums of this type including over one hundred heroic warrior images as single sheets and polytychs, including {{Nihongo|忠孝武勇伝|''Chūka buyūden''|}} ("Tales of Loyalty and Filial Devotion") also issued in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Fiorillo "Konishi Hirosada"&lt;/ref&gt; Doesburg has argued that such print collections reflect an attempt to circumvent censorship of kabuki-themed ''ukiyo-e'' under the Tenpō Reforms by cloaking the dramatic content in titles that imply the promotion of moral values and "suggesting that the portraits were actually representations of famous men and women from history and legend." Although these images date from the period immediately after the easing of the Tenpō restrictions, they appear to be riding this trend.

===Play===
The scene in this diptych is taken from the play {{Nihongo|''Go Taiheiki Shiroishi Banashi''|碁太平記白石噺|}}. Originally written in 1780 for the ''[[ningyō jōruri]]'' puppet theatre by {{Nihongo|Kijō Tarō|紀上太郎|}},{{Nihongo|Utei Enba|烏亭焉馬|}} and {{Nihongo|Yō Yōtai|容楊黛|}}, the play was soon adapted for the kabuki stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kotobank&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh act, commonly referred to as "Ageya", is still performed on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;Shōriya "Ageya"&lt;/ref&gt;

Made up of eleven acts, the play is part {{Nihongo|''[[jidaimono]]''||}} historical drama and part {{Nihongo|''[[sewamono]]''||}} contemporary drama. It recounts the story of the [[Keian Uprising]] of 1651 led by {{Nihongo|[[Yui Shōsetsu]]|由井正雪|}} (d. 1651), a commoner who rose to prominence as an expert swordsman and martial artist. Frustrated by the increasingly strict regulations placed on the [[samurai]], Yui and a small band of ''[[rōnin]]'' attempted to stage a coup against the ruling [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. The plot was discovered, Yui arrested and ultimately allowed to commit ''[[seppuku]]'' ritual suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom 1963, 79&lt;/ref&gt; The other section of the play tells the story of a revenge plot hatched by two long-lost sisters. Reunited in an Edo brothel, the two women plan to exact vengeance on the evil samurai who killed their farmer father.&lt;ref&gt;Shōriya "Ageya"&lt;/ref&gt;

The diptych is taken from a performance of the play which was staged in the eighth month of 1848 at Osaka's Kado Theatre.
&lt;ref&gt;The Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum of Waseda University&lt;/ref&gt; The print on the right is of the actor Ichikawa Ebizō as {{Nihongo|Uji Hyōbu-no-suke|宇治兵部助|}}(also {{Nihongo|Uji Jōetsu|宇治常悦|}}), a fictionalized version of rebel leader Yui Shōsetsu. The left print shows Arashi Rikan as {{Nihongo|Kanae Tanigorō|金井たに五郎|}} (also {{Nihongo|金江谷五郎|Kanai Yagorō|}}).

===Description===
The diptych depicts two samurai facing each other in dramatic combative poses. They both wear ''waraji'' straw sandals, dark blue thigh-length [[kimono]], and light blue ''[[Obi (sash)|obi]]'' tied casually around their waists. Both figures have ''[[chonmage]]'' topknots and carry two swords tucked into their ''obi''. The figure on the left stands in an active pose with one foot off the ground. With his right hand he raises a sword over his head, and in his left he profers an ''ōgi'' [[hand fan|folding fan]] with writing—possibly a poem—on it. The figure on the right wears a more elaborate kimono, which includes a ''[[haori]]'' jacket decorated with a flower ''[[Kamon (crest)|kamon]]'' family crest on the sleeve and shoulder. He stands with his legs widely and firmly planted, about to grab his sword.

The scene takes place outdoors against the backdrop of pinetrees. Like the sky and ground which are grey with no detail, the trees appear simply as silhouettes. Among the trees in the background is the shadow of a building with a traditional thatched roof. On the ground between the two figures is a fire.

==Subjects==

===Arashi Rikan III===
Born in 1812, Rikan III began his stage career appearing with his father's travelling actor troupe. As a youth, however, he began studying kabuki under the head of the Arashi Rikan family, Rikan II. He performed very frequently on the Osaka, [[Edo]] and [[Kyoto]] stages. although especially praised for his ''[[tachiyaku]]'' (male heores) and ''[[onnagata]]'' female roles, he has been described as "an outstanding kaneru yakusha,"&lt;ref&gt;Shōriya "Arashi Rikan III"&lt;/ref&gt; which is to say he was capable of performing a wide variety of both male and female roles. He was particularly praised for his powerful physique and voice, as well as his ''[[shamisen]]'' playing. Rikan III remained active on the stage until his death in 1863. He is buried on the grounds of Hōzenji Temple in the Dōtombori entertainment district of Osaka.&lt;ref&gt;Shōriya "Arashi Rikan III"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ichikawa Ebizō V===
Born in Edo in 1791, Ebizō was the son of a ''shibai jaya'' (theatre tea-house) owner and grandson of Ichikawa Danjūrō V, one of the biggest kabuki stars of his day. He first appeared on the stage in 1794 at the age of three, and went on to become an "outstanding tachiyaku [actor of male roles] and the most popular actor of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Shōriya "Ichikawa Ebizō V"&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as "highly original", and as being particularly skilled at performing multiple roles within the same play and the requistite quick changes.&lt;ref&gt;Banham 1995, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebizō V gained infamy in the summer of 1842 when he was found to be in violation of the restrictive [[sumptuary law]]s imposed through the Tempō Reforms. He was arrested and temporarily banished from Edo to Kamigata on the grounds that his ostentatious lifestyle was deemed to be irreconcilable with the Tokugawa bakufu's call for modesty and frugality.&lt;ref&gt;Banham 1995, 214&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to return seven years later, and had a very active career until his death in 1859. His sons continued his tradition, and both the Danjūrō and Ebizō lines continue to this day.

==Medium and genre==

===''Kamigata-e''===
Gosōtei Hirosada's works are categorized as {{Nihongo|''kamigata-e''|上方絵|}}, a term used to distinguish prints produced in the Kamigata area (Kyoto and Osaka) from those produced in Edo.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS, "Kamigata-e"&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining prominence about a century after the emergence of ''ukiyo-e'' in Edo,&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa 2005, 229&lt;/ref&gt; ''kamigata-e'' were predominantly {{Nihongo|''kabuki-e''|歌舞伎絵|}} (images of ''kabuki'' actors),&lt;ref&gt;Other names for this genre are: {{Nihongo|''shibai-e''|芝居絵|}}, {{Nihongo|''gekijou-e''|劇場絵|}}, {{Nihongo|''gekiga''|劇画|}}.(JAANUS "yakusha-e")&lt;/ref&gt; and were produced almost exclusively by amateur “talented kabuki fans” promoting their favourite actors.&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa 2005, 230&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kabuki-e''===
Literally 'kabuki pictures', ''kabuki-e'' began to be produced in Edo in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS "kabuki-e"&lt;/ref&gt; As kabuki grew in popularity, stars emerged, which in turn led to the {{Nihongo|''yakusha-e''|役者絵|}} (actor print) subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS "yakusha-e"&lt;/ref&gt; Further subgenres of ''yakusha-e'' include {{Nihongo|''ōkubi-e''|大首絵|}} bust portraits, {{Nihongo|''zenshin-zu''|全身図|}} full-length portraits, {{Nihongo|''mitate-e''|見立絵|}} parody pictures, and {{Nihongo|''shini-e''|死に絵|}} death portraits.&lt;ref&gt;JAANUS "kabuki-e"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Late 1930s.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]
'''Vladimir Ivanovich Nemirovich-Danchenko''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Владимир Иванович Немирович-Данченко}}; {{OldStyleDate|23 December|1858|11 December}} – 25 April 1943, Moscow), [[People's Artist of the USSR|PAU]], was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and Soviet theatre director, writer, [[Theatre pedagogy|pedagogue]], playwright, producer and theatre administrator, who founded the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] with his colleague, [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], in 1898.

==Biography==
[[File:Vladimir Nemirovich Danchenko3.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]]
Vladimir Ivanovich Nemirovich-Danchenko was born into a mixed [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] family in the village of [[Shemokmedi]] near [[Ozurgeti]] ([[Guria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]). His Ukrainian father, Ivan Danchenko, was an officer in the Imperial Russian army, and his mother, Alexandra Yagubyan (1829–1914), was Armenian. He went to high school in [[Tbilisi]], continuing his education at [[Moscow State University]] (physical-mathematical and juridical departments 1876–79). 

In 1879 he left the University for the theatre, starting as a theatre critic, and in 1881, his first play "Dog-rose", which was staged in one year by [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]], was published. 
He was a teacher of [[Moskvin]], [[Olga Knipper|Knipper]] and [[Meyerhold]].&lt;ref name="BertenssonFryer2004"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Sergei Bertensson|author2=Paul Fryer|author3=Anna Shoulgat|title=In Hollywood with Nemirovich-Danchenko, 1926–1927: the memoirs of Sergei Bertensson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-q7vtY7jXUC&amp;pg=PR16|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4988-4|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1919, he established the Musical Theatre of the Moscow Art Theatre, which was reformed into the [[Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="BertenssonFryer2004"/&gt; In 1943 Nemirovich-Danchenko established the [[Moscow Art Theatre School]], which is still extant.{{cn|date=August 2015}} 

He died of a heart attack on 25 April 1943, aged 84, in Moscow.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Legacy==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2015}}
Nemirovich-Danchenko's  [[Moscow Art Theatre]] staged [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]] drama with theretofore unknown naturalism and full expression. In addition, his theatre presented highly acclaimed [[Dostoevsky]] and [[Tolstoy]] dramatizations. It has been said {{Whom?|date=July 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that "If [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavsky]] was the soul of Art Theatre, then Nemirovich was its heart".

Nemirovich-Danchenko created the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]'s acting and directing style, known for "actors ensemble" and its "atmosphere". Because of his directorial and production skills, the Moscow Art Theatre was considered, at the time, the best theatre in the world.{{Whom?|date=July 2010}} But Nemirovich didn't write down his acting "system"and we know only the "[[Stanislavski's system|system of Stanislavski]]".{{proveit|date=August 2016}} He was one of the first recipients of the title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]] in 1936. Later, he was awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] (1942, 1943), the [[Order of Lenin]] (3 May 1937), and [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] (25 February 1936).

A '''wooden spoon''' is usually given to an individual or team which has come last in a competition, but sometimes also to runners-up. Examples range from the academic to sporting and more frivolous events. The term is of British origin and has spread to other Commonwealth countries outside North America.

== Wooden spoon at the University of Cambridge ==
The wooden spoon was presented originally at the [[University of Cambridge]] as a kind of [[booby prize]] awarded by the students to the man who achieved the lowest exam marks but still earned a [[third-class degree]] (a ''junior optime'') in the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|last=Grose|first=Francis|year=1811|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402|accessdate=26 May 2013|at=Entry: "Wranglers"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stray&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Mordecai|editor-last=Feingold|author-first=Christopher|author-last=Stray|title=The History of Universities XXVI/1|chapter=The Wooden Spoon: Rank (dis)order in Cambridge 1753–1909|chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/7596201/Rank_dis_order_in_Cambridge_1753-1909_the_Wooden_Spoon|date=2012|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "wooden spoon" or simply "the spoon" was also applied to the recipient,&lt;ref name=Gradus&gt;{{Cite book| title = Gradus ad Cantabrigiam| author=A Brace of Cantabs. (pseudonym)| publisher = J. Hearne| year = 1824|url=https://archive.org/details/gradusadcantabr00unkngoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prize became quite notorious:
[[File:SelwynCollegeCambridge Library 11.jpg|thumb|left|]]
{{Quote|
And while he lives, he ''wields'' the boasted prize&lt;br /&gt;
Whose value all can feel, the weak, the wise;&lt;br /&gt;
Displays in triumph his distinguish'd boon,&lt;br /&gt;
The solid honours of the ''Wooden Spoon''&lt;ref name=Tart&gt;{{cite book| title = The Cambridge Tart |author = Socius |publisher = Smith |place = London|year = 1823 |page = 98|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgetartepi00londuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|98}}
}}

The spoons themselves, actually made of wood, grew larger, and in latter years measured up to five feet long. By tradition, they were dangled in a teasing way from the upstairs balcony in the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]], in front of the recipient as he came before the Vice-Chancellor to receive his degree, at least until 1875 when the practice was specifically banned by the University.&lt;ref name=Selwyn&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sjc1/selwyn/mathematics/spoon.html | title=Cambridge Mathematical Tripos: Wooden Spoons | author=Stephen J. Cowley | accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Queens&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/page-1152 | title=Queens' College Cambridge: 'A Queens' Wooden Spoon' | author=Jonathan Holmes | year=1998 | accessdate=27 July 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest placed students earning a second-class (''senior optime'') or first-class degree (''wrangler'') were sometimes known as the "silver spoon" and "golden spoon" respectively.&lt;ref name=Gradus/&gt; In contrast, the highest-scoring male student was named the "[[senior wrangler]]". Students unfortunate enough to place below the wooden spoon, by achieving only an Ordinary degree, were given a variety of names depending on their number.&lt;ref name=Tart/&gt;{{rp|284}} In the 1860s about three-quarters of the roughly 400 candidates did not score enough to be awarded honours, and were known as  ''poll men''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galton|first=Francis|title=Hereditary Genius-An Enquiry into its Laws and Consequences|year=1869|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom dates back at least to the late 18th century, being recorded in 1803,&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt; and continued until 1909.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/whatson/index.cgi?event=EV200905270001.xml&amp;cat=exhibitions&amp;radar=7 | title= University of Cambridge Exhibitions: "In honours mathematical, the very last of all: Cambridge Wooden Spoons" | date=27 May 2009 | accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1910 onwards the results have been given in alphabetical rather than score order, and so it is now impossible to tell who has come last, unless there is only one person in the lowest class.&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt;

===Last award===
[[File:Wooden Spoon 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|The last wooden spoon]]
The last wooden spoon was awarded to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the [[Lady Margaret Boat Club]] of [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1909 at the graduation ceremony in the University's Senate House. The handle is shaped like an oar and inscribed with an epigram in [[Greek language|Greek]] which may be translated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Honours Mathematical,&lt;br /&gt;
This is the very last of all&lt;br /&gt;
The Wooden Spoons which you see here;&lt;br /&gt;
O you who see it, shed a tear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alternatively:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This wooden object is the last souvenir of the competitive examinations in mathematics. Look upon it, and weep.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last spoon to be awarded is now in the possession of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], with an earlier version being kept at the [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn College Library]]. From 8 June 2009 to 26 June 2009, St. John's College held an exhibition of the five surviving wooden spoons in College hands, from St. John's (the last one, dating from 1909), Selwyn's (1906),&lt;ref name=Selwyn/&gt; [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel's]] (1889) and [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi's]] (1895 and 1907) in its library to mark the centenary of the "awarding" of the last spoon of all.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/library/spoonsbooklet.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five known wooden spoons in private hands.&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt;

== In sport ==
===Rugby union &lt;span id="Rugby Union"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Six Nations Championship]]--&gt;
How the Cambridge wooden spoon idea came to be used in [[rugby union]] is not exactly known, but in the early years of what is now the [[Six Nations Championship]] there were many Cambridge graduates playing, so they may have attempted to preserve the concept after the last one was awarded in 1909. It is certain, in any case, that the tradition first arose in Cambridge and rugby adopted and perpetuated the tradition. In 1894 the ''South Wales Daily Post'' remarked that within the Home Nations Championships the [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]-[[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] match has been to decide which team should be recipient of the ignominious Wooden Spoon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Godwin, Terry|title=The International Rugby Championship 1883–1893|publisher=Willow Books|year=1984|isbn=0-00-218060-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest mentions of the term within rugby union.

=== Australian and New Zealand sports ===

The term is commonly used in Australian and [[New Zealand]] sporting competitions, most notably in the major Australian rules, soccer, rugby league and rugby union leagues (such as the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], the [[A-League]], [[National Rugby League|NRL]], [[Super Rugby]] and [[ITM Cup]]) and refers to the club positioned last on the league table at the end of the season.

The [[Sydney Thunder]] won the wooden spoon in the first three [[Big Bash League]] seasons between the [[2011–12 Big Bash League season|2011–12]] and [[2013–14 Big Bash League season|2013–14 seasons]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/jacques-kallis-targeted-to-help-sydney-thunder-rumble-in-the-big-bash-league-20140401-zqpdx.html Jacques Kallis targeted to help Sydney Thunder rumble in the Big Bash League], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 1 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2012/content/story/629327.html Big Bash League 2012–13: From blunder to Thunder], ''ESPN Cricinfo'', 11 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; before [[Brisbane Heat]] became the first team other than the Thunder to finish last in the eight-team competition, in [[2014–15 Big Bash League season|2014–15]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/andrew-flintoff-declares-brisbane-heats-underperforming-players-to-blame-for-wooden-spoon-campaign/story-fnii0bxd-1227192459453|title=Andrew Flintoff declares Brisbane Heat's underperforming players to blame for wooden spoon campaign|publisher=The Courier Mail|first=Ben|last=Dorries|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tennis===
A wooden spoon, also known as the "anti-slam", is sometimes spoken about in tennis. It is described as the worst possible outcome in a tournament, applying to the player for whom the following scenario becomes true:

*in the first round, such player is defeated by a player 2 who is arguably not very good in that player 2 does not progress further i.e.:
*in the second round, such player 2 is defeated by a player 3 who is arguably not very good in that player 3 does not progress further i.e.:
*in the third round, such player 3 is defeated by a player 4 who is arguably not very good...
*...and so forth, until the final of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikero.com/misc/anti-slam/|title=mikero.com - The tennis anti-grand slam|website=www.mikero.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.ws/andrewbroad/tennis/wooden_spoon/theory.html|title=Wooden-Spoon Theory|website=www.geocities.ws|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable Grand Slam "wooden spooners" include, among others, [[Goran Ivanišević]] ([[1995 Australian Open]]), [[Mary Pierce]] ([[2002 Australian Open]]), [[Marat Safin]] ([[2004 US Open (tennis)|2004 US Open]]), [[Caroline Wozniacki]] ([[2007 French Open]]), [[Ana Ivanovic]] ([[2010 Wimbledon Championships]]), [[Rafael Nadal]] ([[2016 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2016 Australian Open]]), [[Jelena Janković]] ([[2016 French Open – Women's Singles|2016 French Open]]) and [[Jeļena Ostapenko|Jelena Ostapenko]] ([[2018 French Open – Women's Singles|2018 French Open]] - Jelena Ostapenko was the defending champion, being crowned in 2017).

[[Greg Rusedski]] ([[1994 US Open (tennis)|1994]] and [[1995 US Open (tennis)|1995]] US Open, [[2006 Wimbledon Championships]]), [[Nicolás Lapentti]] ([[1996 French Open]], [[1997 Wimbledon Championships|1997]] and [[2009 Wimbledon Championships|2009]] Wimbledon Championships) and [[Julien Benneteau]] ([[2014 US Open (tennis)|2014]] and [[2016 US Open (tennis)|2016]] US Open, [[2016 French Open]]) can claim three wooden spoons throughout their career.

'''Major League Soccer'''

In [[Major League Soccer]], the last place team in the overall standings is generally considered as the "wooden spoon champion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/10/01/jobs-playoffs-wooden-spoons-and-shield-whats-stake-mls-week-30|title=Jobs, playoffs, wooden spoons and a Shield: What's at stake in MLS Week 30|date=1 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, unlike other Wooden Spoon awards, there is an actual "trophy" for the award. Before the start of the 2016 MLS season, the Independent Supporter's Council decided to create an official "trophy" for the lowest place team in the league, as a complement to the [[Supporters Shield]] which the ISC also manages.&lt;ref name="independentsupporterscouncil.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://independentsupporterscouncil.com/isc-creates-wooden-spoon-award/|title=ISC Creates Wooden Spoon Award - Independent Supporters Council|website=independentsupporterscouncil.com|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy is passed to the “winning” team at the annual ISC Conference, and the holders of the Spoon must possess the spoon for the entire following season. At the end of the year every group awarded the Wooden Spoon are allowed to do what they will with the trophy.&lt;ref name="independentsupporterscouncil.com"/&gt; The [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club]] were the “winner” of the inaugural 2015 wooden spoon and their supporters had the responsibility of creating the first spoon.

=== Oxford and Cambridge Rowing ===
In the Cambridge and Oxford [[Bumps race|Bumps races]], a crew who get bumped each day (thus moving down four places) are awarded spoons. This is probably related to the use of wooden spoons as a booby prize in the University of Cambridge [[Mathematical Tripos]].

== Early life ==
Zewde's father was ''Dejazmatch'' Gebre Selassie Baria Gabr (governor of [[Adwa]]) and his mother was ''Leult'' Wolete Israel Seyoum. His sister was ''Leult'' Ijigayehou Asfa Wossen, his grandfather was ''Ras'' [[Seyoum Mengesha|Seyum Mengesha]], and his wife was ''Woizero'' Alem Tsehai Araya. He received his rudimentary education in Addis Ababa under a tutor and went to school in Jerusalem and Cairo respectively where his mother, stayed during the [[Italian East Africa|Fascist occupation]] of Ethiopia. After the liberation, he enrolled at the Haile Selassie I secondary school in Addis Ababa and subsequently joined the [[University of Exeter]], England, where he studied English literature. This was followed by legal training at [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St. Anthony's College, Oxford]] where he became a senior member of the college from 1963 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|last=Gabre-Sellassie|first=Zewde|publisher=Red Sea Press|year=2014|isbn=1-56902-042-6|location=|pages=xiii-xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of which he was called to the Bar, Lincoln's Inn, London. After a long interval, during which he held various public offices in Ethiopia, he returned to Oxford and earned his PhD in the composite field of history, politics and economics.

== Career ==
Since his return home in the early 1950s, he held various offices, including that of deputy prime minister.

Under the imperial government he held the following positions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Who's Who in Africa|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1975|isbn=|location=London|pages=1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economic attache, later Head of Press, Information and Administration Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1951–53
* Director-General of Maritime Affairs, 1953–55
* Deputy Minister, Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Civil Aviation, 1955–57
* Mayor and Governor of Addis Ababa, 1957–59
* Ambassador to Somalia, 1959–60
* Minister of Justice, 1961–63
* Permanent Representative to the United Nations, 1972–74
* Minister of the Interior, March–May 1974
* Minister of Foreign Affairs, May–November 1974
In November 1974, the Provisional Military Administrative Council's ([[Derg]]) summary execution of high government officials of the previous regime force Zewde to go into exile. He eventually became vice-president of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and subsequently worked for several years as advisor to the secretariat of the United Nations. Throughout his service, he received national honors from at least seven sovereign states, including the Federal Republic of Germany. Together with some prominent Ethiopians, he tried to mediate between Ethiopia and Eritrea 1998.

== Legacy ==
Scholars of African history often compare the passing away of a knowledgeable person to a library consumed by conflagration. That is precisely what happened when the Ethiopian luminary, Dr. ''Dejazmatch'' Zewde Gebre-Sellassie, died of illness in Addis Ababa 15 December 2008. He harmoniously combined oral tradition with profound western education; and, he readily availed of them to any academic who sought his assistance. His popularity among all walks of life was immense. His funeral, which took place at the patriotic cemetery of the Trinity Cathedral, was attended by a huge crowd of mourners. The lawyer, ''Ato'' Tasoma Gebre Mariam who read out the eulogy, praised him for his contribution in making of the various Ethiopian codes of law. A week-long exhibition of his works and photos, accompanied by speeches of scholars and family members, was also held in his memory at the main campus of [[Addis Ababa University]].

'''Örjan Wikander''' (born 6 July 1943) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[classical archaeologist]] and [[ancient historian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.lu.se/en/person/OrjanWikander Personal website] at Department of Archaeology and Ancient History, Lund University&lt;/ref&gt; His main interests are ancient water technology, ancient [[Roof tile|roof terracottas]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[social history]], [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] archaeology and [[epigraphy]].

== Life ==
From 1963, Wikander studied [[Classical Archaeology]] and [[Classical antiquity|Ancient History]], History, [[History of Art]], and [[Classics|Classical Languages]] at [[Lund University]]. He received his  [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1967 and [[PhD]] in 1980, both at Lund.

From 1979 to 1981, Wikander worked as a [[curator]] at the Greek and Roman department of the [[Medelhavsmuseet]] (''Mediterranean Museum'') in Stockholm. From 1981, he has been on the staff of the Department of Classics and the Department of Archaeology at the University of Lund. From 1985 to 1991, he held the position as researcher in ancient technology at the [[Swedish Research Council|Swedish Research Council of Humanities]]. He was appointed professor at Lund University in 2001 and retired in 2008.

Wikander took part in the Swedish excavations at [[Acquarossa, Italy|Acquarossa]], [[Etruria]] in 1968–1975, 1978 and 1991. For shorter periods, he excavated at [[Uppåkra]], Sweden (1968), [[Vetulonia|Val Beretta]], Etruria (1972, 1974), and in the [[Baths of Caracalla]], Rome (1980).

As of 2011, Wikander has published five books and more than 120 scholarly and popular articles and reviews. He has been the editor or co-editor of four conference acta and handbooks.

== Work ==
[[File:Roda de Vitruvi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Roman watermill (modern model)]]

Wikander, basing his argument on the constantly increasing archaeological evidence for [[List of ancient watermills|ancient watermills]], makes a case for the breakthrough of [[watermill]]ing occurring much earlier than previously thought, possibly already in the first century A.D. The wide distribution of watermill sites indicates that this labour-saving technology was adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire|empire]] and must have had a significant impact on the late [[Roman economy]]. The relative lack of ancient written evidence compared to the [[medieval]] period is rather due to the general urban focus of ancient authors, while the watermill was primarily a rural phenomenon. 

Wikander's studies of ancient architectural [[terracotta]]s are focused around the development of tiled roofs in [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] [[Etruria]]. By detailed publications of the entire tile material from some of the most important sites (Acquarossa, [[San Giovenale]], [[Poggio Civitate]]), he has been able to present a general systematization of the early typological development in the area, together with a description of its basic technological prerequisites. He is also working on the publication of parts of the monumental zone at Acquarossa.

Wikander's [[prosopographical]] studies of [[Roman Senate|senator]]s and [[equites]] aim at a better understanding of the connections – economic and other – between the two leading classes of the [[Roman Republic]]. His basic hypothesis is that these contacts, often confirmed by marriage alliances, were far closer than generally acknowledged. 

Together with his late wife Charlotte, Wikander has put in order the notes and documents concerning [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] inscriptions assembled by Olof August Danielsson during his preparations for the [[Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum]] (CIE) between 1886 and 1933. One substantial result of this work has been the publication of [[addenda]] and [[corrigenda]] to CIE II,1,4.
