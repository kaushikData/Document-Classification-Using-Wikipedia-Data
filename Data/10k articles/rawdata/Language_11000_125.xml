'''Chapter 17''' of the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji]] is named "Schedule Oaths and Affirmations."  It is the last chapter of the Constitution.  It sets out [[oath]]s and [[oath of office|oaths of offices]] to be taken by [[Politics of Fiji|politicians of Fiji]].

==Oath or Affirmation of Allegiance==
Part 1 of Chapter 17 sets out the [[oath of allegiance]].  It has a person state that he or she is "[[faith]]ful" to the republic, and faithful "according to law."  The oath ends with the statement "So help me [[God]]!"

In 2006, Fiji experienced a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|coup]].  The [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] [[Helen Clark]] argued that the coup should be resisted by citizens, pointing to the oath of allegiance: "You owe it to your oath of allegiance to the Fiji constitution to act to stop this act of mutiny," she said.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]], "[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/06122006/325/fiji-begins-round-coup-opponents.html Fiji begins round-up of coup opponents]," ''[[Yahoo!]] News UK &amp; Ireland'', December 6, 2006, URL accessed 2 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part 2==
Part 2 gives the oath and affirmation for the [[President of Fiji]] and the [[Vice-President of Fiji]].  The oath and affirmation refer to service to the republic from the President's office or Vice-President's office.  This oath also ends with "So help me God!"

==Part 3==
An oath for a [[cabinet minister]] in the [[Cabinet of Fiji]] is given in Part 3.  This oath would be taken by the [[Prime Minister of Fiji]], the [[Attorney-General Minister of Fiji]], or an Assistant Minister.  It refers to using the "best... judgment" and advising the President when mandated to do so.  This advice, according to the oath, must not be revealed.

==Part 4==
The last Part of Chapter 17 contains oaths for those holding office in the [[judiciary of Fiji]].  This oath also refers to service to the republic, and to upholding the Constitution.

'''Agvald Gjelsvik''' (14 August 1907 &amp;ndash; 14 April 1976) was a Norwegian educator and politician for the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]].

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Tvedestrand]] as a son of teacher Andreas Gjelsvik (1863–1938) and Brita Bolstad (1872–1953). He was a nephew of [[Nikolaus Gjelsvik]]. In 1934 he married teacher Aase Hermansen.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Agvald Gjelsvik|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Arnfinn |last=Engen|authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo |url=http://nbl.snl.no/Agvald_Gjelsvik|language=Norwegian|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in [[Arendal]] in 1926, and graduated from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] with the [[cand.real.]] degree in 1933—specializing in astronomy. In the same year he was hired as a teacher at [[Orkdal District Gymnasium]]. When [[Vinstra District Gymnasium]] was established in 1946, Gjelsvik became its first principal. From 1969 to his retirement in 1975 he was the principal of [[Stabekk Upper Secondary School]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In 1958 he was named as a member of the national Council of Teaching, which among others was responsible for final examinations in the upper secondary school. He was promoted to chairman in 1962, and when the council was superseded by the Council of Gymnasiums in 1965, Gjelsvik continued as chairman until 1969. From 1963 to 1967 he led the Gjelsvik Committee that shaped the "reform gymnasium" in Norway, removing the former rigid division into science or philological courses. Gjelsvik also chaired the State Textbook Council from 1970, where he had become a member in 1962. He wrote textbooks himself in projective drawing (1946), [[mathematical geography]] (1954) and astronomy (1963), and translated other textbooks into [[Nynorsk]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Gjelsvik served in [[Nord-Fron]] [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] from 1956 to 1960 and Oppland county school board from 1960 to 1964. In 1968 he was named as deputy chairman of the [[Broadcasting Council (Norway)|Broadcasting Council]]. He was a board member of [[Norsk Lektorlag]] from 1945 to 1950. He died in October 1976 in [[Bærum]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

'''Asset protection''' (sometimes also referred to as ''debtor-creditor law'') is a set of legal techniques and a body of statutory and [[common law]] dealing with protecting [[asset]]s of individuals and business entities from civil money judgments. The goal of asset protection planning is to insulate assets from claims of creditors without [[perjury]] or [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Controversial Truth About Asset Protection Planning | author= Bill Williams | publisher = Asset Protection Planners| date = | url = https://www.assetprotectionplanners.com/articles/the-controversial-truth-about-asset-protection-planning/ | accessdate = October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asset protection consists of methods available to protect assets from [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]] arising elsewhere. It should not be confused with ''limiting liability'', which concerns the ability to stop or constrain liability to the asset or activity from which it arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Real Estate Investor's Guide to Corporations, LLCs &amp; Asset Protection Entities |last= [[Richard T. Williamson]]|first=  |year=2008 |publisher= Kaplan Publishing|location= |isbn=978-1-4277-9702-5 |page= 43|url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assets that are shielded from creditors by law are few (common examples include some home equity, certain retirement plans and interests in LLCs and limited partnerships [and even these are not always unreachable]). Assets that are almost always unreachable are those to which one does not hold legal title. In many cases it is possible to vest legal title to personal assets in a trust, an agent or a nominee, while retaining all the control of the assets. The goal of asset protection is similar to [[bankruptcy]], and the two practice areas go hand-in-hand. When a debtor has none to few assets, the bankruptcy route is preferable. When the debtor has significant assets, asset protection may be the solution.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The four threshold factors that are either expressly or implicitly analyzed in each asset protection case are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Jacob|title=A Lawyer's Guide to Asset Protection Planning in California|date=2017|publisher=Aliant Law|isbn=9780983978060|page=8|edition=Second|url=https://www.aliantlaw.com|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The identity of the person engaging in asset protection planning

:- If the debtor is an individual, does he or she have a spouse, and is the spouse also liable? If the spouse is not liable, is it possible to enter into a transmutation agreement? Are the spouses engaged in activities that are equally likely to result in lawsuits or is one spouse more likely to be sued than the other?
:- If the debtor is an entity, did an individual guarantee the entity's debt? How likely is it that the creditor will be able to pierce the corporate veil or otherwise get the assets of the individual owners? Is there a statute that renders the individual personally liable for the obligations of the entity?

* The nature of the claim

:- Are there specific claims or the asset protection is taken as a result of a desire to insulate from lawsuits?
:- If the claim has been reduced to a judgement, what assets does the judgement encumber?
:- Is the claim [[Bankruptcy discharge|dischargeable]]?
:- What is the statute of limitations for bringing the claim?

* The identity of the creditor

:- How aggressive is the creditor?
:- Is the creditor a government agency? Taxing authority? Some government agencies possess powers of seizure that other government agencies do not.

* The nature of the assets

:- To what extent are the assets exempt from the claims of the creditors? For example, the degree of protection offered by the [[homestead exemption]], the exemption of the assets in a qualified plan, i.e. assets in a plan under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) etc.

Whilst the aforementioned use of Trusts will be of benefit in a number of cases the question of ownership can still arise, as although legal ownership may have been transferred to the trustees, beneficial ownership may still in many cases lie with the settler of the Trust. A Private Placement Life Insurance contract (PPLI), can provide a greater degree of protection and privacy than most Trusts, and can also be integrated with an existing trust if necessary. Whilst Trusts may not be recognised in many Jurisdictions, Life insurance also has the advantage of being Multi jurisdictional.

==United States legislation==
United States federal bankruptcy laws and ERISA laws exempt certain assets from creditors, including certain retirement plans.  All fifty states also have laws that exempt certain assets from creditors.  These vary from state to state, but they often include exemptions for a certain amount of [[Home equity|equity]] in a personal residence, individual [[pension|retirement accounts]], clothing, or other personal property.

All fifty U.S. states also have laws that protect the owners of a [[corporation]], [[limited partnership]], or [[limited liability company]] from the liabilities of the entity.  Many states limit the remedies of a creditor of a limited partner or a member in an LLC, thereby providing some protection for the assets of the entity from the creditors of a member.

All fifty U.S. states provide some protection for the assets of a [[trust (law)|trust]] against the creditors of the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiaries]].  Some states allow asset protection for a self-settled trust (a trust in which the settlor or creator of the trust is included as a potential discretionary beneficiary) and some states do not.

Creditors have several tools to overcome the laws that provide asset protection.  First, there are federal and state [[fraudulent conveyance|fraudulent transfer]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;11 USC § 548&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are two bodies of fraudulent transfer law: the [[Title 11 of the United States Code|Bankruptcy Code]] and state fraudulent transfer statutes. Most states have adopted [[List of Uniform Acts (United States)|Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act]] which defines what constitutes a fraudulent transfer. The UFTA and the Bankruptcy Code both provide that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer with the "actual intention to hinder, delay or defraud" any creditor of the debtor.   While UFTA applies clearly to present creditors, the distinction between a future creditor and a future potential creditor is not as clear. The UFTA is commonly held to apply only to future creditors and not to future potential creditors (those whose claim arises after the transfer, but there was no foreseeable connection between the creditor and the debtor at the time of the transfer).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

There are also laws which allow a creditor to [[piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]] of an entity and go after the owners for the debts of the entity.  It may also be possible for a creditor of a member to reach the assets of an entity through a constructive trust claim, or a claim for a reverse piercing of a corporate veil.

The anti-alienation provision of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA) exempts from claims of creditors the assets of pension, profit-sharing, or [[401(k)]] plans. Two exceptions are carved out for [[qualified domestic relations order]]s and claims under the [[Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990]]. Because the protection is set forth in a federal statute, it will trump any state fraudulent transfer law. Protection of ERISA is afforded to employees only and does not cover employers. The owner of a business is treated as an employer, even though he may also be the employee of the same business, as in a [[closely held corporation]]. Accordingly, ERISA protection does not apply to sole proprietors, to one owner business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, and to partnerships, unless the plan covers employees other than the owners, partners and their spouses.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Asset protection planning requires a working knowledge of federal and state exemption laws, federal and state bankruptcy laws, federal and state tax laws, the comparative laws of many jurisdictions (onshore and offshore), choice of law principles, in addition to the laws of trusts, estates, corporations and business entities.  The process of asset protection planning involves assessing the facts, circumstances, and objectives of an individual, evaluating the pros and cons of the various options, designing a structure that is most likely to accomplish all the objectives of the individual (including asset protection objectives), preparing legal documents to carry out the plan, and ensuring that the various legal entities are operated properly in accordance with the laws and the objectives of the individual.  This process involves providing legal advice and legal work and most states prohibit the practice of law without a license.

==History==

Asset protection planning began to develop as a stand-alone area of the law in the late 1970s. It began coming into prominence in the late 1980s, with the advent and the marketing of offshore asset protection trusts. Colorado attorney [[Barry Engel]] is credited with the introduction of that concept and the development of asset protection trust law statutes in the Cook Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Low-Tax.net Cook Islands Table of Statutes, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The most distinctive feature of the [[offshore trust]] is the fact that the settlor or creator of the trust may be included among the potential beneficiaries of the trust without causing the assets of the trust to be subject to the creditors of the settlor.  This is often referred to as a "self-settled trust."

Over the years, this new field of law enjoyed a marginal reputation, but started going mainstream in the mid-1990s. A 2003 article in the [[Wall Street Journal]] claimed that 60% of America's millionaires have considered engaging in asset protection planning.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, Oct. 14, 2003, Rachel Emma Silverman, "Litigation Boom Spurs Efforts to Shield Assets"&lt;/ref&gt;

Choice of law rules in the United States make it possible for a person from any state to create a trust, corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company that is governed by the laws of any other state or jurisdiction.  Because of this ability to "forum shop," various states and other jurisdictions have modified their laws to allow greater asset protection in order to make them competitive with other jurisdictions.

In most states, the assets of a self-settled trust are not protected from the creditors of the settlor.  In 1997, the [[State of Alaska]] passed a statute which provided that the assets of an Alaska self-settled trust are not subject to the creditors of the settlor.&lt;ref&gt;Alaska Statutes Section 34.40.110&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the following states have adopted legislation allowing for a self-settled asset protection trust: [[Nevada]], [[Delaware]], [[South Dakota]], [[Wyoming]], [[Tennessee]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Colorado]], [[Missouri]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[New Hampshire]]. This legislation created a favorable offshore asset protection trust jurisdiction also for non-US settlors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States As An Offshore Asset Protection Trust Jurisdiction – The World’s Best Kept Secret |author=Alexander A. Bove, Jr. |publisher=Trusts &amp; Trustees, Vol. 14 Issue 1 (Oxford Journals, 2008) |date= |url=http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708085701/http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable debate about the comparative effectiveness of the asset protection provided by the laws of each jurisdiction, onshore and offshore. Similarly, the asset protection features provided by corporations, limited partnerships and limited liability companies vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Once again, Alaska's limited liability company statute provides innovative advantages over other states.  Case law from [[North Carolina]] demonstrates the asset protection advantages of a transfer to a limited liability company (see Herring v. Keasler, 150 NC App 598 (01-1000) 06/04/2002).

Just as the [[Cook Islands]] have developed a reputation for the best offshore jurisdiction for an asset protection trust, [[Nevis]] stands out in the competition for the best jurisdiction to file a limited liability company. The Nevis limited liability company statute is based on the Delaware limited liability statute, but they have a few added advantages. One advantage of a Nevis LLC is that the members and managers are not disclosed to the public.

There is some debate over the ethics of asset protection planning. On one hand, every attorney that creates a trust, corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company is engaging in some form of asset protection planning. On the other hand, most would agree that it is ethically inappropriate to assist a person to commit fraud or evade income taxes. The timing and the purposes of the plan seem to be the determinative factors as to whether a plan will be considered ethically and legally appropriate.  In some cases, individuals have gone to jail for contempt of court for failing to unwind a plan that a judge felt was repugnant to the principles of law and justice, however in those cases the individuals incarcerated retained some control over their plan immediately prior to, or during, litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Importance of Property APT Design &amp; Counsel | author= Howard Rosen &amp; Patricia Donlevy-Rosen| publisher = The Asset Protection News| date = | url = http://protectyou.com/1998/10/the-importance-of-a-property-asset-protection-design/ | accessdate = February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bass-baritone''' is a high-lying [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] or low-lying "classical" [[baritone]] [[voice type]] which shares certain qualities with the true baritone voice. The term arose in the late 19th century to describe the particular type of voice required to sing three [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] roles: the Dutchman in ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der fliegende Holländer]]'', Wotan/Der Wanderer in the ''[[Ring Cycle]]'' and Hans Sachs in ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''. Wagner labelled these roles as ''Hoher Bass'' ("high bass")&amp;mdash;see [[fach]] for more details.&lt;ref name=Stark&gt;{{cite book

The bass-baritone voice is distinguished by two attributes. First, it must be capable of singing comfortably in a baritonal [[tessitura]]. Secondly, however, it needs to have the ripely resonant lower range typically associated with the bass voice. For example, the role of Wotan in ''[[Die Walküre]]'' covers the range from F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the F at the bottom of the bass clef) to F{{music|#}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (the F{{music|#}} above middle C), but only infrequently descends beyond C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (the C below middle C). Bass-baritones are typically divided into two separate categories: '''lyric bass-baritone''' and '''dramatic bass-baritone'''.&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book

Bass-baritones should not be confused with their vocal cousin—the so-called '''Verdi baritone'''. This type of Italianate baritone voice has a brighter tone colour and sings at a slightly higher tessitura than that possessed by the bass-baritone. In addition to the operas of [[Giuseppe Verdi]], its natural home is to be found in operatic music composed after about 1830 by the likes of [[Donizetti]], [[Ponchielli]], [[Massenet]], [[Puccini]] and the [[verismo]] composers.

The term bass-baritone is roughly synonymous with the Italian vocal classification '''basso cantante'''; for example, in the Verdian repertoire, Philip II in ''[[Don Carlos]]'' is often taken by a bass-baritone, while Ferrando in ''[[Il trovatore]]'' is sung by a true bass—though the two roles' ranges are very similar. In Debussy's ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' the lower baritone role of Golaud is a bass-baritone, sitting between Pelleas (high baritone) and Arkel (bass).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} (See under [[fach]] for more information.) Much of the oratorio repertoire, from [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' to [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'', is best suited to a bass-baritone with the ability to combine a rich, dark tone with a smooth, high-lying cantabile line.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Some of the classical [[Mozart]] baritone roles such as Don Giovanni, Figaro and Gugliemo&amp;mdash;composed before the term "baritone" gained currency&amp;mdash;are occasionally played by a bass-baritone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy opera]]s usually featured a comic bass-baritone character, created to make use of [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]] company member [[Richard Temple (bass-baritone)|Richard Temple]].

In short: the ''bass-baritone'' is a voice that has the resonant low notes of the typical bass allied with the ability to sing in a baritonal tessitura. Colloquially, it refers to a voice with a [[Vocal range|range]] and tone somewhere between a [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] and a [[baritone]].

The bass-baritone's required range can vary tremendously based on the role, with some less demanding than others. Many bass-baritones have ventured into the baritone repertoire, including (among others) Leopold Demuth, George Baklanov, [[Rudolf Bockelmann]], [[George London (bass-baritone)|George London]], [[James Morris (bass-baritone)|James Morris]] and [[Bryn Terfel]].

'''Craxism''' ({{lang-it|Craxismo}}) was and is according to some extant, an Italian political ideology based on the thought of [[socialist]] leader [[Bettino Craxi]], who was also [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] in the 1980s. It was informal ideology of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] from 1976 to 1994, the year of the end of the "[[Tangentopoli|First Republic]]" and of PSI, because of strong corruption scandals. 

==Origins and features==
The Craxism, although the term derogatory today was based on a synthesis of social democracy, socialism and liberal conservatism. In fact, if on one side the PSI under Craxi is required with a strong [[third-worldism]], Pro-[[Arabian]]ism, [[environmentalism]] and a modern [[welfare state]] system (typical of the [[centre-left|modern left]]), on the other hand was strongly pro-[[atlanticism|Atlanticist]] and pro-[[europeanism|europeanist]] and supported [[privatisation]]s, [[liberalisation]]s and placed on a strong defense of territorial sovereignty (e.g. "Sigonella crisis" American armed forces) and on [[conservative]] policies on issues such as [[abortion]] and [[war on drugs]].

Under Craxi, PSI moved from [[left-wing]] (close to [[Italian Communist Party|PCI]]) to centre-left, almost centrist, much to ally with the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] and other moderate parties that formed a coalition called ''[[Pentapartito]]'', which ensured a stable majority to govern.

==Critics==
Today, the Craxism is often used in derogatory form to define a corrupt politician, although some welcome him in a favourable manner: this is the case of those who, following the dissolution of the PSI, joined the newly formed [[Forza Italia]] of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] ([[centre-right]]), but also a part of those who formed the [[Italian Socialists]], small party adhering to the [[Alliance of progressives]] of [[Achille Occhetto]] (centre-left).

Finally, the Craxism has led to the change of the entire [[Party of European Socialists|European socialism]], together with [[Felipe González]] ([[Spanish Socialist Worker's Party|PSOE]]), [[François Mitterrand]] ([[Socialist Party (France)|PS]]) and [[Helmut Schmidt]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]), during all the years 80; In addition, along with these other figures, inspired the overhaul and the policies of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|José Zapatero]]'s PSOE and the [[Andreas Papandreou]]'s [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]].

In Italy, the main critics of the Craxism (as well as the figure of Craxi), are the former [[Communist]]s (including most members of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]) and some media left-wing press ([[Il Fatto Quotidiano]], [[il manifesto]], [[L'Espresso]], [[La Repubblica]], etc.), while the biggest supporters are the [[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|PSI]] of [[Riccardo Nencini]] and various politicians of [[The People of Freedom]] and the centre-right, as Silvio Berlusconi (also ex-Socialist), [[Renato Brunetta]], [[Maurizio Sacconi]], Stefano Caldoro and [[Stefania Craxi]], Bettino's daughter.

Abroad, Bettino Craxi has received praise especially by [[Mário Soares]], [[Ricardo Lagos]], Felipe González, [[Lech Walesa]], [[Ronald Reagan]], Sergio Romano (Italian Ambassador in the USA), [[Renato Ruggiero]] (Socialist diplomat and former Director of the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]), Boris Biancheri.&lt;ref name="La mia vita"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fondazionecraxi.org/pdf/LaMiaVita_libretto.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021222248/http://www.fondazionecraxi.org/pdf/LaMiaVita_libretto.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10866">{{about|the rhetorical genre|the manner in which words are set to music|Text declamation}}
'''Declamation''' (from the Latin: '''''declamatio'''''  for "declaration") is an artistic form of public speaking. It is a dramatic oration designed to present through articulation, emphasis and gesture the full sense of the message being imparted.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}}

==History==
In Ancient Rome, declamation was a genre of ancient [[rhetoric]] and a mainstay of the [[Education in Ancient Rome|Roman higher education]] system. It was separated into two component subgenres, the ''[[controversia]]'', speeches of defense or prosecution in fictitious court cases, and the ''[[suasoria]]'', in which the speaker advised a historical or legendary figure as to a course of action. Roman declamations survive in four corpora: the compilations of [[Seneca the Elder]] and [[Calpurnius Flaccus]], as well as two sets of ''controversiae'', the ''Major Declamations'' and ''Minor Declamations'' spuriously attributed to [[Quintilian]].

Declamation had its origin in the form of preliminary exercises for Greek students of rhetoric: works from the Greek declamatory tradition survive in works such as the collections of [[Sopater]] and [[Choricius of Gaza]]. Of the remaining Roman declamations the vast majority are ''controversiae''; only one book of ''suasoriae'' survive, that being in Seneca the Elder's collection. The ''controversia'' as they currently exist normally consist of several elements: an imaginary law, a theme which introduced a tricky legal situation, and an argument which records a successful or model speech on the topic. It was normal for students to employ illustrative ''exempla'' from Roman history and legend (such as were collected in the work of [[Valerius Maximus]]) to support their case. Important points were often summed up via pithy epigrammatic statements (''sententiae''). Common themes include ties of fidelity between fathers and sons, heroes and tyrants in the archaic city, and conflicts between rich and poor men.

As a critical part of rhetorical education, declamation's influence was widespread in Roman elite culture. In addition to its didactic role, it is also attested as a performative genre: public declamations were visited by such figures as [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Asinius Pollio]], [[Maecenas]], and the emperor [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sussmann|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Ovid]] is recorded by Seneca the Elder as being a star declaimer, and the works of the satirists [[Martial]] and [[Juvenal]], as well as the historian [[Tacitus]], reveal a substantial declamatory influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sussmann|1994|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later examples of declamation can be seen in the work of the sixth century AD bishop and author [[Ennodius]].

==Classic revival==
In the eighteenth century, a classical revival of the art of public speaking, often referred to as [[elocution|The Elocution Movement]] occurred in Britain. While elocution focused on the voice—articulation, diction, and pronunciation—declamation focused on delivery. Rather than a narrow focus on [[rhetoric]], or persuasion, practitioners involved in the movement focused on improving speech and gesture{{sfn|Goring|2014}} to convey the full sentiment of the message.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}} Traditionally, practitioners of declamation served in the clergy, legislature or law, but by the nineteenth century, the practice had extended to theatrical and reformist venues.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}}{{sfn|Goring|2014}} Initially, the aim was to improve the standard of oral communication, as high rates of illiteracy made it imperative for churches, courts and parliaments, to rely on the spoken word.{{sfn|Goring|2014}} Through modification of inflection and phrasing, along with appropriate gestures, speakers were taught to convey the meaning and persuade the audience, rather than deliver monotonous litanies.{{sfn|Bell|1810|p=109}} 

By the mid-nineteenth century, reformers were using the "art of declamation" to publicly address vice and provide moral guidance. In the Americas, missionary-run schools focused on teaching former slaves the art of public speaking to enable them to elevate others of their race as teachers and ministers.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=7}} Using drama as a tool to teach, reformers hoped to standardize the spoken word, while creating a sense of national pride.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|Harrington|2010|p=68}} Studies and presentation of declamation flourished in Latin America and particularly in the African-American and Afro-Caribbean communities through the first third of the twentieth century. Practitioners attempted to interpret their orations to convey the emotions and feeling behind the writer's words to the audience, rather than simply recite them.{{sfn|Kuhnheim|2008|p=137}} In the twentieth century, among black practitioners, topical focus often was on the irony of their lives in a post-slavery world, recognizing that they had gained freedom but were not free to express themselves. Presentation involved utilization of African rhythms from dance and music,{{sfn|''ABC Color''|2006}} and local dialect, as a form of social protest.{{sfn|Kuhnheim|2008|p=141}}

{{English grammar}}
A '''determiner''', also called '''determinative''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|det}}'''), is a [[word]], [[phrase]], or [[affix]] that occurs together with a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]] and serves to express the [[reference]] of that noun or noun phrase in the context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Common kinds of determiners include definite and indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]]s (like the English ''the'' and ''a'' or ''an''), [[demonstrative]]s (''this'' and ''that''), [[possessive determiner]]s (''my'' and ''their''), [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] (''many'', ''few'' and ''several''),  [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, [[Distributive (linguistics)|distributive]] determiners (''each'', ''any''), and [[Interrogative word|interrogative]] determiners (''which'').

For examples of determiners and use, see the box on the use in English,  [[English determiners]]

==Description==
Most determiners have been traditionally classed along with either [[adjective]]s or [[pronoun]]s, and this still occurs in classical grammars: for example, demonstrative and possessive determiners are sometimes described as ''demonstrative adjectives'' and ''possessive adjectives'' or as ''(adjectival) demonstrative pronouns'' and ''(adjectival) possessive pronouns'' respectively.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} These classical interpretations of determiners map to some of the linguistic properties related to determiners in modern syntax theories, such as [[Demonstrative|deictic information]], [[definiteness]] and [[Genitive case|genitivity]]. However, modern theorists&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[OED]]'' (Second Edition), the word ''determiner'' was first used in its grammatical sense by [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[grammar]] prefer to distinguish determiners as a separate [[word class]] from adjectives, which are simple [[grammatical modifier|modifiers]] of nouns, expressing attributes of the thing referred to. This distinction applies particularly in languages like English that use definite and indefinite articles, frequently as a necessary component of noun phrases – the determiners may then be taken to be a class of words that includes the articles as well as other words that function in the place of articles. (The composition of this class may depend on the particular language's rules of [[syntax]]; for example, in English the [[possessive]]s ''my'', ''your'' etc. are used without articles and so can be regarded as determiners, whereas their [[Italian language|Italian]] equivalents ''{{wt|it|mio}}'' etc. are used together with articles and so may be better classed as adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Progovac|first1=Ljiljana|title=Determiner Phrase in a Language without Determiners|journal=Journal of Linguistics|date=Mar 1998|volume=34|issue=1|page=166|jstor=4176455}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Not all languages can be said to have a lexically distinct class of determiners.

In some languages, the role of certain determiners can be played by [[affix]]es (prefixes or suffixes) attached to a noun or by other types of [[inflection]]. For example, definite articles are represented by suffixes in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. (For example, in Swedish, ''{{wt|sv|bok}}'' ("book"), when definite, becomes ''{{wt|sv|boken}}'' ("the book"), while the Romanian ''{{wt|ro|caiet}}'' ("notebook") similarly becomes ''caietul'' ("the notebook").) Some languages, such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]], have [[possessive affix]]es, which play the role of possessive determiners like ''my'' and ''his''.
 
Some theoreticians unify determiners and [[pronoun]]s into a single class. For further information, see {{slink|Pronoun|Theoretical considerations}}.

[[Universal Grammar]] is the theory that all humans are born equipped with [[grammar]], and all languages share certain properties. There are arguments that determiners are not a part of Universal Grammar and are instead part of an emergent [[syntactic category]]. This has been shown through the studies of some languages' histories, including Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van de Velde |first=Freek |title=The emergence of the determiner in the Dutch NP |journal=Linguistics |date=March 2010 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=263–299 |doi=10.1515/ling.2010.009 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34467312.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contradict|about=the status of numerals as a determiner|date=May 2018}}
Determiners may be subcategorized as '''predeterminers''', '''central determiners''' and '''postdeterminers''', based on the order in which they can occur. For example, "all my seventeen very young children" uses one of each. "My all seventeen very young children" is ungrammatical because a central determiner cannot precede a predeterminer.

== Types of determiners ==
===Articles===
An [[Article (grammar)|article]] is a word that is used with a noun (as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. Some example of articles are ''a'', ''an'', ''the''.

===Demonstratives===
[[Demonstrative]]s are words, such as ''this'' and ''that'', used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others. They are usually [[Deixis|deictic]], which means their meaning changes with context.

===Possessive determiner===
[[Possessive determiner]]s modify a noun by attributing possession (or other sense of belonging) to someone or something, and usually reflect the noun's [[Genitive case|genitive]] [[Grammatical case|case]]. They are also known as possessive adjectives.

===Quantifiers===
[[Quantifier (linguistics)|Quantifier]]s indicate quantity. Some examples of quantifiers include: ''all'', ''some'', ''many'', ''few'', and ''no''. Quantifiers are also dependent of a [[noun]]. It is important to acknowledge that quantifiers only indicate a vague quantity of objects, not a specific number, such as ''twelve'', ''dozen'', ''first'', ''single'', or ''once'', which would be considered [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=P.H. |year=2014 |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of linguistics |edition=3rd |location=Oxford [u.a.] |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press |isbn=9780199675128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributive determiners===
Distributive determiners, also called distributive adjectives, consider members of a group separately, rather than collectively. Words such as ''each'', ''any'', ''either'', and ''neither'' are examples of distributive determiners. This type of determiner also depends on a noun. These determiners are not to be confused with [[distributive pronoun]]s, which can operate without a noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Jeffrey T. |last1=Runner |first2=Elsi |last2=Kaiser |title=Binding in Picture Noun Phrases: Implications for Binding Theory |book-title=Proceedings of the HPSG05 Conference |editor-first=Stefan |editor-last=Müller |location=Lisbon |publisher=CSLI Publications |date=2005 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2005/runner-kaiser.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.588.7351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Each went his own way. (''Each'' is used as a pronoun, without an accompanying noun.)
* Each man went his own way. (''Each'' is used as a determiner, accompanying the noun ''man''.)

===Interrogative determiners===
[[Interrogative word|Interrogatives]] are used to ask a question, such as ''which'', ''what'', and ''whose'' (personal possessive determiner). These determiners also depend on a noun.

== As a functional head==
{{Main|Determiner phrase}}
Some modern grammatical approaches regard determiners (rather than nouns) as the [[head (grammar)|head]] of their phrase and thus refer to such phrases as [[determiner phrase]]s rather than noun phrases. Under this assumption, every noun in a syntax tree is dominated by a determiner. There are many examples in [[natural language]] where nouns appear without a determiner, yet in determiner phrase grammars there must still be a determiner. To account for this, syntacticians consider the head of the determiner phrase to be an unpronounced [[Empty category#Null determiners|null determiner]]. These grammar theories are either based on [[X-bar theory]] or descend from it, which requires that every noun has a corresponding determiner (or [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]]). In the cases where a noun does not have an explicit determiner (as in ''physics uses mathematics''), X-bar theory hypothesizes the presence of a [[Zero (linguistics)|zero article]], or zero determiner, an X-bar specific form of the null determiner. Noun phrases that contain only a noun and do not have a determiner present are known as bare noun phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nemoto |first=Naoko |title=On Mass Denotations of Bare Nouns in Japanese and Korean |journal=Linguistics |date=2005 |page=383 |url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/Ling480.08/NemotoMassJapaneseKorean.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more detail on theoretical approaches to the status of determiners, see {{slink|Noun phrase|Noun phrases with and without determiners}}.

Under the Universal Grammar theory, most facets of language are inherent, and only idiosyncrasies of languages are learned. Notice that determiners and subsequently their phrases would have to inherently be part of Universal Grammar in order for Determiner Phrase theory and Universal Grammar theory to coexist.

Some theoreticians unify determiners and [[pronoun]]s into a single class. See [[Pronoun#Theoretical considerations|Pronoun: Theoretical considerations]]. This is consistent with the determiner phrase viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the head of the phrase.

'''Downstep''' is a phenomenon in [[tone languages]] in which if two syllables have the same [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] (for example, both with a high tone or both with a low tone), the second syllable is lower in pitch than the first.

Two main kinds of downstep can be distinguished. The first, more usually called '''automatic downstep''', '''[[downdrift]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Yip (2002), p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''catathesis''',&lt;ref&gt;Beckman &amp; Pierrehumbert (1986), p.272.&lt;/ref&gt; occurs when high and low tones come in the sequence H L (L) H; the second high tone tends to be lower than the first because of the intervening low toned syllable. That phenomenon is common in African languages, such as [[Chewa language|Chichewa]]. &lt;ref&gt;Myers (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that the same phenomenon causes English sentences, such as ''I &lt;u&gt;rea&lt;/u&gt;lly be&lt;u&gt;lieve&lt;/u&gt; Ebe&lt;u&gt;ne&lt;/u&gt;zer was a &lt;u&gt;dea&lt;/u&gt;ler in mag&lt;u&gt;ne&lt;/u&gt;sium'' or ''I bought &lt;u&gt;blue&lt;/u&gt;berries, &lt;u&gt;bay&lt;/u&gt;berries, &lt;u&gt;rasp&lt;/u&gt;berries, &lt;u&gt;mul&lt;/u&gt;berries, and &lt;u&gt;bram&lt;/u&gt;bleberries'' (if the sentences are pronounced with a falling intonation), to fall gradually in pitch, with each accented syllable (here underlined) slightly lower than the last.&lt;ref&gt;Pierrehumbert (1980), pp.139ff, 329ff; Beckman &amp; Pierrehumbert (1986), p.273.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downstep proper''', or '''non-automatic downstep'''&lt;ref&gt;Connell (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;, is another phenomenon found especially in West African languages such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]]. If two high tones are in succeeding syllables (thus in the sequence H H), the second is lower than the first.&lt;ref&gt;Welmers (1974), pp.82ff&lt;/ref&gt; In such languages, when two high tones come one after the other, they are at the same height or, if there is a downstep, the second one is lower. The second high tone is also lower than the preceding one if there is an intervening low tone in the sequence H L H as described above. The high tones in a simple sentence tend to descend from the beginning to the end of the sentence in a series of steps, a phenomenon that Is known as [[tone terracing]].

The symbol for the second kind of downstep in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is a superscript down arrow, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ꜜ}}}}. It is common to see instead a superscript exclamation mark {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ꜝ}}}} because of typographic constraints. 

It has been shown that in most, if not all, cases of downstep proper, the lowering of the second high tone is from an intervening low-toned syllable that has dropped out. What was H L H has become H H.&lt;ref&gt;Welmers (1974), p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; The missing low-toned syllable creates what is known as a '[[Floating tone|floating tone]]'. An example occurs in [[Bambara language|Bambara]], a language spoken in [[Mali]]. Its [[definite article]] is a floating low tone. With a noun in isolation, it docks to the preceding vowel and turns a high tone into a falling tone:
{|
|{{IPA|/bá/}}||''river''
|-
||{{IPA|/bâ/}}||''the river''
|}
However, when it occurs between two high tones, it downsteps the following tone:
{|
|{{IPA|/bá tɛ́/}}||''it's not a river''
|-
||{{IPA|/bá ꜜ tɛ́/}}||''it's not the river''
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1907">'''Eochaid ua Flannacáin''' (935&amp;ndash;1004) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[cleric]] and [[poet]].

==Life==

Eochaid was the author of more than twenty surviving quasi-historical, genealogical and topographical poems, many of which were incorporated into [[Lebor Gabala Erenn]]. He was a member of Clann Sinaich, an eccleiastical family of [[Armagh]]. At the time of his death he was superior ([[abbot]] or [[prior]]) of [[Clonfeacle]] and Lios Aoigheadh (unidentified). One of his sons, and several of his descendants, were abbots of Armagh.

==Obit==

The [[Annals of Ulster]] contain Eochaid's [[obituary|obit]] ''sub anno'' 1004, stating:

''"Eochaid ua Flannacáin, superior of Les Oeiged and of Cluain Fiachna, a master of poetry and historical lore, died in the 69th year of his age."''

==Commemorative verse==

The obit was accompanied by a [[stanza]] commemorating him:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
The full form of beautiful Eochaid
An ascending poetic psalm of happy aspect
eochaiss that he does not approach from behind(?)
A key to the lock of Ireland's ignorance.
‘Eochaid of the undying knowledge’
Has long been an incontrovertible name for him;
For reproach in the matter of learning or wisdom
He has no cause to answer.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Background==

Born to a ''bhatkar'', or landowning family, Epitácio Pais was a primary school teacher by profession. He attended ''liceu'', or high school, in Portuguese before undergoing his teacher training. He contributed short stories in Portuguese to newspapers such as ''Diário de Goa'' and ''[[O Heraldo]]'' from the 1950s to the 1980s. He also participated in the Portuguese-language programme ''Renascença'', which ran on [[All-India Radio]] until the 1980s. For José Pereira, Pais was "one of Goa’s prominent writers of fiction in Portuguese".&lt;ref&gt;José Pereira Goa Today September 2000, accessed http://www.goa-world.com/goa/goatoday/sep2000/letters.htm, 3rd Aug 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For Manuel de Seabra and [[Vimala Devi]], Pais was a writer who felt the world around him in all his poetry and tragedy and whose writing was reminiscent of Russian writers like Turgenev and Korolenko.&lt;ref&gt;Vimala Devi and Manuel de Seabra.''A Literatura Indo-Portuguesa''. Lisbon: Junta das Investigações do Ultramar, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Os Javalis de Codval''==

A collection of Pais's stories was published in Lisbon in 1973 by Editorial Futura under the title ''Os Javalis de Codval''.

===Themes===

Several key themes recur in the short narratives contained. One subject is matrimony, a particularly prevalent topos in Lusophone Goan writing for the discussion of caste identities and social mores. In stories such as “Ferdinando,” “De Mal a Pior” or “Um Diário e Duas Cartas” these perennial machinations are depicted within the context of a society undergoing deep social shifts that render these compacts even more fraught. Another subset of tales focuses on the breakdown of traditional rural society, featuring Hindu characters in the main and striking a similar tone to Pundalik Naik’s Konkani-language novel ''Upheaval'', perhaps the most prominent Goan novel to deal with this subject. These stories include “Uma Filha da Terra” and “Munu.” The third subgroup is represented by “Os javalis de Codval,” “O navio encalhado,” “História de minas,” “Outra história de minas” and “No comboio.” All of these narratives involve in some way a journey out into uncertainty, a setting forth in search of wealth, security or merely sustenance that ends in some sort of reversal. Both the journeys and the conditions under which they are undertaken resonate with the social, economic and political changes occurring in Goa at the time in which the stories are set.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. "Out Into Uncertainty: The Lonely Voices of Epitácio Pais’s Goan Short Stories". ''Luso-Brazilian Review'', 51:2 (2014), pp.105-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unpublished Stories==

At his death, Pais left behind a dozen uncollected stories. It is unclear whether they had been broadcast or published in the written press in some form. These stories extend Pais's concerns beyond 1973.

In 2003, the story "Um Portuguese em Baga" (A Portuguese in Baga) was published in the Portuguese-Language anthology of Goan writing "Onde O Moruoni Canta", which deals subtly with questions of identity in a post-colonial Goa.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. 'Postcolonial Subjects in the Goan Short Stories: "A Portuguese Soldier's Story" by Lambert Mascarenhas and "Um Português em Baga" by Epitácio Pais', ''Ellipsis'', 11 (2013), pp.87-100 http://apsa.us/ellipsis/11/meloecastro.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Preia-Mar''==

Pais left behind an unpublished novel in Portuguese. It will be published by Goa, 1556 under the title ''Preia-Mar'' in 2016. The novel follows the trajectory of a young Goan named Leo. From a privileged yet impoverished family, Leo tries to strike it rich by any means possible in the Goa of the 1970s. Moving through various strata representative of the society of his times – new ascendant classes linked to smuggling, mining and politics, hippies tired of the West in search of drugs and spirituality, the fishermen of the coast and repatriates from Idi Amin’s Uganda, the novel reaches a climax that defies local tradition even as it calls into question the principles of the new order.

{{Linguistics}}

'''False friends''' are words in two languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning. An example is the English ''embarrassed'' and the Spanish ''[[embarazada]]'' (which means ''pregnant''), or the word ''sensible'', which means ''reasonable'' in English, but ''sensitive'' in [[:wikt:sensible#French|French]] and [[:wikt:sensible#Spanish|Spanish]]. 

The term originates from a book by French linguists describing the phenomenon, which was translated in 1928 and entitled, "false friend of a translator".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

There is often a partial overlap in meanings, which creates additional complications.

As well as producing completely false friends, the use of [[loanword]]s often results in the use of a word in a restricted [[Context (language use)|context]], which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language. For example, ''angst'' means "fear" in a general sense (as well as "anxiety") in German, but when it was borrowed into English in the context of psychology, its meaning was restricted to a particular type of fear described as "a neurotic feeling of anxiety and depression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blvoc_gerloan.htm|title=German Loan Words in English|publisher=About.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, ''gymnasium'' meant both 'a place of education' and 'a place for exercise' in Latin, but its meaning was restricted to the former in German and to the latter in English, making the expressions into false friends in those languages as well as in Greek, where it started out as 'a place for naked exercise'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=gymnasium|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=etymolyonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and origin ==

False friends, or bilingual homophones&lt;ref name="Korpela-2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Korpela |first=Jukka K. |title=Introduction to Finnish |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ld9BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |date=12 August 2014 |publisher=Suomen E-painos Oy |location=Helsinki |isbn=978-952-6613-26-0 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; are words in two or more languages that [[homonym|look]] or [[homophone|sound]] similar, but differ significantly in meaning.&lt;ref name="Knospe-2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knospe |first1=Sebastian  |last2=Onysko |first2=Alexander  |last3=Goth |first3=Maik |title=Crossing Languages to Play with Words: Multidisciplinary Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuUsDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |date=26 September 2016 |publisher=De Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-11-046560-0 |page=116 |oclc=954201320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Korpela-2014"/&gt;

The origin of the term is as a shortened version of the expression "false friend of a translator", the English translation of a French expression ({{lang-fr|faux amis du traducteur}}) introduced by linguists Maxime Kœssler and Jules Derocquigny in their 1928 book,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0aFqB-R0MrgC&amp;pg=PA698 books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''False Friends, or the Pitfalls of the English Vocabulary'' (''Les Faux Amis ou les trahisons du vocabulaire anglais'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lesfauxamisoules00kssl archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; with a sequel, ''Autres Mots anglais perfides''.

== Implications ==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=May 2018}}
False friends can cause difficulty for people who might interpret a foreign text incorrectly.  Students learning a foreign language, particularly one that is related to their [[First language|native language]], also have difficulty with false friends because students are likely to identify the words wrongly due to [[language transfer|linguistic interference]]. For this reason, teachers sometimes compile lists of false friends as an aid for their students.

== Causes ==
From the [[etymology|etymological]] point of view, false friends can be created in several ways.

=== Shared etymology ===
If language A borrowed a word from language B, or both borrowed the word from a third language or inherited it from a common ancestor, and later the word shifted in meaning or acquired additional meanings in at least one of these languages, a [[First language|native speaker]] of one language will face a false friend when learning the other. Sometimes, presumably both senses were present in the common ancestor language, but the cognate words got different restricted senses in Language A and Language B.{{citation needed |date=March 2013}}

''Actual'', which in English is usually a synonym of ''real'', has a different meaning in other European languages, in which it means 'current' or 'up-to-date', and has the logical derivative as a [[verb]], meaning 'to make current' or 'to update'. ''Actualise'' (or 'actualize') in English means 'to make a reality of'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Euro-English: assessing variety status
|last=Mollin |first=Sandra |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPhULmMmqJMC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=using+actual+to+mean+current#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''friend'' itself has cognates in the other Germanic languages; but the Scandinavian ones (like Swedish ''frände'', Danish ''frænde'') predominantly mean 'relative'. The original [[Proto-Germanic]] word meant simply 'someone whom one cares for' and could therefore refer to both a friend and a relative, but lost various degrees of the 'friend' sense in Scandinavian languages, while it mostly lost the sense of 'relative' in English. (The plural ''friends'' is still rarely used for "kinsfolk", as in the Scottish proverb ''Friends agree best at a distance'', quoted in 1721.)

The [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Finnish language]]s are closely related, which gives rise to false friends:&lt;ref name="Knospe-2016"/&gt;

The Italian word ''confetti'' (sugared almonds) has acquired a new meaning in English, French and Dutch; in Italian, the corresponding word is ''coriandoli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/confetto |title=''Confetto in Enciclopedia Treccani'' |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English and Spanish, both of which have borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]], have multiple false friends.{{citation needed |date=April 2018}}

English and Japanese also have diverse false friends, many of them being ''[[wasei-eigo]]'' and ''[[gairaigo]]'' words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Chalmers|date=1980|title=Omote (Explicit) and Ura (Implicit): Translating Japanese Political Terms|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/132001|journal=Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=6|issue=1|pages=89–115|doi=10.2307/132001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homonyms ===

{{Main|Homonym}}

In Swedish, the word ''rolig'' means 'fun': ''ett roligt skämt'' ("a funny joke"), while in the closely related languages Danish and Norwegian it means 'calm' (as in "he was calm despite all the commotion around him"). However, the Swedish original meaning of 'calm' is retained in some related words such as ''ro'', 'calmness', and ''orolig'', 'worrisome, anxious', literally 'un-calm'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |article=Orolig |date=1950 |title=Svenska Akademiens Ordbok |trans-title=The Swedish Academy's Dictionary |publisher=Swedish Academy |location=Lund |page=spalt O 1337 |volume=19 |chapter-url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=orolig|accessdate=8 May 2017|language=Swedish|quote=[fsv. oroliker; jfr dan. o. nor. urolig, nor. dial. uroleg, nyisl. órólegur (jfr isl. úróliga, adv.), mlt. unrouwelik, (ä.) t. unruhlich; av O- 1 o. ROLIG, lugn, delvis möjl. avledn. av ORO]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish and Norwegian word ''semester'' means term (as in school term), but the Swedish word ''semester'' means holiday. The Danish word ''frokost'' means lunch, the Norwegian word ''frokost'' means breakfast.

=== Pseudo-anglicisms ===
{{Main|Pseudo-anglicism}}

[[Pseudo-anglicism]]s are new words formed from English [[morpheme]]s independently from an analogous English construct and with a different intended meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Onysko|first1=Alexander|title=Anglicisms in German: Borrowing, Lexical Productivity, and Written Codeswitching|date=2007|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|isbn=978-3-11-019946-8|pages=52-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] is replete with pseudo-anglicisms, known as ''[[wasei-eigo]]'' ("Japan-made English").{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Semantic change ==
In bilingual situations, false friends often result in a [[semantic change]]—a real new meaning that is then commonly used in a language. For example, the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''humoroso'' ('capricious') changed its referent in American Portuguese to 'humorous', owing to the [[English language|English]] surface-cognate ''humorous.''{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

''[[Corn]]'' was originally the dominant type of grain in a region (indeed ''corn'' and ''grain'' are themselves [[cognate]]s from the same Indo-European root). It came to mean usually [[cereal]]s in general in the British Isles in the nineteenth century, as in the [[Corn Laws]], but [[maize]] in North America, and now often just maize also in the British Isles.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The American [[Italian language|Italian]] ''fattoria'' lost its original meaning 'farm' in favor of 'factory' owing to the phonetically similar surface-cognate [[English language|English]] ''factory'' (cf. Standard [[Italian language|Italian]] ''fabbrica'' 'factory'). Instead of the original ''fattoria'', the phonetic adaptation American [[Italian language|Italian]] ''farma'' became the new signifier for 'farm' (Weinreich 1963: 49; see "one-to-one correlation between signifiers and referents").

This phenomenon is analyzed by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] as "(incestuous) [[phono-semantic matching]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=102 |first= Ghil'ad |last=Zuckermann |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?is=140391723X |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher= Houndmills: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change, Series editor: Charles Jones) |ISBN= 1-4039-1723-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4687">'''Flann mac Lonáin''' (died 896) was an Irish poet.

==Background and career==

Flann mac Lonáin was a famed and at times controversial poet. He was the [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]] He seems to have been born in the east [[County Clare|Clare]]/west [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] region. Distinguished both in his lifetime and after, his compositions were studied and used as exemplars in medieval metrical tracts.

==Annalistic verse==

The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] contains two verses of a [[lament]] he composed upon the death of ''Treasach, son of Becan, chief of Ui Bairche Maighe, [who]was slain by Aedh, son of Ilguine'' in 884:

''Of him Flann, son of Lonan, said:''

* ''A heavy mist upon the province of Breasal/since they slew at the fortaliced Liphe/Heavy the groans of Assal/for grief at the loss of Treasach.''
* ''Wearied my mind, moist my countenance/since Treasach lies in death./The moan of Oenach Lifi all/and of Leinster to the sea, is the son of Becan.''

Upon the death of [[Ceallach mac Flannaghan]], King of [[Kings of Brega|Brega]] in 890, he composed the following:

* ''Illustrious the careers/of the three sons of Flann/who coursed over Odhbha/Congalach of Colt/Ceallach of Cearna/and Cinaedh of Cnodhbha.''
* ''Though Ceallach slew/an outlaw, pity/he should fall in the battle's onset;/Alas!/his danger was certain;/ that he would not spend/the life of a historian.''

==Death==

He died violently at Waterford Harbour.

The Annals of the Four Masters state that:

M891.14 Flann,mac Lonáin, Uirghil Shil Scota primh-fhileGaoidheal uile, file as deach baí i n-Erinn ina aimsir, do mharbhadhla macaibh Cuirbhuidhe, do Uibh Fothaith iat-sen, h-in-duinetaidhe h-ic Loch Dá Caochi n-Deisibh Mumhán.

M891.14 Flann, son of Lonan, the Virgil of the race of Scota, chief poet of all the Gaeidhil, the best poet that was in Ireland in his time, was secretly murdered by the sons of Corrbuidhe (who were of the Ui Fothaith), at Loch Dachaech, in Deisi Mumhan.

The [[Annals of Ulster]] state that:

* 896 AD ''Flann son of Lónán grandson of Guaire, was slain by the Déisi of Mumu.''

while the [[Annals of Innisfallen]] notes;

* ''The slaying of Flann son of Lonán, king of the poets of Ireland, by the Uí Fhothaid Tíre.''

while the [[Chronicon Scotorum]] more fulsomly records that;

*''Flann son of Lónán, the [[Virgil]] of the Irish i.e. the chief poet of the Irish, was slain by the Uí Cuirrbuidh i.e. by the Uí Fothaid, at Loch dá Caoch in the [[Déisi]] of [[Munster|Mumu]].''

In his posthumously-published work, ''The Irish Tradition'' (1946), [[Robin Flower]] wrote at some length of him and the legends surrounding his life.

Flann is mentioned in the oldest surviving personal letter from Ireland, which dates from the mid 12th century and was addressed to [[Áed Ua Crimthainn]], compiler of the [[Book of Leinster]], by Find, [[Bishop of Kildare]], who wrote: "Let the poem book of Mac Lonáin be brought to me so that we may study the meanings of the poems that are in it, ''et vale in Christo''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, William, 'Notes on the scripts and make-up of the Book of Leinster', in ''Celtica'' 7 (1966) pp. 1-31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fude pen.jpg|210px|thumb|Fudepen with brush strokes]]
The {{nihongo|'''fudepen'''|筆ペン}}, also known as "Brush Pen", is a cartridges-based writing instrument used in [[East Asian calligraphy]]; in essence, an [[ink brush]] analogue to [[fountain pen]]. It consists of a pen nib that mimics the brush-like quality of the ink brush with either brush strands as in a normal ink brush or a soft felt tip similar to a marker; the nibs are fed by an [[ink]] reservoir. The ink used is unlike traditional [[India ink|calligraphy ink]].  It is designed to adhere well to modern [[paper]], while traditional ink only adheres well to [[rice paper]].

They are typically manufactured by Japanese companies such as [[Pentel]], [[Sakura Color Products Corporation]] and [[Kuretake (art products)]].

[[hypergraphia]]). The term 'graphomania' was used in the early 19th century by [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol|Esquirol]] and later by [[Eugen Bleuler]], becoming more or less common.&lt;ref&gt;"The habit of excessive writing, of explaining, amplifying, and reiterating, of letter making and pamphleteering, forms a morbid symptom of known as 'graphomania.' Some men may overload their natural tendency to write, but a certain class of lunatics use nearly all their mental activities in this occupation, to the endless annoyance of their friends, relatives and physicians."''[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5353/ "Bryan's Mental Condition:" One Psychiatrist’s View] Source: New York Times, 27 September 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphomania is related to '''typomania''', which is obsessiveness with seeing one's name in publication or with writing for being published, excessive symbolism or typology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordquests.info/cgi/ice2-for.cgi?file=/hsphere/local/home/scribejo/wordquests.info/htm/L-Gk-mania-P-Z.htm&amp;HIGHLIGHT=manias Typomania, definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the psychiatric definitions of graphomania and related conditions, the word is used more broadly to label the urge and need to write excessively, professionally or not. [[Max Nordau]], in his attack of what he saw as [[degenerate art]], frequently used the term 'graphomania' to label the production of the artists he condemned (most notably [[Richard Wagner]]&lt;ref name=nordau&gt;Nordau M., ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'': "We will take a closer view of the graphomaniac Wagner.. He displays in the general constitution of his mind ... all the signs of graphomania, namely, incoherence, fugitive ideation, and a tendency to idiotic punning." p.&amp;nbsp;171–2; London: Heinemann. 1895 [https://archive.org/details/degeneration035137mbp]&lt;/ref&gt; or the French [[symbolist poets]] &lt;ref name=nordau/&gt;)

[[Milan Kundera]], in ''[[The Book of Laughter and Forgetting]]'' (1979), explains proliferation of non-professional writing as follows:

{{quote|multiline=yes|Graphomania inevitably takes on epidemic proportions when a society develops to the point of creating three basic conditions:
# An elevated level of general well-being, which allows people to devote themselves to useless activities;
# A high degree of social atomization and, as a consequence, a general isolation of individuals;
# The absence of dramatic social changes in the nation's internal life. (From this point of view, it seems to me symptomatic that in France, where practically nothing happens, the percentage of writers is twenty-one times higher than in Israel).}}

'''''Groupe [[Mu (letter)|μ]]''''' ([[French language|French]] for "Group [[Mu (letter)|μ]]") is the [[collective pseudonym]] under which a group of Belgian 20th-century semioticians wrote a series of books, presenting an exposition of modern [[semiotics]].

==Research and work==
This interdisciplinary group works out of the Center of Poetic Studies at the [[University of Liège]], in [[Belgium]], and was formed in 1967.  Members have included [[Francis Édeline]], [[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]], [[Jacques Dubois (Walloon Professor)|Jacques Dubois]], [[Francis Pire]], [[Hadelin Trinon]] and [[Philippe Minguet]], with several other associate members.  Beyond their personal research in [[biochemistry]], cultural [[sociology]], [[aesthetics]], or semiotics, the authors have published collectively various books as well as more than sixty papers in such journals as ''Communications'', ''Poétique'', ''Versus'', ''Visio'', ''Degrés'', ''Cahiers internationaux de symbolisme'', ''Communication et langage'',  ''Era'', ''Revue d'esthétique'',  ''Le Français moderne'', ''Texte'', ''Technê'', ''Protée'', ''RS/SI'', ''Nouveaux actes sémiotiques'', ''Les Documents de travail d'Urbino'', etc. or in collected papers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} 

Some of their early work in the 1960s dealt with [[linguistics|linguistically oriented topics]] such as [[polysemous language]], and the nature of [[synecdoche]] and [[metaphor]].  The concepts elaborated in the group’s first major publication (''[[A General Rhetoric]]'' 1970) contributed to the revival of [[rhetorics]] at the time, by providing an explanatory model of rhetorical figures,  which drew on contemporary concepts of linguistic structure. The group separated itself even further from formal [[structuralism]] with the publication of ''A Rhetoric of Poetry'' (1977), which showed that, although the presence of certain linguistic structures – and foremost amongst them poly-[[isotopy (linguistics)|isotopy]], made possible by rhetorical figures – was a necessary condition for the production of poetic effects, this condition was not enough, and that anthropological and social criteria would be needed to complete these structures.

In the 1970s and 1980s they worked on developing a theoretical approach towards [[visual rhetoric]] and [[visual semiotics]] that involved classifying images according to their differences from plastic and iconic norms.

The ''Traité du signe visuel'' (1992) (which [[Göran Sonesson]] said was to visual communication what [[Saussure]]'s ''Cours de linguistique générale'' was to linguistics) sought to elaborate a general grammar of the image, independently of the type of corpus being considered. This semiotic of the visual contributed, in its turn, to semiotics in general: indeed, a question encountered by the group at this stage was that of the relationship between sensorial experience and signification, a question which certainly reveals something of this degree of generality since it comes up against the question of the origin of meaning itself.

The group took its name from the [[metaphor]], μ being the Greek initial for the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raffaelesolaini.com/2scient.html |title=La metafora nel Gruppo μ |last=Solaini |first=Raffaele |date=n.d. |access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guillaume de Saluste Du Bartas''' (1544, [[Monfort]]{{snd}}July 1590, [[Mauvezin, Gers|Mauvezin]]) was a [[Gascony|Gascon]] [[Huguenot]] courtier and poet. Trained as a doctor of law, he served in the court of [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]] for most of his career. Du Bartas was celebrated across sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe for his divine poetry, particularly ''L'Uranie ''(1584), ''Judit ''(1584), ''La Sepmaine; ou, Creation du monde'' (1578), and ''La Seconde Semaine'' (1584-1603).

== Life ==
Relatively little is known about Du Bartas’ life. Born in 1544, Guillaume Sallustre descended from a family of wealthy merchants in Montfort (in the [[Armagnac (province)|Armagnac]] region).&lt;ref name=Bellenger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|first1=Yvonne|title=La Sepmaine (texte de 1581)|date=1981|location=Paris|pages=xix-xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family name later became ‘Saluste’ rather than 'Sallustre', perhaps to invite comparison with the Roman historian [[Sallust]]. He was possibly a student at [[College de Guyenne]] in Bordeaux ([[Montaigne|Michel de Montaigne]]’s school), and studied law in Toulouse under [[Jacques Cujas]]: he became a doctor of law in 1567, and subsequently a judge in Montfort in 1571.&lt;ref name=Bellenger /&gt; He gained the lordship of nearby Bartas (becoming Sieur Du Bartas) on his father’s death in 1566. He married Catherine de Manas, a local noblewoman, in 1570, and they had four daughters together: Anne, Jeanne, Marie and Isabeau.

He entered the service of [[Henri de Navarre]] in 1576, who would become Henri IV of France in 1589.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Pellissier|title=Du Bartas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Du Bartas et ses Divines Semaines|last = Bellenger|first = Yvonne|publisher = |year = 1993|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 15–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent on various diplomatic missions, including to Montmorency in 1580, and Scotland and England in 1587. He died in 1590, just weeks after composing a poem that celebrated Henri's victory at the [[Battle of Ivry]], though it is not thought that he fought in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|title=La Sepmaine|page=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Château Du Bartas, found in Saint Georges, was Du Bartas' residence in the later part of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.au-chateau.com/Barthas.php|title = Château du Barthas |date = |accessdate = 11 November 2014|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Du Bartas stands in a square named after him in [[Auch]], the historic capital of [[Gascony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.monnuage.fr/point-d-interet/statue-du-bartas-a100888|title = Statue du Bartas|date = |accessdate = 11 November 2014|website = MonNuage|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==

=== ''La muse chrestienne'' ===
Du Bartas began writing poetry in the 1560s after being invited to do so by [[Jeanne d'Albret|Jeanne d'Albret de Navarre]]. His first collection, ''La muse chrestienne'' (1574) contains ‘L’Uranie’, a verse prosopographia in which the Christian muse urges the poet to commit himself to composing serious poetry on scriptural themes. The other two items in the volume, the biblical epic ''Judit'' and 'Le Triomphe de la Foi', were examples of this new religious verse.

=== The ''Semaines'' ===
Du Bartas' masterpiece is his ''Semaines'' ('Weeks'), two epic poems which freely expand on the account in the [[Book of Genesis]] of the creation of the world and the first eras of world history. Each ''Semaine'' consists of individual ''jours'' (days) which can be read separately.

==== ''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ====
''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ('The Week, of creation of the World'), subsequently also known as ''La Premiere Sepmaine'' was first printed in Paris in 1578, and was immediately popular. ''La Sepmaine'' is a [[hexameral]] poem consisting of seven ''jours'', each containing around 700 lines, devoted to the aspect of the world created on that day in the first week. Because the poem's structure follows Genesis 1:1-8 closely, it is easy to navigate to particular sections; for example, readers wanting to find what Du Bartas writes about cuttlefish or mullet could know to turn to 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day) and in most editions would have had marginal annotations to help them locate the description of each creature.

'Le Premier Jour' (The First Day) describes the creation of the world out of chaos (Du Bartas advocates the theory of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' - 'Nothing, but ''Nothing'' had the Lord Almighty, | Whereof, wherewith, whereby, to build this City' (Sylvester, I.i.228-29), forecasts the Day of Judgement and concludes with a discussion of angels. 'Le Second Jour' (The Second Day) concerns the creation of the four elements - water, air, earth and fire - and their meteorological effects. Land, seas and vegetation are created in 'Le Troisiesme Jour' (The Third Day). The earth is populated with particular species of natural life during the next three days: the sun, stars and seasons in 'Le Quatriesme Jour' (The Fourth Day); fish and birds in 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day); and land animals and human beings in 'Le Sixiesme Jour' (The Sixth Jour). In 'Le Septiesme Jour' (The Seventh Day) Gods surveys the world he has created, and the poet meditates on the created world.[[File:Sallusti.png|thumb|La Sepmaine ou creation du Monde (1578)]]

==== ''La Seconde Semaine'' ====
Following the success of his First Week, Du Bartas embarked upon a sequel that would survey world history from Adam to the apocalypse, following the plan in Augustine's ''City of God''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saint Augustine|title=City of God|origyear=1972|year= 2003|publisher=Penguin|page=1091 (Book 22, Chapter 30)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He only completed four ''jours'', each divided into four parts, that covered the eras of Adam, Noah, Abraham and David (the final three were to cover [[Zedekiah]], the Messiah and the Eternal Sabbath).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sylvester|first1=Josuah|title=Devine Weekes and Workes|date=1621|page=Q6v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two ''jours'' of ''La Seconde Semaine'' were first printed in 1584. 'Le Premier Jour' (the era of Adam) contains 'Eden' (II.i.1) describing the Garden of Paradise; 'L'Imposture' ('The Imposture' in Sylvester's translation, II.i.2) which relates the Fall of Man; 'Les Furies' ('The Furies', II.i.3) which describes the diseases, conflicts and vices that plague mankind; and 'Les Artifices' ('The Handy Crafts', II.i.4) which is about the various crafts that humankind learnt, and Cain and Abel. 'Le Second Jour' (Noah) consists of 'L'Arche' ('The Arke', II.ii.1) retelling the Great Flood; 'Babylone' ('Babylon', II.ii.2) about the [[Tower of Babel]] and European literary cultures; 'Les Colonies' ('The Colonies', Ii.ii.3) which describes the spread of different tribes across the world; and 'Les Colomnes' ('The Columnes', II.ii.4) in which the tale (originally found in [[Josephus]]) of [[Seth]] writing scientific and astronomical knowledge on two pillars to safeguard it against fire and flood is a point of departure for a review of learning in those areas.

''Les Suites de la Second Semaine,'' containing the third and fourth ''jours'', were printed in parts between 1591 and 1603. James VI of Scotland received a manuscript copy containing six of the eight sections of the ''Suites'' (including a version of 'Les Peres' with 830 lines not found in the printed texts) in the late 1580s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=Le Manuscrit Royal de la Suite de la Seconde Semaine de Du Bartas|url=|journal=Bibliothèque d’Humanisme et Renaissance|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Le Troisieme Jour' continues the narrative into the age of Abraham: La Vocation ('The Vocation', II.iii.1) and 'Les Peres' ('The Fathers', II.iii.2) cover the end of the Book of Genesis in relating the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] respectively, while 'La Loy' ('The Law', II.iii.3) moves into the Exodus narrative and 'Les Captaines' ('The Captains', II.iii.4) to [[Joshua]] and [[Samuel]]. 'Le Quatrieme Jour' is devoted to [[David]]: 'Les Trophees' ('The Trophies', II.iv.1), 'La Magnificence' ('The Magnificence', II.iv.2) is about [[Solomon]], and the final two completed sections, 'Le Schisme' ('The Schism', II.iv.3) and finally 'La Decadence' ('The Decay', II.iv.4), reviews the monarchs of the [[Books of Kings]] and [[Book of Chronicles]].

== Reputation ==

===France===
''La Sepmaine'' was instantly successful in France: there were 42 editions between 1578 and 1632, often printed with [[Simon Goulart]]'s marginal annotations and commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I.77|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bartas was the most highly esteemed French poet in France at the turn of the seventeenth century, even more so than [[Ronsard]], and in 1620 was still regarded as the apogee of French 'grand poesie'.&lt;ref name="Garapon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garapon|title=Sur la Renommée posthume de Ronsard et de Du Bartas|pages=53–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were no further French editions of the ''Semaines'' after 1630.&lt;ref name="Garapon" /&gt; What were once regarded as the stylistic merits of Du Bartas' were later deemed to be weaknesses: his use of compound epithets, duplication of initial syllables, frequent inclusion of metaphors and similes and a highly compressed and accumulative style all contributed to a sense that his poetry was over-wrought and over-elaborate.

Nonetheless there were over thirty poems influenced by Du Bartas printed in France between 1601 and 1697, including direct continuations or parodies such as Christophe de Gamon's ''La Sepmaine'' (1609) and A. D’Argent’s ''Sepmaine'' (1629), and printed references praising Du Bartas in works written throughout this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magnien|first1=Michel|title='Du Bartas en France au XVIIe siècle' in Du Bartas: 1590–1990|date=1992|location=Mont-de-Marsan|pages=69–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1684 [[Madeleine de Scudéry]] recalled the often-cited anecdote that Ronsard had once remarked that Du Bartas had achieved more in a week than he had in his entire life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magnien|title=Du Bartas en France|pages=55, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bartas was, however, an object of criticism: he was, for example, cited for examples of mistakes to avoid in a ''Brève instruction'' (1667). Du Bartas' reputation remained low in subsequent centuries: in 1842 [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] wrote that Du Bartas ‘a pu s’égarer et céder au mauvais goût de son temps dans le gros de ces oeuvres’ (‘was led astray and gave into the poor taste of his times in most of his work’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sainte-Beuve|first1=Charles Augustin|date=1842|title=Anciens Poètes Français: Du Bartas|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k86880r/f550|journal=Revue des deux mondes|volume=29|pages=549-75|via=Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Du Bartas is still not widely known in France today, critical re-appraisals in the twentieth century, led by James Dauphiné, Yvonne Bellenger and other, have shown how Du Bartas' encyclopedic writing was representative of its time and is still worthy of attention.

===Scotland===
[[James VI]] of [[Scotland]]'s enthusiasm for Du Bartas made the Frenchman's poetry uniquely popular in sixteenth-century Scotland. James possessed a copy of ''La Sepmaine'' given to him by his nurse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=George Frederick|title=The Library of James VI, 1573–1583|date=1893|location=Edinburgh|page=xliii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a year later wrote in the preface to his ''Essayes of a Prentise'' (Edinburgh, 1584) that

:Hauing oft reuolued, and red ouer (fauorable Reader) the booke and Poems of the deuine and Illuster Poete, Salust du Bartas, I was moued by the oft reading &amp; perusing of them, with a restles and lofty desire, to preas to attaine to the like vertue. (''Essayes'', C3r)

The volume contained James’s Scots translation of ''L'Uranie''. Du Bartas' synthesis of sacred and secular verse matched the King's own aesthetic preferences, and also his political imperative to consolidate his divine and political authority. The King shared Urania's sense that more poets should write about the highest matters:

:O ye that wolde your browes with Laurel bind,
:What larger feild I pray you can you find,
:Then is his praise, who brydles heavens most cleare
:Makes mountaines tremble, and howest hells to feare?

[[Thomas Hudson (poet)|Thomas Hudson]], a court musician, was (so he writes in the preface) commissioned by the King to prepare a translation of ''Judit'', which was printed in 1584 with prefatory sonnets by James and others. Du Bartas was evidently quickly made aware of the King’s attention, for a publisher’s contract which Du Bartas signed in 1585 mentions printing the King’s translation (as well as Du Bartas’ translation of the King’s ‘Ane Schort Poeme of Tyme’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I. 205–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Bartas and James subsequently met in the summer of 1587 when the French poet travelled on a diplomatic mission to Scotland, via the English Court, to propose a marriage match between James and [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]]’s sister, [[Catherine de Bourbon]].Though the match never happened, Du Bartas remained in high esteem with James: he received expensive gifts on departure, and the King invited him to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Du Bartas’ Visit to England and Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may well have been during this visit that Du Bartas translated James’ mini-epic on [[The Battle of Lepanto]] which was printed alongside James’ original poem and his translation of ‘Les Furies’ in his ''[[Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres]]'' (1591).

Poets writing at the Jacobean Court (members of the so-called "[[Castalian Band]]") all knew of Du Bartas, who was ‘aesthetically and ideologically a role-model for James’ and ‘emblematic of the direction, spiritually, philosophically and aesthetically, in which James sought to lead his imagined renaissance’ (Sarah Dunnigan) at the Scottish Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunnigan|first1=Sarah|title=Eros and Poetry at the Courts of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI|date=2002|location=Basingstoke|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Thomas Hudson’s Historie of Judith|date=1941|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Stewart of Baldynneis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Crockett |editor-first1=Thomas|title=Poems of John Stewart of Baldynneis|pages=II, p. 196}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two poets who refer to Urania as a symbolic figurehead for the kind of poetic inspiration to which they aspired in vain. Hadrian Damman’s Latin translation was dedicated to James when printed in 1600 (a manuscript copy dated 1596 also survives, National Library of Scotland MS Adv. 19.2.10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Short Title Catalogue|url=http://estc.bl.uk/S116418}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] and [[Zachary Boyd]] are three seventeenth-century Scottish poets who knew Du Bartas’ works well; the latter two imitate his works (Sylvester's translation in Boyd's case) extensively.

James had a major impact on English responses both before and after his accession to the English throne. Gabriel Harvey is one of numerous writers in London who were reading James' translation in the 1590s: when Harvey praised Du Bartas as the ‘Treasurer of Humanity and 'Ieweller of Diuinity’ and ‘a right inspired, and enravished Poet’ in the preface to ''Pierces Supererogation'' (1593) and other works, he was in part drawing on notes made in his copy of James's ''Essayes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=401–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passage in the King's ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' exhorting more poets to 'bee well versed' in Du Bartas' poetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Basilicon Doron|date=1944|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=I, p. 199}}&lt;/ref&gt; was cited, for instance, by [[Thomas Winter (M.A.)|Thomas Winter]] in the dedicatory epistle of his translation of the ''Third Dayes Creation'' (1604). [[Joshua Sylvester]] dedicated his translation ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605) to James, having presented a manuscript extract to the King in the previous year.

===England===
Du Bartas was extremely popular in early modern England, and was still being read widely in the later seventeenth century even as his reputation in France began to decline. Around two hundred texts printed in England before 1700 make direct reference to Du Bartas, including seventy-five from the period 1641-1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Snapshots|pages=3–4, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were numerous translations of sections of the ''Semaines'' into English, of which the most significant is [[Josuah Sylvester]]'s ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605 et seq.; re-printed six times by 1641). Du Bartas was quickly regarded as a divine epic poet whose works took their place among the great European classics: [[Gabriel Harvey]], for example, compared Du Bartas to Homer, Virgil and Dante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=‘Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey’|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=403, 411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Philip Sidney]] apparently admired Du Bartas' works later in life, and his translation of 'Salust Du Bartas' was entered into the Stationers’ Register in 1588, but is now unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ringler|first1=William A.|title=The Poems of Philip Sidney|date=1962|location=Oxford|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bartas had in effect synthesized the two highest forms of poetry, divine and philosophical, described in Sidney’s ''[[An Apology for Poetry|Apology for Poetry]]''. S. K. Heninger, reflecting on similarities between Sidney and Du Bartas’ conception of poetry, writes that: ‘the reader could ponder the wide-ranging mysteries of creation. He could contemplate God’s intention, His methods, His results. The text is characterized by a Protestant passion for the truth—the truth, at once universal and concrete. It is also characterized by a Protestant devotion to the word—the word, at once comprehensive and knowable, ''logos'' though it may be.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heninger Jr.|first1=S. K.|title=‘Sidney and Milton: The Poet as Maker’, in ''Milton and the Line of Vision'', ed. Joseph Wittreich|date=1975|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Scott, author of ‘[[The Model of Poesy]]’ and a translator of the first two Days of ''La Sepmaine'', found moral, spiritual and aesthetic value in the poetry of 'our incomparable Bartas, who hath opened as much natural science in one week, containing the story of the creation, as all the rabble of schoolmen and philosophers have done since Plato and Aristotle.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Gavin|title=The Model of Poesy|date=2013|location=Cambridge|page=20.12–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmund Spenser, said by Harvey to have particularly enjoyed The Fourth Day, writes in ''[[The Ruines of Time]]'' that after [[Joachim Du Bellay]] 'gins ''Bartas'' hie to rayse | His heavenly Muse, th'Almighty to adore'; however, ‘within the shared province of Christian epic, Spenser and du Bartas remain fairly far apart’ (Susan Snyder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Susan|title='Du Bartas' in ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'', ed. by A. C. Hamilton|date=1990|location=Toronto|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Snyder, ‘clearly everyone in pre-Restoration England who had received a literary education read the Weekes and almost all [...] admired it.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26873|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Du Bartas was [[John Milton]]'s ‘earliest English literary model’, and traces of direct influence are arguably most apparent in ''Poems'' 1645.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=John|title=Milton: The Complete Shorter Poems|date=2007|location=Harlow|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the ''Semaines ''were a major precursor for ''[[Paradise Lost]] '', and can productively be compared with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paradise Lost in Context|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/17century/topic_2/dubartas.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Norton Topics Online|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bartas was also an early influence on [[Anne Bradstreet]]; one of her earliest dated works is her elegy ‘In Honour of Du Bartas. 1641’. The prefatory materials to ''The Tenth Muse'' (1650) make numerous references to Bradstreet's enthusiasm for Du Bartas, including Nathaniel Ward's condescending remark that Bradstreet is a 'right Du Bartas girle'. Though Bradstreet's poetry owes much to Du Bartas' methods, her work is not derivative, and she denied that her poetry imitates Du Bartas in her dedicatory poem to her father Thomas Dudley: 'I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth’ (ll. 38-9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hensley|first1=Jeannine|title=THe Works of Anne Bradstreet|date=2005|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=4, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucy Hutchinson]] would have read ''Devine Weekes'' before writing ''Order and Disorder''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norbrook|first1=David|title=Lucy Hutchinson, Order and Disorder|date=2001|page=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rest of Europe===
Du Bartas' works, particularly and often exclusively ''La Sepmaine'', were translated into numerous other European languages in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|last2= Ternaux|title=Bibliographie|pages=29–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were translations into Latin (by Gabriel de Lerm (1583), Jean Édouard Du Monin (1579), Hadrian Damman (1600) and Samuel Benoît (1609)), Italian (by Ferrante Guisone, first printed in 1592 and reprinted five times before 1613), Spanish (Joan Dessi, 1610, and Francisco de Cáceres in 1612) and German (Tobias Hübner, 1622 and 1631). Several Dutch translators produced versions: Zacharias Heyns (1616, 1621 and 1628), Theodorick van Liefvelt, Heer van Opdorp (1609), Wessel van den Boetselaer, Heer van Asperen (1622) and [[Joost van den Vondel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beekman|title=Influence de Du Bartas|pages=70–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Danish translation of  ''La Sepmaine'' was printed in 1661, and a Swedish translation in 1685.

Du Bartas' popularity apparently declined throughout Europe in the eighteenth century: in his translation of [[Diderot]]'s '[[Rameau's Nephew]]' (1805) [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] expressed surprise that ''La Sepmaine'' was no longer widely known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goethe|first1=Johann Wolfgang von|chapter=Rameaus Neffe|work=Sämtliche Werke|volume= 7,|date=1981|location=Munich|pages=663–664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20993">'''H-dropping''' or '''aitch-dropping''' is the [[elision|deletion]] of the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] or "H sound", {{IPA|[h]}}. The phenomenon is common in many [[dialect]]s of [[English language|English]], and is also found in certain other languages, either as a purely historical development or as a contemporary difference between dialects. Although common in most regions of [[England]] and in some other English-speaking countries, H-dropping is often [[social stigma|stigmatized]] and perceived as a sign of careless or uneducated speech.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The reverse phenomenon, '''H-insertion''' or '''H-adding''', is found in certain situations, sometimes as a [[hypercorrection]] by H-dropping speakers, and sometimes as a [[spelling pronunciation]] or out of perceived [[etymological]] correctness. A particular example of this is the spread of 'haitch' for 'aitch'.

==In English==
===Historical /h/-loss===
In [[Old English phonology]], the sounds [h], [x] and [ç] (described respectively as [[voiceless glottal fricative|glottal]], [[voiceless velar fricative|velar]] and [[voiceless palatal fricative|palatal]] voiceless fricatives) are taken to be [[allophone]]s of a single [[phoneme]] /h/. The [h] sound appeared at the start of a syllable, either alone or in a [[consonant cluster|cluster]] with another consonant. The other two sounds were used in the [[syllable coda]] ([x] after [[back vowel]]s and [ç] after [[front vowel]]s).

The instances of /h/ in coda position were [[Middle English phonology#H-loss|lost]] during the [[Middle English]] and [[Early Modern English]] periods, although they are still reflected in the spelling of words such as ''taught'' (now pronounced like ''taut'') and ''weight'' (now pronounced in most accents like ''wait''). Most of the initial clusters involving /h/ also disappeared (see [[H-cluster reductions]]). As a result, in the [[Standard English|standard]] varieties of [[Modern English]], the only position in which /h/ can occur is at the start of a syllable, either alone (as in ''hat'', ''house'', ''behind'', etc.), in the cluster /hj/ (as in ''huge''), or (for a minority of speakers) in the cluster /hw/ (as in ''whine'' if pronounced [[Wine–whine merger|differently from ''wine'']]). The usual realizations of the latter two clusters are [ç] and [ʍ] (see [[English phonology]]).

===Contemporary H-dropping===
The phenomenon of H-dropping considered as a feature of contemporary English is the omission, in certain [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s and [[dialect]]s, of this syllable-initial /h/, either alone or in the cluster /hj/. (For the cluster /hw/ and its reduction, see [[Pronunciation of English ⟨wh⟩]].)

====Description====
H-dropping, in certain accents and dialects of [[Modern English]], causes words like ''harm'', ''heat'', and ''behind'' to be pronounced ''arm'', ''eat'', and ''be-ind'' (though in some dialects an [h] may appear in ''behind'' to prevent hiatus &amp;ndash; see below).

Cases of H-dropping occur in all English dialects in the [[weak and strong forms in English|weak form]]s of [[function word]]s like ''he'', ''him'', ''her'', ''his'', ''had'', and ''have''. The [[it (pronoun)|pronoun ''it'']] is a product of historical H-dropping – the older ''hit'' survives as an emphatic form in a few dialects such as [[Southern American English]], and in the [[Scots language]].&lt;ref&gt;David D. Murison, ''The Guid Scots Tongue'', Blackwodd 1977, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the {{IPA|/h/}} of  unstressed ''have'' is usually dropped, the word is usually pronounced {{IPA|/əv/}} in phrases like ''should have'', ''would have'', and ''could have''. These can be spelled out in informal writing as "should've", "would've", and "could've". Because {{IPA|/əv/}} is also the weak form of the word ''of'', these words are often misspelled as ''should of'', ''would of'' and ''could of''.

====History====
There is evidence of h-dropping in texts from the 13th century and later. It may originally have arisen through contact with the [[Norman language]], where h-dropping also occurred. [[Pun]]s which rely on the possible omission of the /h/ sound can be found in works by [[William Shakespeare]] and in other [[Elizabethan era]] dramas. It is suggested that the phenomenon probably spread from the middle to the lower orders of society, first taking hold in urban centers. It started to become [[social stigma|stigmatized]], being seen as a sign of poor education, in the 16th or 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Milroy, J., "On the Sociolinguistic History of H-dropping in English", in ''Current topics in English historical linguistics'', Odense UP, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milroy, L., ''Authority in Language: Investigating Standard English'', Routledge 2002, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geographical distribution====
[[File:H-dropping.svg|thumb|250px|H-dropping in the [[English language in England]] (based on Upton and Widdowson, 2006). Dialects in the regions marked ''no /h/'' feature (variable) H-dropping, while those in the regions marked ''/h/'' generally do not, although there is some local variation within these regions.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, C., Widdowson, J.D.A., ''An Atlas of English Dialects'', Routledge 2006, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

H-dropping occurs (variably) in most of the dialects of the [[English language in England]] and [[Welsh English]], including [[Cockney]], [[West Country English]], [[West Midlands English]] (including [[Brummie]]), most of [[English language in northern England|northern England]] (including [[Yorkshire dialect|Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire dialect|Lancashire]]), and [[Cardiff English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phonetics of Dutch and English|edition=5|location=[[Leiden]]/[[Boston]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2002|author1-first=Beverley|author1-last=Collins|author2-first=Inger M.|author2-last=Mees|pages=290–302|url=http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_Collins_Phonetics_of_English_and_Dutch_pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not generally found in [[Scottish English]]. It is also typically absent in certain regions of England, including [[Northumberland]] and [[East Anglia]].

H-dropping also occurs in [[Variation in Australian English#Broad, general and cultivated Australian|General Australian]], most of [[Jamaican English]], and perhaps in other [[Caribbean English]] (including some of [[The Bahamas]]). It is not generally found in [[North American English]], although it has been reported in [[Newfoundland English|Newfoundland]] (outside the [[Avalon Peninsula]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Wells|Wells, J.C.]], ''Accents of English'', CUP 1982, pp. 564, 568–69, 589, 594, 622.&lt;/ref&gt; However, dropping of /h/ from the cluster /hj/ (so that ''human'' is pronounced /'juːmən/) is found in some American dialects, as well as in parts of Ireland – see [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Reduction of /hj/|reduction of /hj/]].

====Social distribution and stigmatization====
H-dropping, in the countries and regions in which it is prevalent, occurs mainly in working-class accents. Studies have shown it to be significantly more frequent in lower than in higher social groups. It is not a feature of [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] (the [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] accent of England), or even of "Near-RP", a variant of RP that includes some regional features.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), pp. 254, 300.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not apply, however, to the dropping of /h/ in weak forms of words like ''his'' and ''her'', as described above – this is normal in all varieties of English.

H-dropping in English is widely [[social stigma|stigmatized]], being perceived as a sign of poor or uneducated speech, and discouraged by schoolteachers. [[John C. Wells|John Wells]] writes that it seems to be "the single most powerful pronunciation [[shibboleth]] in England."&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use and status of the H-sound in H-dropping dialects====
In fully H-dropping dialects, that is, in dialects without a phonemic {{IPA|/h/}}, the sound {{IPA|[h]}} may still occur but with uses other than distinguishing words. An [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|[h]}} may be used to avoid [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], so that for example ''the egg'' is pronounced ''the hegg''. It may also be used when any vowel-initial word is emphasized, so that ''horse'' {{IPA|/ˈɔːs/}} (assuming the dialect is also non-rhotic) and ''ass'' {{IPA|/ˈæs/}} may be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈˈhɔːs]}} and {{IPA|[ˈˈhæs]}} in emphatic utterances. That is, {{IPA|[h]}} has become an [[allophone]] of the [[zero onset]] in these dialects.

For many H-dropping speakers, however, a phonological /h/ appears to be present, even if it is not usually realized – that is, they know which words "should" have an /h/, and have a greater tendency to pronounce an [h] in those words than in other words beginning with a vowel. Insertion of [h] may occur as a means of emphasis, as noted above, and also as a response to the formality of a situation.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandhi]] phenomena may also indicate a speaker's awareness of the presence of an /h/ – for example, some speakers might say "a edge" (rather than "an edge") for ''a hedge'', and might omit the [[linking R]] before an initial vowel resulting from a dropped H.

It is likely that the phonemic system of children in H-dropping areas lacks an /h/ entirely, but that social and educational pressures lead to the incorporation of an (inconsistently realized) /h/ into the system by the time of adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===H-insertion===
The opposite of H-dropping, called ''H-insertion'' or ''H-adding'', sometimes occurs as a [[hypercorrection]] in typically H-dropping accents of English. It is commonly noted in literature from late [[Victorian times]] to the early 20th century that some lower-class people consistently drop ''h'' in words that should have it, while adding ''h'' to words that should not have it. An example from the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' is, "In [[Hertford|'Artford]], [[Hereford|'Ereford]], and [[Hampshire|'Ampshire]], [[hurricane|'urricanes]] 'ardly '''h'''ever 'appen". Another is in [[C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'': "Three cheers for the [[Empress|Hempress]] of [[Colney Hatch|Colney 'Atch]]". In practice, however, it would appear that ''h''-adding is more of a stylistic prosodic effect, being found on some words receiving particular emphasis, regardless of whether those words are h-initial or vowel-initial in the standard language.

Some English words borrowed from [[French language|French]] begin with the letter {{angbr|h}} but not with the sound {{IPA|/h/}}. Examples include ''hour'', ''heir'', ''hono(u)r'' and ''honest''. In some cases, [[spelling pronunciation]] has introduced the sound {{IPA|/h/}} into such words, as in ''humble'', ''hotel'' and (for most speakers) ''historic''. Spelling pronunciation has also added {{IPA|/h/}} to the [[British English]] pronunciation of ''herb'', {{IPA|/hɜːb/}}, while [[American English]] retains the older pronunciation {{IPA|/ɝb/}}. [[Etymology]] may also serve as a motivation for H-addition, as in the words ''horrible'', ''habit'' and ''harmony''; these were borrowed into Middle English from French without an /h/ (''orribel, abit, armonie''), but all three derive from Latin words with an /h/ and would later acquire an /h/ in English as an etymological "correction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/worldofwords/wordfrom/aitches/?view=uk |title=World of words - Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Askoxford.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the letter H itself, "aitch", is subject to H-insertion in some dialects, where it is pronounced "[[haitch]]". In [[Hiberno-English]], "[[haitch]]" is considered standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11642588 |title='Haitch' or 'aitch'? How do you pronounce 'H'? |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other languages==
Processes of H-dropping have occurred in various languages at certain times, and in some cases, they remain as distinguishing features between dialects, as in English. Some [[Dutch dialects]], especially the southern ones, feature H-dropping. The dialects of [[Zeeland]], [[West Flanders]] and [[North Brabant]] have lost /h/ as a phonemic consonant but use [h] to avoid hiatus and to signal emphasis, much as in the H-dropping dialects of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|h}}&lt;/ref&gt; H-dropping is also found in some [[North Germanic languages]], for instance [[Elfdalian]] and the dialect of [[Roslagen]], where it is found already in [[Old Norse#Old East Norse|Old East Norse]]. Loss or replacement of /h/ has also occurred in some dialects of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and other [[South Slavic languages]].

The phoneme /h/ in [[Ancient Greek]], occurring only at the beginnings of words and originally written with the letter H and later as a rough breathing, was lost in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialect. It is also not pronounced in [[Modern Greek]].

The phoneme /h/ was lost in [[Late Latin]], the ancestor of the modern [[Romance languages]]. Both [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] acquired new initial {{IPA|/h/}} in medieval times, but they were later lost in both languages in a "second round" of H-dropping. (However, some dialects of Spanish have reacquired {{IPA|/h/}} from Spanish {{IPA|/x/}} and Latin {{IPA|/f/}}.)

It is hypothesized in the [[laryngeal theory]] that the loss of [h] or similar sounds played a role in the early development of the [[Indo-European languages]].

[[File:Gullberg, Hjalmar i VJ 1943.jpg|thumb|Hjalmar Gullberg at his writing desk in the early 1940s.]]
'''Hjalmar Gullberg''' (30 May 1898 &amp;ndash; 19 July 1961) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer, [[poet]] and translator of Greek drama into [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

==Career==
Gullberg was born in [[Malmö]], [[Scania]].  As a student at [[Lund University]], he was the editor of the student magazine [[Lundagård (newspaper)|Lundagård]]. He was the manager of the [[Swedish Radio Theatre]] 1936-1950. In 1940 he was made a member of the [[Swedish Academy]], and he also became an [[honorary degree|honorary doctor]] of [[philosophy]] at Lund University (1944).

A poem from Gullberg's book ''Kärlek i tjugonde seklet'' from 1933, called "Förklädd gud" ("God in disguise"), was set to music by the composer [[Lars-Erik Larsson]] in 1940. The [[God in Disguise|resulting lyrical suite]] has become one of the most well-recognised and best loved pieces of Swedish music for choir and orchestra.&lt;ref name="forkladd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=4427&amp;grupp=18793&amp;artikel=2090685 |title=Förklädd gud med Helsingborgs Symfoniorkester |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |date=28 May 2008 |access-date=2 February 2015 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150203053108/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=4427&amp;grupp=18793&amp;artikel=2090685 |archivedate=3 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Gullberg had been suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]], which resulted during his last few years that he was bound to his bed. He had also been [[Tracheotomy|tracheotomized]], and was for long periods of time connected to a [[Medical ventilator|ventilator]]. He committed suicide on 19 July 1961 by drowning at Lake Yddingen in Scania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.svd.se/det-finns-en-sjo-och-sedan-aldrig-mer |newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |title=Det finns en sjö och sedan aldrig mer |first=Tommy |last=Olofsson |date=15 July 2011 |access-date=24 April 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">'''Indexing''' in reference to motion is moving (or being moved) into a new position or location quickly and easily but also precisely. When indexing a machine part, its new location is known to within a few hundredths of a millimeter (thousandths of an inch), or often even to within a few thousandths of a millimeter (ten-thousandths of an inch), despite the fact that no elaborate measuring or layout was needed to establish that location. In reference to multi-edge [[Cutting tool (machining)#Cutting tools with inserts (indexable tools)|cutting inserts]], indexing is the process of exposing a new cutting edge for use. Indexing is a necessary kind of motion in many areas of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[machining]]. A object that '''indexes''', or can be '''indexed''', is said to be '''indexable'''.

Usually when the word ''indexing'' is used, it refers specifically to [[rotation]]. That is, indexing is most often the quick and easy but precise rotation of a machine part through a certain known number of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]. For example, ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'', 25th edition, in its section on milling machine indexing,{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|pp=1873–1916}} says, "Positioning a workpiece at a precise angle or interval of rotation for a machining operation is called indexing."{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|p=1873}} In addition to that most classic sense of the word, the swapping of one part for another, or other controlled movements, are also sometimes referred to as ''indexing'', even if rotation is not the focus.

== Examples from everyday life ==

There are various examples of indexing that laypersons (non-engineers and non-machinists) can find in everyday life. These motions are not always called by the name ''indexing'', but the idea is essentially similar:
* The motion of pins inside a [[pin tumbler lock]], which the correct key can move quickly and easily but also rather precisely into [[:File:Pin tumbler with key.svg|the correct position]] to allow the lock's cylinder to turn
* Indexable driver bits for [[screwdriver]]s
* The motion of a retractable [[utility knife]] blade, which often will have well-defined discrete positions (fully retracted, ¼-exposed, ½-exposed, ¾-exposed, fully exposed)
* The indexing of a [[revolver]]'s [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]] with each shot

== Manufacturing applications==

Indexing is vital in [[manufacturing]], especially [[mass production]], where a well-defined cycle of motions must be repeated quickly and easily—but precisely—for each [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable part]] that is made. Without indexing capability, all manufacturing would have to be done on a craft basis, and interchangeable parts would have very high [[unit cost]] because of the time and skill needed to produce each unit. In fact, the evolution of modern technologies depended on the shift in methods from crafts (in which toolpath is controlled via operator skill) to indexing-capable toolpath control. A prime example of this theme was the development of the [[turret lathe]], whose turret indexes tool positions, one after another, to allow successive tools to move into place, take precisely placed cuts, then make way for the next tool. 

=== How indexing is achieved in manufacturing ===

Indexing capability is provided in two fundamental ways: with or without [[Information technology]] (IT).

==== Non-IT-assisted physical guidance ====

Non-IT-assisted physical guidance was the first means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the [[Industrial Revolution]] to progress into the [[Machine Age]]. It is achieved by [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by the very nature of their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are [[wikt:drill jig|drill jigs]], the turrets on manual [[turret lathe]]s, [[indexing head]]s for manual [[milling machine]]s, [[rotary table]]s, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than indexing heads, and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Harvnb|Bulgin|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although indexing heads of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.

==== IT-assisted physical guidance ====

IT-assisted physical guidance (for example, via [[Numerical control|NC]], [[CNC]], or [[robotics]]) has been developed since the [[World War II]] era and uses electromechanical and electrohydraulic [[servomechanism]]s to translate digital information into position control. These systems also ultimately physically limit the path for motion, as jigs and other purely mechanical means do; but they do it not simply through their own shape, but rather using changeable information.

An '''international variety''' is a [[grape variety]] that is widely planted in most of the major [[wine producing regions]] and has widespread appeal and [[consumer recognition]]. These are grapes that are highly likely to appear on [[wine label]]s as [[varietal]] wines and are often considered [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] for emerging [[wine]] industries. There is some criticism that the popularity of so-called international varieties comes at the price of a region's [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] varieties. The majority of declared international varieties are [[French (wine)|French]] in origin (most notably [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Chardonnay]]), though in recent years the popularity of [[Spanish (wine)|Spanish]] (such as [[Tempranillo]]) and [[Italian (wine)|Italian]] varietals (like [[Sangiovese]] and [[Nebbiolo]]) has seen an increase in worldwide plantings and these may also be considered "international varieties".&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 358"&gt; J. Robinson (ed.), ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'', Third Edition, p. 358, Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Classic varieties==
[[File:Merlot_Grape.jpg|left|thumb|Merlot grapes growing in the [[La Mancha (DO)|La Mancha]] region of Spain]]
Wine expert [[Karen MacNeil]] describes an international variety as a "classic variety" which has a long established reputation for making premium quality wines in locations across the globe. The origins for many of these grapes trace back to France which has had a [[History of French wine|long history]] of influencing global [[viticulture]] and [[winemaking]] thought. The nine classic international varieties that MacNeil lists are [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Chardonnay]], [[Chenin blanc]], [[Merlot]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Riesling]], [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Semillon]] and [[Syrah]].&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 48-59"&gt; K. MacNeil, ''The Wine Bible'', pp. 48–59, Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Other varieties==
As the wine industry expands across the globe, particularly in the [[New World (wine)|New World]], more varieties beyond the nine classic varieties listed above have been gaining recognition as "international varieties". These include French as well as Spanish, Italian and [[German (wine)|German]] varieties such as [[Muscat (wine)|Muscat]], [[Mourvedre]], [[Tempranillo]], [[Sangiovese]], [[Nebbiolo]], [[Gewürztraminer]], [[Pinot blanc]], [[Pinot gris]], [[Pinotage]] (South-Africa) and [[Viognier]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 358"/&gt;

==Noble grapes==
[[File:Central coast California Cab.jpg|right|thumb|A Californian Cabernet Sauvignon.]]
Noble grapes are any grapes traditionally associated with the highest quality wines. Noble grapes are said to retain their character no matter where they are planted. This concept is not as common today, partly because of the proliferation of [[hybrid grape]] varieties, and partly because some critics feel that it unfairly prioritizes varieties grown within [[France]]. Historically speaking, the noble grapes comprised only six varieties. The white noble grapes were [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Riesling]], and [[Chardonnay]]. The red noble grapes were [[Pinot noir]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], and [[Merlot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Koeppel, Fredric | title = Noble Grapes | publisher = [[Home &amp; Garden Television]] | date = 2007-12-06 | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/799/799046p1.html | accessdate=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer recognition==
The popularity and presence of international varieties in winemaking regions throughout the world have contributed to high levels of consumer recognition for some of these varieties that often appear on wine labels as varietal wines. The recognition is so great for varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay that many consumers believe these names are either wine regions or [[brand name]]s themselves.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 358"/&gt; Wine expert [[Frank Prial]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' notes that the name recognition of a grape like Chardonnay is so powerful that it "transcends the product or its producers".&lt;ref&gt;F. Prial "[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/19/dining/wine-talk-looking-beyond-cabs-and-pinots.html Wine Talk: Looking Beyond Cabs and Pinots]", ''New York Times'', September 19, 2001 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Columbia valley Chard.jpg|left|thumb|The familiar flavors and name recognition of Chardonnay have seen the variety pop up in regions throughout the world.]]
International varieties have been criticized as both a symbol and instigator of the [[globalization of wine]], in which local indigenous grape varieties are grubbed up in favor of the big names demanded by international markets. In the late 20th century, during the "Chardonnay-boom", vineyards throughout the world and particularly in emerging wine industries rushed to plant acres of Chardonnay in order to capture some of the market. Examples of this occurred in south Italy and Spain where ancient [[Negroamaro]], [[Primitivo]], [[Grenache]] and [[Mataro (grape)|Mataro]] vineyards were ripped up in favor of new Chardonnay plantings.&lt;ref name="Clarke pg 63-73 &amp; 119"&gt; Oz Clarke, ''Encyclopedia of Grapes'', pp. 63–73, 119, Harcourt Books, 2001, {{ISBN|0-15-100714-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a backlash of sorts against not only Chardonnay, but also other international varieties. Wine expert [[Oz Clarke]] described a view of Chardonnay in this light as "...the ruthless coloniser and destroyer of the world's vineyards and the world's palates."

Even within the industry, there are protests against the trend of planting international varieties at the expense of local varieties with winemakers such as the [[Languedoc (wine)|Languedoc]] producer [[Aimé Guibert]] comparing the trend to "burning [[cathedrals]]".&lt;ref&gt;J. Lichfield, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-filmmaker-who-took-on-the-wine-world-532204.html The film-maker who took on the wine world]", ''The Independent'', November 6, 2004 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ismail Ahmedani''' (1930–2007) (اسماعیل احمدانی) was a [[Saraiki people|Saraiki]] novelist, fiction writer, and promoter of the Saraiki language. He was born 1 January 1930 in a small village "Khoi" in [[Rajanpur District]], [[British India]] (now [[Pakistan]]). His father Muhammad Moosa Khan was a famous writer and teacher. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in art from [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] after which Ismail Ahmedani started his life as a teacher from Bahawal pur  and then Khan pur district Rahim Yar Khan. After getting his LL.B from [[Sindh]] University in Hyder Abad [[Pakistan]] he started his legal practice in Sanghar [[Sindh]]. Firstly he began to write in [[Urdu]]. Sometimes he wrote in his mother tongue [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]]. He wrote some poems in Saraiki but later he decided to write prose. He wrote several symbolic fictions. He wrote two novels named ''Cholian'' (waves) and ''Amar Khani'' (living story) He was awarded [[Khwaja Ghulam Farid]] award by the [[Pakistan Academy of Letters]] on ''Chholian''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} He wrote a travelogue named ''Peet de Pandh'' (travel of love)&lt;ref name="peetworldcatlisting"&gt;worldcat listing at http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18673065?tab=details#tabs&lt;/ref&gt; and won an award for this writing. He wrote several articles on legendary Saraiki poet Khawaja Farid  and also several articles about Saraiki language and linguistics. He was a critic of Saraiki literature and wrote several articles on this topic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} He wrote his autobiography named ''Yadden De Kak Muhal'' (places of memories). In 2013 he was again awarded the Khwaja Ghulam Farid award for literature in the Saraiki language for this autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Amir Jalil Bobra, [https://search.proquest.com/central/results/8A02C68562854F67PQ PAL confers awards on literary figures]. The Nation; Lahore, Pakistan [[Lahore, Pakistan]] 19 Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had two sons and six daughters. His elder son's name is Sarmad Moosa Laghari and younger son's name is Asad Moosa Laghari. Sarmad Moosa Laghari is the Manager in PTCL Karachi. Ahmedani spent 35 years in Sanghar, Sindh [Pakistan]. After that  he went back to his own village, [[Rasoolpur]], where he spent seven years. Due to his poor health, he went back to Sindh [[Karachi]]. There he spent three years.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Ismail Ahmedani died  at Karachi on 6 June 2007 and was buried in his village Rasoolpur. The cause of his death was a heart attack.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

'''Jru' ''' ({{IPA-xx|ɟruʔ|IPA}}) is a [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer language]] of the [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch spoken in southern Laos.&lt;ref name=Jacq2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jacq |first1=Pascale |year=2004 |title=The Development of a Lao-based orthography for Jrù |journal=Mon-Khmer Studies Journal |volume=34 |issue= |pages=97–112 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/jacq2004development.pdf |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also known as "Loven", "Laven" or "Boloven" from the [[Lao language|Laotian]] exonym ''Laven'' or ''Loven'', which is derived from the [[Khmer language|Khmer]] name for the [[Boloven Plateau]]. The Jru' people engage in coffee and [[cardamom]] cultivation, as well as other agricultural activities.

==Classification==
Jru' is a variety of [[Laven language|Laven]] which belongs to the Western branch of the Bahnaric languages which also includes such languages as [[Brao language|Brao]].

==Geographical distribution==
Jru' is the native language of the Jru' people, a [[Lao Theung|hill tribe]] indigenous to the isolated mountains in [[Champasak Province|Champasak]], [[Sekong Province|Sekong]] and [[Attapeu Province]]s in the central part of extreme southern Laos.&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt; The variety described here is the most-studied variety that is spoken in [[Paksong District]], Champasak in the towns of [[Paksong]], [[Houeikong]], [[Tateng]], and various nearby villages.

==Phonology==
The sounds and syllable structure of Jru' are typical of the West Bahnaric languages in general. Words are mostly monosyllabic although a few words have [[minor syllable|minor pre-syllables]], retaining the classic Mon-Khmer sesquisyllabic structure. The [[register (phonology)|register]] contrast seen in other Mon-Khmer languages has not been found in Jru' and, in contrast to the surrounding [[prestige language]], Lao, Jru' has not developed phonemic [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]].&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt;

===Consonants===
Similar to the other Mon-Khmer languages of the region, Jru' ditinguishes five places of articulation in its consonant inventory and the stops can be either voiced, unvoiced or (unvoiced) aspirated. The consonants are given below in IPA as laid out by Jacq.&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt;

===Vowels===
The vowels of Jru' inherited from Proto-Mon-Khmer show three vowel heights and three tongue positions, or amount of "backness". An innovation in which Jru' developed a rounding contrast in the open-mid back vowels, results in ten vowel positions. All ten also show a length contrast, giving a total of 20 monophthongs. Unlike other languages in the Southeast Asian [[sprachbund]], the length contrast is not between short and long, but between "regular" and "extra short".&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt;

Jru' additionally has three diphthongs {{IPA|/ia/}}, {{IPA|/ɨə/}}, and {{IPA|/ua/}}.  The diphthongs {{IPA|/ie/}} and {{IPA|/uo/}} are also found in certain environments as allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=Jacq2001&gt;Jacq, Pacale. ''A Description of Jruq (Loven): a Mon-Khmer language of the Lao PDR''. Doctoral Dissertation. Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllable structure===
The maximal monosyllable is represented as (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(R)V(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is any voiceless consonant, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is any consonant except one identical to C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (or R if present), R is {{IPA|/r/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}, V is any vowel or diphthong and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is any consonant except a voiced or aspirated stop. The components in parentheses are not present in all words.&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacq2001/&gt;

The maximal sesquisyllabic word structure is represented C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;əC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(R)V(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}, V is any vowel or diphthong and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is any consonant except a voiced or aspirated stop.&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacq2001/&gt;

==Writing system==
As is the situation with most of the Mon-Khmer languages, Jru' has no indigenous writing system. However, at different points in history, various existing scripts including [[Quốc ngữ]] and [[Lao script|Lao]] have been used or modified to transcribe the sounds of the language for study.&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt; During the [[Ong Keo|Ong Keo Rebellion]] of the early 1900s, in which the Mon-Khmer hill tribes of the region joined together to resist French and Lao rule, [[Ong Kommandam]], a speaker of the closely related [[Alak language]], invented a complicated script called [[Khom script|''Khom'']] that was used for a time to write Jru'.&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacq2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=sidwell2008&gt;Sidwell, P 2008, 'The Khom script of the Kommodam Rebellion', International Journal of the sociology of language, vol. 2008, no. 192, pp. 15-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, linguist Pascale Jacq, with the help of native speakers, has devised an orthography based on the Lao script in an attempt to provide Jru' speakers a standardized method with which to write their language.&lt;ref name=Jacq2004/&gt; Jacq's orthography is currently being used to compile a Jru'-Lao-English-French dictionary.

The '''Kunama language''' has been included in the proposed [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language family]], though it is distantly related to the other languages, if at all. Kunama is spoken by the [[Kunama people]] of western [[Eritrea]] and just across the [[Ethiopia]]n border. The language has several dialects including: Barka, Marda, Aimara, Odasa, Tika, Lakatakura, Sokodasa, Takazze-Selit and Tigray. [[Ilit language|Ilit]] and [[Bitama language|Bitama]] are not mutually intelligible and so may be considered distinct languages.

This article outlines the legislative chronology concerning the use of [[official language]]s in [[Belgium]].

==1830: Freedom of languages and linguistic correction==
A factor in the [[Belgian Revolution]] of the 1830s was the rising dominance of the [[Dutch language]] in the [[Southern Provinces|southern provinces]] of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Dutch period (1815 - 1830)| accessdate=2010-08-02| url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/country/history/before_1830/dutch_period/index.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conflict arose between the citizenry of the [[Flanders|Flemish]] provinces who wished to engage with the authorities in Dutch, and the largely francophone aristocracy of the southern provinces which became modern-day Belgium.

While the [[Belgian Constitution]] guaranteed "freedom of languages", in practice the authorities, including government institutions such as the courts, were dominated by the French-speaking upper classes, and operated in French.&lt;ref name="Vande Lanotte p21–22"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vande Lanotte| first1=Johan| last2=Goedertier |first2=Geert| title=Overzicht publiekrecht|trans-title=Outline public law| year=2007| publisher=die Keure| location=[[Brugge]] | language=Dutch| isbn=978-90-8661-397-7| pages=21–22| lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect this bias disadvantaged the largely [[Flemish]] North and, to a lesser degree, the [[Walloons]] of the South and the mainly [[German language|German-]] or [[Luxembourgish]]-speaking environs of [[Arlon]]). As universal education developed in Belgium, the French language was initially the sole medium of instruction,&lt;ref name="Vande Lanotte p22–24"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vande Lanotte| first1=Johan| last2=Goedertier |first2=Geert| title=Overzicht publiekrecht|trans-title=Outline public law| year=2007| publisher=die Keure| location=Brugge| language=Dutch| isbn=978-90-8661-397-7| pages=22–24| lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; alienating the northern half of the country. There was a similar sense of alienation in other areas such as justice as the trial and conviction of two Flemish labourers, [[Jan Coucke and Pieter Goethals]] in 1860 demonstrated. The pair were sentenced to death for the murder of a widow without having understood one single word of their trial,&lt;ref name="Vande Lanotte p23"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vande Lanotte| first1=Johan| last2=Goedertier |first2=Geert| title=Overzicht publiekrecht|trans-title=Outline public law| year=2007| publisher=die Keure| location=Brugge| language=Dutch| isbn=978-90-8661-397-7| page=23| lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were then found to be innocent after they were executed.

The [[Flemish Movement]] started to advocate for language legislation that would recognise Dutch as an official language.

==1873: First law on the use of languages==
The first law on the use of languages was voted on in 1873, perhaps influenced by growing public dissent occasioned by cases such as the 1872 case of Jozef Schoep. He refused to pay a fine of 50 francs for not wanting to declare the birth of his son to the municipal administration of [[Molenbeek-Saint-Jean|Molenbeek]] in French only to be convicted after an appeal in [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Cassation]].&lt;ref name="Vande Lanotte p23"/&gt; This and other cases provoked discussions about the use of languages, and the first law on the use of languages, supported by [[Edward Coremans]], regulated the use of languages in the courts in [[Flanders]].

Dutch became the major language in Flanders, but oral testimony and penal action were still permitted in French.&lt;ref name="Vande Lanotte p22–23"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vande Lanotte| first1=Johan| last2=Goedertier |first2=Geert| title=Overzicht publiekrecht|trans-title=Outline public law| year=2007| publisher=die Keure| location=Brugge| language=Dutch| isbn=978-90-8661-397-7| pages=22–23| lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1878: Second law on the use of languages==
The second law on the use of languages in 1878 regulated the use of language in the administrations of Flanders and [[Brussels]]. Announcements to the public by government officials had to be made in either Dutch or in both languages. Correspondence with municipalities or persons would be in Dutch unless a person expressed a wish to be engaged in French&lt;ref name="Vande Lanotte p24"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vande Lanotte| first1=Johan| last2=Goedertier |first2=Geert| title=Overzicht publiekrecht|trans-title=Outline public law| year=2007| publisher=die Keure| location=Brugge| language=Dutch| isbn=978-90-8661-397-7| page=24| lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in reality the law in daily life was hardly applied: Flemish citizens were still obliged to speak French in their communications with the administration because most civil servants were [[Monolingualism|monoglots]] who either spoke only French&lt;ref name="Vande Lanotte p25"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vande Lanotte| first1=Johan| last2=Goedertier |first2=Geert| title=Overzicht publiekrecht|trans-title=Outline public law| year=2007| publisher=die Keure| location=Brugge| language=Dutch| isbn=978-90-8661-397-7| page=25| lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; or refused to use the Dutch language.

==1883: Third law on the use of languages==
Until 1883, education in [[secondary school]]s had been entirely in French. The third law on the use of languages was voted on in order to introduce bilingual education.&lt;ref name="Vande Lanotte p22–24"/&gt;

==1898: Law on Equality==
{{main|Coremans-De Vriendt law}}
In 1898, the Law on Equality was introduced. Dutch and French were now to be regarded as co-equal official languages but native French speakers in parliament, unwilling to learn or use Dutch, were either unable or unwilling to read the Dutch texts they were supposed to vote on. The reverse was not the case: Dutch speakers were obliged to learn French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.be/handann/S0005/S00051675/S00051675.pdf| title=Séance du 26 janvier 1897| pages=213–214| language=French|trans-title=Session of 26 January 1897| format=PDF| accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Nevertheless, under pressure from the general population, the law was passed, largely due to the extension of [[suffrage]] to every male citizen aged 25 and above which increased the number of Flemish voters, and the introduction of [[plural voting]] in 1893 which allowed some eligible voters to cast more than one vote.

==1921: A bilingual nation or languages linked to a region==
Disagreement over the country's language policy continued. Some segments of French-speaking [[Wallonia]] were concerned that current practices could result in Belgium becoming a [[bilingual]] country, with French and Dutch being recognised as official languages everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alen| first=André| title=Le fédéralisme. Approches politique, économique et juridique|trans-title=Federalism. Political, economic and legal perspective| year=1994| publisher=De Boeck Université| location=Brussels| language=French| isbn=2-8041-1921-1| pages=140| lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This led to a proposal to split the administration in Belgium to preserve the French-speaking nature of Wallonia and to avoid the possibility that French-speaking civil servants there might have to pass a Dutch language examination.

This implied a choice: should Belgium become a bilingual country or a country with two language regions? This was expressed in two alternatives:
* [[Personality principle]]: All citizes have the freedom to address the authorities in any of the Belgian languages they so choose, regardless of their region of residence.
* [[Territoriality principle]]: The official language in a particular region follows restricted language boundaries, which means that the language of the region is the one in which all official dealings with the authorities will take place.&lt;ref&gt;Stefaan van der Jeught, Territoriality and freedom of language: the case of Belgium, Current Issues in Language Planning (2016), https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14664208.2016.1243883 &lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1921, the principle of territoriality was chosen, confirmed by further legislation with landmark laws passed in 1932 and 1962.

The language areas were outlined according to the principle of the language of the majority of the population, and a provision in the 1932 law determined that a language [[census]] should be conducted every ten years: a municipality could change its linguistic status only according to the findings of the census.

This more flexible approach opened the possibility of minorities representing a minimum 30% of the local population being able to obtain services in their native, or chosen, language.

==1962: Establishment of the language areas and facilities==
A 1962 law determined which municipality belonged to what [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language area]]. Each Belgian municipality is restricted to one language area, of which there are four: Dutch, French, German, and the bilingual area Brussels-Capital that includes the Belgian capital city and eighteen surrounding municipalities.

From then on, modifications of the linguistic regime would be possible only after changing the law, which required a majority of each language community. In that same year, the municipality of [[Voeren|Voeren (Fourons)]] went to the Dutch-speaking province of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], and [[Comines-Warneton|Comines (Komen)]] and [[Mouscron|Mouscron (Moeskroen)]] to the French-speaking province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]]. These and several other municipalities obtained [[Municipalities with language facilities|facilities]] for the minority language group.

In a municipality with a minority speaking another official language, facilities were provided for registered residents speaking it. For example, education in an alternative official language was made available as long as sixteen or more parents requested its provision. (However a resident of a municipality has no such rights in any neighbouring municipality.)

To benefit from these facilities, they must be asked for by the person concerned. This raised the issue of whether the facilities had to be requested on each and every occasion or whether a single request conferred a blanket benefit. In 1997 the [[Peeters directive]] required that inhabitants of such municipalities must request such facilities in their chosen language on each and every occasion they want to enjoy that right. This led to a crisis in Voeren surrounding the mayor, [[José Happart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martens |first1=Wilfried |title=De Memoires: luctor et emergo |trans-title=Memoires: luctor et emergo |year=2006 |publisher=Lannoo |location=Tielt |language=Dutch |isbn=978-90-209-6520-9 |pages=402–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests raised by French-speakers before the European Court of Human Rights [[ECtHR]] were mostly unsuccessful (e.g.[[Belgian Linguistics Case]]), a number of institutions such as the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] obtained authorisation to become bilingual.

==1970: insertion of the language areas into the Constitution==
In 1970, on the completion of the first state reform, four language areas were established by Article 4 of the Constitution. Since then the language affiliation of municipalities can be changed only by [[special law]].

At the same time [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Communities|language communities]] were established, with the Flemish and French Community being responsible for the regulation of the use of languages in their language area in the areas of administration, education, and for interactions between employers and their workforce.

==The present day==
Currently the language used by the Belgian authorities, administration, education, businesses, and the army is determined by the courts. The constitutional right of ''freedom of language'' remains intact and absolute only in the home, leading to ongoing tensions in [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]].

=== Railways Information ===
[[File:Tweetaligheid in Brussel.jpg|thumb|Bilingual information at a railway station in Brussels]]
The [[National Railway Company of Belgium]]'s policy is to provide information on the train in the language of the region. For example, on a train travelling from [[Antwerp]] to [[Charleroi]], announcements are made first in Dutch (in the [[Flemish Region]]), then in French and Dutch (in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]]), again in Dutch and finally in French in Wallonia. This requires rail travellers be conversant with the name of their destination in both languages (though on-board ticket inspectors are bound to respond in either language).

In and around international stations, such as the [[Brussels Airport]], Dutch and French announcements are supplemented by announcements in German and English.

=== Road signs ===

As mentioned above, road signs are required to give destinations only in the local language, requiring travellers to recognise their ultimate and intermediate destinations in multiple languages. For example, on the Belgian portion of the [[European route E40|E40 motorway]], westbound travellers to [[Liège]] are directed to ''Lüttich'' and eastbound travellers are directed to ''Luik'', but signs near the city itself refer only to ''Liège''.

[[Swedish Language|Swedish]] is the official language of [[Sweden]] and is spoken by the vast majority of the 10 million inhabitants of the country. It is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] and quite similar to its sister [[Scandinavian languages]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], with which it maintains partial mutual intelligibility and forming a [[Dialect continuum#North Germanic continuum|dialect continuum]].

== History ==
For most of its history, Sweden was a larger country than today. At its height in 1658, the [[Swedish Empire]] comprised the territories of what is Finland and Estonia as well as parts of Russia, Latvia, Germany, Denmark and Norway. Hence, Sweden's linguistic landscape has historically been very different from that of today.
[[File:Tyska kyrkan Fürchtet Gott.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sign in German outside the [[German Church, Stockholm]]]]

Swedish evolved from [[Old Norse]] around the 14th and 15th century, and historically, the Swedish dialects were generally much more different than today. Since the 20th century [[Standard Swedish]] prevails throughout the country. The [[Scandinavian languages]] constitute a [[dialectal continuum]] and some of the traditional [[Swedish dialects]] could equally be described as [[Danish dialects|Danish]] ([[Scanian dialects|Scanian]]) or [[Norwegian dialects|Norwegian]] ([[Jamtlandic dialects|Jamtlandic]]).

[[Finnish language|Finnish]] was the majority language of Sweden's eastern parts, though it was used almost exclusively as a spoken language. These areas were also home of a significant [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking minority]]. Finnish became a minority language in the west as well since many Finnish speakers migrated there (mostly for economic reasons).

[[Estonian language|Estonian]] was the language of the majority in [[Swedish Estonia]] but the province, like Finland hosted a [[Estonian Swedes|Swedish-speaking minority]] and also a more significant minority of [[Baltic Germans|Germans]].

In medieval Sweden, the [[Middle Low German|Low German language]] had a very important role as a commercial language and the lingua franca of the [[Hanseatic league]]. As such, the Low German language influenced Swedish and other languages in the region considerably. In medieval [[Stockholm]], half of the population were Low German speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stp.ling.uu.se/~mikaela/WORDDOKUMENT/Stockholm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012529/http://stp.ling.uu.se/~mikaela/WORDDOKUMENT/Stockholm.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Low German was also the language spoken in the 17th-century Swedish territories in northern Germany i.e. [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Bremen-Verden]], [[Wismar]] and [[Wildeshausen]] (as well as the rest of northern Germany) and by the [[Baltic Germans|German minority]] in Estonia and [[Swedish Livonia]]. Livonia was also inhabited by [[Latvians]], [[Estonians]] and [[Livonians]].

In [[Swedish Ingria]], apart from Swedish also Finnish, [[Ingrian language|Ingrian]] and [[Votian language|Votian]] were spoken.

[[Latin language|Latin]] as the language of the Catholic Church was introduced in Sweden with the [[Christianization of Sweden|Christianisation]], around AD 1000. As in most of [[Europe]], [[Latin language|Latin]] remained the [[lingua franca]] and scholarly language of the educated communities for centuries in Sweden. For instance, [[Carl Linnaeus]]' most famous work [[Systema Naturae]], published in 1735, was written in Latin.

During the 18th century, [[French language|French]] was the second language of Europe's upper classes and Sweden was no exception. The Swedish aristocracy often spoke French among themselves and [[code-switching]] between French and Swedish was common. The Swedish King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] was a true [[Francophile]] and French was the common language at his court.

Gradually Sweden lost its overseas possessions and obtained its current borders in 1809, when it lost its eastern part ([[Finland]]) to the [[Russian Empire]]. As a consequence, Sweden became a rather homogeneous country with the exceptions of the indigenous Sami-people and the Finnish-speaking [[Tornedalians]] in the northernmost parts of the country.

During the 19th century Sweden became more industrialised, resulting in important demographic changes. The population duplicated and people moved from the countryside to towns and cities. As a consequence, of this and factors such as generalised education and mass media, the traditional dialects began to give room for the standard language ([[Standard Swedish]]). A large number of Swedes also decided to emigrate, [[Swedish emigration to the United States|especially to the United States]]. There, the Swedes came in contact with the [[English language]]. Since then, as in the rest of Europe and much of the world, English has grown as an important foreign language in Sweden, especially since the allied victory in [[World War II]].

During the second half of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, Sweden has received great numbers of immigrants who speak languages other than Swedish (see: Immigrant languages below). It is unclear to what degree these communities will hold on to their languages and to what degree they will assimilate.

==Swedish==
[[Image:Distribution-sv.png|thumb|Map showing the Swedish speaking areas of Scandinavia and Finland]]
The Kingdom of Sweden is a [[nation-state]] for the [[Swedish people]],{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} and as such, their national language is held in very high regard. Of Sweden's roughly ten million people, almost all speak Swedish as at least a second language, and the majority as a first language (7,825,000, according to SIL's [[Ethnologue]]). Swedish is also an official language in [[Finland]] where it is spoken by a large number of [[Swedish-speaking Finns]]. The language is also spoken to some degree by [[Swedish people|ethnic Swedes]] living outside Sweden, for example, just over half a million people of Swedish descent in the United States speak the language, according to Ethnologue.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Dialects===

A number of [[Swedish dialects]] exist, some of which are divergent enough from standard Swedish to be considered separate languages.

====Westrobothnian====

{{main|Westrobothnian}}
Westrobothnian is a common name used to refer to a number of closely related Germanic, North Germanic languages spoken in historical Westrobothnia (modern coastal areas of Westrobothnia and Norrbotten) bordering areas with speakers of Sami to the west, Meänkeli Finnish to the north, Jamtlandic to the south-west and dialects of national standard Swedish to the south. Like other Scandinavian languages, all different forms of Westrobothnian originate in Proto-Norse and dialects of Old Norse that started diverging as distinct languages during the Viking Age. Dialects differ greatly between different areas and the language has traditionally merely been a spoken language since no standard spelling was available. The following cities and surrounding villages have a traditionally Westrobothnian speaking population: Piteå, Skellefteå, Umeå, Luleå and Kalix.

====Dalecarlian====
{{main|Elfdalian}}
The Dalecarlian (Elfdalian) dialect group is highly divergent, even within itself, so that speakers of separate sub-dialects do not always understand each other. Dialects of this group are spoken in the northern parts of the province of [[Dalarna]], especially in the [[Älvdalen Municipality]], by a population of 1,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=dlc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323231727/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=dlc |archivedate=2007-03-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern Gutnish====
{{main|Modern Gutnish}}
Modern Gutnish exists as a spoken language in [[Gotland]] and [[Fårö]]. It is an open issue whether modern Gutnish is to be considered an independent language or a Scandinavian dialect. It derives, however, from Old Gutnish, which is indisputably a separate branch of the Old Norse language family.

====Jamtlandic====
{{main|Jamtlandic}}
[[Image:FC-Jämtland, Sweden.png|thumb|right|75px|The province of Jämtland]]
Spoken mainly in [[Jämtland]], but with a scattered speaker population throughout the rest of Sweden, Jamtlandic or Jamska is a [[North Germanic languages|West Scandinavian language]] with 95% lexical similarity to Norwegian and Swedish, but generally more archaic. It has a native speaker population of 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=jmk |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212081641/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=jmk |archivedate=2007-02-12 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

====Scanian====
{{main|l1=Scanian|Scanian dialects}}
[[Image:FC-Skåne, Sweden.png|thumb|left|75px|The Swedish province of Scania.]]
Spoken in the Swedish province of [[Scania]] (''Skåne'' in Swedish), the [[Scanian dialects|Scanian dialect]] is considered by some to be a dialect of [[Danish language|Danish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=scy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303225438/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=scy |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; and a related dialect is also spoken in [[Bornholm]], where it is called "East Danish" (Scania was part of the kingdom of Denmark until 1658). The variety generally spoken today is heavily influenced by standard Swedish.

==Recognised minority languages==
{{main|Minority languages of Sweden}}

In 1999, the Minority Language Committee of Sweden formally declared five minority languages of Sweden: Finnish, Meänkieli (also known as Tornedal, Tornionlaaksonsuomi or Tornedalian), the Sami languages, Romani, and Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy'', 3(2), 181-201. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish===
{{main|Sweden Finns}}
[[Image:Finsktalande södra sverige.png|thumb|right|300px|Areas with Finnish speaking population in per cent, in southern Sweden, 2005]]
Today there are about 470,000 [[Finnish Language|Finnish]]-speakers in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=185&amp;artikel=2797781|title=Tilastojen kertomaa: RUOTSINSUOMALAISET 2009 - Sisuradio|website=Sverigesradio.se|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finnish Language|Finnish]], a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language, has long been spoken in Sweden (the same holds true for Swedish in Finland, ''see [[Finland-Swedes]], [[Åland]]''), as Finland was part of the Swedish kingdom for centuries. Ethnic Finns (mainly first and second generation immigrants) constitute up to 5% of the population of Sweden. A high concentration of Finnish-speakers (some 16,000) resides in [[Norrbotten]].

===Meänkieli===
{{main|Meänkieli}}
Meänkieli is also a Finnic language. Spoken by the [[Tornedalians|Tornedalian people]], it is so closely related to Finnish that they are mutually intelligible, and is sometimes considered a dialect of Finnish. Meänkieli is mainly used in the municipalities of [[Gällivare]], [[Haparanda]], [[Kiruna]], [[Pajala]] and [[Övertorneå]], all of which lie in the [[Torne Valley]]. Between 40,000 and 70,000 people speak Meänkieli as their first language.

===Sami===
{{main|Sami languages}}
[[Image:Sami languages large.png|thumb|right|150px|Map showing the area there the Sami languages are traditionally spoken]]
The [[Sami people]] (formerly known as Lapps) are a people indigenous to all of northern [[Scandinavia]] (see [[Sápmi (area)]]) who speak a closely related group of languages usually grouped together under the name "Sami", but at least three separate Sami languages are spoken in Sweden. They are, like Finnish and Meänkieli, Uralic. Prolonged exposure to Germanic-language-speaking neighbors in Sweden and Norway causes them to have a large number of Germanic loanwords not normally found in other Uralic languages like Finnish, [[Estonian Language|Estonian]], or [[Hungarian Language|Hungarian]]. Between 15,000 and 20,000 Sami people live in Sweden of whom 9,000 are Sami-language speakers. Worldwide, between 20,000 and 40,000 people speak Sami languages (most Sami now speak Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, or Russian as their first language, depending on the country in which they reside). In Sweden, the largest concentrations of Sami-language-speaking Sami are found in the municipalities of [[Arjeplog]], [[Gällivare]], [[Jokkmokk]] and [[Kiruna]], and its immediate neighbourhood.

===Romani===
{{main|Romani language}}
Romani (also known as the Romani Chib) is the language spoken by the [[Romani people]], a nomadic ethnic group originating in northern [[India]]. Due to the geographic origins of its speakers, Romani is an [[Indo-Aryan language]], closely related to languages spoken in modern-day India, and sometimes written with an Indic Script (see [[Romani writing systems]]). Around 90% of Sweden's Romani people speak Romani, meaning that there are approximately 9,500 Chib speakers. In Sweden, there is no major geographic center for Romani like there is for Finnish, Sami, or Meänkieli, but it is considered to be of historical importance by the Swedish government, and as such the government is seen as having an obligation to preserve them, a distinction also held by Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manskligarattigheter.gov.se/dynamaster/file_archive/050216/24a99c86fd734f15c9f722b343cc152e/FaktaJu%5f0415ji.pdf|format=PDF|title=אַ סך-הכּל פֿון דער פּאָליטיק פֿון דער|website=Manskligarattigheter.org|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yiddish===
[[Image:Jidische.Folkschtime.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The first issue of ''Jidische Folkschtime'' (Yiddish People's Voice), a Yiddish-language newspaper first published in Stockholm, 12 January 1917]]
{{main|l1=Yiddish in Sweden|History of the Jews in Sweden#Status of Yiddish in Sweden}}
[[Yiddish]] is a [[Germanic language]] with significant Hebrew and Slavic influence, written with a variant of the Hebrew Alphabet (see [[Yiddish orthography]]) and, formerly, spoken by most [[Ashkenazic Jews]] (although most now speak the language of the country in which they live). Although the Jewish population of Sweden was traditionally [[Sephardic]], after the 18th century, Ashkenazic immigration began, and the immigrants brought with them their Yiddish language (See [[History of the Jews in Sweden]]). Like Romani, it is seen by the government to be of historical importance. The organisation ''Sällskapet för Jiddisch och Jiddischkultur i Sverige'' (Society for Yiddish and Yiddish Culture in Sweden) has over 200 members, many of whom are mother-tongue Yiddish speakers, and arranges regular activities for the speech community and in external advocacy of the Yiddish language.

As of 2009, the Jewish population in Sweden was estimated at around 20,000. Out of these 2,000-6,000 claim to have at least some knowledge of Yiddish according to various reports and surveys. The number of native speakers among these has been estimated by linguist Mikael Parkvall to be 750-1,500. It is believed that virtually all native speakers of Yiddish in Sweden today are adults, and most of them elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mikael Parkvall|title=''Sveriges språk.

===Swedish Sign Language===
{{main|Swedish Sign Language}}
[[Swedish Sign Language]] is an officially recognized minority language.

==Foreign languages==
[[File:Foreign languages in Sweden.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Knowledge of foreign languages in Sweden, in per cent of the population aged 15 and above, 2005.

Of these 35% had a very good knowledge of the language, 42% had a good knowledge and 23% had basic English skills (p. 156).&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Since the [[Middle Ages]] until the end of [[World War II]], [[Germany]] was usually the country outside Scandinavia having the closest cultural, commercial and political relations with [[Sweden]]. Thus, study of the [[German language]] had always been promoted by the Swedish state as the main foreign language. Many of Sweden's administrative and social institutions, including the education system, had also been organised along the German and Prussian model, as a lot of Swedish pioneering intellectuals of the Seventeenth century had been educated in German universities.  This changed after the end of the Second World War, when it was no longer acceptable to emphasise a closer link with defeated Germany.
A majority of Swedes, especially those born after [[World War II]], are able to understand and speak [[English language|English]] thanks to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong American influence, especially in regards to arts and culture, and the tradition of [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films. English, whether in American, [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] (Australian, Canadian, and [[New Zealand|Kiwi]]), or British dialects, became a compulsory subject for [[Secondary education|secondary school]] students studying [[natural science]]s as early as 1849 and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since 1952, when it replaced [[German language|German]] as the compulsory language subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject from [[third grade|third]] until [[ninth grade]], and all students continuing in secondary school study English for at least another year. Most students also learn one and sometimes two additional languages; the most popular being [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. From the autumn semester 2014, [[Mandarin Chinese]] is proposed as a fourth additional language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lararnasnyheter.se/lararnas-tidning/2012/12/03/kinesiska-infors-sprakval Kinesiska införs som språkval], Lärarnas Tidning, 2012-12-03 (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] is, at times, also taught as part of the Swedish course taught to native speakers of Swedish to emphasize differences and similarities between the languages.

There is currently an ongoing debate among linguists whether English should be considered a foreign language, [[second language]] or transcultural language in Sweden (and the other Scandinavian countries)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sprakforsvaret.se/sf/fileadmin/PDF/Parkvall_spraakstatistik.pdf Sveriges språk, vem talar vad och var] Mikael Parkvall, Stockholm University p.100 Men är engelska verkligen ett främmande språk?&lt;/ref&gt; due to its widespread use in education&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.

''Language Problems and Language Planning'', 34(2), 158-181. &lt;/ref&gt; This has also triggered opposition: in 2002 the Swedish government proposed an action plan to strengthen the status of Swedish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/108/a/1443|title=Government.se|first=Regeringen och|last=Regeringskansliet|date=20 September 2017|website=Regeringskansliet|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2005). A case of prestige and status planning: Swedish and English in Sweden. ''Current Issues in Language Planning'', 6(1), 73-79.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 Swedish was announced the official language of the country for the first time in its history.  In 2013, for the second year in a row, Swedes were ranked as best in the world at speaking English by the language proficiency company [[EF English First]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20131107/swedes-ranked-again-best-world-english|title=Swedes 'best in the world' at English - again|date=2013-11-07|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en|website=Thelocal.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigrant languages==
{{Further|Immigration to Sweden}}

Like many developed European countries from the late 1940s to the 1970s, Sweden has received tens of thousands of guest workers from countries in Southern Europe and the Middle East (i.e. [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[Iraq]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Spain]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], and the former [[Yugoslavia]]). Second and third-generation Swedes of Southern European or Middle Eastern descent have adopted Swedish as their main tongue, or in addition to their immigrant languages, such as [[Arabic]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]/[[Serbian language|Serbian]]/[[Croatian language|Croatian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. However, the criteria in [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] state that minority languages need a long history in the country to receive the classification, and thus, these languages have not come into question.

[[Tanzania]] is a [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] country. There are many languages spoken in the country, but no one language is spoken natively by a majority or a large plurality of the population. The [[Bantu language|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]] and [[English language|English]], the latter of which was inherited from colonial rule (''see [[Tanganyika Territory]]''), are widely spoken as [[lingua franca]]s.  They serve as working languages in the country, with Swahili being the official national language. &lt;ref name="tzgov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tanzania Profile|url=https://tanzania.go.tz/home/pages/68|website=Tanzania Gov|publisher=Tanzanian Government|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more speakers of Swahili than of English in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/tz/languages/|title=Tanzania|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0075, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Einheimisches Mädchen.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]] written in the [[Arabic script]] on the clothes of a [[Tanzania]]n woman (early 1900s).]]
According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are a total of 126 [[language]]s spoken in Tanzania. Two are institutional, 18 are developing, 58 are vigorous, 40 are endangered, and 8 are dying. There are also three languages that recently became extinct.&lt;ref name="Ethnltz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tanzania|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/TZ|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most languages spoken locally belong to two broad language families: [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] ([[Bantu languages|Bantu branch]]) and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] ([[Nilotic languages|Nilotic branch]]), spoken by the country's [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nilotic]] populations, respectively. Additionally, the [[Hadza people|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe people|Sandawe]] hunter-gatherers speak languages with [[click consonant]]s, which have tentatively been classified within the [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] phylum (although Hadza may be a [[language isolate]]). The [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ethnic minorities speak languages belonging to the separate [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family, with the [[Hindustani people|Hindustani]] and [[British people|British]] residents speaking languages from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family.&lt;ref name="Ethnltzl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages of Tanzania|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/TZ/languages|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanzania's various ethnic groups typically speak their [[mother tongue]]s within their own communities. The two [[official language]]s, [[English language|English]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], are used in varying degrees of fluency for communication with other populations. According to the official national linguistic policy announced in 1984, Swahili is the language of the social and political sphere as well as primary and adult education, whereas English is the language of secondary education, universities, technology, and higher courts.&lt;ref name="masebo"&gt;J. A. Masebo &amp; N. Nyangwine: ''Nadharia ya lugha Kiswahili 1.'' S. 126, {{ISBN|978-9987-676-09-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government announced in 2015 that it would discontinue the use of English as a language of education as part of an overhaul of the Tanzanian schools system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afkinsider.com/88774/tanzania-ditches-english-education-overhaul-plan/|agency=AFK Insider|title=Tanzania Ditches English In Education Overhaul Plan|date=17 February 2015|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, several [[Tanzanian sign languages]] are used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5100">'''Mahmud Bayazidi''' (Kurdish; '''Mehmûdê Bazîdî''' ) (1797 [[Doğubeyazıt]]–1859 [[Erzurum]]), was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[philosopher]], [[polymath]] from Bayazid in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Early life==
He was born in Bayazid (present-day [[Doğubeyazıt]] in [[Ağrı Province]], [[Turkey]]) in 1797. He started his studies by reading the [[Koran]], and then [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. He then moved to [[Tabriz]] in north-western [[Iran]] to continue his studies. After finishing his studies, he went back to his hometown and became a teacher. After the fall of Kurdish emirates in Bayazid, he moved to [[Erzurum]].

==Works==
In 1856, the Russian academic ''A. Dorne'', asked ''A.D. Jaba'', the newly appointed [[Russia]]n consulate in Erzurum, for assistance in analyzing documents in the [[Kurdish language]]. Jaba, in turn, employed Mahmud Bayazidi in the field of Kurdish language, history and Culture. With the assistance of Bayazidi, a number of Kurdish documents were sent to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], including some of Bayazidi's own writings.  In 1858-1859, Bayazidi, edited the [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]-[[Arabic]]-[[Persian language|Persian]] [[grammar]] book by ''Ali Taramokhi'' (Kurdish writer of 15-16th century). He also wrote a book containing 3,000 phrases in Kurdish, which shed light on the life of [[Kurds]] in the 19th century. This book was translated into [[French language|French]] by ''A.D. Jaba'' in 1880. Bayazidi, wrote another book called ''Habits and Customs of Kurds'', which has been published in 1963 by the famous Russian Kurdologist [[:ru:Руденко, Маргарита Борисовна|Margarita B. Rudenko]]. From the correspondences of ''A.D. Jaba'' with [[Saint Petersburg]], it is evident that Bayazidi had written a book about the modern history of the Kurds, covering the period 1785-1858, although this book appears to have been lost, except for the [[French language|French]] translation of its preface. Bayazidi and Jaba also played an instrumental role in preserving old Kurdish literature by collecting more than 50 volumes of old hand written Kurdish classic texts and sending them to the Library of [[Saint Petersburg]]. These texts which have been preserved until now, include the epics of well known classical poets such as [[Faqi Tayran]], Malaye Bate, [[Malaye Jaziri]] and ''Mem û Zîn'' (Mam and Zin) by [[Ahmad Khani]]. This collection was finally published in 1961 by ''M.B. Rudenko'', titled ''About the hand-written Kurdish texts in Leningrad''.

During the period 1858-1859, Mahmud Bayazidi and ''A.D. Jaba'', wrote the first [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]-[[French language|French]] and [[French language|French]]-[[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] dictionary, published in 1879. During the same period, Mahmud Bayazidi, translated the ''Sharafnama'' (history of the Kurdish nation) from [[Persian language|Persian]] into [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. This is considered to be the first [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] history book in modern times. Its hand-written version is preserved in the [[Russian National Library]]. It was published for the first time in 1986.

The '''Mon language''' ({{lang-mnw|ဘာသာ မန်}}; {{lang-my|မွန်ဘာသာ}}) is an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]] spoken by the [[Mon people]], who live in [[Myanmar]]. Mon, like the related [[Khmer language]], but unlike most languages in mainland [[mainland Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]], is not tonal. In recent years, usage of Mon has declined rapidly, especially among the younger generation.&lt;ref name="ethno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=mnw|title=Mon: A language of Myanmar|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G., Jr.|year=2005|work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2006-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ethnic Mon are monolingual in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and the language is classified as "vulnerable" by [[UNESCO]]. The current number of speakers is approximately 800,000 in 2007. In Myanmar, the majority of speakers live in [[Mon State]], followed by [[Tanintharyi Region]] and [[Kayin State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrc-usa.org/mon__language.htm |title=The Mon Language |publisher=Monland Restoration Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622213233/http://www.mrc-usa.org/mon__language.htm |archivedate=2006-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mon is an important language in Burmese history. Up until the 12th century, it was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy valley]]—not only in the Mon kingdoms of the lower Irrawaddy but also of the upriver [[Pagan Kingdom]] of the [[Bamar people]]. Mon, especially written Mon, continued to be the primary language even after the fall of the Mon kingdom of [[Thaton]] to Pagan in 1057. Pagan king [[Kyansittha]] (r. 1084–1113) admired Mon culture and the Mon language was patronized. The [[Mon script]] was adopted for Burmese during his reign.

Kyanzittha left many inscriptions in Mon. During this period, the [[Myazedi inscription]], which contains identical inscriptions of a story in [[Pali]], [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], Mon and Burmese on the four sides, was carved.&lt;ref name="tarling"/&gt;

However, after Kyansittha's death, usage of the Mon language declined among the Bamar and the [[Burmese language]] began to replace Mon and Pyu as a lingua franca.&lt;ref name="tarling"&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Strachan | year=1990 | title=Imperial Pagan: Art and Architecture of Burma | publisher=[[University of Hawaii|University of Hawaii Press]] | pages=66 | isbn=0-8248-1325-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mon inscriptions from [[Dvaravati]]'s ruins also litter Thailand. However it is not clear if the inhabitants were Mon, a mix of Mon and Malay or Khmer. Later inscriptions and kingdoms like [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]] were subservient to the [[Khmer Empire]].

After the fall of Pagan, the Mon language again became the lingua franca of the Mon [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] (1287–1539) in present-day [[Lower Burma]]. The language long continued to be prevalent in Lower Burma until the mid-19th century because the region was still mainly populated by Mon. This changed after the [[British Empire|British]] captured Lower Burma in 1852, and encouraged immigration to develop [[Irrawaddy Delta]] for farming. The ensuing mass migration of peoples into the region from other areas of Burma as well as India and China relegated the Mon language to a tertiary status.

The language languished during British colonial rule, and has experienced a rapid decline in the number of speakers since the Burmese independence in 1948. Currently, according to scholars, the number of Mon speakers is relatively very small when compared to the large numbers who identify themselves as Mon people. With little or no support from successive Burmese governments, the Mon language (especially written Mon) continues to be propagated mostly by Mon monks. The Mon language instruction survives in the Thai-Burmese border inside the Mon rebel controlled areas.

In 2013, it was announced that the [[Mawlamyine]]-based ''Thanlwin Times'' would begin to carry news in the Mon language, becoming Myanmar's first Mon language publication since 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Kun Chan | title = First Mon language newspaper in 50 years to be published | accessdate = 2013-02-16 | date = 2013-02-13 | url =http://archive-2.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/8898-first-mon-language-newspaper-in-50-years-to-be-published.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Mon has three primary dialects in Burma, coming from the various regions the Mon inhabit. They are the Central (areas surrounding [[Mottama]] and [[Mawlamyine]]), [[Bago, Myanmar|Bago]], and [[Ye, Mon State|Ye]] dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=South | first=Ashley | year=2003 | title=Mon Nationalism and Civil War in Burma: The Golden Sheldrake | publisher=Routledge | isbn=0-7007-1609-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All are mutually intelligible. Thai Mon has some differences from the Burmese dialects of Mon, but they are mutually intelligible.

''Ethnologue'' lists Mon dialects as Martaban-Moulmein (Central Mon, Mon Te), Pegu (Mon Tang, Northern Mon), and Ye (Mon Nya, Southern Mon), with high mutual intelligibility among them.

The [[Old Mon script]], which has been dated to the 6th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bauer|first=Christian|year=1991|title=Notes on Mon Epigraphy|journal=Journal of the Siam Society|publisher=|volume=79|issue=1|pages=35|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest inscriptions found in [[Nakhon Pathom]] and [[Saraburi]] (in Thailand). It may be the ancestral script of the modern Mon (or Burma Mon) script although no one has shown a linkage between the Old Mon script of Dvaravati and Burma Mon. The extant archaeological evidence shows that Burma Mon was derived from the Burmese alphabet, not the other way around.&lt;ref name=maat-177-178&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Mon alphabet, however, utilizes several letters and [[diacritic]]s that do not exist in Burmese, such as the stacking diacritic for medial 'l', which is placed underneath the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lwinmoe.friendsofburma.org/doc/myanmar_extension.pdf |title=Proposal for encoding characters for Myanmar minority languages in the UCS |accessdate=2006-07-09 |date=2006-04-02 |format=PDF |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723083627/http://lwinmoe.friendsofburma.org/doc/myanmar_extension.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Burmese script]].)

There is a great deal of discrepancy between the written and spoken forms of Mon, with a single pronunciation capable of having several spellings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenny |first1=Mathias|year=2001 |title=A Short Introduction to the Mon Language |journal= |publisher=Mon Culture and Literature Survival Project (MCL) |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.uzh.ch/spw/aboutus/jenny/downloads/mon_language_intro1.pdf |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mon script also makes prominent use of consonant stacking, to represent [[consonant cluster]]s found in the language.

The Mon alphabet contains 35 consonants (including a [[zero consonant]]), as follows, with consonants belonging to the breathy register indicated in gray:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/31095689/Mon-Consonants-Characters |title=Mon Consonants Characters |author=Dho-ong Jhaan |date=2010-05-09 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/20473584/Romanization-for-Mon-Script-by-Transliteration-Method |title=Romanization for Mon Script by Transliteration Method |author=Dho-ong Jhaan |date=2009-10-01 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

In the Mon script, consonants belong to one of two registers: clear and breathy, each of which has different inherent vowels and pronunciations for the same set of diacritics. For instance, {{my|က}}, which belongs to the clear register, is pronounced {{IPA|/kaˀ/}}, while {{my|ဂ}} is pronounced {{IPA|/kɛ̀ˀ/}}, to accommodate the vowel complexity of the Mon phonology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world |chapter=Mon |year=2009 |publisher=Elsevier |location= |isbn=978-0-08-087774-7 |pages=719–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of diacritics makes this obvious. Whereas in Burmese, spellings with the same diacritics are rhyming, in Mon, this depends on the consonant's inherent register. A few examples are listed below:
* {{my|က}} + {{my|ဳ}} → {{my|ကဳ}}, pronounced {{IPA|/kɔe/}}
* {{my|ဂ}} + {{my|ဳ}} → {{my|ဂဳ}}, pronounced {{IPA|/kì/}}
* {{my|က}} + {{my|ူ}} → {{my|ကူ}}, pronounced {{IPA|/kao/}}
* {{my|ဂ}} + {{my|ူ}} → {{my|ဂူ}}, pronounced {{IPA|/kù/}}

The Mon language has 8 medials, as follows: {{my|္ၚ}} ({{IPA|/-ŋ-/}}), {{my|ၞ}} ({{IPA|/-n-/}}), {{my|ၟ}} ({{IPA|/-m-/}}), {{my|ျ}} ({{IPA|/-j-/}}), {{my|ြ}} ({{IPA|/-r-/}}), {{my|ၠ}} ({{IPA|/-l-/}}), {{my|ွ}} ({{IPA|/-w-/}}), and {{my|ှ}} ({{IPA|/-hn-/}}).

Consonantal finals are indicated with a [[virama]] ({{my|်}}), as in Burmese: however, instead of being pronounced as glottal stops as in Burmese, final consonants usually keep their respective pronunciations. Furthermore, consonant stacking is possible in Mon spellings, particularly for [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]]-derived vocabulary.

===Vowels===
Mon uses the same diacritics and diacritic combinations as in Burmese to represent vowels, with the addition of a few diacritics unique to the Mon script, including {{my|ဴ}} ({{IPA|/ɛ̀a/}}), and {{my|ဳ}} ({{IPA|/i/}}), since the diacritic {{my|ိ}} represents {{IPA|/ìˀ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/31170845/Mon-Vowels-Characters |title=Mon Vowels Characters |author=Dho-ong Jhaan |date=2010-05-10 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, {{my|ဨ}} ({{IPA|/e/}}) is used instead of {{my|ဧ}}, as in Burmese.

=== Vocalic register ===
Unlike the surrounding Burmese and [[Thai language|Thai]] languages, Mon is not a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]].  As in many Mon–Khmer languages, Mon uses a vowel-phonation or vowel-[[register (phonology)|register]] system in which the quality of voice in pronouncing the vowel is phonemic.  There are two registers in Mon:

#Clear (modal) voice, analyzed by various linguists as ranging from ordinary to [[Creaky voice|creaky]]
#[[Breathy voice]], vowels have a distinct breathy quality

One study involving speakers of a Mon dialect in Thailand found that in some syllabic environments, words with a breathy voice vowel are significantly lower in pitch than similar words with a clear vowel counterpart.&lt;ref name=thongkum&gt;[[Theraphan Luangthongkum|Thongkum, Theraphan L]]. 1988. The interaction between pitch and phonation type in Mon: phonetic implications for a theory of tonogenesis. Mon-Khmer Studies 16-17:11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; While difference in pitch in certain environments was found to be significant, there are no [[minimal pair]]s that are distinguished solely by pitch. The contrastive mechanism is the vowel phonation.

In the examples below, breathy voice is marked with a grave accent.

==Syntax==

===Verbs and verb phrases===

Mon verbs do not inflect for person.  Tense is shown through particles.

Some verbs have a morphological causative, which is most frequently a /pə-/ prefix (Pan Hla 1989:29):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Underived verb !! Gloss !! Causative verb !! Gloss
|-
| chɒt || to die || kəcɒt || to kill
|-
| lɜm || to be ruined || pəlɒm || to destroy
|-
| khaɨŋ || to be firm|| pəkhaɨŋ ||to make firm
|-
| tɛm || to know || pətɛm || to inform
|}

===Nouns and noun phrases===

====Singular and Plural====

Mon nouns do not inflect for number.  That is, they do not have separate forms for singular and plural:

{|
|-
|
|{{my|၁}}
|
|-
| sɔt pakaw
| mòa
| mèa
|-
| apple
| one
| classifier
|}
'one apple'

{|
|-
|
|{{my|၂}}
|
|-
| sɔt pakaw
| ɓa
| mèa
|-
| apple
| two
| classifier
|}
'two apples'

====Adjectives====

Adjectives follow the noun (Pan Hla p.&amp;nbsp;24):

{|
|-
|prɛa
|ce
|-
|woman
|beautiful
|}
'beautiful woman'

====Demonstratives====

Demonstratives follow the noun:

{|
|-
| ŋoa || nɔʔ
|-
| day || this
|-
|colspan="2"|this day
|}

====Classifiers====

Like many other Southeast Asian languages, Mon has [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] which are used when a noun appears with a numeral.  The choice of classifier depends on the semantics of the noun involved.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!IPA
|kaneh
|mòa
|tanəng
|-
!Gloss
|pen
|one
|classifier
|}
'one pen'

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!IPA
|chup
|mòa
|tanɒm
|-
!Gloss
|tree
|one
|classifier
|}
'one tree'

===Prepositions and prepositional phrases===

Mon is a prepositional language.

{|
|-
|  ɗoa||əma
|-
| in || lake
|-
|'in the lake'
|}

===Sentences===

The ordinary word order for sentences in Mon is subject–verb–object, as in the following examples

{|
!Mon
|{{my|အဲ}}
|{{my|ရာန်}}
|{{my|သ္ၚု}}
|{{my|တုဲ}}
|{{my|ယျ}}
|-
!IPA
|ʔoa
|ran
|hau
|toa
|ya.
|-
!Gloss
|I
|buy
|rice
|completive
|affirmative
|}

'I bought rice.'

{|
!Mon
|{{my|ညး}}
|{{my|တံ}}
|{{my|ဗ္တောန်}}
|{{my|ကဵု}}
|{{my|အဲ}}
|{{my|ဘာသာ}}
|{{my|အၚ်္ဂလိက်}}
|-
!IPA
|Nyeh
|tɔʔ
|paton
|kɒ
|ʔua
|pàsa
|ʔengloit
|-
!Gloss
|3rd
|plur
|teach
|to
|1st
|language
|English
|}
'They taught me English.'

===Questions===

Yes-no questions are shown with a final particle ''ha''

{|
!Mon
|{{my|ဗှ်ေ}}
|{{my|စ}}
|{{my|ပုင်}}
|{{my|တုဲ}}
|{{my|ယျ}}
|{{my|ဟာ}}
|-
!IPA
|ɓè
|shea
|pəng
|toa
|ya
|har?
|-
!Gloss
|you
|eat
|rice
|com
|aff
|q
|}

‘Have you eaten rice?’

{|
!Mon
|{{my|အပါ}}
|{{my|အာ}}
|{{my|ဟာ}}
|-
!IPA
|əha
|a
|ha?
|-
!Gloss
|father
|go
|q
|}

‘Will father go?’ (Pan Hla, p.&amp;nbsp;42)

Wh-questions show a different final particle, ''rau''.  The interrogative word does not undergo [[wh-movement]].  That is, it does not necessarily move to the front of the sentence:

{|
!Mon
|{{my|တၠ  အဲ}}
|{{my|ကြာတ်ကြဴ}}
|{{my|မူ}}
|{{my|ရော}}
|-
!IPA
|Tala oa
|kratkraw
|mu
|raw?
|-
!Gloss
|You
|wash
|what
|wh:q
|}
'What did you wash?'

The extinct '''Palta language''' of the Ecuadorian Amazon is attested by only a few words: ''yumé'' 'water', ''xeme'' 'maize', ''capal'' 'fire', ''let'' 'wood' (Jiménez de la Espada, 1586), and some toponyms. Based on this, Jacinto Jijón y Caamaño (1936) classified it as a [[Jivaroan language]]. Kaufman (1994) states that there is "little resemblance", but Adelaar (2004) finds the connection reasonable. In addition to these four words are [[toponym]]s, which commonly end in ''-anga, -numa, -namá''. The latter two suggest the Jivaroan [[locative case]] suffix ''-num ~ -nam'', though Torero (1993) notes that the last resembles [[Aguaruna language|Aguaruna]] (Jivaroan) ''namák(a)'' 'river' as well.

'''Pamphylian''' is a little-attested and isolated dialect of [[Ancient Greek]] that was spoken in [[Pamphylia]], on the southern coast of [[Asia Minor]]. Its origins and relation to other Greek dialects are uncertain. A number of scholars have distinguished in Pamphylian dialect important [[isogloss]]es with [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]] which allow them to be studied together. Pamphylia means "land of all [[phyle]]s (tribes)". The [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] may have settled the region under the leadership of [[Amphilochus (brother of Alcmaeon)|Amphilochus]], [[Calchas]], and [[Mopsus]]. However, other cities in Pamphylia were established by different Greek tribes: [[Aspendos]] was a colony of [[Argos]], [[Side, Turkey|Side]] was a colony of [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Aeolian Cyme]], [[Sillyon]] was a colony of an unknown Greek mother city, and [[Perga]] was a colony established by a wave of Greeks from northern Anatolia. The isolation of the dialect took place even before the appearance of the Greek article. Pamphylian is the only dialect that does not use articles other than [[Mycenean Greek]] and poetic language.

==Pronunciation and writing==
&lt;!-- As the pamphylian digamma is not supported in unicode, this source text makes use of the similar Cyrilic letter И --&gt;
[[File:Greek Sigma 01.svg|thumb|100px|Pamphylian digamma]]
Pamphylia had a variant [[Greek alphabet|local alphabet]], that made use both of the original "[[Pamphylian digamma]]" (И) and a standard [[digamma]] (Ϝ), which was probably borrowed from other Greek alphabets. It has been surmised that the original sound {{IPAslink|w}} in some environments (after vowels) was represented by И; where the sound has changed to labiodental {{IPAslink|v}} in the Pamphylian dialect, it was represented by Ϝ. Sometimes И stood also in the place of [[beta]].
[[File:Greek Sampi Pamphylian.svg|100px|thumb|Pamphylian sampi]]
There is also a psi-like [[sampi]] ([[File:Greek Sampi Pamphylian.svg|x16px|Ͳ]]), used probably to represent the sounds {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/ss/}}, or {{IPA|/ps/}}.

An inscription from [[Perge]] dated to around 400 BC reads: {{lang|grc|Иανά[[File:Greek Sampi Pamphylian.svg|x16px]]αι Πρειίαι Κλεμύτας Λϝαράμυ Иασιρϝο̄τας ἀνέθε̄κε}} (=''"Vanassāi Preiiāi Klemutas Lwaramu Vasirwōtas anethēke"'', "Klemutas the vasirwotas, son of Lwaramus, dedicated this to the Queen of Perge").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHI Greek Inscriptions – IK Perge 1|url=http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=313768&amp;bookid=794&amp;region=8&amp;subregion=41}}. Other editions read "Kleиutas" and "Lwaraиu".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Papyromancy''' is a way of [[divination]] through folding paper. Some say a true papyromancer can crumple up any piece of paper, unfold it, and predict the future from the creased lines{{R|"skepdic"}} reading the creased paper the way that a palm reader would read a person’s palm.  Another form of papyromancy is done by folding an illustrated piece of paper and interpreting the resulting image.{{R|"nature"}}

== Etymology ==

Derived from the Greek papuros (‘paper’) and manteia (‘prophecy’){{R|"occultworld"}}

== Methods ==

A [[paper fortune teller]] is an [[origami]]. A player asks a question and the operator uses an algorithm to manipulate the fortune teller’s shape. Questions, answers, colors or numbers may be written on the fortune teller. Manipulations are done by various methods. The holder asks for a number or color. Once the number or color is chosen, the holder uses their fingers to switch between the two groups of colors and numbers inside the paper fortune teller. The holder switches these positions several times determined by the number of letters in the color , the number chosen, or the sum of both. Once the holder has finished switching positions, the player chooses one of the flaps revealed. These flaps often have colors or numbers on them as well. The fortune is under the flap. Steps may be repeated and changed to suit the users.

== Criticisms ==

The paper fortune telling devices can be “rigged” by the placement of only even numbers on one “position” and only odd numbers on the other, causing forced placement to an even position. This will generate only good or bad fortunes.

== Examples ==

An urban legend where a specifically folded $20 American bill will reveal the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].{{R|"snopes"}}

'''Political philology'''  is "an active mode of understanding" texts. It does not simply take (religious) texts at face-value as religious texts without any connection to a social and political context, but situates them in a historical context, and is sensitive to the social and political implications and usages of a (religious) text.{{sfn|Pollock|2008}}

A '''contract proof'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/proofs/g/contractproof.htm Contract Proof]&lt;/ref&gt; usually serves as an agreement between customer and [[printer (publishing)|printer]] and as a [[color]] reference guide for adjusting the [[press (machine)|press]] before the final press run.&lt;ref&gt;theprintspace (2010), [http://www.theprintspace.co.uk/photography-terminology.php CMYK Proof] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315102453/http://www.theprintspace.co.uk/photography-terminology.php |date=2010-03-15 }}, theprintspace, retrieved on 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Most contract proofs are a '''prepress proof'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/g/prepressproof.htm Prepress Proof]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goal of {{'}}'''proofing'''{{'}} is to serve as a tool for customer verification that the entire job is accurate. [[Prepress]] proofing (also known as '''off-press proofing'''&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Romano, "Pocket Guide to Digital Prepress", © 1996, Delmar Publishers, page 109, {{ISBN|0-8273-7198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a cost-effective way of providing a visual copy without the expense of creating a '''press proof'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/proofs/g/pressproof.htm Press Proof] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707093434/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/proofs/g/pressproof.htm |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If errors are found during the [[printing]] process on press, correcting them can prove very costly to one or both parties involved.

Press time is the most expensive part of print media. The main objective of proofing is to produce either a soft or hard copy of what the final product will look like on press. Hard-copy proofing usually involves [[inkjet printer|ink-jet printing]] or other technologies (i.e. Laminate Proof&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/proofs/g/laminateproof.htm Laminate Proof]&lt;/ref&gt;) to produce high-quality one-off copies of the production artwork. Soft proofing usually involves highly color accurate wide-[[gamut]] computer displays.

"The printed proof is a dispassionate simulation of the ultimate output – a CMYK press sheet. The mission of a proofing system is to create accurate predictions, not pretty pictures."&lt;ref&gt;Rick McCleary, "CMYK 2.0, A Cooperative Workflow for Photographers, Designers, and Printers", © 2009, Peachpit Press, page 70, {{ISBN|978-0-321-57346-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the best conditions the proofing process will actually try to emulate the effects of the [[printing press]] through [[color management]] and screening techniques, which can be quite challenging because proofing devices may behave and operate quite differently from press devices.

==History==
[[Image:Press-Check.jpg|thumb|right|A fussy client approves a press proof, in a 19th century painting.]]Since the first days of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], proofing has just been press proofs - one makes a short run on the press in order to verify what is to be done on a production run. As technology evolved to lower the per-copy cost of a printing job, the cost of starting a production run continued to rise. Today, it can be very costly to start up a production press, and thus it is cost-prohibitive to run a press proof. While some people may think a press proof is the ultimate proof quality, this is not necessarily so, especially if the production run is done days or weeks later when press conditions may have changed, or the production run is done on a different press than the press proof.

In the late 1940s, the first overlay&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/proofs/g/overlayproof.htm Overlay Proof]&lt;/ref&gt; systems were developed. These systems produce each of the process colors on a separate sheet of clear film and then register them together to view the final proof.

The Ozalid division of General Aniline and Film (GAF) Corporation created Ozachrome&lt;ref&gt;Louis Walton Sipley, "A Half Century of Color", The Macmillan Company, © 1951, page 207&lt;/ref&gt; as the first commercial system used in proofing. Diazo (light-sensitive dye) coatings on film were used for each of the process colors, and the films were developed using [[ammonia]] vapor. The initial process colors used were red, yellow, blue and black, although other colors may have been used in subsequent years. A black separation was processed on a white paper, while the remaining separations were processed on clear [[cellulose acetate]].

Around 1965, [[3M]] invented an overlay system called Color Key. Basically, sheets of clear polyester were coated with UV-sensitive pigmented emulsions in the four process colors, cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Later, spot colors were created (Color Key Custom Colors). The sheets were exposed to the artwork via a carbon arc lamp, washed with water and process chemicals, and then dried.

As of 2010, overlay proofs are still created, for example for small single-drum presses where each color has to be a separate run. Such proofs are usually made using either [[inkjet printer]]s or lamination devices.

Internal&lt;ref name="Frank J. Romano 1996, page 111"&gt;Frank J. Romano, "Pocket Guide to Digital Prepress", © 1996, Delmar Publishers, page 111, {{ISBN|0-8273-7198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (single-sheet) or [[laminate]] systems attempt to overcome the problems with overlay systems by putting all process colors on a single sheet of media. After the end of World War II, the first commercial system, called Watercote, was introduced by the Direct Reproduction Corporation.

By the 1970s, [[3M]] developed Transfer Key technology, which used a cold lamination adhesive process. Successive layers of colored adhesive would be pressed on the substrate, exposed and washed away until all the colors existed on a single substrate. This later evolved into the Match Print product, which used a thermal transfer lamination process. The Match Print trade mark has since been sold to [[Kodak]], which uses it today in its MATCHPRINT InkJet and MATCHPRINT Virtual products. Both Color Key&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/proofs/g/colorkey.htm Color Key]&lt;/ref&gt; and Match Print&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/proofs/g/matchprint.htm Match Print]&lt;/ref&gt; have also become generic names for types of prepress proofs. Later, other similar water process products such as [[DuPont]] Waterproof came on the market.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the early 1960s, several attempts were made to develop electrophotographic proofing processes based on the electrofax principle, using paper coated with zinc oxide in a resistive binder as a [[photoconductor]], along with toners consisting of ink pigments dispersed in liquid [[Isopar]]. The electrofax principle was introduced in the United States by [[RCA]], and the use of liquid toners was developed in Australia by Ralph Metcalf and Robert Wright of the Australian government. Other groups worked on similar processes, but these never got to market.&lt;ref name="Frank J. Romano 1996, page 111"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in the 1970s, toner-based solutions such as Dupont Cromalin were developed.

By the 1980s, custom colors, including white and metallics such as gold and silver, were becoming commonplace.

By 1987, the first [[Iris printer]] was commercialized. This was a continuous stream [[inkjet printer]] that was later followed by the [[Veris printer]] in 2004. Initially, these printers had unparalleled quality in inkjet printing, but steady advances in drop-on-demand printers has made their quality acceptable to more and more [[prepress]] shops. As of 2010, both Iris and Veris devices are still in use.

In the early 1990s, [[Dye Sublimation]] was introduced with products like [[3M]] Rainbow and [[Kodak]] DCP9000 and DCP9500.

Also in the early 1990s, Laser Sublimation systems were introduced. Products such as the Fuji FINALPROOF, and [[Approval proofer|Kodak Approval]] are still in use today.

In the late 1990s, laser thermal transfer was developed. These systems are still in use, such as the [[Creo (company)|Creo]] (now Kodak) Spectrum. The Spectrum was notable in that the same [[platesetter]] device used to make plates was also used to make proofs, resulting in proofs with identical screening as the press.

By 2005, the first [[spectrophotometer]]s were integrated with inkjet printers, such as the [[Creo (company)|Creo]] Veris and [[HP 2100 (printer)|HP 2100]]. By 2009, Epson released a printer with an integrated spectrophotometer. By automating the measurement process, this eliminates much of the labor involved in calibrating the proofing system and validating the proofs. However, it slows down overall throughput of the proofing device, so more proofing devices are needed to maintain throughput.

By 2003, soft proofing emerged using well-calibrated and profiled computer displays under highly controlled viewing conditions. This approach continues to gain in popularity due to the much lower cost and lesser production time than producing a hard-copy proof.

As of 2010, the majority of hard-copy contract proofing is done on inkjet and laminate devices, while soft proofing continues to gain popularity.

Since the late 1990s, a number of software proofing solutions were developed by companies. Previously, proofing systems were typically a complete solution from one vendor, but as software has become the dominant enabling technology in proofing, customers enjoy the benefits of being able to use commodity print devices over special proofing devices.

==Proofing methods==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Depending on the quality needed and the use of product, there are two major types of proof:

*soft proof;
*hard proof;

===Soft proof===

Soft proof describes the simulation of the print result on a monitor.&lt;ref name="Kipphan"&gt;Helmut Kipphan (2001), Handbook of Print Media, Berlin: Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt; This is the cheapest solution for proofing since no additional equipment, except a monitor, is needed.

Usually soft proof is done in software applications in combination with color management systems. The monitor used for soft proofing must be [[Color calibration|calibrated]], so that the image on the screen looks like the image on the paper. The major problem is the difference of color spaces (RGB in monitor and CMYK in print), and this is solved by using [[ICC profile]]s for input and output devices. Moreover, colors on a monitor depend not only on its properties, but also on lighting conditions in a room where the image is viewed. Usually, lighting is standardized and is close to a daylight (D50).

Soft proofing can be used an unlimited number of times, and is most useful when editing images and designing layout, but is normally not used as a contract proof.

It should be noted that the use of soft proofs in low end printing has become prevalent in recent years allowing for a time and cost savings where color management is not crucial.

===Hard proof===
Hard proof is an actual printed sample of a printed product. It is further divided into five general classifications &lt;ref name="Kipphan" /&gt;

'''Blueprint''' (originated from conventional platemaking) is a copy printed in one color and used for checking and correcting mistakes in contents, imposition layout and completeness of data.

'''Imposition proof''' (Layout proof) is similar to blueprint, but the copy is printed in color. Imposition proof is usually done with a large-format color [[inkjet printer]].

'''Color proof''' provides the color-reliable/color-true reproduction of the contents of the file intended for printing. Color proof is made with [[inkjet printer]]s or [[Dye-sublimation printer|thermal sublimation printers]] in combination with powerful color-management systems. Proofing is usually performed in full-size format, but in some cases small-page format is also acceptable. Color proof serves as a guideline for a printing press operator, and usually stands for a contract proof.

'''Screen Proof''' (True Proof) is a method of proofing used for simulating a raster structure of the printed image. Performing this proof makes it possible to recognize different raster-dependent effects such as smoothness, grade and range of tonal gradations, and [[Moiré pattern|moiré]] or rosette patterns.

Several vendors offer special proof systems for creating a screen proof. The proof is produced via color donors and thermal transfer (ablation) onto intermediate carriers or onto the substrate used for the print run. Both systems are imagesetter-like devices with which the image motifs can be reproduced in every detail including their color, screen definition, and [[screen angle]]s. The true proof systems use color foils that are to be processed in separate units (laminators), transferred from intermediate carriers onto production paper and/or laminated, either to protect the proof or to give it the appearance of the surface structure of production paper.&lt;ref name="Kipphan" /&gt;

'''Press proof''' is a test print of the data directly on a printing press. This can be the press for the production run or a comparable press (using the same print technology) prepared especially for proof purposes. Short runs of 50 or 100 copies can be produced more cost-effectively than with other color proof processes. The individual proof is, however, hardly economically justifiable.&lt;ref name="Kipphan" /&gt;

==Issues==

Proofing can either be viewed subjectively as an art based on training, experience, talent and judgment; or objectively as a science based on measurement, algorithms, and analysis; but in practice it is somewhere in between. Increasingly, however, printers rely on scientific methods, as it is often more cost-effective to buy the necessary technology than to acquire, train and retain skilled artisans.

In many cases, it makes sense to align the proof with the press, but in other cases it makes sense to align the press with the proof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qualityinprint.blogspot.com/2009/01/press-and-proof-alignment.html Press and proof alignment strategies]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, one would align the press with the proof when one is trying to achieve a particular industry specification (i.e. Fogra,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fogra.org/ Fogra]&lt;/ref&gt; GRACoL,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idealliance.org/industry_resources/branding_media_and_color/gracol GRACoL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212061629/http://www.idealliance.org/industry_resources/branding_media_and_color/gracol |date=2009-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SWOP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idealliance.org/industry_resources/branding_media_and_color/swop SWOP]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). In situations where one is trying to achieve the best possible color on a particular press, typically to distinguish oneself as a printer, one would define a custom color standard for the press and then align the proof with the press.

===Process control===

A central aspect of scientific proofing is [[process control]], which consists of baselining, characterizing and [[calibrate|calibrating]] the proofing process.

A '''baseline''' is representation of the output device settings (i.e. paper feed, head alignment, etc.) and associated conditions (i.e. media, ink, screening, etc.). A baseline is created by adjusting device settings under a given set of conditions and running test samples, measuring the samples, readjusting the settings, until the output process is brought to an optimal state. Once optimized, a final set of measurements are made of output samples and this data becomes part of the baseline information.

The baseline is then '''characterized''' by outputting ECI&lt;ref&gt;[http://eci.org European Color Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; or IT8.7/4&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI+IT8.7%2F4-2005 ANSI IT8.7/4-2005 Graphic technology - Input data for characterization of 4-color process printing - Expanded data set]&lt;/ref&gt; test charts (samples of color patches), then the charts are scanned with a [[spectrophotometer]] to finally produce a [[color profile]] of the baseline.

Over time, specific device performance (and other conditions) may vary. Certainly different devices of the same device type will also vary with respect to the baseline data. However it is essential that the proofing system always perform as closely as possible to the original color profile. '''Calibration''' is a process of outputting more color charts, measuring them and adjusting the color mapping until system performance is as close as possible to the original baseline and color profile. During calibration, device settings may also be changed to achieve an optimal output process and subsequent color match.

In ideal circumstances, the printing press will also be characterized and calibrated using similar techniques. When there exists a color profile of the press device and a color profile of proofing device, the best emulation of the press on the proofing device is possible. Doing this accurately requires well controlled and repeatable processes (including calibration), in order to ensure that the color profiles continue to represent the devices involved.

'''Proof Validation''' is another aspect of process control. While calibration only ensures that the proofing system is producing output as close to the baseline as possible, proof validation embeds color charts in the artwork itself to ensure that at the artwork matches an industry color standard or a custom color standard (i.e. a specific press that has been characterized). In short, it validates that the proofing system emulates the desired press results accurately.

===Proofing for packaging===

Producing proofs for packaging faces a number of challenges beyond those for conventional offset press.

Often, customers want three-dimensional mock-ups of the actual package. This could be cardboard, metal (i.e., aluminum pop can), glass, plastic, etc. This can be very difficult, or impossible to do effectively using inkjet printers, so typically laminate processes such as Kodak APPROVAL or Fuji FINALPROOF are needed, so that the proof can be transferred to the preferred packaging materials.

In the case of cardboard cartons, an automated cutting-and-creasing table is useful. Typically, [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software is used to define the cuts and creases based on the proof geometry, and this is fed into the cutting-and-creasing table software.

Most packaging is printed using [[flexography]], because it is more versatile over the range of materials used in packaging. However, the image quality of flexographic prints is often inferior to offset presses, and it is important to simulate the characteristics of the press in the proofs so that customers have realistic expectations for the final packaging. Similarly certain materials, such as corrugated cardboard, add their own characteristics to the image, and these too need to be simulated.

'''Puluwatese''' is a [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian language]] of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. It is spoken on [[Poluwat]]. 

== Classification ==
Puluwatese has two dialects: Pulapese and Pulusukes, all of which have low intelligibility with Satawalese (64%), Woleaian (40%), and Ulithian (21%).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/puw/|title=Puluwatese|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puluwatese does however have slightly higher lexical similarity with Satawalese and Carolinian (88%), Mortlockese (83%), Woleaian (82%), Chuukese (81%), and Ulithian (72%).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue" /&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Syllable Structure ===
The syllables in Puluwatese begin with either [[Consonant|consonants]] or [[Gemination|geminal consonants]] followed by a [[vowel]] or geminal vowel and can be ended with either a consonant or a vowel.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puluwat Grammar|last=Elbert|first=Samuel|publisher=Linguistic Circle of Canberra|year=1974|isbn=0 85883 103 1|editor-last=Wurm|editor-first=S.A|series=B|location=Australian National University|pages=1-56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different syllable structure types are as follows:&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

* CV: hi ''we''
* CVV: rúú ''bone''
* CVC: mwoŕ ''blow''
* CVVC: niiy ''kill-him''
* CVVCC: wiill ''wheel''
* CVCC: wuut ''bath house''
* CCV: ppi ''sand''
* CCVV: kkúú ''fingernails''
* CCVC: llón ''in''
* CCVVC: mmwlik ''pepper''
* CCVCC: ppóh ''steady''

In the voicing of consonants, nasals, liquids, and glides are always voiced. Voiceless consonants consist of stops and fricatives and usually follow a pattern of being voiceless initially, weakly voiced medially, and voiceless at the end.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

Puluwatese consists of long consonants ccòwo (heavy) and short consonants ppel (light). Long consonants are considered more forceful and are often used to display an emotion such as fear. Such an example is the word for hide-and seek/ tow-the-ghost: likohhomà. In this case, the "hh" long consonant creates a heavy sound that is used to frighten children.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

An interesting pattern in consonant replacement occurs where /w-/ and /y-/ glides replace /k-/ in some words. Some of the most commonly heard forms are as follows:&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

* kapong, yapong-i-y ''to greet''
* kereker, yereker ''rat''
* wo, ko ''you (polite)''
* woow, koow ''coconut fiber''
* yáát, káát ''boy''
* ya-mwar, ka-mwar ''to hold''
* yéé, kéé ''fishhook''

Other consonant interchange patterns involve /c/ and /r/ which can be traced back to [[Trukese language|Trukese]] influence. Oftentimes, the Truk consonant /c/ and the Puluwat /r/ correspond such as in the words:&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

* caw, raw ''slow''
* céccén, réccén ''wet''
* ceec, reec ''to tremble''

/k/ and /kk/ may also be used interchangeably as follows:&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

* kltekit ''small,'' yátakkit ''small''
* rak ''only,'' mákk ''write''

While [[Consonant cluster|consonant clusters]] do not occur in Puluwatese, there are several instances of consonant combinations occurring. These consonant combinations are often interrupted by a vowel referred to as an Excrescent.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;  Sometimes, the intersyllabic vowel is lost and a [[consonant cluster]] can occur.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; The historically noted consonant combinations are as follows:&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

* kf: yekiyekféngann ''to think together''
*

*

* np: tayikonepék ''fish species''
* nf: pwonféngann ''to promise together''
* nm: yinekinmann ''serious''
* nl: fanefanló ''patient''
* nw: yóónwuur ''canoe part''
* ngf: llónghamwol ''termite''
* wp: liyawpenik ''cormorant''
* wh: yiwowhungetá ''to raise''

Vowel distribution is limited and occur finally. Vowels may present themselves as short or long and can change to a lower pitch when lengthened.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; While all syllables are stressed fairly evenly, stressed syllables are often denoted as capitals. The following are two rules that determine stressed syllables:&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

# Final vowels in CVCV words are stressed such as in hanA ''hibiscus,'' klyÒ ''outrigger boom,'' ylfA? ''where?,'' and ylwE ''then''
# Syllables that follow the letter h are normally stressed: yapawahAalò ''to dry out'', pahAlò ''to drift away,'' yekúhÚ rak ''just a little''

Unstressed syllables often occur as excrescent vowels except for when they follow h- and are denoted by breves. Unstressed vowels occur in the following instances:&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; 

* Vowels in between reduplicated words are often unstressed:
** ngeŕ- ĕ -ngeŕ ''to sew''
** ngeŕ- ĭ -ngeŕ ''to gnaw''
** pwul- ă -pwul ''red''
** yale- ĕ  yái ''young man''
** yál- ĭ -yel ''retreat''

* Vowels between bases and suffixes (directional and first person plural exclusive pronoun suffix):
** fanúw- ĕ -mám ''our''
** mópw- ŭ -ló ''to drown''
** nlike- ĕ -mem- ĕ -ló ''attack us all''
** yállew- ŭ -ló ''worse''
* Vowels following -n, the construct form suffix and the initial consonant:
** n + p: lúkúnĭ paliyewowuh ''beyond the outer side''
** n + k: máánĭ kiiiiló ''hunger death''
** n + m: roonĭ maan ''floating ripe coconuts''
** n + y: wòònĭ Yáley ''on Yáley''
* Vowels in loan words that often contain consonant clusters:
** s+t: Sĭtien ''Steven''
** m+ s: Samĭson ''Samson''
** f+k: Maŕĕkús ''Markus''
* In words that follow the shape of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; vowels are normally stressed while the V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a week stress:
** TilĭmE ''male name''
** yeŕŏmA ''a tree''

== Pronouns ==
Independent pronouns, subject pronouns, and polite vocatives are the three types of pronouns that occur in differing distributions.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; Independent pronouns occur alone and in [[Equational sentence|equational sentences]], they precede noun or noun phrases, as well as subject pronouns, or the prepositions me, and, and with.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; Subject pronouns never occur as objects and always precede verbs, normally with intervening particles.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; The use of polite vocatives are rare in daily life and even rarer in texts.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; However, the known polite vocatives are included in the table below.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!
!Before proper names, 'person'
!Clause - final
|-
|To a male or males
|ko, ŕewe
|wo, ko keen ŕewe
|-
|To a femail or females
|ne
|ne
|-
|To males or females
|keen
|kææmi
|}

The polite vocatives that occur before a proper name may most closely be translated to Mr, Miss, or Mrs, but there are no accurate translations for the clause-final polite vocatives.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

Independent and subject pronouns occur in seven propositions: first person singular (1s, 2s, 3s), first person plural inclusive (1p inc), first person plural exclusive (1p exc, 2p, 3p), and is illustrated in the table below.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

|}

== Word order ==
For transitive sentences, Puluwatese follows a SVO word order but an SV or VS structure for intransitive sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48929366|title=The Oceanic languages|date=2002|publisher=Curzon|others=Lynch, John (John Dominic), Ross, Malcolm., Crowley, Terry.|isbn=0700711287|location=Richmond [England]|oclc=48929366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SVO:

Wuŕumwo ya yákékkél-ee-ŕ     yát-e-kkit          mákk.

Wuŕumwo 3s teach-SV-3pl.obj child-EV-small writing

'Wuŕumwo taught the children writing.'

SV:

Ye-ray   eŕemahán Polowat  a     fáyi-to.

one-CL manPuluwat perf come-hither

'A Puluwat man has come.'

VS:

Ye pwe   le          mááló manú-hmwaay we.

3s T(fut) imm.fut die      dem-SV-sick     dem

'the sick man will soon die.'

== Counting system ==

Numbers in Puluwatese are confusing because there is such an intricate system of suffixes for counting different objects. In general, the base of the number stays the same and suffixes for different objects are added onto each base of the number. Suffixes that are added onto the base numbers can significantly alter the meaning of the word such as in the example ye-ray woong (a small turtle) and yee-w woong (a large turtle).&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; For counted objects, suffixes can greatly change their meaning such as in ye-fay teŕeec (a spool of thread) and ye-met teŕeec (a piece of thread).&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; The most common counting suffixes are outlined in the following table.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

Sequential counting is used for rapid counting and can be combined in order to count two or three numbers without intervention. For example, "one, two" can be counted as yét-é-ŕúúw and "three, four" as yei-u-fáán.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; This sequential counting can be used as a system for rapid pair counting of objects such as coconuts and breadfruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender|first=Andrea|last2=Beller|first2=Sieghard|date=December 2006|title=Numeral Classifiers and Counting Systems in Polynesian and Micronesian Languages: Common Roots and Cultural Adaptations|jstor=4499969|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|volume=45|issue=2|pages=380-403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general suffixes are used for objects that do not have a specified suffix. Suffixes for objects are either drawn upon from the general set or any of the other sets.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

The animate suffixes are applied to humans, animals, weapons, tools, musical instruments, and other miscellaneous artifacts. The animate suffixes are the only ones to have two different classifiers: -ray and -man with -man being the Trukese cognate for -mén.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

Long object suffixes are used for objects that are long and slender such as rope (yámeey), vehicles (citosa), and cigarettes (suupwa).&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

Round objects suffixes are used for round objects such as stones (fawú), breadfruit (mááy), eggs (hakúll).&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

Flat object suffixes are applied to objects such as leafs (éé), clothes (Mégaak: ''cloth''), and mat (hááki).&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

[[Ordinal number|Ordinals]] follow the pattern of sequential counting with the prefixes /ya-/, /yó-/, or /yé-/, followed by the base number, and the suffix /an-/ as seen in the following table.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|1st
|ya-ye-w-an
|-
|2nd
|yó-ŕuw-ow-an

|-

|-
|9th

|-
|10th
|ya-hee-yik-an
|}

The names of the days of the week for Tuesday through Saturday are the ordinals from 2nd through 6th without the suffix /an-/. Monday is sometimes referred to as ya-ye-w (1st) and Sunday ya-féh-úw (7th), but more commonly known as, hárin fáál (ending sacredness) and ránini pin (sacred day).&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt; However, Trukese words for the names of the week are more often heard but with a Puluwat accent.&lt;ref name="Elbert 0 85883 103 1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3039">'''Researchsome''' belongs to the -omics set of words, which comprises [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[metabolomics]] and  related words dealing with scientific research, mostly in the biological sciences and related disciplines, like [[bioinformatics]].

== Origin of term ==
Devised partly as a joke, the term was coined by Ivan Erill, from [[UMBC]], and first used in an oral communication at the 15th Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles (France) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) [http://sites.univ-provence.fr/evol-cgr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=40 "15th EBM PROGRAM"] ''Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles'.' Retrieved December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Erill 2011 EBM Conference Researchsome.png|thumb|The original researchsome slide by Ivan Erill at the 2011 EBM meeting]] As opposed to other -omic words, which originate as [[portmanteau]] from incorrect application of either the -some suffix (derived from the Greek σῶμα (soma, body) as in [[chromosome]] or the -nome suffix (from the Greek νόμος (nomos, "custom" or "law") as in [[economics]]),&lt;ref name="pmid118166670"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yadav SP | title = The wholeness in suffix -omics, -omes, and the word om | journal = J Biomol Tech | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 277 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18166670 | doi = | url = | issn = | pmc=2392988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9450566"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuska B | title = Beer, Bethesda, and biology: how "genomics" came into being | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 90 | issue = 2 | pages = 93 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9450566 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/90.2.93| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jong Bhak (2011) [http://omics.org/index.php/History_of_Omics "History of Omics"] ''The History of Omics: as a generic name for various omics and a standalone biology discipline.' Retrieved December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; researchsome is among the few newly minted words in the biosciences that derives properly from soma and should be read as "body of research". Obviously, the word has a [[double entendre]] interpretation as "some research".

== Application ==
As an entity, the researchsome is meant to be a graphical representation of the body of research conducted by a particular individual or organization. It depicts research fields and their interconnections, much in the same way that graphical renditions of [[interactome]]s outline molecules and their interactions. In its original application, the researchsome was designed to convey a rapid overview of a researcher's areas of expertise onto which the relevant fields for a given lecture or talk could be highlighted.

{{Millennium Problems}}
In mathematics, the '''Riemann hypothesis''' is a [[conjecture]] that the [[Riemann zeta function]] has its [[Root of a function|zeros]] only at the negative even integers and [[complex number]]s with [[real part]] {{sfrac|2}}. It was proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Bernhard|last= Riemann|year=1859|author-link=Bernhard Riemann}}, after whom it is named. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the [[Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields]].

The Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution of [[prime numbers]]. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem in [[pure mathematics]] {{harv|Bombieri|2000}}. The Riemann hypothesis and some of its generalizations, along with [[Goldbach's conjecture]] and the [[twin prime conjecture]], comprise [[Hilbert's eighth problem]] in [[David Hilbert]]'s list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems]]; it is also one of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]]'s [[Millennium Prize Problems]].

The Riemann zeta function ζ(''s'') is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[Argument of a function|argument]] ''s'' may be any [[complex number]] other than 1, and whose values are also complex. It has zeros at the negative even integers; that is, ζ(''s'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when ''s'' is one of −2, −4, −6,&amp;nbsp;.... These are called its '''trivial zeros'''. However, the negative even integers are not the only values for which the zeta function is zero. The other ones are called '''non-trivial zeros'''. The Riemann hypothesis is concerned with the locations of these non-trivial zeros, and states that:

{{bquote|The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2}}}}

Thus, if the hypothesis is correct, all the non-trivial zeros lie on the '''critical line''' consisting of the complex numbers {{nowrap|{{sfrac|2}} + ''i{{hsp}}t'',}} where ''t'' is a [[real number]] and ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]].

There are several nontechnical books on the Riemann hypothesis, such as {{harvtxt|Derbyshire|2003}}, {{harvtxt|Rockmore|2005}}, {{harvs|last=Sabbagh|year=2003a|year2=2003b}},
{{harvtxt|du Sautoy|2003}}. The books {{harvtxt|Edwards|1974}}, {{harvtxt|Patterson|1988}}, {{harvtxt|Borwein|Choi|Rooney|Weirathmueller|2008}}, {{harvtxt|Mazur|Stein|2015}} and {{harvtxt|Broughan|2017}} give mathematical introductions, while
{{harvtxt|Titchmarsh|1986}}, {{harvtxt|Ivić|1985}} and {{harvtxt|Karatsuba|Voronin|1992}} are advanced monographs.

==Riemann zeta function==
The [[Riemann zeta function]] is defined for complex ''s'' with real part greater than 1 by the [[Absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]] [[infinite series]]
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
[[Leonhard Euler]] already considered this series in the 1730s for real values of s, in conjunction with his solution to the [[Basel problem]]. He also proved that it equals the [[Euler product]]
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}= \frac{1}{1-2^{-s}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-3^{-s}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-5^{-s}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-7^{-s}} \cdot \frac{1}{1-11^{-s}} \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[infinite product]] extends over all prime numbers ''p''.&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Euler.  [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/docs/originals/E072.pdf Variae observationes circa series infinitas.] Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 9, 1744, pp. 160–188, Theorems 7 and 8. In Theorem 7 Euler proves the formula in the special case &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt;, and in Theorem 8 he proves it more generally. In the first corollary to his Theorem 7 he notes that   &lt;math&gt;\zeta(1)=\log\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and makes use of this latter result in his Theorem 19, in order to show that the sum of the inverses of the prime numbers is &lt;math&gt;\log\log\infty&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Riemann hypothesis discusses zeros outside the region of convergence of this series and Euler product. To make sense of the hypothesis, it is necessary to [[Analytic continuation|analytically continue]] the function to obtain a form that is valid for all complex ''s''. This is permissble because the zeta function is [[meromorphic]], so its analytic continuation is guaranteed to be unique and functional forms equivalent over their [[Domain of a function|domains]]. One begins by showing that the zeta function and the [[Dirichlet eta function]] satisfy the relation
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1-\frac{2}{2^s}\right)\zeta(s) = \eta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} - \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} - \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
But the series on the right converges not just when the real part of ''s'' is greater than one, but more generally whenever ''s'' has positive real part. Thus, this alternative series extends the zeta function from {{nowrap|Re(''s'') &gt; 1}} to the larger domain {{nowrap|Re(''s'') &gt; 0}}, excluding the zeros &lt;math&gt;s = 1 + 2\pi in/\ln(2)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;1-2/2^s&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Dirichlet eta function#Landau's problem with zeta(s)=eta(s)/0 and solutions|Dirichlet eta function]]). The zeta function can be extended to these values too by taking limits, giving a finite value for all values of ''s'' with positive real part except for the [[simple pole]] at ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

In the strip {{nowrap|0 &lt; Re(''s'') &lt; 1}} (and everywhere else) the zeta function satisfies the [[functional equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = 2^s\pi^{s-1}\ \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\ \Gamma(1-s)\ \zeta(1-s).&lt;/math&gt;
One may then define ζ(''s'') for all remaining nonzero complex numbers ''s'' by applying this equation outside the strip, and letting ζ(''s'') equal the right-hand side of the equation whenever ''s'' has non-positive real part.

If ''s'' is a negative even integer then ζ(''s'') = 0 because the factor sin(π''s''/2) vanishes; these are the '''trivial zeros''' of the zeta function. (If ''s'' is a positive even integer this argument does not apply because the zeros of the [[sine]] function are cancelled by the poles of the [[gamma function]] as it takes negative integer arguments.) The value [[1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · ·|ζ(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2]] is not determined by the functional equation, but is the limiting value of ζ(''s'') as ''s'' approaches zero. The functional equation also implies that the zeta function has no zeros with negative real part other than the trivial zeros, so all non-trivial zeros lie in the '''critical strip''' where ''s'' has real part between 0 and 1.

==Origin==
{{quote | text="{{lang|de|...es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass alle Wurzeln reell sind. Hiervon wäre allerdings ein strenger Beweis zu wünschen; ich habe indess die Aufsuchung desselben nach einigen flüchtigen vergeblichen Versuchen vorläufig bei Seite gelassen, da er für den nächsten Zweck meiner Untersuchung entbehrlich schien.}}"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;("…it is very probable that all roots are real. Of course one would wish for a rigorous proof here; I have for the time being, after some fleeting vain attempts, provisionally put aside the search for this, as it appears dispensable for the immediate objective of my investigation.")|source=Riemann's statement of the Riemann hypothesis, from {{harv|Riemann|1859}}. (He was discussing a version of the zeta function, modified so that its roots (zeros) are real rather than on the critical line.)}}

Riemann's original motivation for studying the zeta function and its zeros was their occurrence in his [[Explicit formulae (L-function)|explicit formula]] for the [[prime-counting function|number of primes]] π(''x'') less than a given number ''x'', which he published in his 1859 paper "[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude]]". His formula was given in terms of the related function
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\Pi(x) = {} &amp; \pi(x) +\tfrac{1}{2}\pi(x^{\frac{1}{2}}) +\tfrac{1}{3} \pi(x^{\frac{1}{3}}) +\tfrac{1}{4}\pi(x^{\frac{1}{4}}) \\
&amp; {} +\tfrac{1}{5}\pi(x^{\frac{1}{5}}) +\tfrac{1}{6}\pi(x^{\frac{1}{6}}) +\cdots\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which counts the primes and prime powers up to ''x'', counting a prime power ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as 1/''n'' of a prime. The number of primes can be recovered from this function by using the [[Möbius inversion formula]],
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \pi(x) &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mu(n)}{n}\Pi(x^{\frac{1}{n}}) \\ &amp;= \Pi(x) -\frac{1}{2}\Pi(x^{\frac{1}{2}}) -\frac{1}{3}\Pi(x^{\frac{1}{3}})  -\frac{1}{5}\Pi(x^{\frac{1}{5}}) + \frac{1}{6}\Pi(x^{\frac{1}{6}}) -\cdots, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''μ'' is the [[Möbius function]]. Riemann's formula is then

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\Pi_0(x) &amp;= \operatorname{Li}(x) - \sum_\rho \operatorname{Li}(x^\rho) -\log(2) + \int_x^\infty\frac{dt}{t(t^2-1)\log(t)}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is over the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and where Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a slightly modified version of Π that replaces its value at its points of discontinuity by the average of its upper and lower limits:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_0(x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\frac{\Pi(x-\varepsilon) + \Pi(x+\varepsilon)}2. &lt;/math&gt;

The summation in Riemann's formula is not [[Absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]], but may be evaluated by taking the zeros ρ in order of the absolute value of their imaginary part. The function Li occurring in the first term is the (unoffset) [[logarithmic integral function]] given by the [[Cauchy principal value]] of the divergent integral

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}(x) = \int_0^x\frac{dt}{\log(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The terms Li(''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ρ''&lt;/sup&gt;) involving the zeros of the zeta function need some care in their definition as Li has branch points at 0 and 1, and are defined (for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1) by analytic continuation in the complex variable ''ρ'' in the region Re(''ρ'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, i.e. they should be considered as {{nowrap|[[Exponential integral|Ei]](''ρ'' ln ''x'')}}. The other terms also correspond to zeros: the dominant term Li(''x'') comes from the pole at ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, considered as a zero of multiplicity −1, and the remaining small terms come from the trivial zeros. For some graphs of the sums of the first few terms of this series see {{harvtxt|Riesel|Göhl|1970}} or {{harvtxt|Zagier|1977}}.

This formula says that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function control the oscillations of primes around their "expected" positions. Riemann knew that the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function were symmetrically distributed about the line {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1/2 + ''it'',}} and he knew that all of its non-trivial zeros must lie in the range {{nowrap|0 ≤ Re(''s'') ≤ 1.}} He checked that a few of the zeros lay on the critical line with real part 1/2 and suggested that they all do; this is the Riemann hypothesis.

{{quote box|quote=The result has caught the imagination of most mathematicians because it is so unexpected, connecting two seemingly unrelated areas in mathematics; namely, [[number theory]], which is the study of the discrete, and [[complex analysis]], which deals with continuous processes. {{harv|Burton|2006|p=376}}}}
{{clear}}

==Consequences==
The practical uses of the Riemann hypothesis include many propositions known true under the Riemann hypothesis, and some that can be shown to be equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.

===Distribution of prime numbers===
[[Riemann's explicit formula]] for [[prime counting function|the number of primes less than a given number]] in terms of a sum over the zeros of the Riemann zeta function says that the magnitude of the oscillations of primes around their expected position is controlled by the real parts of the zeros of the zeta function. In particular the error term in the [[prime number theorem]] is closely related to the position of the zeros. For example, if β is the upper bound of the real parts of the zeros, then the difference π(''x'') - Li(''x'') has the error bound O(''x''&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt; log(''x'')) {{harv|Ingham|1932}}.{{rp|Theorem 30}}
It is already known that 1/2 ≤ β ≤ 1 {{harv|Ingham|1932}}.{{rp|p. 82}}

[[#CITEREFvon Koch1901|Von Koch (1901)]] proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies the "best possible" bound for the error of the prime number theorem. A precise version of Koch's result, due to {{harvtxt|Schoenfeld|1976}}, says that the Riemann hypothesis implies

:&lt;math&gt;|\pi(x) - \operatorname{li}(x)| &lt; \frac{1}{8\pi} \sqrt{x} \log(x), \qquad \text{for all } x \ge 2657,&lt;/math&gt;
where π(''x'') is the [[prime-counting function]], and log(''x'') is the [[natural logarithm]] of ''x''.

{{harvtxt|Schoenfeld|1976}} also showed that the Riemann hypothesis implies

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi(x) - x| &lt; \frac{1}{8\pi} \sqrt{x} \log^2(x), \qquad \text{for all } x \ge 73.2, &lt;/math&gt;

where ψ(''x'') is [[Chebyshev function|Chebyshev's second function]].

{{harvtxt|Dudek|2014}} proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies there is a prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; satisfying&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;x - \frac{4}{\pi} \sqrt{x} \log x &lt; p \leq x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;for all &lt;math&gt;x \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;. This is an explicit version of a theorem of [[Cramér]].

===Growth of arithmetic functions===
The Riemann hypothesis implies strong bounds on the growth of many other arithmetic functions, in addition to the primes counting function above.

One example involves the [[Möbius function]] μ. The statement that the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

is valid for every ''s'' with real part greater than 1/2, with the sum on the right hand side converging, is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. From this we can also conclude that if the [[Mertens function]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;M(x) = \sum_{n \le x} \mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;

then the claim that

:&lt;math&gt;M(x) = O(x^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

for every positive ε is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis ([[John Edensor Littlewood|J.E. Littlewood]], 1912; see for instance: paragraph 14.25 in {{harvtxt|Titchmarsh|1986}}). (For the meaning of these symbols, see [[Big O notation]].) The determinant of the order ''n'' [[Redheffer matrix]] is equal to ''M''(''n''), so the Riemann hypothesis can also be stated as a condition on the growth of these determinants. The Riemann hypothesis puts a rather tight bound on the growth of ''M'', since {{harvtxt|Odlyzko|te Riele|1985}} disproved the slightly stronger [[Mertens conjecture]]

:&lt;math&gt;|M(x)| \le \sqrt x.&lt;/math&gt;

The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to many other conjectures about the rate of growth of other arithmetic functions aside from μ(''n''). A typical example is [[Robin's theorem]] {{harv|Robin|1984}}, which states that if σ(''n'') is the [[divisor function]], given by

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(n) = \sum_{d\mid n} d&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(n) &lt; e^\gamma n \log \log n&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''n'' &gt; 5040 if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true, where γ is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]].

Another example was found by [[Jérôme Franel]], and extended by [[Edmund Landau|Landau]] (see {{harvtxt|Franel|Landau|1924}}). The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to several statements showing that the terms of the [[Farey sequence]] are fairly regular. One such equivalence is as follows: if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Farey sequence of order ''n'', beginning with 1/''n'' and up to 1/1, then the claim that for all ε &gt; 0

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^m|F_n(i) - \tfrac{i}{m}| = O(n^{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Here

:&lt;math&gt;m = \sum_{i=1}^n\phi(i)&lt;/math&gt;

is the number of terms in the Farey sequence of order ''n''.

For an example from [[group theory]], if ''g''(''n'') is [[Landau's function]] given by the maximal order of elements of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of degree ''n'', then {{harvtxt|Massias|Nicolas|Robin|1988}} showed that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the bound

:&lt;math&gt;\log g(n) &lt; \sqrt{\operatorname{Li}^{-1}(n)}&lt;/math&gt;

for all sufficiently large ''n''.

===Lindelöf hypothesis and growth of the zeta function===
The Riemann hypothesis has various weaker consequences as well; one is the '''[[Lindelöf hypothesis]]''' on the rate of growth of the zeta function on the critical line, which says that, for any ''ε'' &gt; 0,

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2} + it\right) = O(t^\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

as ''t'' → ∞.

The Riemann hypothesis also implies quite sharp bounds for the growth rate of the zeta function in other regions of the critical strip. For example, it implies that

:&lt;math&gt; e^\gamma\le \limsup_{t\rightarrow +\infty}\frac{|\zeta(1+it)|}{\log\log t}\le 2e^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{6}{\pi^2}e^\gamma\le \limsup_{t\rightarrow +\infty}\frac{1/|\zeta(1+it)|}{\log\log t}\le \frac{12}{\pi^2}e^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

so the growth rate of ζ(1+''it'') and its inverse would be known up to a factor of 2 {{harv|Titchmarsh|1986}}.

===Large prime gap conjecture===
The prime number theorem implies that on average, the [[prime gap|gap]] between the prime ''p'' and its successor is log&amp;nbsp;''p''. However, some gaps between primes may be much larger than the average. [[Harald Cramér|Cramér]] proved that, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, every gap is ''O''({{radic|''p''}}&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''p''). This is a case in which even the best bound that can be proved using the Riemann hypothesis is far weaker than what seems true: [[Cramér's conjecture]] implies that every gap is ''O''((log&amp;nbsp;''p'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which, while larger than the average gap, is far smaller than the bound implied by the Riemann hypothesis. Numerical evidence supports Cramér's conjecture {{harv|Nicely|1999}}.

===Criteria equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis===
Many statements equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis have been found, though so far none of them have led to much progress in proving (or disproving) it. Some typical examples are as follows. (Others involve the [[Divisor function#Growth rate|divisor function]] σ(''n'').)

The [[Riesz criterion]] was given by {{harvtxt|Riesz|1916}}, to the effect that the bound

:&lt;math&gt;-\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-x)^k}{(k-1)! \zeta(2k)}= O\left(x^{\frac{1}{4}+\epsilon}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

holds for all ε &gt; 0 if and only if the Riemann hypothesis holds.

{{harvtxt|Nyman|1950}} proved that the Riemann hypothesis is true if and only if the space of functions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{\nu=1}^nc_\nu\rho \left(\frac{\theta_\nu}{x} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ(''z'') is the fractional part of ''z'', {{nowrap|0 ≤ θ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1}}, and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\nu=1}^nc_\nu\theta_\nu=0&lt;/math&gt;,

is dense in the [[Lp_space|Hilbert space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0,1)]] of square-integrable functions on the unit interval. {{harvtxt|Beurling|1955}} extended this by showing that the zeta function has no zeros with real part greater than 1/''p'' if and only if this function space is dense in ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(0,1)

{{harvtxt|Salem|1953}} showed that the Riemann hypothesis is true if and only if the integral equation

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^\infty\frac{z^{-\sigma-1}\phi(z)}{{e^{x/z}}+1}\,dz=0 &lt;/math&gt;

has no non-trivial bounded solutions &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;\sigma &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Weil's criterion]] is the statement that the positivity of a certain function is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Related is [[Li's criterion]], a statement that the positivity of a certain sequence of numbers is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.

{{harvtxt|Speiser|1934}} proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that &lt;math&gt;\zeta'(s)&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt;, has no zeros in the strip

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \Re(s) &lt; \frac12.&lt;/math&gt;

That &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; has only simple zeros on the critical line is equivalent to its derivative having no zeros on the critical line.

The [[Farey sequence#Riemann hypothesis|Farey sequence]] provides two equivalences, due to [[Jerome Franel]] and [[Edmund Landau]] in 1924.

===Consequences of the generalized Riemann hypothesis===
Several applications use the [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] for [[Dirichlet L-series]] or [[Dedekind zeta function|zeta functions of number fields]] rather than just the Riemann hypothesis. Many basic properties of the Riemann zeta function can easily be generalized to all Dirichlet L-series, so it is plausible that a method that proves the Riemann hypothesis for the Riemann zeta function would also work for the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions. Several results first proved using the generalized Riemann hypothesis were later given unconditional proofs without using it, though these were usually much harder. Many of the consequences on the following list are taken from {{harvtxt|Conrad|2010}}.
* In 1913, [[Thomas Hakon Grönwall|Grönwall]] showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies that Gauss's [[class number problem|list of imaginary quadratic fields with class number 1]] is complete, though Baker, Stark and Heegner later gave unconditional proofs of this without using the generalized Riemann hypothesis.
* In 1917, Hardy and Littlewood showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies a conjecture of Chebyshev that
:: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 1^-}\sum_{p&gt;2}(-1)^{(p+1)/2}x^p=+\infty,&lt;/math&gt;
:which says that in some sense primes 3 mod 4 are more common than primes 1 mod 4.
* In 1923 Hardy and Littlewood showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies a weak form of the [[Goldbach conjecture]] for odd numbers: that every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of three primes, though in 1937 Vinogradov gave an unconditional proof. In 1997 [[Jean-Marc Deshouillers|Deshouillers]], Effinger, [[Herman te Riele|te Riele]], and Zinoviev showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies that every odd number greater than 5 is the sum of three primes.
* In 1934, Chowla showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies that the first prime in the arithmetic progression ''a'' mod ''m'' is at most ''Km''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;log(''m'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for some fixed constant ''K''.
* In 1967, Hooley showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies [[Artin's conjecture on primitive roots]].
* In 1973, Weinberger showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies that Euler's list of [[idoneal number]]s is complete.
* {{harvtxt|Weinberger|1973}} showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the zeta functions of all algebraic number fields implies that any number field with class number 1 is either [[Euclidean domain|Euclidean]] or an imaginary quadratic number field of discriminant −19, −43, −67, or −163.
* In 1976, G. Miller showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies that one can [[primality test|test if a number is prime]] in polynomial time via the [[Miller–Rabin primality test|Miller test]]. In 2002, Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena proved this result unconditionally using the [[AKS primality test]].
* {{harvtxt|Odlyzko|1990}} discussed how the generalized Riemann hypothesis can be used to give sharper estimates for discriminants and class numbers of number fields.
* {{harvtxt|Ono|Soundararajan|1997}} showed that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies that [[Ramanujan's ternary quadratic form|Ramanujan's integral quadratic form]] {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 10''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} represents all integers that it represents locally, with exactly 18 exceptions.

===Excluded middle===
Some consequences of the RH are also consequences of its negation, and are thus theorems. In their discussion of the [[#Gauss's class number conjecture|Hecke, Deuring, Mordell, Heilbronn theorem]], {{harv|Ireland|Rosen|1990|p=359}} say

&lt;blockquote&gt;The method of proof here is truly amazing. If the generalized Riemann  hypothesis is true, then the theorem is true. If the generalized Riemann  hypothesis is false, then the theorem is true. Thus, the theorem is true!! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (punctuation in original)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Care should be taken to understand what is meant by saying the generalized Riemann hypothesis is false: one should specify exactly which class of Dirichlet series has a counterexample.

====Littlewood's theorem====
This concerns the sign of the error in the [[prime number theorem]].
It has been computed that π(''x'') &lt; Li(''x'') for all ''x'' ≤ 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;,{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and no value of ''x'' is known for which π(''x'') &gt; Li(''x''). See this [[Prime number theorem#Table of .CF.80.28x.29.2C x .2F ln x.2C and li.28x.29|table]].

In 1914 Littlewood proved that there are arbitrarily large values of ''x'' for which
:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&gt;\operatorname{Li}(x) +\frac13\frac{\sqrt x}{\log x}\log\log\log x,&lt;/math&gt;
and that there are also arbitrarily large values of ''x'' for which
:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;\operatorname{Li}(x) -\frac13\frac{\sqrt x}{\log x}\log\log\log x.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the difference π(''x'') − Li(''x'') changes sign infinitely many times. [[Skewes' number]] is an estimate of the value of ''x'' corresponding to the first sign change.

Littlewood's proof is divided into two cases: the RH is assumed false (about half a page of {{harvnb|Ingham|1932|loc=Chapt. V}}), and the RH is assumed true (about a dozen pages).

====Gauss's class number conjecture====
This is the [[Class number problem|conjecture]] (first stated in article 303 of Gauss's [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]])  that there are only a finite number of imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number. One way to prove it would be to show that as the discriminant ''D'' → −∞ the class number ''h''(''D'') →  ∞.

The following sequence of theorems involving the Riemann hypothesis is described in {{Harvnb|Ireland|Rosen|1990|pp=358–361}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem (Hecke; 1918).''' Let ''D'' &lt; 0 be the discriminant of an imaginary quadratic number field ''K''. Assume the generalized Riemann hypothesis for ''L''-functions of all imaginary quadratic Dirichlet characters. Then there is an absolute constant ''C'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;h(D) &gt; C\frac{\sqrt{|D|}}{\log |D|}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem (Deuring; 1933).''' If the RH is false then ''h''(''D'') &gt; 1 if |''D''| is sufficiently large.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem (Mordell; 1934).''' If the RH is false then ''h''(''D'') → ∞ as ''D'' → −∞.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem (Heilbronn; 1934).''' If the generalized RH is false for the ''L''-function of some imaginary quadratic Dirichlet character then ''h''(''D'') → ∞ as ''D'' → −∞.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(In the work of Hecke and Heilbronn, the only ''L''-functions that occur are those attached to imaginary quadratic characters, and it is only for those ''L''-functions that ''GRH is true'' or ''GRH is false'' is intended; a failure of GRH for the ''L''-function of a cubic Dirichlet character would, strictly speaking, mean GRH is false, but that was not the kind of failure of GRH that Heilbronn had in mind, so his assumption was more restricted than simply ''GRH is false''.)

In 1935, [[Carl Siegel]] later strengthened the result without using RH or GRH in any way.

====Growth of Euler's totient====
In 1983 [[Jean-Louis Nicolas|J. L. Nicolas]] proved {{harv|Ribenboim|1996|p=320}} that

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) &lt; e^{-\gamma}\frac  {n} {\log \log n} &lt;/math&gt;

for infinitely many ''n'', where φ(''n'') is [[Euler's totient function]] and γ is [[Euler's constant]].

Ribenboim remarks that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The method of proof is interesting, in that the inequality is shown first under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true, secondly under the contrary assumption.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Generalizations and analogs==
===Dirichlet L-series and other number fields===
The Riemann hypothesis can be generalized by replacing the Riemann zeta function by the formally similar, but much more general, global [[L-function]]s. In this broader setting, one expects the non-trivial zeros of the global ''L''-functions to have real part 1/2. It is these conjectures, rather than the classical Riemann hypothesis only for the single Riemann zeta function, which account for the true importance of the Riemann hypothesis in mathematics.

The [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] extends the Riemann hypothesis to all [[Dirichlet L-function]]s. In particular it implies the conjecture that [[Siegel zero]]s (zeros of ''L''-functions between 1/2 and 1) do not exist.

The [[extended Riemann hypothesis]] extends the Riemann hypothesis to all [[Dedekind zeta function]]s of [[algebraic number field]]s. The extended Riemann hypothesis for abelian extension of the rationals is equivalent to the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The Riemann hypothesis can also be extended to the ''L''-functions of [[Hecke character]]s of number fields.

The [[grand Riemann hypothesis]] extends it to all [[Automorphic L-function|automorphic zeta functions]], such as [[Mellin transform]]s of [[Hecke eigenform]]s.

===Function fields and zeta functions of varieties over finite fields===
{{harvtxt|Artin|1924}} introduced global zeta functions of (quadratic) [[Function field of an algebraic variety|function fields]] and conjectured an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for them, which has been proved by Hasse in the genus 1 case and by {{harvtxt|Weil|1948}} in general. For instance, the fact that the [[quadratic Gauss sum|Gauss sum]], of the quadratic character of a [[finite field]] of size ''q'' (with ''q'' odd), has absolute value &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{q}&lt;/math&gt; is actually an instance of the Riemann hypothesis in the function field setting. This led {{harvtxt|Weil|1949}} to conjecture a similar statement for all [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]; the resulting [[Weil conjectures]] were proved by {{harvs|txt|first=Pierre|last=Deligne|authorlink=Pierre Deligne|year1=1974|year2=1980}}.

===Arithmetic zeta functions of arithmetic schemes and their L-factors===
[[Arithmetic zeta function]]s generalise the Riemann and Dedekind zeta functions as well as the zeta functions of varieties over finite fields to every arithmetic scheme or a scheme of finite type over integers. The arithmetic zeta function of a regular connected [[equidimensionality|equidimensional]] arithmetic scheme of Kronecker dimension ''n'' can be factorized into the product of appropriately defined L-factors and an auxiliary factor {{harvs|txt|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Serre|authorlink=J.-P. Serre|year1=1969–1970}}. Assuming a functional equation and meromorphic continuation, the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the L-factor states that its zeros inside the critical strip &lt;math&gt;\Re(s)\in (0,n)&lt;/math&gt; lie on the central line. Correspondingly, the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the arithmetic zeta function of a regular connected equidimensional arithmetic scheme states that its zeros inside the critical strip  lie on vertical lines &lt;math&gt;\Re(s)=1/2,3/2,\dots,n-1/2&lt;/math&gt; and its poles inside the critical strip lie on  vertical lines &lt;math&gt;\Re(s)=1, 2, \dots,n-1&lt;/math&gt;. This is known for schemes in positive characteristic and follows from {{harvs|txt|first=Pierre|last=Deligne|authorlink=Pierre Deligne|year1=1974|year2=1980}}, but remains entirely unknown in characteristic zero.

===Selberg zeta functions===
{{main|Selberg zeta function}}
{{harvtxt|Selberg|1956}} introduced the [[Selberg zeta function]] of a Riemann surface. These are similar to the Riemann zeta function: they have a functional equation, and an infinite product similar to the Euler product but taken over closed geodesics rather than primes. The [[Selberg trace formula]] is the analogue for these functions of the [[explicit formula (L-function)|explicit formulas]] in prime number theory. Selberg proved that the Selberg zeta functions satisfy the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis, with the imaginary parts of their zeros related to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator of the Riemann surface.

===Ihara zeta functions===
The [[Ihara zeta function]] of a finite graph is an analogue of the [[Selberg zeta function]], which was first introduced by [[Yasutaka Ihara]] in the context of discrete subgroups of the two-by-two p-adic special linear group. A regular finite graph is a [[Ramanujan graph]], a mathematical model of efficient communication networks, if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis as was pointed out by [[Toshikazu Sunada|T. Sunada]].

===Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture===
{{harvtxt|Montgomery|1973}} suggested the [[pair correlation conjecture]] that the correlation functions of the (suitably normalized) zeros of the zeta function should be the same as those of the eigenvalues of a [[Gaussian unitary ensemble|random hermitian matrix]]. {{harvtxt|Odlyzko|1987}} showed that this is supported by large scale numerical calculations of these correlation functions.

Montgomery showed that (assuming the Riemann hypothesis) at least 2/3 of all zeros are simple, and a related conjecture is that all zeros of the zeta function are simple (or more generally have no non-trivial integer linear relations between their imaginary parts). [[Dedekind zeta function]]s of algebraic number fields, which generalize the Riemann zeta function, often do have multiple complex zeros {{harv|Radziejewski|2007}}. This is because the Dedekind zeta functions factorize as a product of powers of [[Artin L-function]]s, so zeros of Artin L-functions sometimes give rise to multiple zeros of Dedekind zeta functions. Other examples of zeta functions with multiple zeros are the L-functions of some [[elliptic curve]]s: these can have multiple zeros at the real point of their critical line; the [[Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]] predicts that the multiplicity of this zero is the rank of the elliptic curve.

===Other zeta functions===
There are [[zeta function|many other examples]] of zeta functions with analogues of the Riemann hypothesis, some of which have been proved. [[Goss zeta function]]s of function fields have a Riemann hypothesis, proved by {{harvtxt|Sheats|1998}}. [[Main conjecture of Iwasawa theory|The main conjecture]] of [[Iwasawa theory]], proved by [[Barry Mazur]] and [[Andrew Wiles]] for [[cyclotomic field]]s, and Wiles for [[totally real number field|totally real fields]], identifies the zeros of a ''p''-adic ''L''-function with the eigenvalues of an operator, so can be thought of as an analogue of the [[Hilbert–Pólya conjecture]] for [[p-adic L-function|''p''-adic ''L''-functions]] {{harv|Wiles|2000}}.

==Attempted proofs==
Several mathematicians have addressed the Riemann hypothesis, but none of their attempts have yet been accepted as a correct solution. {{harvtxt|Watkins|2007}} lists some incorrect solutions, and more are [https://arxiv.org/find/grp_math/1/AND+ti:+AND+Riemann+hypothesis+subj:+AND+General+mathematics/0/1/0/all/0/1 frequently announced].

===Operator theory===
{{main|Hilbert–Pólya conjecture}}

Hilbert and Pólya suggested that one way to derive the Riemann hypothesis would be to find a [[self-adjoint operator]], from the existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeros of ζ(''s'') would follow when one applies the criterion on real [[eigenvalue]]s. Some support for this idea comes from several analogues of the Riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues of some operator: the zeros of a zeta function of a variety over a finite field correspond to eigenvalues of a [[Frobenius element]] on an [[étale cohomology]] group, the zeros of a [[Selberg zeta function]] are eigenvalues of a [[Laplacian operator]] of a Riemann surface, and the zeros of a [[p-adic zeta function]] correspond to eigenvectors of a Galois action on [[ideal class group]]s.

{{harvtxt|Odlyzko|1987}} showed that the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function shares some statistical properties with the eigenvalues of [[random matrices]] drawn from the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]]. This gives some support to the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture.

In 1999, [[Michael Berry (physicist)|Michael Berry]] and [[Jonathan Keating]] conjectured that there is some unknown quantization &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; of the classical Hamiltonian ''H'' = ''xp'' so that

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta (1/2+i\hat H) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and even more strongly, that the Riemann zeros coincide with the spectrum of the operator &lt;math&gt;1/2 + i \hat H&lt;/math&gt;. This is in contrast to [[canonical quantization]], which leads to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] &lt;math&gt;[x,p]=1/2&lt;/math&gt; and the [[natural numbers]] as spectrum of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. The crucial point is that the Hamiltonian should be a self-adjoint operator so that the quantization would be a realization of the Hilbert–Pólya program. In a connection with this quantum mechanical problem Berry and Connes had proposed that the inverse of the potential of the Hamiltonian is connected to the half-derivative of the function

:&lt;math&gt; N(s)= \frac{1}{\pi}\operatorname{Arg}\xi(1/2+i\sqrt s)&lt;/math&gt;

then, in Berry–Connes approach

:&lt;math&gt; V^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{4\pi} \frac{d^{1/2}N(x)}{dx^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

{{harv|Connes|1999}}. This yields a Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are the square of the imaginary part of the Riemann zeros, and also that the functional determinant of this Hamiltonian operator is just the [[Riemann Xi function]]. In fact the Riemann Xi function would be proportional to the functional determinant (Hadamard product)

:&lt;math&gt; \det(H+1/4+s(s-1)) &lt;/math&gt;

as proved by Connes and others, in this approach

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\xi(s)}{\xi(0)}=\frac{\det(H+s(s-1)+1/4)}{\det(H+1/4)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The analogy with the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields suggests that the Hilbert space containing eigenvectors corresponding to the zeros might be some sort of first cohomology group of the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] Spec('''Z''') of the integers. {{harvtxt|Deninger|1998}} described some of the attempts to find such a cohomology theory {{harv|Leichtnam|2005}}.

{{harvtxt|Zagier|1981}} constructed a natural space of invariant functions on the upper half plane that has eigenvalues under the Laplacian operator that correspond to zeros of the Riemann zeta function—and remarked that in the unlikely event that one could show the existence of a suitable positive definite inner product on this space, the Riemann hypothesis would follow. {{harvtxt|Cartier|1982}} discussed a related example, where due to a bizarre bug a computer program listed zeros of the Riemann zeta function as eigenvalues of the same Laplacian operator.

{{harvtxt|Schumayer|Hutchinson|2011}} surveyed some of the attempts to construct a suitable physical model related to the Riemann zeta function.

=== Lee–Yang theorem ===
The [[Lee–Yang theorem]] states that the zeros of certain partition functions in statistical mechanics all lie on a "critical line" with their real part equals to 0, and this has led to some speculation about a relationship with the Riemann hypothesis {{harv|Knauf|1999}}.

===Turán's result===
{{harvs|authorlink=Pál Turán|first=Pál |last=Turán|year=1948|txt}} showed that if the functions

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N n^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

have no zeros when the real part of ''s'' is greater than one then

:&lt;math&gt;T(x) = \sum_{n\le x}\frac{\lambda(n)}{n}\ge 0\text{ for } x &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where λ(''n'') is the [[Liouville function]] given by (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; if ''n'' has ''r'' prime factors. He showed that this in turn would imply that the Riemann hypothesis is true. However {{harvtxt|Haselgrove|1958}} proved that ''T''(''x'') is negative for infinitely many ''x'' (and also disproved the closely related [[Pólya conjecture]]), and {{harvtxt|Borwein|Ferguson|Mossinghoff|2008}} showed that the smallest such ''x'' is {{gaps|72|185|376|951|205}}. {{harvtxt|Spira|1968}} showed by numerical calculation that the finite Dirichlet series above for ''N''=19 has a zero with real part greater than 1. Turán also showed that a somewhat weaker assumption, the nonexistence of zeros with real part greater than 1+''N''&lt;sup&gt;−1/2+ε&lt;/sup&gt; for large ''N'' in the finite Dirichlet series above, would also imply the Riemann hypothesis, but {{harvtxt|Montgomery|1983}} showed that for all sufficiently large ''N'' these series have zeros with real part greater than {{nowrap|1 + (log log ''N'')/(4 log ''N'')}}. Therefore, Turán's result is [[vacuous truth|vacuously true]] and cannot be used to help prove the Riemann hypothesis.

===Noncommutative geometry===
{{harvs|last=Connes|authorlink=Alain Connes|year1=1999|year2=2000|txt}} has described a relationship between the Riemann hypothesis and [[noncommutative geometry]], and shows that a suitable analog of the [[Selberg trace formula]] for the action of the [[idèle class group]] on the adèle class space would imply the Riemann hypothesis. Some of these ideas are elaborated in {{harvtxt|Lapidus|2008}}.

===Hilbert spaces of entire functions===
{{harvs|txt||first =Louis|last=de Branges |year=1992 |authorlink=Louis de Branges}} showed that the Riemann hypothesis would follow from a positivity condition on a certain Hilbert space of [[entire function]]s.
However {{harvtxt|Conrey|Li|2000}} showed that the necessary positivity conditions are not satisfied. Despite this obstacle, de Branges has continued to work on an attempted proof of the Riemann hypothesis along the same lines, but this has not been widely accepted by other mathematicians {{harv|Sarnak|2005}}.

===Quasicrystals===
The Riemann hypothesis implies that the zeros of the zeta function form a [[quasicrystal]], meaning a distribution with discrete support whose Fourier transform also has discrete support.
{{harvtxt|Dyson|2009}} suggested trying to prove the Riemann hypothesis by classifying, or at least studying, 1-dimensional quasicrystals.

===Arithmetic zeta functions of models of elliptic curves over number fields===
When one goes from geometric dimension one, e.g. an algebraic number field, to geometric dimension two, e.g. a regular model of an [[elliptic curve]] over a number field, the two-dimensional part of the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the [[arithmetic zeta function]] of the model deals with the poles of the zeta function. In dimension one the study of the zeta integral in [[Tate's thesis]] does not lead to new important information on the Riemann hypothesis. Contrary to this, in dimension two work of [[Ivan Fesenko]] on two-dimensional generalisation of Tate's thesis includes an integral representation of a zeta integral closely related to the zeta function. In this new situation, not possible in dimension one, the poles of the zeta function can be studied via the zeta integral and associated adele groups.  Related conjecture of {{harvs|last=Fesenko|authorlink=Ivan Fesenko|year1=2010|txt}} on the positivity of the fourth derivative of a boundary function associated to the zeta integral essentially implies the pole part of the generalized Riemann hypothesis. {{harvs|last=Suzuki|year1=2011|txt}} proved that the latter, together with some technical assumptions, implies Fesenko's conjecture.

===Multiple zeta functions===
Deligne's proof of the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields used the zeta functions of product varieties, whose zeros and poles correspond to sums of zeros and poles of the original zeta function, in order to bound the real parts of the zeros of the original zeta function. By analogy, {{harvtxt|Kurokawa|1992}} introduced multiple zeta functions whose zeros and poles correspond to sums of zeros and poles of the Riemann zeta function. To make the series converge he restricted to sums of zeros or poles all with non-negative imaginary part. So far, the known bounds on the zeros and poles of the multiple zeta functions are not strong enough to give useful estimates for the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

==Location of the zeros==
===Number of zeros===
The functional equation combined with the [[argument principle]] implies that the number of zeros of the zeta function with imaginary part between 0 and ''T'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;N(T)=\frac{1}{\pi}\mathop{\mathrm{Arg}}(\xi(s)) = \frac{1}{\pi}\mathop{\mathrm{Arg}}(\Gamma(\tfrac{s}{2})\pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\zeta(s)s(s-1)/2)&lt;/math&gt;
for ''s''=1/2+i''T'', where the argument is defined by varying it continuously along the line with Im(''s'')=''T'', starting with argument 0 at ∞+i''T''. This is the sum of a large but well understood term
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi}\mathop{\mathrm{Arg}}(\Gamma(\tfrac{s}{2})\pi^{-s/2}s(s-1)/2) = \frac{T}{2\pi}\log\frac{T}{2\pi}-\frac{T}{2\pi} +7/8+O(1/T) &lt;/math&gt;
and a small but rather mysterious term
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = \frac{1}{\pi}\mathop{\mathrm{Arg}}(\zeta(1/2+iT)) =O(\log(T)).&lt;/math&gt;
So the density of zeros with imaginary part near ''T'' is about log(''T'')/2π, and the function ''S'' describes the small deviations from this. The function ''S''(''t'') jumps by 1 at each zero of the zeta function, and for {{nowrap|''t'' ≥ 8}} it decreases monotonically between zeros with derivative close to −log ''t''.

[[Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba|Karatsuba]] (1996) proved that every interval (''T'', ''T''+''H''] for &lt;math&gt;H \ge T^{\frac{27}{82}+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; contains at least
: &lt;math&gt; H(\ln T)^{\frac{1}{3}}e^{-c\sqrt{\ln\ln T}} &lt;/math&gt;
points where the function ''S''(''t'') changes sign.

{{harvtxt|Selberg|1946}} showed that the average moments of even powers of ''S'' are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^T|S(t)|^{2k}dt = \frac{(2k)!}{k!(2\pi)^{2k}}T(\log \log T)^k + O(T(\log \log T)^{k-1/2}).&lt;/math&gt;

This suggests that ''S''(''T'')/(log log ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; resembles a [[Gaussian random variable]] with mean 0 and variance 2π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ({{harvtxt|Ghosh|1983}} proved this fact).
In particular |''S''(''T'')| is usually somewhere around (log log ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, but occasionally much larger. The exact order of growth of ''S''(''T'') is not known. There has been no unconditional improvement to Riemann's original bound ''S''(''T'')=O(log ''T''), though the Riemann hypothesis implies the slightly smaller bound ''S''(''T'')=O(log ''T''/log log ''T'') {{harv|Titchmarsh|1986}}. The true order of magnitude may be somewhat less than this, as random functions with the same distribution as ''S''(''T'') tend to have growth of order about log(''T'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. In the other direction it cannot be too small: {{harvtxt|Selberg|1946}} showed that {{nowrap|''S''(''T'') ≠ o((log ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;/(log log ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;7/3&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, and assuming the Riemann hypothesis Montgomery showed that {{nowrap|''S''(''T'') ≠ o((log ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;/(log log ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

Numerical calculations confirm that ''S'' grows very slowly: |''S''(''T'')|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1 for {{nowrap|''T'' &lt; 280}}, |''S''(''T'')|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;2 for ''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;{{gaps|6|800|000}}, and the largest value of |''S''(''T'')| found so far is not much larger than 3 {{harv|Odlyzko|2002}}.

Riemann's estimate ''S''(''T'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;O(log ''T'') implies that the gaps between zeros are bounded, and Littlewood improved this slightly, showing that the gaps between their imaginary parts tends to 0.

===Theorem of Hadamard and de la Vallée-Poussin===
{{harvtxt|Hadamard|1896}} and {{harvtxt|de la Vallée-Poussin|1896}} independently proved that no zeros could lie on the line Re(''s'') = 1. Together with the functional equation and the fact that there are no zeros with real part greater than 1, this showed that all non-trivial zeros must lie in the interior of the critical strip {{nowrap|0 &lt; Re(''s'') &lt; 1}}. This was a key step in their first proofs of the [[prime number theorem]].

Both the original proofs that the zeta function has no zeros with real part 1 are similar, and depend on showing that if ζ(1+''it'') vanishes, then ζ(1+2''it'') is singular, which is not possible. One way of doing this is by using the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta(\sigma)^3\zeta(\sigma+it)^4\zeta(\sigma+2it)|\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;
for σ &gt; 1, ''t'' real, and looking at the limit as σ → 1. This inequality follows by taking the real part of the log of the Euler product to see that
:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta(\sigma+it)| = \exp\Re\sum_{p^n}\frac{p^{-n(\sigma+it)}}{n}=\exp\sum_{p^n}\frac{p^{-n\sigma}\cos(t\log p^n)}{n},&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is over all prime powers ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so that
:&lt;math&gt;|\zeta(\sigma)^3\zeta(\sigma+it)^4\zeta(\sigma+2it)| = \exp\sum_{p^n}p^{-n\sigma}\frac{3+4\cos(t\log p^n)+\cos(2t\log p^n)}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
which is at least 1 because all the terms in the sum are positive, due to the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;3+4\cos(\theta)+\cos(2\theta) = 2 (1+\cos(\theta))^2\ge0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Zero-free regions===
[[#CITEREFde la Vallée-Poussin1899–1900|De la Vallée-Poussin (1899–1900)]] proved that if {{nowrap|σ + ''i{{hsp}}t''}} is a zero of the Riemann zeta function, then {{nowrap|1 − σ ≥ &lt;big&gt;{{sfrac|''C''|log(''t'')}}&lt;/big&gt;}} for some positive constant ''C''. In other words, zeros cannot be too close to the line {{nowrap|σ {{=}} 1:}} there is a zero-free region close to this line. This zero-free region has been enlarged by several authors using methods such as [[Vinogradov's mean-value theorem]]. {{harvtxt|Ford|2002}} gave a version with explicit numerical constants: {{nowrap|ζ(σ + ''i{{hsp}}t''&amp;thinsp;) ≠ 0}} whenever {{nowrap begin}}|''t''&amp;thinsp;| ≥ 3{{nowrap end}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma\ge 1-\frac{1}{57.54(\log{|t|})^{2/3}(\log{\log{|t|}})^{1/3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Zeros on the critical line==
{{harvtxt|Hardy|1914}} and {{harvtxt|Hardy|Littlewood|1921}} showed there are infinitely many zeros on the critical line, by considering moments of certain functions related to the zeta function. {{harvtxt|Selberg|1942}} proved that at least a (small) positive proportion of zeros lie on the line. {{harvtxt|Levinson|1974}} improved this to one-third of the zeros by relating the zeros of the zeta function to those of its derivative, and {{harvtxt|Conrey|1989}} improved this further to two-fifths.

Most zeros lie close to the critical line. More precisely, {{harvtxt|Bohr|Landau|1914}} showed that for any positive ε, all but an infinitely small proportion of zeros lie within a distance ε of the critical line. {{harvtxt|Ivić|1985}} gives several more precise versions of this result, called ''zero density estimates'', which bound the number of zeros in regions with imaginary part at most ''T'' and real part at least 1/2+ε.

===Hardy–Littlewood conjectures===
In 1914 [[G. H. Hardy|Godfrey Harold Hardy]] proved that &lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\right)&lt;/math&gt; has infinitely many real zeros.

Let ''N''(''T'') be the total number of real zeros, &lt;math&gt;N_0(T)&lt;/math&gt; be the total number of zeros of odd order of the function
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\right),&lt;/math&gt;
lying on the interval (0, ''T''].

The next two conjectures of [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[John Edensor Littlewood]] on the distance between real zeros of &lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\right)&lt;/math&gt; and on the density of zeros of &lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\right)&lt;/math&gt; on intervals (''T'', ''T''+''H''] for sufficiently large ''T'' &gt; 0, &lt;math&gt;H = T^{a + \varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and with as less as possible value of ''a'' &gt; 0, where ε &gt; 0 is an arbitrarily small number, open two new directions in the investigation of the Riemann zeta function:

'''1.''' for any ε &gt; 0 there exists &lt;math&gt;T_0 = T_0(\varepsilon) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for &lt;math&gt;T \geq T_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H=T^{0.25+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; the interval &lt;math&gt;(T,T+H]&lt;/math&gt; contains a zero of odd order of the function &lt;math&gt;\zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2.''' for any ε &gt; 0 there exist &lt;math&gt;T_0 = T_0(\varepsilon) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and ''c'' = ''c''(ε) &gt; 0, such that for &lt;math&gt;T \geq T_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; the inequality &lt;math&gt;N_0(T+H)-N_0(T) \geq cH&lt;/math&gt; is true.

===Selberg's zeta function conjecture===
{{main|Selberg's zeta function conjecture}}
{{harvs|first=Atle|last=Selberg|authorlink=Atle Selberg||year=1942|txt}} investigated the problem of Hardy–Littlewood '''2''' and proved that for any ε &gt; 0 there exists such &lt;math&gt;T_0 = T_0(\varepsilon) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and ''c'' = ''c''(ε) &gt; 0, such that for &lt;math&gt;T \geq T_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; the inequality  &lt;math&gt;N(T+H)-N(T) \geq cH\log T&lt;/math&gt; is true. Selberg conjectured that this could be tightened to &lt;math&gt;H=T^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;. {{harvs|first=A. A. |last=Karatsuba |year=1984a |year2=1984b |year3=1985 |txt |authorlink=Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba}} proved that for a fixed ε satisfying the condition 0 &lt; ε &lt; 0.001, a sufficiently large ''T'' and &lt;math&gt;H = T^{a+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a = \tfrac{27}{82} = \tfrac{1}{3} -\tfrac{1}{246}&lt;/math&gt;, the interval (''T'', ''T''+''H'') contains at least ''cH''ln(''T'') real zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\right)&lt;/math&gt; and therefore confirmed the Selberg conjecture. The estimates of Selberg and Karatsuba can not be improved in respect of the order of growth as ''T'' → ∞.

{{harvtxt|Karatsuba|1992}} proved that an analog of the Selberg conjecture holds for almost all intervals (''T'', ''T''+''H''], &lt;math&gt;H = T^{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;, where ε is an arbitrarily small fixed positive number. The Karatsuba method permits to investigate zeros of the Riemann zeta-function on "supershort" intervals of the critical line, that is, on the intervals (''T'', ''T''+''H''], the length ''H'' of which grows slower than any, even arbitrarily small degree ''T''. In particular, he proved that for any given numbers ε, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_1&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the conditions &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\varepsilon, \varepsilon_{1}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; almost all intervals (''T'', ''T''+''H''] for &lt;math&gt;H\ge\exp{\{(\ln T)^{\varepsilon}\}}&lt;/math&gt; contain at least &lt;math&gt;H(\ln T)^{1-\varepsilon_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; zeros of the function &lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\right)&lt;/math&gt;. This estimate is quite close to the one that follows from the Riemann hypothesis.

===Numerical calculations===
[[File:Riemann zeta function absolute value.png|thumb|250px|Absolute value of the ζ-function]]
The function

:&lt;math&gt;\pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\Gamma(\tfrac{s}{2})\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt;

has the same zeros as the zeta function in the critical strip, and is real on the critical line because of the functional equation, so one can prove the existence of zeros exactly on the real line between two points by checking numerically that the function has opposite signs at these points. Usually one writes

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(\tfrac{1}{2} +it) = Z(t)e^{-i\theta(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

where Hardy's function [[Z function|''Z'']] and the [[Riemann–Siegel theta function]] θ are uniquely defined by this and the condition that they are smooth real functions with θ(0)=0.
By finding many intervals where the function ''Z'' changes sign one can show that there are many zeros on the critical line. To verify the Riemann hypothesis up to a given imaginary part ''T'' of the zeros, one also has to check that there are no further zeros off the line in this region. This can be done by calculating the total number of zeros in the region and checking that it is the same as the number of zeros found on the line. This allows one to verify the Riemann hypothesis computationally up to any desired value of ''T'' (provided all the zeros of the zeta function in this region are simple and on the critical line).

Some calculations of zeros of the zeta function are listed below. So far all zeros that have been checked are on the critical line and are simple. (A multiple zero would cause problems for the zero finding algorithms, which depend on finding sign changes between zeros.) For tables of the zeros, see {{harvtxt|Haselgrove|Miller|1960}} or {{harvnb|Odlyzko}}.

===Gram points===
A [[Gram point]] is a point on the critical line 1/2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''it'' where the zeta function is real and non-zero. Using the expression for the zeta function on the critical line, ζ(1/2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''it'') = ''Z''(''t'')e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i''θ(''t'')&lt;/sup&gt;, where Hardy's function, [[Z function|''Z'']], is real for real ''t'', and θ is the [[Riemann–Siegel theta function]], we see that zeta is real when sin(θ(''t'')) = 0. This implies that θ(''t'') is an integer multiple of π, which allows for the location of Gram points to be calculated fairly easily by inverting the formula for θ. They are usually numbered as ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' = 0, 1, ..., where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the unique solution of θ(''t'') = ''n''π.

Gram observed that there was often exactly one zero of the zeta function between any two Gram points; Hutchinson called this observation '''Gram's law'''. There are several other closely related statements that are also sometimes called Gram's law: for example, (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''Z''(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is usually positive, or ''Z''(''t'') usually has opposite sign at consecutive Gram points. The imaginary parts γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of the first few zeros (in blue) and the first few Gram points ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are given in the following table

A Gram point ''t'' is called good if the zeta function is positive at 1/2 + ''it''. The indices of the "bad" Gram points where ''Z'' has the "wrong" sign are 126, 134, 195, 211, ... {{OEIS|id=A114856}}. A '''Gram block''' is an interval bounded by two good Gram points such that all the Gram points between them are bad. A refinement of Gram's law called Rosser's rule due to {{harvtxt|Rosser|Yohe|Schoenfeld|1969}} says that Gram blocks often have the expected number of zeros in them (the same as the number of Gram intervals), even though some of the individual Gram intervals in the block may not have exactly one zero in them. For example, the interval bounded by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;125&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;127&lt;/sub&gt; is a Gram block containing a unique bad Gram point ''g''&lt;sub&gt;126&lt;/sub&gt;, and contains the expected number 2 of zeros although neither of its two Gram intervals contains a unique zero. Rosser et al. checked that there were no exceptions to Rosser's rule in the first 3 million zeros, although there are infinitely many exceptions to Rosser's rule over the entire zeta function.

Gram's rule and Rosser's rule both say that in some sense zeros do not stray too far from their expected positions. The distance of a zero from its expected position is controlled by the function ''S'' defined above, which grows extremely slowly: its average value is of the order of (log log ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, which only reaches 2 for T around 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that both rules hold most of the time for small ''T'' but eventually break down often. Indeed, {{harvtxt|Trudgian|2011}} showed that both Gram's law and Rosser's rule fail in a positive proportion of cases. To be specific, it is expected that in about 73% one zero is enclosed by two successive Gram points, but in 14% no zero and in 13% two zeros are in such a Gram-interval on the long run.

==Arguments for and against the Riemann hypothesis==
Mathematical papers about the Riemann hypothesis tend to be cautiously noncommittal about its truth. Of authors who express an opinion, most of them, such as {{harvtxt|Riemann|1859}} or {{harvtxt|Bombieri|2000}}, imply that they expect (or at least hope) that it is true. The few authors who express serious doubt about it include {{harvtxt|Ivić|2008}} who lists some reasons for being skeptical, and {{harvtxt|Littlewood|1962}} who flatly states that he believes it is false, and that there is no evidence whatsoever for it and no imaginable reason that it would be true. The consensus of the survey articles ({{harvnb|Bombieri|2000}}, {{harvnb|Conrey|2003}}, and {{harvnb|Sarnak|2005}}) is that the evidence for it is strong but not overwhelming, so that while it is probably true there is some reasonable doubt about it.

Some of the arguments for (or against) the Riemann hypothesis are listed by {{harvtxt|Sarnak|2005}}, {{harvtxt|Conrey|2003}}, and {{harvtxt|Ivić|2008}}, and include the following reasons.
* Several analogues of the Riemann hypothesis have already been proved. The proof of the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields by {{harvtxt|Deligne|1974}} is possibly the single strongest theoretical reason in favor of the Riemann hypothesis. This provides some evidence for the more general conjecture that all zeta functions associated with automorphic forms satisfy a Riemann hypothesis, which includes the classical Riemann hypothesis as a special case. Similarly [[Selberg zeta function]]s satisfy the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis, and are in some ways similar to the Riemann zeta function, having a functional equation and an infinite product expansion analogous to the Euler product expansion. However, there are also some major differences; for example they are not given by Dirichlet series. The Riemann hypothesis for the [[Goss zeta function]] was proved by {{harvtxt|Sheats|1998}}. In contrast to these positive examples, however, some [[Epstein zeta function]]s do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis, even though they have an infinite number of zeros on the critical line {{harv|Titchmarsh|1986}}. These functions are quite similar to the Riemann zeta function, and have a Dirichlet series expansion and a functional equation, but the ones known to fail the Riemann hypothesis do not have an Euler product and are not directly related to [[automorphic representation]]s.
* At first, the numerical verification that many zeros lie on the line seems strong evidence for it. However, analytic number theory has had many conjectures supported by large amounts of numerical evidence that turn out to be false. See [[Skewes number]] for a notorious example, where the first exception to a plausible conjecture related to the Riemann hypothesis probably occurs around 10&lt;sup&gt;316&lt;/sup&gt;; a counterexample to the Riemann hypothesis with imaginary part this size would be far beyond anything that can currently be computed using a direct approach. The problem is that the behavior is often influenced by very slowly increasing functions such as log log ''T'', that tend to infinity, but do so so slowly that this cannot be detected by computation. Such functions occur in the theory of the zeta function controlling the behavior of its zeros; for example the function ''S''(''T'') above has average size around (log log ''T'')&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; . As ''S''(''T'') jumps by at least 2 at any counterexample to the Riemann hypothesis, one might expect any counterexamples to the Riemann hypothesis to start appearing only when ''S''(''T'') becomes large. It is never much more than 3 as far as it has been calculated, but is known to be unbounded, suggesting that calculations may not have yet reached the region of typical behavior of the zeta function.
* [[Arnaud Denjoy|Denjoy]]'s probabilistic argument for the Riemann hypothesis {{harv|Edwards|1974}} is based on the observation that if μ(''x'') is a random sequence of "1"s and "−1"s then, for every {{nowrap|ε &gt; 0}}, the [[partial sum]]s
::&lt;math&gt;M(x) = \sum_{n \le x} \mu(n)&lt;/math&gt;
:(the values of which are positions in a [[simple random walk]]) satisfy the bound
::&lt;math&gt;M(x) = O(x^{1/2+\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;
:with [[Almost surely|probability 1]]. The Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to this bound for the [[Möbius function]]&amp;nbsp;μ and the [[Mertens function]] ''M'' derived in the same way from it. In other words, the Riemann hypothesis is in some sense equivalent to saying that μ(''x'') behaves like a random sequence of coin tosses. When μ(''x'') is non-zero its sign gives the parity of the number of prime factors of ''x'', so informally the Riemann hypothesis says that the parity of the number of prime factors of an integer behaves randomly. Such probabilistic arguments in number theory often give the right answer, but tend to be very hard to make rigorous, and occasionally give the wrong answer for some results, such as [[Maier's theorem]].
* The calculations in {{harvtxt|Odlyzko|1987}} show that the zeros of the zeta function behave very much like the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix, suggesting that they are the eigenvalues of some self-adjoint operator, which would imply the Riemann hypothesis. However all attempts to find such an operator have failed.
* There are several theorems, such as [[Goldbach's weak conjecture|the weak Goldbach conjecture]] for sufficiently large odd numbers, that were first proved using the generalized Riemann hypothesis, and later shown to be true unconditionally. This could be considered as weak evidence for the generalized Riemann hypothesis, as several of its "predictions" turned out to be true.
* [[Lehmer pair|Lehmer's phenomenon]] {{harv|Lehmer|1956}} where two zeros are sometimes very close is sometimes given as a reason to disbelieve in the Riemann hypothesis. However one would expect this to happen occasionally just by chance even if the Riemann hypothesis were true, and Odlyzko's calculations suggest that nearby pairs of zeros occur just as often as predicted by [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture|Montgomery's conjecture]].
* {{harvtxt|Patterson|1988}} suggests that the most compelling reason for the Riemann hypothesis for most mathematicians is the hope that primes are distributed as regularly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;p. 75: "One should probably add to this list the 'Platonic' reason that one
expects the natural numbers to be the most perfect idea conceivable,
and that this is only compatible with the primes being distributed in
the most regular fashion possible..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roparz Hemon''' (18 November 1900 in [[Brest, France|Brest]] – 29 June 1978 in [[Dublin]]), officially named '''Louis-Paul Némo''', was a [[France|Breton]] author and scholar of [[Breton language|Breton]] expression. He was the author of numerous dictionaries, grammars, poems and short stories. He also founded ''[[Gwalarn]]'', a literary journal in Breton where many young authors published their first writings during the 1920s and 1930s.

==Life and works==
Hemon served in the [[French Army]] at the beginning of the [[Second World War]], where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans.

Back in Brest in August 1940, he took back publishing ''Gwalarn''.{{clarify|date=February 2012}} In November 1940, he was appointed as director of programmes at ''[[Radio Rennes Bretagne|Radio Roazhon-Breizh]]'', a  [[Breton language]] weekly broadcast set up by the ''[[Propagandastaffel]]''.&lt;ref name="mercator"&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/mercator/images/breton_literature_during_German_Occupation.pdf Breton literature during German Occupation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105151/http://www.aber.ac.uk/mercator/images/breton_literature_during_German_Occupation.pdf |date=2007-09-29 }}, Mercator, The University of Wales&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941, he directed the weekly publication ''Arvor''. In October 1942, Hemon was appointed by [[Leo Weisgerber]] to help found the "Celtic Institute of Brittany". Hemon rendered other services to the Germans, like helping in compiling files against ''[[préfet]]'' Ripert.

At the Liberation, Hemon fled to Germany, where he was imprisoned. After one year of jail he was sentenced by the French state to ten years of "[[dégradation nationale]]" for the offence of "[[Indignité nationale]]".&lt;ref name="mercator" /&gt; He decided therefore to go in exile to [[Ireland]]. He worked there for the Institute for Advanced Studies. He would never go back to Brittany. Despite all this he never stopped working for the Breton language, and wrote for instance ''A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton'' in 1975. He created the magazine ''Ar Bed Keltiek'' that resembled ''Kannadig Gwalarn'' or ''Arvor''. He died in 1978. He was buried in Brest.

== Attack on his reputation ==
Hemon's reputation as a scholar led to the naming of institutions in Brittany after him. In 2000 controversy erupted over this, as Hemon's role in the war was publicised. Some of his statements made at the time were disinterred, particularly anti-French opinions expressed in ''Ni hon unan''. As a result, the school Diwan in [[Le Relecq-Kerhuon]], and the Cultural centre of [[Guingamp]], which had been named after Hemon, had to change names.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6946">'''Sa'id al-Afghani''' was a professor of [[Arabic language]] and [[Arabic literature|literature]] at the [[University of Damascus]]. He was regarded as one of the 20th century's leading scholars in both fields.&lt;ref name=news&gt;Adil Salahi, [http://stage.arabnews.com/node/219989 Scholars of renown: Saeed Al-Afghani]. [[Arab News]]: Thursday, April 18th, 2002.{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Afghani was born in [[Damascus]] in 1911 to a [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] father and [[Syrian people|Syrian]] mother.&lt;ref name=news/&gt; Having been born in an Arab country, Afghani spoke the language as his mother tongue and was eventually appointed to the position of professor of the Arabic language and later dean of the faculty of arts at the University of Damascus. He also taught at universities in [[Jordan]], [[Libya]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=news/&gt; Afghani died on February 18th, 1997 in [[Mecca]], where he was buried.

==Works==
Afghani's most well-known work is ''al-Mujaz'', a book attempting to simplify [[Arabic grammar]] for those unfamiliar with the language. He was a strong supporter of reforming the way in which Arabic grammar was understood and taught, blaming traditionalists and their opposition to any reform for the failure of language education in Arab countries. In Afghani's view, opposition from traditionalists such as the [[Arab Academy of Damascus]] stifled efforts of reform-minded bodies such as the [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;Salih J.

N.V., 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghani was instrumental in the founding of [[Al-Arabi (magazine)|Al-Arabi]], a magazine showcasing the arts and culture of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabimag.com/common/collection/e-info.htm Al Arabi Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917043559/http://alarabimag.com/common/collection/e-info.htm |date=2010-09-17 }}: the Idea and the Reality, at Al-Arabi's official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghani also spent ten years composing a biography of [[Aisha]], the Muslim [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]]'s second or third wife; the book was noted for Afghani's views on [[women in Islam]], which [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] [[feminist]] writer [[Fatema Mernissi]] described as representative of all the [[Muslim world]]'s most conservative views.&lt;ref name=aish&gt;[[Fatema Mernissi]], [http://www.teachmideast.org/essays/26-stereotypes/123-women-in-muslim-history-traditional-perspectives-and-new-strategies Women in Muslim History: Traditional Perspectives and New Strategies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603112448/http://www.teachmideast.org/essays/26-stereotypes/123-women-in-muslim-history-traditional-perspectives-and-new-strategies# |date=2014-06-03 }}. Taken from ''Women's Rebellion and Islamic Memory''. [[London]]: [[Zed Books]], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghani was also learned in the field of [[Islamic studies]], devoting much attention to the aspects of Muslim [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]. On both language and religion, he wrote very little, seeing that books should only be written if there was a clear need for research on the given topic.&lt;ref name=news/&gt; Being a follower of the [[Zahiri]]te school of [[Islamic law]], Afghani devoted much attention to preserving and commenting on the works of [[Ibn Hazm]], one of the school's champions. Afghani's 1960 published edition of Ibn Hazm's ''Mulakhkhas'', an important work of Zahirite legal theory, is considered a key moment in Arab intellectual history and the modernist revival of Ibn Hazm's legal method.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Sabra, "Ibn Hazm's Literalism: A Critique of Islamic Legal Theory."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8412">'''Slips and capture''' is a type of error that may occur in high-stress situations. According to studies in the psychology of [[human error]] to improve medicine and business, a person may inadvertently perform one action while intending to do another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/us/tulsa-police-shooting-eric-harris-deputy-charged/index.html |title=Tulsa shooting: Deputy Robert Bates charged |publisher=CNN.com |date=2015-04-14 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "slips and capture" became more widely known in the early 21st century in the United States, after being referred to by [[law enforcement]] in two prominent fatal police shooting cases in 2009 and 2015. In both cases, the police officer claimed to have shot a suspect while intending to use a [[Taser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tulsa Officer Says He Mistook Handgun for Taser|url=https://www.wsj.com/video/tulsa-officer-says-he-mistook-handgun-for-taser/810FC2F7-60C6-482B-BFEA-6B9CEF4C9D39.html|publisher=wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officials call shooting a "slips and capture" event|url=http://www.onenewspage.com/video/20150410/2747679/Officials-call-shooting-slips-and-capture-event.htm|publisher=One News Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2015/04/tulsa-sheriffs-office-says-volunteer-deputy-is-victim-of-circumstance-after-shooting-unarmed-man-video/ |title=Oklahoma Deputy Tells Dying Man Shot by Accident, "Fuck Your Breath," as he Gasps His Final Breaths – PINAC |publisher=Photographyisnotacrime.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==
The concept of "slips and capture" has been studied in the psychology of human error, and efforts to prevent error.&lt;ref name="slips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanfactorsmd.com/psychology-of-human-error |title=Intro to the psychology of human error and medical errors |publisher=HumanFactorsMD |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thoroughly described in 1990 by James Reason.&lt;ref name="design"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/human_error_slips_and_mistakes.html |title=Human error – slips and mistakes |publisher=Interaction Design Foundation |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "slips and capture" was used by Bill Lewinski in 2009, a consultant in police use of force who was part of Mehserle's defense team. Lewinski was reported by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' to have a doctorate in psychology from [[Union Institute &amp; University]], an online college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/crime_and_courts/expert-in-deadly-force-training-criticized-for-record-on-police/article_20a0f770-c507-5312-90b4-dc5d291a377b.html#ixzz3XF51oY18 |title=Expert in deadly force training criticized for record on police shootings |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Host.madison.com |date=2014-07-31 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His company, Force Science Institute, specializes in consulting to police departments.

== Shooting of Eric Courtney Harris ==
{{Main|Shooting of Eric Courtney Harris}}
44-year-old Eric Courtney Harris was shot to death April 2, 2015 by Tulsa city police during an undercover sting in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. As Harris was being subdued, Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Charles "Bob" Bates, 73, fatally shot Harris in the back, according to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office. Bates used the concept of "slips and capture" in his defense, saying that he had intended to use his Taser on Harris.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepage1/sources-supervisors-told-to-falsify-reserve-deputy-s-training-records/article_a6330f10-a9fb-51e3-ab5e-4d97b03c6c04.html |title=Sources: Supervisors told to falsify reserve deputy's training records; department announces internal review|work=Tulsa World |publisher=Tulsaworld.com |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/crimewatch/video-of-fatal-shooting-by-reserve-deputy-shown-at-sheriff/article_9d77cce0-75e6-5ddf-a782-cf048ad4064b.html |title=Video of fatal shooting by reserve deputy shown at Sheriff's Office press conference |publisher=Tulsaworld.com |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[CNN]] interview in 2015, after this term was used by the Tulsa Police Department in reference to the fatal [[shooting of Eric Courtney Harris]], a criminal justice expert said that there was no scientific basis for the theory of "slip and capture". He said most courts would reject the argument as inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/14/us/taser-gun-confusion/ |title=How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2015-04-21 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6904">'''Straight-acting''' is a term for a same gender-attracted person who does not exhibit the appearance or mannerisms of what is seen as typical for [[gay]] people. Although the label is used by and reserved almost exclusively for gay and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] men, it may also be used to describe a [[lesbian]] or [[bisexual]] woman exhibiting a [[Femininity|feminine]] appearance and mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011034/http://all-science-fair-projects.com/science_fair_project_dictionary/Straight-acting Science Fair Projects - Straight-acting] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Journal of Men's Studies"&gt;Jay Clarkson, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210734/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-16124560_ITM '"Everyday Joe" versus "pissy, bitchy, queens": gay masculinity on StraightActing.com.',] ''[[The Journal of Men's Studies]]'' (2006): .{{Dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term invokes negative stereotypes of gay people, its application is often controversial and may cause offense.&lt;ref name="Acting Straight"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061216033223/http://www.bgay.com/bwellness/well60831_acting_straight.htm Acting Straight] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed explanations and criticisms ==
Communication Scholar, Shinsuke Eguchi (2009)  proposes to explain the emergence of the straight acting phenomenon "because some gay men want to achieve hegemonic masculinity to overcome gay effeminate images".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Eguchi | first1 = S.| title = Negotiating Hegemonic Masculinity: the Rhetorical Strategy of 'Straight-Acting' Among Gay Men| journal = Journal of Intercultural Communication Research| volume = 38| issue = 3| pages = 193–209| date=Nov 2009 | doi = 10.1080/17475759.2009.508892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Eguchi  and [[Tim Berling]] relate it to the general context of [[sissyphobia]]&amp;mdash;the dominant cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]] that disparages effeminate men, which is not restricted to the gay culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timbergling.com/sissyphobia/ Bergling, Tim. ''Sissyphobia: Gay Men and Effeminate Behavior''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208132235/http://www.timbergling.com/sissyphobia/ |date=2012-02-08 }} {{ISBN|1-56023-989-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Negotiating Sisyphobia: A critical/ interpretive analysis of one ‘femme’ gay Asian body in the heteronormative world," Shinsuke Eguchi (2011) writes, "I began to see that the discursive manifestation of sissyphobia is not that feminine gay men are unattractive and undesirable. Rather, these straight-acting gay men would like to present their “heteronormative” masculine faces in their social interactions with others" (p.&amp;nbsp;50).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eguchi | first1 = S. | doi = 10.3149/jms.1901.37 | title = Negotiating Sissyphobia: A Critical/Interpretive Analysis of One "Femme" Gay Asian Body in the Heteronormative World | journal = The Journal of Men's Studies | volume = 19 | pages = 37–56 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex advice columnist [[Dan Savage]] commented on the popularity of the term "straight-acting" in gay [[Personal advertisement|personal ads]], criticizing both the practice and the idea that a man seeking a [[Intimate relationship|gay relationship]] through a gay personal ad is acting straight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=46 This American Life | Sissies]&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the term maintain it refers merely to one's mannerisms and that critics' isolation of the word "acting" in the phrase distorts the intended meaning of the phrase. Use of the term itself has been labeled as damaging to the LGBT community, as it associates certain attributes with [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="Acting Straight"/&gt;

Men who use the expression "straight-acting" may express resentment that critics claim the term implies they are acting and not being their true selves.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Men's Studies"/&gt;

==QUASH==

Queers United Against Straight Acting Homosexuals (QUASH) was the organization in Chicago that published a often cited article in their newsletter in 1993. .&lt;ref&gt;Cathy J. Cohen; Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics?. GLQ 1 May 1997; 3 (4): 437–465. doi: https://doi.org/10.1215/10642684-3-4-437&lt;/ref&gt; Titled; "Assimilation is Killing Us Fight For a Queer United Front." &lt;ref&gt;Queers United Against Straight-Acting Homosexuals. "Assimilation is Killing Us Fight For a Queer United Front." WHY I HATED THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON (1993):4&lt;/ref&gt; The article calls for a new order in our gendered social systems to be inclusive and not exclude anyone from liberation, challenging the power and privilege of the dominant members of society. &lt;ref&gt;Cathy J. Cohen; Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics?. GLQ 1 May 1997; 3 (4): 437–465. doi: https://doi.org/10.1215/10642684-3-4-437&lt;/ref&gt; An article similar to "Assimilation is Killing Us", published a year later, entitled, QUASH, still standing for Queers United Against Straight-Acting Homosexuals, used the same concept of rejection of the established gendered protocols, specifically, that there can be varied and better institutions than couple hood and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Enszer, J. R. (2013). "Whatever happens, this is": Lesbians engaging marriage. Women's Studies Quarterly, 41(3), 210-224. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/1503682489?accountid=14698&lt;/ref&gt;
These were early challenges to heteronormativity; ways of thinking outside the dominant culture's definitions of gender.

Filmmaker Spencer Windes explored the term and the definition of masculinity in his film ''Straight Acting.'' The film is a documentary about Windes' transformation from a closeted [[Mormon]] [[missionary]] into an openly gay man, through his involvement in the subculture of gays who play [[contact sport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://straightactingmovie.com Straight Acting. A Story about Queers and Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the geographic and political term|the powers of superheroes|Superpower (ability)|other uses|Superpower (disambiguation)}}
{{specific|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], then leaders of the [[Cold War]]'s rival superpowers, meeting in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] in November 1985]]
'''Superpower''' is a term used to describe a [[Sovereign state|state]] with a dominant position, which is characterised by its extensive ability to exert [[Sphere of influence|influence]] or [[Power projection|project power]] on a global scale. This is done through the combined-means of economic, military, technological and cultural strength, as well as [[International relations|diplomatic]] and [[soft power]] influence. Traditionally, superpowers are preeminent among the [[great power]]s.

The term was first applied post World War II to the [[British Empire]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. However, after the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, the United Kingdom's status as a superpower [[British Empire#Decolonisation and decline (1945–1997)|was greatly diminished]], leaving just the United States and Soviet Union as superpowers. For the duration of the [[Cold War]] the United States and the Soviet Union came to be generally regarded as the two remaining superpowers, dominating world affairs. At the end of the Cold War and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, only the United States appeared to fulfill the criteria of being a world superpower.&lt;ref name="Time-May-28-2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bremer, Ian|title=These Are the 5 Reasons Why the U.S. Remains the World’s Only Superpower|url=http://time.com/3899972/us-superpower-status-military/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nossal"&gt;{{cite conference|author=Kim Richard Nossal|title=Lonely Superpower or Unapologetic Hyperpower?

Herring (Professor of History at Kentucky University)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice L. Miller|Alice Lyman Miller]] defines a superpower as "a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world, and sometimes, in more than one region of the globe at a time, and so may plausibly attain the status of global [[hegemony]]."&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Lyman|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/sjir/6.1.03_miller.html |title=www.stanford.edu|publisher=stanford.edu|accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology and origin ==
[[File:Superpower map 1945.png|thumb|upright 1.3|A world map in 1945. According to [[William T.R. Fox]], the [[United States]] (blue), the [[Soviet Union]] (red) and the [[British Empire]] (teal) were superpowers.]]
[[File:US insular areas SVG.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|A world map. The United States remains the world's sole superpower.]]
No agreed definition of what is a 'superpower' exists, and may differ between sources.&lt;ref name="Nossal"/&gt; However, a fundamental characteristic that is consistent with all definitions of a superpower is a nation or state that has mastered the seven dimensions of state power: geography, population, economy, resources, military, [[diplomacy]] and [[national identity]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]]'' (1987) written by Paul Kennedy&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first used to describe nations with greater than [[great power]] status as early as 1944, but only gained its specific meaning with regard to the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and its [[British Empire|empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War II]]. This was because the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union had proved themselves to be capable of casting great influence in global politics and military dominance. The term in its current political meaning was coined by Dutch-American [[geostrategist]] [[Nicholas Spykman]] in a series of lectures in 1943 about the potential shape of a new post-war world order. This formed the foundation for the book ''The Geography of the Peace'', which referred primarily to the unmatched maritime global supremacy of the British Empire and United States as essential for peace and prosperity in the world.

A year later, in 1944, [[William T. R. Fox]], an American foreign policy professor, elaborated on the concept in the book ''The Superpowers: The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union — Their Responsibility for Peace'', which spoke of the global reach of a super-empowered nation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casaasia.es/pdf/9200595422AM1127202862621.pdf |title=China Superpower |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox used the word Superpower to identify a new category of power able to occupy the highest status in a world in which, as the war then raging demonstrated, states could challenge and fight each other on a global scale. According to him, there were (at that moment) three states that were superpowers: the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. The British Empire was the most [[List of largest empires|extensive empire]] in world history and considered the foremost great power, holding sway over 25% of the world's population&lt;ref&gt;Angus Maddison. ''The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective'' (p. 98, 242). [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Paris, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and controlling about 25% of the Earth's total land area, while the United States and the Soviet Union grew in power before and during [[World War II]].

According to Lyman Miller, "The basic components of superpower stature may be measured along four axes of power: military, economic, political, and cultural (or what political scientist [[Joseph Nye]] has termed “[[soft power]]”)".&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

In the opinion of [[Kim Richard Nossal]] of [[Queen's University]] in Canada, "generally this term was used to signify a political community that occupied a continental-sized landmass, had a sizable population (relative at least to other major powers); a superordinate economic capacity, including ample indigenous supplies of food and natural resources; enjoyed a high degree of non-dependence on international intercourse; and, most importantly, had a well-developed nuclear capacity (eventually normally defined as [[second strike]] capability)."&lt;ref name="Nossal" /&gt;

In the opinion of Professor [[Paul Dukes (historian)|Paul Dukes]], "a superpower must be able to conduct a global strategy including the possibility of destroying the world; to command vast economic potential and influence; and to present a universal ideology". Although, "many modifications may be made to this basic definition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abe.etailer.dpsl.net/Home/html/moreinfo.asp?bookid=536885601|title=The Superpowers – A Short History|date=8 December 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208142349/http://abe.etailer.dpsl.net/Home/html/moreinfo.asp?bookid=536885601|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor June Teufel Dreyer, "A superpower must be able to project its power, soft and hard, globally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/docs/media/FN1205-Ch-dreyer.pdf |title=PDF Version - Foreign Policy Research Institute |publisher=www.fpri.org |accessdate=2015-05-31|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[Superpower: Three Choices for America's Role in the World]]'', Dr. [[Ian Bremmer]], president of the [[Eurasia Group]], argues that a superpower is "a country that can exert enough military, political, and economic power to persuade nations in every region of the world to take important actions they would not otherwise take."&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, Ian. 2015. [http://www.ianbremmer.com/book/superpower-three-choices-america%E2%80%99s-role-world] Portfolio (Penguin Group): New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Superpowers of the past ==

There have been many attempts by historians to apply the term superpower retrospectively, and sometimes very loosely, to a variety of entities in the past. Recognition by historians of these older states as superpowers may focus on various superlative traits exhibited by them.

The 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] suggested that [[British Empire|Britain]], financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue its [[foreign policy]] objectives on an equal footing with the new superpowers without sacrificing [[convertibility]] of its [[reserve currency]] as a central goal of policy.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Klug and Gregor W. Smith, 'Suez and Sterling', ''Explorations in Economic History'', Vol. 36, No. 3 (July 1999), pp. 181–203.&lt;/ref&gt; As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in [[Europe]] or [[Asia]]. The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world's largest long-term creditor nation&lt;ref&gt;"Getting Serious About the Twin Deficits "by Author: Menzie D. Chinn - September 2005 by Council on Foreign Relations Press [http://www.cfr.org/economics/getting-serious-twin-deficits/p8933]&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal supplier of goods; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldenburger.us/gary/docs/TheColdWar.htm The Cold War: The Geography of Containment] Gary E. Oldenburger by Oldenburger Independent Studies; December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the [[United Nations]]), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like, and after the withdrawal of British aid to [[Greece]] in 1947, the United States took the lead in [[Containment|containing]] Soviet expansion in the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Frazier, 'Did Britain Start the Cold War? Bevin and the Truman Doctrine', ''Historical Journal'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Sep., 1984), pp. 715–727.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two countries opposed each other ideologically, politically, militarily, and economically. The Soviet Union promoted the ideology of [[communism]]: [[planned economy]] and a one-party state, whilst the United States promoted the ideologies of [[liberal democracy]] and the [[free market]]. This was reflected in the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[NATO]] military alliances, respectively, as most of Europe became aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. These alliances implied that these two nations were part of an emerging [[Polarity (international relations)|bipolar]] world, in contrast with a previously multipolar world. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The idea that the Cold War period revolved around only two blocs, or even only two nations, has been challenged by some scholars in the post–Cold War era, who have noted that the bipolar world only exists if one ignores all of the various movements and conflicts that occurred without influence from either of the two superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signalalpha.com/Cold_War.html Conflicts of Superpower] by Signal Alpha News Achieve Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, much of the conflict between the superpowers was fought in "[[proxy war]]s", which more often than not involved issues more complex than the standard Cold War oppositions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/fordham.htm Economic Interests, Party, and Ideology in Early Cold War Era U.S. Foreign Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928145126/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/fordham.htm |date=2012-09-28 }} Benjamin O. Fordham by World Peace Foundation; Massachusetts Institute of Technology April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s, the term [[hyperpower]] began to be applied to the United States, as the sole remaining superpower of the Cold War era.&lt;ref name="Nossal"/&gt; This term, popularized by French foreign minister [[Hubert Védrine]] in the late 1990s, is controversial and the validity of classifying the United States in this way is disputed. One notable opponent to this theory, [[Samuel P. Huntington]], rejects this theory in favor of a multipolar [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]. Other international relations theorists, such as [[Henry Kissinger]], theorize that because the threat of the Soviet Union no longer exists to formerly American-dominated regions such as Western Europe and Japan, American influence is only declining since the end of the Cold War, because such regions no longer need protection or have necessarily similar foreign policies as the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HhfceQZ3pmoC Diplomacy]'', pp. 24, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union and the United States fulfilled the superpower criteria in the following ways:

The [[Supreme Soviet]] enjoyed de facto [[parliamentary sovereignty]], despite a [[Constitution of the Soviet Union|written constitution]] and nominal [[federation|federalism]], as no court was vested with [[Judicial review]]. No formal office of [[President of the Soviet Union|President]] has existed; the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|standing legislature]] also served as a collective [[Head of State]]. The only national-level popular elections were the quinquennial elections to the [[Supreme Soviet]], which were yes-or-no votes on candidates handpicked beforehand. However, radical government reforms in 1989 introduced competitive elections, a directly-elected executive [[President of the Soviet Union|President]] and a [[Constitutional Court]], both having rudimentary [[Separation of Powers]] from the existing components of the system. One-party system with the [[Far-left politics|Far-left]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] having an institutionalized monopoly of power. Permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]].
| Strong [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Republic|constitutional republic]], organized under a [[presidential system]] with strong [[separation of powers]], with a complicated system of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] exercised between the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. The legislative powers of the [[United States Congress]] were limited both by the [[Constitution of the United States|written constitution]] and by the [[Federation|federal]] nature of the national government. Despite the lack of a dedicated [[Constitutional Court]], [[judicial review]] of laws has been vested in the Supreme Court by [[Marbury v. Madison|judicial precedent]]. The [[President of the United States|President]] was not only [[Head of State]], but also [[Head of Government]], and [[Cabinet of the United States|his Cabinet]] was not required to [[Motion of no confidence|command congressional confidence]]. The only national popular elections were the biennial congressional elections; however the quadrennial presidential election has de facto changed from an [[indirect election]] by an [[Electoral College]] into a direct, though [[Weighted voting|weighted]], popular election. Two-party system between [[Left-wing politics|Left-wing]] [[Democratic Party (US)|Democrats]] and [[Right-wing politics|Right-wing]] [[Republican Party (US)|Republicans]]. Permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council plus two allies (France and the UK) with permanent seats.

| Constitutional guarantees for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] were made conditional both for fulfilling one's citizen's duties and for conformity with the interests of the government, thereby turning them into effective dead letters. Press explicitly controlled and censored. Promoted, through the use of [[propaganda]], its Communist and Socialist ideal that workers of all countries should unite to overthrow capitalist society and what they called the [[Liberal democracy#Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie|dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]] and replace it with [[Communist state|a socialist society]] where all means of production are publicly owned.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 which ended the [[Cold War]], the post–Cold War world has in the past been considered by some to be a [[Unipolarity|unipolar]] world,&lt;ref name="Krauthammer1"&gt;Charles Krauthammer, [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1991-02-01/unipolar-moment The Unipolar Moment], ''Foreign Policy Magazine'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaikoforum.com/P03_19_122.pdf |title=www.gaikoforum.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[United States]] as the world's sole remaining superpower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1217752.stm Country profile: United States of America], BBC News. Retrieved March 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[Samuel P. Huntington]] wrote, "The United States, of course, is the sole state with preeminence in every domain of power – economic, military, diplomatic, ideological, technological, and cultural – with the reach and capabilities to promote its interests in virtually every part of the world." However, he rejected the claim that the world was unipolar: "There is now only one superpower. But that does not mean that the world is unipolar," describing it instead as "a strange hybrid, a uni-multipolar system with one superpower and several major powers." He further wrote that "Washington is blind to the fact that it no longer enjoys the dominance it had at the end of the Cold War. It must relearn the game of international politics as a major power, not a superpower, and make compromises."&lt;ref name="affairs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-stage.foreignaffairs.org/19990301faessay966/samuel-p-huntington/the-lonely-superpower.html|title=The Lonely Superpower|work=Foreign Affairs|author=Samuel P.

Experts argue that this older assessment of [[global politics]] is too simplified, in part because of the difficulty in classifying the [[European Union]] at its current stage of development.

A 2012 report by the [[National Intelligence Council]] said that America's superpower status will have eroded to merely being first among equals by 2030, but that the US would remain highest among the world's most powerful countries because of its influence in many different fields and global connections that the great regional powers of the time would not match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2012/intell-121211-rferl01.htm|title=Forecast Sees Eroded U.S. Power|first=John|last=Pike|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some experts have suggested the possibility of the United States losing its superpower status completely in the future.

Some people doubt the existence of superpowers in the [[post–Cold War era]] altogether, stating that today's complex global marketplace and the rising interdependency between the world's nations has made the concept of a superpower an idea of the past and that the world is now [[Polarity (international relations)#Multipolarity|multipolar]]. However, while the military dominance of the United States remains unquestioned for now and its international influence has made it an eminent world power, countries such as China, India, Brazil and Russia are inventing new ways to counter US military supremacy (namely space) and are making great strides in science, literature, soft power, and diplomacy.&lt;ref name="The Global list (No superpower)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post (No superpower)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Globalpolicy.org (No superpower)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Times (No superpower)" /&gt;

The term 'potential superpowers' has been applied by scholars and other qualified commentators to the possibility of several states achieving superpower status in the 21st century.

Many historians, writers, and critics have expressed doubts, however, whether any of these countries would ever emerge as a new superpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|title=Why India Will Not Become a Superpower|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-17350650|publisher=BBC India|accessdate=2012-04-29|date=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yuanan|first=Zhang|url=http://www.worldcrunch.com/business-finance/why-china-is-still-no-superpower/china-usa-economy-superpower-confucius/c2s12860/#.UyNI_j-SxA0|title=Why China Is Still No Superpower|accessdate=2014-03-14|date=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some political scientists and other commentators have even suggested that such countries might simply be [[emerging power]]s, as opposed to potential superpowers.&lt;ref name="BRICS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccs.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/China_Monitor_JUNE_2010.pdf|title=The Centre for Chinese Studies – Study of China and East Asia on the African continent|website=www.ccs.org.za|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204011005/http://www.ccs.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/China_Monitor_JUNE_2010.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides those mentioned above, a limited number of observers have also discussed, though ultimately dismissed, [[Brazil]] having the potential to emerge as a superpower.&lt;ref name="Collecott"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Collecott|url=http://www.diplomaticourier.com/brazil-s-quest-for-superpower-status/|title=Brazil's Quest for Superpower Status|publisher=The Diplomatic Courier|date=29 October 2011|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record of such predictions has admittedly not been perfect. For example, in the 1980s, some commentators thought Japan would become a superpower, due to its large GDP and high economic growth at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967823,00.html?promoid=googlep time.com] 1988 article "Japan From Superrich To Superpower"&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japan's economy crashed in 1991]], creating a long period of economic slump in the country which has become known as ''[[Lost Decade (Japan)|The Lost Years]]''. As of August 2012, Japan had yet to fully recover from the 1991 crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan eyes end to decades long deflation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/17/japan-economy-estimate-idUSL4E8JH1TC20120817|author=Leika Kihara|publisher=Reuters|date=August 17, 2012|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{undue|to=the term as it pertains to video games. Time sink is not strictly a video game term|date=February 2017}}
A '''time sink''' (also '''timesink'''), '''time drain''' or '''time-waster'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/time-waster?fallbackFrom=learner-english "time-waster"] entry at ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; is an activity that consumes a significant amount of time, especially one which is seen as a wasteful way of spending it. Although it is unknown when the term was coined, it makes an analogy with [[heat sink]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/time%20sink Timesink from reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In video games==
In [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs), time sinks are a method of increasing the time needed by players to do certain tasks, hopefully causing them to subscribe for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name=MMODesigner&gt;Miller, Matt. [http://www.mmodesigner.com/?p=118 Timesinks], ''MMODesigner.com'', 31 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Players may use the term disparagingly to describe a simplistic and time-consuming aspect of [[gameplay]], possibly designed to keep players playing longer without significant benefit. Time sinks can also be used for other gameplay reasons, such as to help regenerate [[resources]] or [[monsters]] in the [[game world]].

===Negative connotations===
Many players consider time sinks to be an inherently poor design decision, only included so that game companies can increase profits. For example, one [[Slashdot]] article describes time sinks as "gameplay traps intended to waste your time and keep you playing longer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/12/27/1748252&amp;mode=flat&amp;tid=127 Slashdot: "EverQuest: What You Really Get From an Online Game"], 27 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In most games, boring and lengthy parts of gameplay are merely an annoyance, but when used in [[subscription]]-based [[MMORPG]]s, where players are paying recurring fees for access to the game, they become a much more inflammatory issue. [[Game designer]]s must be prudent in balancing efforts to produce both involving gameplay and the length of content that players expect.

Time sinks are often associated with [[Gamer#Dedication_spectrum|hardcore games]], though whether this is a positive or negative association depends on the context.

===Trade-offs===
Implementing time sinks in a video game is a delicate balancing act. Excessive use of time sinks may cause players to stop playing. However, if not enough time sinks are implemented, players may feel the game is too short or too easy, causing them to abandon the game much sooner out of boredom. A number of criteria can be used to evaluate use of time sinks, such as frequency, length, and variety (both of the nature of the time sink and the actions taken to overcome it). What is considered a good balance depends in part on the type of game in question. [[Casual games]] are often expected to have less in the way of time sinks, and [[Gamer#Dedication_spectrum|hardcore games]] to have more, though this is not a hard and fast rule.

{{quote|A good timesink has you interacting with the game on some level, earning some level of enjoyment or moving the story along. It might be “realistic”, but keep in mind that you are trying to entertain people here and useless timesinks tend to do the opposite of entertain.|Matt Miller, ''MMODesigner.com''&lt;ref name=MMODesigner /&gt;}}
