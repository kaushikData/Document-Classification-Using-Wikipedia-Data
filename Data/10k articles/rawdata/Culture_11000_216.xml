{{short description|concept in sociology relating to the intergenerational effects of immigration}}

The '''acculturation gap''' is the changing set of values and culture between a child and parent or guardian. The gap is usually revealed after a family immigrates from one country to another and assimilates into a the culture. After immigration, a child adapts into a new culture quickly. The child usually interacts with more people from the new culture than the culture of their parents. School attendance plays a significant role in the shift of values and attitudes. 

The acculturation gap-distress hypothesis states that because the parent and child acculturate at different rates, the acculturation gap exists. Because the parents have spent more time embracing their own culture and heritage, it takes more time for them to acculturate. [[Acculturation]] occurs when a person adapts into a new culture and learns its language, values, and traditions. When children acculturate, they are less proud of their family and view their parents as controlling. The parents do not switch their views and ideologies in the same way.&lt;ref name="Marsiglia" /&gt; The gap in language, values, and traditions between the child and parent is linked to conflict between them.&lt;ref name="Encylopedia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/immigration/according-experts/intergenerational-differences-acculturation|title=Immigration Intergenerational Differences in Acculturation Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development|website=Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict ==
The acculturation gap in language can cause conflict between members of an immigrant family. The parents use their native language more so than the primary language of their new environment. The child, depending on the age of the child during immigration, is more likely to assume the local primary language as their own.&lt;ref name="Encylopedia" /&gt;

If a child does not formally learn the language of their parents, conflict arises between the family because it becomes difficult for the parent and child to discuss topics in depth with one another.&lt;ref name="Encylopedia" /&gt; When parents have to rely on their child for translation, it reverses the child-parent relationship and can lead to complications.&lt;ref name="Marsiglia" /&gt;{{how|date=November 2018}}

== Acculturation gap-distress hypothesis ==
The acculturation gap causes distress among parents and their children. When parents acculturate at a slower rate than their children, it can result in the parent growing apart from the child and not feeling as connected as before. In addition, parents could prevent the child from participating in activities that are a part of the new culture, which could lead the child to want to acculturate even further.&lt;ref name="Lau 2005" /&gt; Studies found that the increased conflict leads to more tense families that do not bond as deeply as others.{{who|date=November 2018}} In addition, it is likely that these children act out behaviorally or academically.&lt;ref name="Encylopedia" /&gt;

One study with Mexican-American families found that [[intergenerational]] acculturation was unrelated to youth behavioral issues and family conflict disproving the acculturation gap-distress hypothesis. The study found that when the parent was more acculturated than the child, the child struggled with aggression and antisocial behavior. This study also found that when neither the parent or child was acculturated to the American or traditional culture, the child had a greater risk of conduct problems.&lt;ref name="Lau 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lau |first1=Anna S. |last2=McCabe |first2=Kristen M. |last3=Yeh |first3=May |last4=Garland |first4=Ann F. |last5=Wood |first5=Patricia A. |last6=Hough |first6=Richard L. |title=The acculturation gap-distress hypothesis among high-risk Mexican American families. |journal=Journal of Family Psychology |date=2005 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=367–375 |doi=10.1037/0893-3200.19.3.367 |pmid=16221017|url=https://laulab.psych.ucla.edu/psych-laulab/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/lau-et-al-jfp-2005.pdf|via=UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural dissonance ==
Immigrants sometimes face [[cultural dissonance]] when moving from one place to another. They may be confronted with prejudice from locals whp feel their home has been infiltrated. This results in the immigrant feeling uncomfortable in the new environment which can potentially lead to conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Caroline Sarojini|last2=Sriprakash|first2=Arathi|date=2018-01-02|title=Understanding cultural dissonance and the development of social identities|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09620214.2018.1427194|journal=International Studies in Sociology of Education|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–3|doi=10.1080/09620214.2018.1427194|issn=0962-0214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that an immigrant child's exposure to discrimination and negative stereotypes while acculturating also can generate family conflict back at home due to the child's lost traditional cultural values.&lt;ref name="Gonzales 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gonzales |first1=Nancy A. |last2=Deardorff |first2=Julianna |last3=Formoso |first3=Diana |last4=Barr |first4=Alicia |last5=Barrera |first5=Manuel |title=Family Mediators of the Relation Between Acculturation and Adolescent Mental Health |journal=Family Relations |date=July 2006 |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=318–330 |jstor=40005316|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2006.00405.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== East Asian-American study findings ==
Multiple studies were conducted to evaluate the acculturation gap and whether or not it has detrimental effects. The studies ask children and parents about how they feel about their own acculturation and the acculturation of other family members. The studies then compare the gaps. Results from some studies showed that parents were more attached to their cultural heritage while other studies showed that the children were more attached than their parents. Based on this, the acculturation gap may not be as predicted.&lt;ref name="Encylopedia" /&gt;&lt;!-- The studies really need to be named not just mentioned as "studies" --&gt;

Studies also reflect that many struggle with adjusting culturally. Studies exhibit links between cultural dissonance and depression in the case of Chinese-American children. Chinese-Canadian and Chinese-American children who do not know the Chinese language as well as they'd like show a link to depression. Higher conflict than normal is shown in Indian-American, Soviet-American, and Vietnamese-American families where the acculturation gap exists.&lt;ref name="Encylopedia" /&gt;

Researchers found that the acculturation gap between East Asian-American generations is negatively correlated with parent-youth relationships. This disconnection leads to different mental health problems among the youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheung|first=Christopher W.|last2=Jahn|first2=Stephani A. B.|date=April 2017 |title=Closing the Acculturation Gap|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1066480717697686|journal=The Family Journal|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=170–178|doi=10.1177/1066480717697686|issn=1066-4807|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mexican-American study findings ==
Studies were conducted in the American Southwest, where there are many children with Mexican ancestry, to see how these children's home and parental values clash with the values of their peers at school. Studies have shown that higher levels of acculturation correlate with delinquency—the existence of a gap can increase the likelihood of children participating in deviant behaviors.&lt;ref name="Marsiglia"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marsiglia|first=Flavio F.|last2=Kulis|first2=Stephen|last3=FitzHarris|first3=Blythe|last4=Becerra|first4=David|date=May 2009 |title=Acculturation Gaps and Problem Behaviors among U.S. Southwestern Mexican Youth|journal=Social Work Forum |volume=42-43|pages=6–26|issn=1536-691X|pmc=3719159|pmid=23888125|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies with Mexican-American youth and parents also reflect similar data that remains inconclusive. The study notes that in the American Southwest, Mexican culture is prevalent and the close proximity to Mexico may play a role in the results.&lt;ref name="Marsiglia" /&gt;

Minimal research has been done to see the impact of the acculturation gap on parents compared to adolescents. However, one study has found that there is a link between Hispanic adults that have low acculturation rates and an increased risk of poor [[Low-density lipoprotein|low-density lipoprotein cholesterol]] control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eamranond |first1=Pracha P. |last2=Wee |first2=Christina C. |last3=Legedza |first3=Anna T.R. |last4=Marcantonio |first4=Edward R. |last5=Leveille |first5=Suzanne G. |title=Acculturation and cardiovascular risk factor control among Hispanic adults in the United States |journal=Public Health Reports |date=November 2009 |volume=124 |issue=6 |pages=818–824 |doi=10.1177/003335490912400609 |pmid=19894424 |pmc=2773945|jstor=25682315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confounding variables in studies ==
[[Confounding|Confounding variables]] (such as income and stability) exist in evaluations that connect the acculturation gap and family conflict. Therefore, the acculturation gap hypothesis needs further testing.&lt;ref name="Encylopedia" /&gt;

Furthermore, migration and work add to family stresses. Immigrants parents in the United States typically have longer work days and are away from their children more. These details must be addressed in future studies.&lt;ref name="Marsiglia" /&gt;

== Future acculturation gap research ==
Understanding the acculturation gap is important because minority population in the US continues to grow.&lt;ref name="Gonzales 2006" /&gt; Further research regarding the connection of acculturation gaps to family conflict could produce methods of to prevent conflict and treat those affected.&lt;ref name="Lau 2005" /&gt;

'''Arcadia Watches''' is a Swiss brand of [[luxury watch]]es&lt;ref name="Arcadia website"&gt;[http://www.arcadia-watches.com "Arcadia Website"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123024252/http://www.arcadia-watches.com/ |date=January 23, 2012 }} ''arcadia-watches.com''. Accessed January 07 2012&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1858.  In 1968 the brand ceased following a decline caused by the introduction of [[Quartz clock|quartz]] movements.&lt;ref name="iwmag"&gt;[http://www.iwmagazine.com "Comeback Kid"]. ''International Watch Magazine'', March 2011.  Accessed December 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It was relaunched in 2007 by Claude Sanz, owner and President of Maison Bunter based in [[Geneva]], and the first new Arcadia watch, the AC01, entered the market in 2010.&lt;ref name="Arcadia website"/&gt;

== History ==

The Arcadia brand originated in [[Fleurier]], a small village in Val-de-Travers region of the [[Canton of Neuchâtel]] in Switzerland.  [[Watchmaker]] Jules-Samuel Jequier was born in 1835 in Fleurier and  joined Bovet after training as a jewel-cutter and quickly climbed up the company ladder. In 1858 he founded Arcadia and positioned it as the top-of the-line among the five watchmaking [[brand]]s of the Fleurier Watch Company, a manufacturer established in 1915.  The company specialised in jewel cutting and designing watch calibers and had federated watchmaking farmers into working cooperatively. Fleurier Watch Company supplied movements for over a century to many watch brands.&lt;ref name="Arcadia website"/&gt;
 
While Arcadia had started off producing [[Watch movement|movements]], this was followed several years later by a watch line. Arcadia was in fact one of the earliest brands to sell its watches around the world, including [[China]] and  [[South America]], and it was a creative, [[avant-garde]] brand &lt;ref name="iwmag"/&gt; that became the flagship of the Fleurier Watch Company.&lt;ref name="Arcadia website"/&gt;

The brand sold watches until 1968, when, like so many [[mechanical watch]] companies, the advent of inexpensive quartz models led to its demise.&lt;ref name="robreport"&gt;[http://robbreport.com/Watches/Watches-Vintage-Victory "Watches: Vintage Victory"]. ''Robb Report'', May 2011.  Accessed December 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rebirth ==
In 2007 Claude Sanz re-launched the brand. Sanz is President and owner of jewellery watch house &lt;ref name="Arcadia website"/&gt; Bunter SA, based in a 17th-century  farmhouse just outside Geneva.&lt;ref name="iwmag"/&gt;  Claude is a trained [[geologist]] and [[mineralogist]], a self-taught [[watchmaker]] and a 33-year watch industry [[veteran]]. His name is well known in watchmaking circles.&lt;ref name="iwmag"/&gt;

Bunter SA, works behind the scenes for companies that customized gem-set high-complication mechanical watches for some of the watch industry’s most prestigious brands. Bunter is responsible for the invisibly set baguette [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamond]] watches that are exhibited at every [[Basel]] Fair.
Sanz bought the Arcadia brand several years ago, and it was the enthusiasm of a few friends and his own team at Bunter that in 2007 to set the wheels of rebirth in motion.&lt;ref name="iwmag"/&gt; The relaunch of Arcadia has led to it restarting the Fleurier Watch Company, which is temporarily based in Geneva with all movements assembled there.&lt;ref name="world tempus"&gt;[http://www.worldtempus.com/en/news/top-news/detail/article/1300459618-arcadia-takes-over-fleurier-watch-co/ "Arcadia Takes Over Fleurier Watch Co"] ''World Tempus'', March 2011. Accessed December 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
All sixty of Bunter’s employees worked on the first Arcadia watch, the AC01 [[chronograph]], at different times for a few hours per day performing varied watchmaking crafts, such as design and case-making or movement assembly.  In [[steel]] and [[titanium]], a limited edition of 275 pieces launched in January 2010 at the Geneva Time Exhibition.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Future ==
Arcadia calibers were highly innovative for their time,&lt;ref name="iwmag"/&gt; and the Fleurier Watch Company was considered one of the international ambassadors of Swiss watchmaking.
 
Sanz’s ultimate plan is to restart production of Arcadia movements in the town of Fleurier [http://www.worldtempus.com/en/news/top-news/detail/article/1300459618-arcadia-takes-over-fleurier-watch-co/], with redesigned and redeveloped calibres that can replace [[ETA movement]]s.&lt;ref name="iwmag"/&gt;  His concept is about simplicity and quality and Sanz considers it important to manufacture Arcadia movements that work well, and to create watches that are reliable and last and that can be passed on through generations.&lt;ref name="iwmag"/&gt;  With this in mind, and using modern technology and manufacturing techniques, the Fleurier Watch Company is now well underway with design and [[prototyping]] of future calibres.&lt;ref name="Arcadia website"/&gt;
 
The first watch to be made completely in-house is due in 2012, a 14 [[ligne]] manually wound movement.  A ladies’ gem set jewellery timepiece is also due in 2012.&lt;ref name="Arcadia website"/&gt;

'''Beit Ben-Yehuda''' is a historical home built in Arnona-[[Talpiot]] Neighborhood in [[Jerusalem]] for  [[Eliezer Ben Yehuda]], known as "the reviver of the [[Hebrew]] language".
==History==
Eliezer died in December 16th 1922 a short time before the house was completed.
His wife [[Hemda Ben-Yehuda|Chemda]] lived in the house until her death in 1951. Over the years Chemda turned the place into a commemoration center of Ben-Yehuda's life achievement.
A few years later the family of Ben-Yehuda donated the house to the [[Municipality of Jerusalem]].
In 1965 the municipality rented the house to private residents and in 1971 Jerusalem's former mayor [[Teddy Kollek]] decided  to hand it over to [[Action Reconciliation Service for Peace]] ([[Aktion Sühnezeichen Friedensdienste]] in German or ASF), a volunteer organization based in Germany.
In 2004 a new wing was built in the backyard of the house in order to be used as a seminar center for the German volunteers.
In the same year the decision was made to found "Beit Ben Yehuda" as the International Meeting Center and Guesthouse we have today. The ambitious goal to establish a guesthouse that opens its doors for everyone and to create a place that is a cultural center for learning was set. With a focal point on German-Israeli relations we do offer a variety of different seminars, workshops, lectures, language courses and other events on historical, sociological, political  and cultural topics, such as German, Hebrew and Yiddish courses.

Because memory is not just an individual, private experience but is also part of the collective domain, '''cultural memory''' has become a topic in both [[historiography]] ([[Pierre Nora]], Richard Terdiman) and [[cultural studies]] (e.g., [[Susan Stewart (poet)|Susan Stewart]]). These emphasize cultural memory’s process (historiography) and its implications and objects (cultural studies), respectively. Two schools of thought have emerged, one articulates that the present shapes our understanding of the past. The other assumes that the past has an influence on our present behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry. 1991. "Social Change and Collective Memory: The Democratization of George Washington." American Sociological Review 56: 221-236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2010). 'Culture and Collective Memory: Two Comparative Perspectives'. In. Hall, J. R.; Grindstaff, L. and Lo, M-C. ''Handbook of Cultural Sociology''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical approach==

===Time===

Crucial in understanding cultural memory as a phenomenon is the distinction between memory and [[history]].  This distinction was put forward by [[Pierre Nora]], who pinpointed a niche in-between history and memory.

Scholars disagree as to when to locate the moment representation 'took over'. Nora points to the formation of European [[nation state]]s. For [[Richard Terdiman]], the [[French revolution]] is the breaking point: the change of a political system, together with the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], made life more complex than ever before. This not only resulted in an increasing difficulty for people to understand the new society in which they were living, but also, as this break was so radical, people had trouble relating to the past ''before'' the revolution. In this situation, people no longer had an implicit understanding of their past. In order to understand the past, it had to be represented through history. As people realized that history was only one version of the past, they became more and more concerned with their own [[cultural heritage]] (in French called ''patrimoine'') which helped them shape a collective and [[national identity]]. In search for an identity to bind a country or people together, governments have constructed collective memories in the form of commemorations which should bring and keep together minority groups and individuals with conflicting agendas. What becomes clear is that the obsession with memory coincides with the fear of [[forgetting]] and the aim for [[Authentication|authenticity]].

However, more recently questions have arisen whether there ever was a time in which 'pure', non-representational memory existed – as Nora in particular put forward. Scholars like [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] rightly point out that representation is a crucial precondition for human perception in general: pure, organic and objective memories can never be witnessed as such.

===Space===

It is because of a sometimes too contracted conception of memory as just a temporal phenomenon, that the concept of cultural memory has often been exposed to misunderstanding. Nora pioneered connecting memory to physical, tangible locations, nowadays globally known and incorporated as ''lieux de mémoire''. He certifies these in his work as ''mises en abîme''; entities that symbolize a more complex piece of our history. Although he concentrates on a spatial approach to remembrance, Nora already points out in his early historiographical theories that memory goes beyond just tangible and visual aspects, thereby making it flexible and in flux. This rather problematic notion, also characterized by Terdiman as the '[[omnipresence]]' of memory, implies that for instance on a sensory level, a smell or a sound can become of cultural value, due to its commemorative effect.

Either in visualized or abstracted form, one of the largest complications of memorializing our past is the inevitable fact that it is absent. Every memory we try to reproduce becomes – as Terdiman states – a 'present past'. It is this impractical desire for recalling what is gone forever that brings to surface a feeling of [[nostalgia]], noticeable in many aspects of daily life but most specifically in cultural products.

==Cultural studies approach==

===Embodied memory===

Recently, interest has developed in the area of '[[Embodied cognition|embodied]] memory'. According to [[Paul Connerton]] the body can also be seen as a container, or carrier of memory, of two different types of social practice; inscribing and incorporating. The former includes all activities which are helpful for storing and retrieving information: photographing, writing, taping, etc. The latter implies skilled performances which are sent by means of physical activity, like a spoken word or a handshake. These performances are accomplished by the individual in an unconscious manner, and one might suggest that this memory carried in gestures and habits, is more authentic than 'indirect' memory via inscribing.

The first conceptions of embodied memory, in which the past is 'situated' in the body of the individual, derive from late nineteenth century thoughts of [[evolutionist]]s like [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Lamarck’s law of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] and Haeckel's theory of [[recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny]], suggested that the individual is a summation of the whole history that had preceded him or her. (However, neither of these concepts is accepted by current science.)

===Objects===

Memory can, for instance, be contained in objects. [[Souvenir]]s and [[photograph]]s inhabit an important place in the cultural memory discourse. Several authors stress the fact that the relationship between memory and objects has changed since the nineteenth century. Stewart, for example, claims that our culture has changed from a culture of production to a culture of consumption. Products, according to Terdiman, have lost 'the memory of their own process' now, in times of [[mass-production]] and [[commodification]]. At the same time, he claims, the connection between memories and objects has been institutionalized and exploited in the form of trade in souvenirs. These specific objects can refer to either a distant time (an [[antique]]) or a distant (exotic) place. Stewart explains how our souvenirs authenticate our experiences and how they are a survival sign of events that exist only through the invention of [[narrative]].

This notion can easily be applied to another practice that has a specific relationship with memory: [[photography]]. Catherine Keenan explains how the act of taking a picture can underline the importance of remembering, both individually and collectively. Also she states that pictures cannot only stimulate or help memory, but can rather eclipse the actual memory – when we remember in terms of the photograph – or they can serve as a reminder of our propensity to forget. Others have argued that photographs can be incorporated in memory and therefore supplement it.

[[Edward Chaney]] has coined the term 'Cultural Memorials' to describe both generic types, such as obelisks or sphinxes, and specific objects, such as the Obelisk of Domitian, Abu Simbel or 'The Young Memnon', which have meanings attributed to them that evolve over time. Readings of ancient Egyptian artefacts by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], the Collector [[Earl of Arundel]], 18th-century travellers, [[Napoleon]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[William John Bankes|William Bankes]], [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Florence Nightingale]] or Sigmund and Lucian [[Freud]], reveal a range of interpretations variously concerned with reconstructing the intentions of their makers.

==Between culture and memory: experience==

As a contrast to the sometimes generative nature of previously mentioned studies on cultural memory, an alternative 'school' with its origins in [[gender]] and postcolonial studies underscored the importance of the individual and particular memories of those unheard in most collective accounts: women, minorities, homosexuals, etc.

[[Experience]], whether it be lived or imagined, relates mutually to culture and memory. It is influenced by both factors, but determines these at the same time. Culture influences experience by offering mediated perceptions that affect it, as Frigga Haug states by opposing conventional theory on femininity to lived memory. In turn, as historians such as Neil Gregor have argued, experience affects culture, since individual experience becomes communicable and therefore collective.  A memorial, for example, can represent a shared sense of loss.

The influence of memory is made obvious in the way the past is experienced in present conditions, for – according to Paul Connerton, for instance – it can never be eliminated from human practice. On the other hand, it is perception driven by a longing for authenticity that colors memory, which is made clear by a desire to experience the real (Susan Stewart). Experience, therefore, is substantial to the interpretation of culture as well as memory, and vice versa.

==Traumatic memory transmission==
{{Main|Transgenerational trauma}}
Traumatic transmissions are articulated over time not only through social sites or institutions but also through cultural, political, and familial generations, a key social mechanism of continuity and renewal across human groups, cohorts, and communities. The intergenerational transmission of collective trauma is a well-established phenomenon in the scholarly literature on psychological, familial, sociocultural, and biological modes of transmission. Ordinary processes of remembering and transmission can be understood as cultural practices by which people recognize a lineage, a debt to their past, and through which "they express moral continuity with that past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = State Terrorism and the Politics of Memory in Latin America: Transmissions Across The Generations of Post-Dictatorship Uruguay, 1984–2004|last = Fried Amilivia|first = Gabriela|publisher = Cambria Press|year = 2016|isbn = 9781604979190|location = Amherst, New York|pages = 24, 26|url = http://www.cambriapress.com/books/9781604979190.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergenerationality|intergenerational preservation]], transformation, and transmutation of traumatic memory such as of [[genocide]] tragic historical legacy can be assimilated, redeemed, and transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adelman|first1=A.|title=Traumatic memory and the intergenerational transmission of Holocaust narratives|journal=The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|date=1995|volume=50|pages=343–367|issn=0079-7308|doi=10.1080/00797308.1995.11822409|pmid=7480412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Recent research and theorizing in cultural memory has emphasized the importance of considering the content of cultural identities in understanding the study of social relations and predicting cultural attitudes.

The Institute of Germanic &amp; Romance Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London, has developed its MA degree around the above-mentioned topics.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100222220029/http://igrs.sas.ac.uk/postgraduate/mamres-programmes/cultural-memory.html MA in Cultural Memory] has now been running for 10 years. This unique degree explores the many different ways in which culture is based on the construction, manipulation and transmission of memories, and the role played by memory in collective and individual identity formation.

The degree programme is supplemented by a Cultural Memory Seminar and by the [http://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk new Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory].

In 2008, the first issue of quarterly journal ''[[Memory Studies (journal)|Memory Studies]]'' concerning subjects of and relating to cultural memory was published by [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]].

== Other approaches ==
[[Jan Assmann]] in his book "Das kulturelle Gedächtnis", drew further upon [[Maurice Halbwachs]]'s theory on [[collective memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Assmann, J. (1992) ''Das Kulturelle Gedächtnis: Schrift, Erinnerung und Politische Identität in frühen Hochkulturen.'' Munich: Verlag C.H. Beck&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars like [[Andreas Huyssen]] have identified a general interest in memory and [[mnemonics]] since the early 1980s, illustrated by phenomena as diverse as [[memorial]]s and [[retro]]-culture.  Some might see cultural memory as becoming more democratic, due to liberalization and the rise of [[new media]].  Others see cultural memory as remaining concentrated in the hands of corporations and states.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The term '''cut and sew''' is used to denote a garment that has been customized from raw fabric rather than one that has been purchased from a third-party supplier and then [[screenprint]]ed or altered.

The term is prevalent in the [[urban fashion]] industry, where designers can either have a design screenprinted on a pre-made garment, such as a [[t-shirt]] or [[hooded sweatshirt]], or have the entire garment created from scratch.  In the latter case, the designer of the graphic also played a role in the creation of the t-shirt itself.  Cut and sew garments are generally of higher quality and price than a standard mass-produced item.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Brands like [[A Bathing Ape]], Diamond Supply Co., [[Marc Ecko]] and [[Kanati Clothing Company]] have 'cut and sew' lines, which are most commonly items like button up shirts and other higher end clothing items instead of items like t-shirts.

The '''emblem of Qatar''' ({{lang-ar|'''شعار قطر'''}}) is the [[coat of arms]] of [[Qatar]].

==Overview==
[[File:Qatar embassy.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Flag and emblem of [[Qatar]], displayed above the entrance of the Qatari Embassy in [[Paris]].]]
The emblem shows two crossed white curved swords in a yellow circle. Between the swords there is a sailing ship (dhow) sailing on blue and white waves beside an island with two palm trees. The circle is surrounded by a round doughnut-shaped object, which is divided horizontally. In the white section the name of the state of Qatar is written in black [[Kufic]] script and in the maroon section, the English (the only among Arab states) translation (State of Qatar) is written in white [[Blackletter]] script. The coat of arms is sometimes shown without the English translation, the middle circle is occasionally yellow and the curved swords are sometimes brown (instead of white).

The current version was introduced in 1976 and replaced another one, which was used since 1966, and consisted of two curved swords, one pearl shell and two palm tree-branches with the label "Qatar".

Several elements of the emblem are featured in national emblems of several [[Middle East]]ern countries: the traditional Arab curved sword is also present in the coats of arms of [[Coat of arms of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and [[Coat of arms of Oman|Oman]]; the dhow is in the coat of arms of [[Coat of arms of Kuwait|Kuwait]] and the former coat of arms of [[Coat of arms of the United Arab Emirates|the United Arab Emirates]]. The palm tree is also a national symbol of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The colors and the separation of the outside ring come from the [[flag of Qatar]].

'''''Friday, or, The Other Island''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique'''}}) is a 1967 novel by French writer [[Michel Tournier]]. It retells [[Daniel Defoe|Daniel Defoe's]] ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''. The first edition of the book was published 15 March 1967. It won that year's [[Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française]].

In 1971, Tournier rewrote the book, adapting it for younger readers, under the title ''Vendredi ou la Vie sauvage''.

== Plot ==
The young Robinson Crusoe is shipwrecked on a desert island that he names ''Speranza'' (Hope). Crusoe tries to civilize and control the nature of the island, but is redeemed by the appearance of "[[Mapuche|Araucanian]]" whom he names as Friday. Because of the deep change that happens in Crusoe during the stay, he finally does not want to return from the island, while Friday does.

&lt;div style="float: right; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; width: 200px; border: solid 2px gray; background-color: white;"&gt;[[File:COA of Évora municipality (Portugal).png|200px]]
The city of Évora honours Gerald with a place on its coat-of-arms. The central plaza, the Praça do Giraldo, is also named after him.
[[File:Praca do Giraldo, Evora, Alentejo, Portugal, 28 September 2005.jpg|200px]]&lt;/div&gt;

'''Geraldo Geraldes''' or '''Gerald the Fearless''' (died prob. 1173), known in Portuguese as '''Geraldo ''Sem Pavor''''' ("without fear"),&lt;ref&gt;Owing to the non-standardisation of spelling in the twelfth century, his name may also be rendered Gerardo or Giraldo. The Spanish version of his patronymic is Geráldez. In medieval Latin he was described as ''Giraldus qui dicebatur sine pavore'' ("Gerald, who is called without fear").&lt;/ref&gt; was a Portuguese warrior and folk hero of the ''[[Reconquista]]'' whose theatre of operations was in the barren [[Alentejo]] and [[Extremadura]] regions of the lower [[Guadiana]] river. The city of [[Évora]] was the most lasting of his conquests and was never retaken. His success and independence have suggested parallels with the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] hero [[El Cid]] and Gerald has been called "the Cid of Portugal".&lt;ref&gt;Or the "Portuguese Cid", but not without some controversy. To certain Spanish scholars a mere guerilla fighter has no business consorting with El Cid (cf. [http://www.chde.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89:fortaleza-medieval-sierra-santa-cruz&amp;catid=28:2006&amp;Itemid=2 Cillán Cillán, n9]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

==''Reconquista'' in Alentejo and Extremadura==
Around 1162 Gerald assembled a private army (a ''mesnada'') and rapidly developed tactics that proved remarkably successful in seizing Muslim strongholds, though it was not adapted for siege warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Clemente Ramos, 653.&lt;/ref&gt; He "perfected techniques of nocturnal surprise in wintry or stormy weather, stealthy escalading of walls by picked commando-like troops, cutting down of sentries and opening of town gates to the larger force stationed without."&lt;ref name=bishko414&gt;Bishko, 414–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the primary sources for Gerald's methods the most important is the contemporary Arabic chronicler [[Ibn Ṣāḥib al-Ṣalā]], whose ''Al-Mann bil-Imāma'' was incorporated into the history of [[al-Maqqarī]] in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=pavon182/&gt; His opinion of Gerald and his tactics is very low:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The dog [Gerald] marched on rainy and very dark nights, with strong wind and snow, towards the cities and, having prepared his wooden instruments of scaling [walls] very large, so that they would surpass the wall of the city, he would apply those ladders to the side of the tower and catch the sentinel [by surprise] and say to him: "Shout, as is your custom," in order that the people would not hear him. When the scaling of the group had been completed on the highest wall in the city, they shouted in their language with an abominable screech, and they entered the city and fought whom they found and robbed them and captured all who were there in [the city, taking] captive and prisoner all who were there.&lt;ref&gt;Clemente Ramos, 653 n14: ''El perro caminaba en noches lluviosas y muy oscuras, de fuerte viento y nieve, hacia las ciudades y había preparado sus instrumentos de escalas de madera muy largas, que sobrepasen el muro de la ciudad, aplicaba aquellas escaleras al costado de la torre y subía por ellas el primero, hasta la torre y cogía al centinela y le decía: "Grita como es tu costumbre," para que no le sintiese la gente. Cuando se había completado la subida de su grupo a lo más alto del muro de la ciudad, gritaban en su lengua con un alarido execrable, y entraban en la ciudad y combatían al que encontraban y le robaban y cogían a todos los que había en ella cautivos y prisioneros a todos los que estaban allí.''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the places Gerald conquered the primary sources are in general agreement, also as to the order of their seizure, but as to the dating of events there is ambiguity. Ibn Ṣāḥib's version goes:
[[Image:GeraldoGeraldesSemPavor.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Statue of Geraldo the Fearless in [[Évora]], decapitating a Moor.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the second ''[[Jumada al-awwal]]'' [15 April–13 May] of the ''[[anno Hegirae]]'' 560 [1165] the city of Trujillo was surprised, and in ''[[Dhu al-Qi'dah]]'' the notable village of Évora. Also was the population of Cáceres in ''[[Safar]]'' 561 [1166], and the castle of Montánchez in ''[[Jumada al-thani]]'' and the strongholds of Serpa and Juromenha.&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the Spanish: ''En Yumada segundo de la hegira 560 fue sorprendida la ciudad de Truxillo, y en Diskada, la notable villa de Jeburah. También la población de Cáceres en Safar de 561, y el castillo de Muntajesh en Umada y los fuertes de Severina y Jelmaniyyah'' (in [http://www.chde.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89:fortaleza-medieval-sierra-santa-cruz&amp;catid=28:2006&amp;Itemid=2 Cillán Cillán]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The years 560 and 561 correspond roughly to the ''[[anno Domini|annos Domini]]'' 1165 and 1166, but here Ibn Ṣāḥib is almost certainly off in his dating by a year. The events rather took place in 1164 and 1165. A later Portuguese chronicle, the ''[[Cronicón Lusitano|Crónica dos Godos]]'' ("Chronicle of the Goths"), dates the conquest of [[Évora]] to the year 1204 of the [[Spanish era]], that is, 1166.&lt;ref&gt;[[Enrique Flórez]], ''España Sagrada'' (Madrid: 1796), [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k927603.image.f443.pagination XIV:428]: ''Æra 1204. Civitas Elbora capta, &amp; depraedata, &amp; noctu ingressa a Giraldo cognominato sine pavore, &amp; latronibus sociis ejus, &amp; tradidit eam Regi D. Alfonso'' (In the year 1166 the city of Évora was captured and depredated, for at night it was entered by Gerald called "the Fearless", and his associates entered by the latrines, and made over [the city] to the king Don Afonso).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]] was taken on 14 May 1164,&lt;ref name=floriano&gt;Floriano Cumbreño, see note 10 in [http://www.chde.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89:fortaleza-medieval-sierra-santa-cruz&amp;catid=28:2006&amp;Itemid=2 Cillán Cillán.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in June;&lt;ref name=cillan&gt;[http://www.chde.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89:fortaleza-medieval-sierra-santa-cruz&amp;catid=28:2006&amp;Itemid=2 Cillán Cillán.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Évora in September 1164;&lt;ref name=cillan/&gt; and [[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]] in December 1164&lt;ref name=cillan/&gt; or, on a later dating, in September 1166.&lt;ref name=floriano/&gt; These were the major conquests. The lesser conquests of [[Montánchez]], [[Serpa]], and [[Juromenha]] took place in 1165, based on Ibn Ṣāḥib's scheme,&lt;ref name=cillan/&gt; but Montánchez and Serpa may have gone in March 1167, as one historian has it.&lt;ref name=floriano/&gt; All the primary sources agree that [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Spain)|Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] was the last of Gerald's successes, which may place it as late as 1169,&lt;ref name=cillan/&gt; though perhaps earlier (1167/8), along with Ureña.&lt;ref name=floriano/&gt; The conquest of these last two places left Gerald in a position to harass [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]].&lt;ref name=floriano/&gt; The date of the capture of [[Monfragüe]],&lt;ref&gt;Variously spelled Mofra, Monfra, Monfrag, and Monsfragüe.&lt;/ref&gt; which was certainly one of his conquests, cannot be established.&lt;ref name=pavon182&gt;Pavón Maldonado, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!---{{quote box3|width=250px||}} / July–August 1165 Evora / in the name of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]---&gt;

==Conflict with León==
So successful was Gerald by 1168 that his eastward expansion threatened the southward expansion of the [[Kingdom of León]]. These actions were in violation of the succession arrangements laid down by [[Alfonso VII]] at [[Sahagún]], since they comprised lands whose conquest had been assigned to León.&lt;ref name=powers42&gt;Powers, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of Gerald's conquests in the far east had even been assigned to [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].&lt;ref name=cillan/&gt; The Leonese king, [[Ferdinand II of León|Ferdinand II]], son of Alfonso VII, took action immediately after the taking of Cáceres, probably early in the spring of 1166, capturing [[Alcántara]] later that year and thus securing a crossing over the [[Tagus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hernández Giménez (part III), 311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently he allied with the [[Almohad]] caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf|Yusuf I]], who had warned him of Gerald and the Portuguese's encroachments on his interests.&lt;ref name=bishko414/&gt;&lt;ref name=cillan/&gt;

In the early summer of 1169, Gerald took the [[Taifa of Badajoz|''taifa'']] and city of [[Badajoz]] after a long siege, but the garrison took refuge in the citadel, the ''[[alcazaba]]'', the siege of which continued.&lt;ref name=bishko414/&gt; Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region at the expense of both his Muslim and Christian enemies, [[Afonso I of Portugal]] came with an army to Badajoz to relieve his nominal vassal. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of León, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison.&lt;ref name=cillan/&gt; The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Gerald was captured by the Leonese majordomo, [[Fernando Rodríguez de Castro|Fernán Ruiz de Castro]], called ''el Castellano'' ("the Castilian"). He was an important person at court, who for a while held the highest military post in the capital (''tenente turris Legionis'', "possessing the tower of León"). He was the king's brother-in-law, being married to Stephanie the Unfortunate, an illegitimate daughter of [[Alfonso VII]] by his second mistress, Urraca Fernández, and thus a half-sister of Ferdinand II. After the mêlée the Leonese had control of the town and the ''alcazaba'', which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Ferdinand succeeded in gaining the valley of the upper [[Limia]] and the regions of Toroño (around [[Tui, Galicia|Tuy]]), Capraria (around [[Verín]]), and Lobarzana (around [[Chaves (Portugal)|Chaves]]) from Afonso in exchange for his release.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom.&lt;ref name=bishko414/&gt;&lt;ref name=powers42/&gt; Ferdinand retained Cáceres, but Trujillo, Montánchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfragüe he gave to Fernán Ruiz.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ṣāḥib states that three years after its conquest, between 17 October 1167 and 4 October 1168, Gerald was forced to cede Trujillo to a certain Ferdinand, called a brother-in-law of "Fernando el Baboso" (Ferdinand the Stupid), that is, the king of León. The gift to Fernán is also recorded in a Christian source, the ''Chronica latina regum castellae''. The date given by Ibn Ṣāḥib conflicts with the dates of 1169 (cf. Bishko, 414–15) or 1170 (cf. Clemente Ramos, 649–50) found in other sources. Cf. Hernández Giménez (part I), 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serving the Almohads==
In 1171 and 1172,&lt;ref&gt;Years in which [[Muhammad ibn Mardanish]] of Murcia was defeated by Yusuf and then died, leaving his kingdom of the taking.&lt;/ref&gt; while Yusuf was waging war on [[Taifa of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Taifa of Murcia|Murcia]], general anarchy prevailed in the Extremadura as Leonese, Portuguese, and Almohad troops fought for supremacy. Gerald took advantage of Yusuf's absence to conquer Beja in the Alentejo (1172). When he and Afonso disagree over whether to hold the site or raze it, Gerald—"impoverished and bereft of all aid" &lt;ref&gt;Original Latin: ''depaupertatus autem et destitutus omni auxilio transtulit se ad Sarracenos, quibus multa dampna intulerat'' (quoted in Barton, n84).&lt;/ref&gt;—went to [[Seville]] to put himself in the service of the caliph. To keep him away from Portugal he was sent to [[Morocco]] with 350 troops.&lt;ref name=barton&gt;Barton, 28–35.&lt;/ref&gt; There he received the governorship of ''[[al-Sūs]]'' (the plains and mountains of southern [[Morocco]]), but soon entered into negotiations with his former monarch concerning the use of al-Sūs as a base for a Portuguese invasion. When his correspondence was intercepted, he was arrested and put to death.&lt;ref name=bishko414/&gt; The ''[[Chronica latina regum castellae]]'', a Latin Christian chronicle, summarises Gerald's career in one paragraph at the end of its tenth chapter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Also then [at the capture of Afonso I at Badajoz] was captured Gerald, alias "without fear", who was given over to Rodrigo Fernández {{sic}}, the Castilian, to whom, in exchange for his liberty, Gerald handed over Montánchez, Trujillo, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfragüe, which the same Gerald had gained from the Saracens, to whom he had caused much damage, and by whom he was decapitated in Moroccan territory on a laughable pretext.&lt;ref&gt;Original Latin (from [http://www.chde.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89:fortaleza-medieval-sierra-santa-cruz&amp;catid=28:2006&amp;Itemid=2 Cillán Cillán]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}): ''Tunc et caputs fuit Giraldus qui dicebant sine pavore et traditus in manus Roderici Fernandi Castellani, cui pro liberatione sua dedit idem Giraldus Montages, Trujellum, Sancta Cruz, Monfra que idem Giraldus acquisierat a sarracenis''.&lt;br&gt;Spanish translation (from [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027134723/http://geocities.com/iblbo/archivo/cronicastilla/laticas2.htm  ''Crónica Latina de los reyes de Castilla'', 10]): ''También fue entonces capturado Giraldo, alias "Sin miedo", quien fue entregado a Rodrigo Fernández, el Castellano, al que, a cambio de su libertad, Giraldo entregó Montánchez, Trujillo, Santa Cruz de la Sierra y Mofra, que el mismo Giraldo había ganado a los sarracenos, a los que había causado muchos daños, y por los que fue decapitado en tierras marroquíes con un pretexto baladí.''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The chief source for Gerald's negotiations with the caliph and his death in Morocco is [[Ibn `Idhārī al-Marrākushī]]'s ''Al-Bayān al-Mugrib''. Many of the cities and castles that Gerald captured with ease were later re-conquered by the Almohads, who improved their fortifications so much that they were not taken by the Christians again until the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Clemente Ramos, 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Cáceres was besieged four times without success (1184, 1213, 1218, and 1222) and is usually referred to as a ''castrum famossum'' ("famous castle") or ''muy fuerte castillo'' ("very strong castle") in Christian sources, although it had fallen relatively easily to Gerald.&lt;ref&gt;Clemente Ramos, 655.&lt;/ref&gt; Trujillo was not taken by the Christians again until 1234.&lt;ref&gt;Clemente Ramos, 670.&lt;/ref&gt; The defences of Badajoz were completely reworked after 1169 and those that survive today are almost entirely of the Almohad period; the city only fell to the Christians permanently in 1226.&lt;ref&gt;Clemente Ramos, 677–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="float: right; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; width: 275px; border: solid 2px gray; background-color: white;"&gt;[[File:Camoens p263 131v Gerald the Fearless.JPG|center|250px]]&lt;br /&gt;

Other translation available online are J. J. Aubertin (London: 1884), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ct8IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 107], and [[Richard Francis Burton]] with Isabel Burton (London: 1880), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ln4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false vol. II, p. 296].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Legacy and legend==
Gerald left his mark on the toponymy of the Extremadura. A document of the [[Order of Calatrava]] of 1218 refers to the ''cabeza de giraldo'' ("head of Gerald") as a place, without indicating where it lay. Two streams, the Geradillo and the Geraldo, the first flowing from the second and into the Tagus, are also named after Gerald. The region where the stream originates is in the highlands around [[Casas de Miravete]], which is quite possibly the site of the ''cabeza''.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández Giménez (part III), 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legends which later arose surrounding Gerald are given concise retelling by [[:fr:Louis-Adrien Duperron de Castera|Louis-Adrien Duperron de Castera]], a French translator:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He was a man of rank, who, in order to avoid the legal punishment to which several crimes rendered him obnoxious, put himself at the head of a party of freebooters. Tiring, however, of that life, he resolved to reconcile himself to his sovereign by some noble action. Full of this idea, one evening he entered Évora, which then belonged to the Moors. In the night he killed the sentinels of one of the gates, which he opened to his companions, who soon became masters of the place. This exploit had its desired effect. The king pardoned Gerald, and made him governor of Évora. A knight with a sword in one hand, and two heads in the other, from that time became the armorial bearing of the city.&lt;ref&gt;From Mickle's translation of Castera's notes to Camoens, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/lus/lusbk08.htm p. 229 n3].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greubel Forsey''' is a [[watchmaking]] company specializing in ultra high-end timepieces. It was launched in 2004 by Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey and is based in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], Switzerland.   

Greubel Forsey specialize in inventing timepieces with multiple tourbillons and inclined balance wheels with the aim of improving timekeeping precision. Their approach was validated in 2011 when a Greubel Forsey Double Tourbillon Technique won the 2011 International Chronometry Competition held by the [[Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle|Le Locle Museum of Horology]].&lt;ref name= "Report on the 2011 International Chronometry Competition by the magazine of Haute Horlogerie"&gt;It us the most accurate mechanical wrist watch.[http://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/passion/from-the-workbench/2011-international-chronometry-contest-tissot-and-greubel-forsey-take-the-honours-3148/ Report on the 2011 International Chronometry Competition by the magazine of Haute Horlogerie]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate history ==

[[Image:Greubel Forsey manufacture.jpg|thumb|200px|Greubel Forsey Manufacture]]
Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey launched Greubel Forsey&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.hautehorlogerie.org/en/brands/partners/greubel-forsey/ History of Greubel Forsey], HauteHorologer.org&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 at [[BaselWorld]] with the introduction of their ''Double Tourbillon 30° (DT30)''. Both men had been working together since 1992 at Renaud &amp; Papi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronometrie.com/ap/apvisit04.htm "Renaud &amp; Papi - Design: company profile"], ''Chronometrie''&lt;/ref&gt; where they developed complicated watch movements.  

The [[Richemont]] group acquired a 20% stake in Greubel Forsey’s share capital in 2006.&lt;ref name="federation"&gt;[http://www.fhs.ch/en/news/news.php?id=504 Richmont/Greubel Forsey], entry in the [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 the company collaborated with American jeweller [[Harry Winston]] to make the ''Opus 6'' model.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The company has invented and presented a number of [[tourbillon]]-based watches including: the ''Double Tourbillon 30° (DT30°)'', the ''Quadruple Tourbillon à Différentiel'', the ''Tourbillon 24 Secondes Incliné'' and the ''GMT''. At the 2012 SIHH Greubel Forsey presented their first non-tourbillon model, the ''Double Balancier 35°''.

== Timepieces ==
Greubel Forsey specializes in designing and manufacturing high-end watches that are usually, but not exclusively, based on the [[Tourbillon]] escapement.

== Double Tourbillon ==

[[Image:Greubel_Forsey_DT30_mechanism.jpg|thumb|200px|Double Tourbillon 30° mechanism]]
'''
Double Tourbillon 30° (DT30°) Vision/Secret'''
The DT30° was presented in 2004 and features one 30° inclined tourbillon cage rotating once per minute inside another tourbillon cage rotating in four minutes.  The company claims rotating one inclined [[Tourbillon]] inside another averages out and minimizes gravitationally induced errors on the balance.

== Quadruple Tourbillon ==
The Quadruple Tourbillon uses two double-tourbillons—four tourbillon cages in total—working independently to average out and minimize gravitationally induced errors on the balance. A spherical differential connects the four rotating carriages, distributing torque between two wheels rotating at different speeds.

The Quadruple Tourbillon Secret, presented in 2012, houses a modified Quadruple Tourbillon ‘hidden’ under a full dial. The movement can be seen through the display back and the two double tourbillon systems—with four tourbillons in all—are configured head-to-tail and are coupled by a spherical differential.

==GMT==
[[Image:Greubel_Forsey-GMT_red_gold.jpg|thumb|200px|GMT in red gold]]
Presented in 2011, the GMT is the first Greubel Forsey timepiece to feature a complication other than a tourbillon. It displays a second time zone at 10 o’clock and the world by a rotating, three-dimensional globe at 8 o’clock. The position of the continents on the titanium globe are cross-referenced with the 24-hour chapter ring circling it for an approximate indication of time all over the world. Other indications include an hour-minute dial at 1 o’clock, a small seconds dial on top of that at 3 o’clock and at 4 o’clock a sectorial power reserve indicator. The movement was especially developed for this timepiece and features the 25° inclined Tourbillon 24 Secondes cage.

==Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain==
The Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/echoes/sihh-2012/greubel-forsey-tourbillon-24-secondes-contemporain-3254/Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain] Tourbillon 24 Secondes Contemporain&lt;/ref&gt; launched in 2012, has royal blue titanium plates and bridges with the movement architecture emphasising the technical aspects of the movement. A 24-second tourbillon is suspended by a transparent synthetic sapphire tourbillon. The T24 Second Contemporain is also notable for its round case, as opposed to the asymmetrical cases that Greubel Forsey are better known for.

==Double Balancier 35°==
The Double Balancier 35° &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtempus.com/en/news/top-news/detail/article/1359038797-greubel-forsey-the-first-double-balancier-in-watchmaking/Double Balancier 35°] Double Balancier 35°&lt;/ref&gt; features two inclined fixed-oscillators coupled with a spherical differential, which provides the average of their rates to the gear train and time display. Between the two visible inclined balances, small seconds at 7 o’clock displays the running instantaneous average of the two regulators, while a 72-hour power reserve indicator at 2 o’clock keeps track of available power.

==Art Piece 1==
Art Piece 1 is a collaboration between Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey with British micro-sculptor [[Willard Wigan]]. Art Piece 1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtempus.com/en/news/top-news/detail/article/1360144966-greubel-forsey-micro-treasure/ Art Piece 1] Art Piece 1&lt;/ref&gt; features integrated magnifying optics on the side of the case to enable the Willard Wigan micro-sculpture to be viewed.

==Invention Pieces==
Invention Pieces are designed to showcase the important invention/mechanism in the movement rather than simply indicating the time.

'''Invention Piece 1 (IP1)''' 2007
Invention Piece 1 features the Double Tourbillon 30° mechanism with a new movement architecture.  Red and blue triangles indicate the time under a large polished tourbillon bridge, with a small seconds dial and a ‘power reserve indicator’ above.

'''Invention Piece 2 (IP2)''' 2011
The Quadruple Tourbillon mechanism is at the heart of Invention Piece 2. The two double tourbillon systems are configured head-to-tail and are coupled by a spherical differential. A sub-dial at 5 o’clock features a red triangle indicating hours while a concentrically-configured rotating disc indicates minutes. Small seconds are at 10 o'clock and there is a power reserve indicator at 11 o'clock.

'''Invention Piece 3 (IP3)''' 2009
The Tourbillon 24 Secondes is the mechanism highlighted by Invention Piece 3. A large 24-hour sub-dial dominates the dial side, with hours indicated by a red triangle. A smaller blue triangle indicates minutes. Small seconds are at 5 o’clock. Opposite the tourbillon at 8 o’clock lies a power reserve at 2 o’clock. Four gold dial plates on the dial are engraved with a message in French from Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey.

== EWT  ==

The company presented in 2005 a proprietary development methodology called EWT (Experimental Watch Technology) to experiment, test and ratify their projects in-house. It's a proprietary research and development platform. It incorporates its own laboratory.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iw"&gt;[http://www.worldtempus.com/wt/1/11615/5668  EWT article], iW magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Two inventions current in EWT are the ‘''Binomial''’, a mono-material balance-and-spring wheel combination mechanism using isochronically stable materials, and the "Différentiel d’Egalité", a constant force device based in a spherical differential. This differential keeps providing the same constant force to all the four tourbillons, solving the typical problem where the main spring gives different amount of force depending on how much potential energy it retains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horomundi.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5291 Différentiel d’Egalité], scan of the announcement of the technology by the company&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes and awards==

Greubel Forsey won the Gaïa Prize in 2009 for 'Entrepreneurship';&lt;ref name= "GREUBEL FORSEY -  Winner of the 2009 Gaïa Prize"&gt;[http://www.worldtempus.com/en/news/top-news/detail/article/1251203742-greubel-forsey-winner-of-the-2009-gaia-prize/ World Tempus article announcing Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey awarded the 2009 Gaïa Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; the Grand Prix de l’Aiguille d’Or at the Grand Prix de l’Horlogerie de Genève in 2010 for the Double Tourbillon 30° Édition Historique in 5N red gold; and the International Chronometry Competition in 2011 for the Double Tourbillon 30 Technique.&lt;ref name="Report on the 2011 International Chronometry Competition by the magazine of Haute Horlogerie"/&gt;

==Naissance d’une montre==
In 2012, [http://www.legardetemps-nm.org/ Le Garde Temps, la Naissance d’une Montre] (the timepiece, birth of a watch) non-profit initiative was launched by Robert at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) in Geneva.

“Le garde-temps, naissance d’une montre” is a project by Robert Greubel, Stephen Forsey and independent watchmaker Philippe Dufour. The aim of the project is to preserve and propagate traditional horological knowledge and experience by teaching and helping master watchmaker and watchmaking teacher, Michel Boulanger, to make a small series of timepieces by hand using traditional techniques and methods.

== Founders ==
[[Image:Robert Greubel-Stephen Forsey.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert Greubel (left) and Stephen Forsey]]
Robert Greubel grew up in [[Alsace]], France and began his horological career by working with his watchmaker father in the family shop, Greubel Horlogerie. In 1987 Greubel moved to Switzerland to join the [[International Watch Company]] (IWC), where he helped develop their Grand Complication.  In 1990 he joined Renaud &amp; Papi SA (now [[Audemars Piguet]] Renaud &amp; Papi SA) as a prototypist for complicated movements and rose to become managing director and partner. 

Stephen Forsey grew up in [[St Albans]], England, where he was inspired by his father's passion for mechanics and engineering.  From 1987 to 1992 Forsey specialized in antique clock restoration and became head of Watch Restoration at Asprey’s in London. From 1988 to 1990 Forsey attended two five-month courses at the WOSTEP watchmaking school in Neuchâtel and in 1992 joined Robert Greubel's team at Renaud &amp; Papi SA (now Audemars Piguet Renaud &amp; Papi SA), developing complicated watch movements.

In 1999 both Greubel and Forsey began working independently, and in 2001 they founded together Complitime SA, a company specializing in created mechanisms with complicated movements for up-market watch brands.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moneyhouse.ch/u/p/complitime_sa_CH-645.1.010.506-2.htm Complitime SA], corporate info&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolsfeld, Paul, [http://www.corporatetrivia.com/current/2004/swiss/comp.html "CompliTime SA (Greubel Forsey)"], ''corporatetrivia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complitime.ch/ CompliTime website] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the world watch fair at [[BaselWorld]] in 2004, after many years in development, Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey launched their first watch, the Double Tourbillion 30° (DT30°), under their own brand ‘Greubel Forsey’.

Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey are founding members of the Time aeon Foundation&lt;ref name="aeon"&gt;[http://www.timeaeon.com/pdf/news_release_2008-04.pdf Time aeon press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Here be dragons'''" means dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of a medieval practice of putting illustrations of [[dragon]]s, [[Sea monster|sea-monster]]s and other mythological creatures on uncharted areas of maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-enchanting-sea-monsters-on-medieval-maps-1805646/ |title=The Enchanting Sea Monsters on Medieval Maps |last=Waters |first=Hannah |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2017-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Duzer |first1=Chet |title=Sea Monsters on Medieval and Renaissance Maps |publisher=British Library Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-0712357715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quote box|width=25%|align=right
|quote = As geographers, [[Quintus_Sosius_Senecio | Sosius]], crowd into the edges of their maps parts of the world which they do not know about, adding notes in the margin to the effect, that beyond this lies nothing but sandy deserts full of wild beasts, unapproachable bogs, [[Scythia]]n ice, or a frozen sea, so, in this work of mine, in which I have compared the lives of the greatest men with one another, after passing through those periods which probable reasoning can reach to and real history find a footing in, I might very well say of those that are farther off, beyond this there is nothing but prodigies and fictions, the only inhabitants are the poets and inventors of fables; there is no credit, or certainty any farther.
|source = [[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' (1st century)
}}

Although several early maps, such as the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', have illustrations of mythological creatures for decoration, the phrase itself is an [[anachronism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Erin C. | last = Blake | year = 1999 | title = Where Be "Here be Dragons"? | work = MapHist Discussion Group | publisher =  | url = http://www.maphist.nl/extra/herebedragons.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are just two known historical uses of this phrase in the [[Latin]] form "HC SVNT DRACONES"&lt;!-- sic; don't replace HC by HIC --&gt; (i.e. ''hic sunt dracones,'' 'here are dragons'). One is on the [[Hunt–Lenox Globe]]{{Ref|lenox_globe}} (c. 1503–07), on which the term appeared around the east coast of Asia. This might be related to the [[Komodo dragon]]s on the Indonesian islands, tales of which were quite common throughout East Asia.{{Ref|mccarthy}} The other appearance of the term is on a globe engraved on two conjoined halves of ostrich eggs, dated to 1504.&lt;ref name=Wapo/&gt; Earlier maps contain a variety of references to [[legendary creature|mythical]] and real creatures, but the Lenox Globe and the egg globe are the only known surviving maps to bear this phrase. Furthermore, the two maps may be closely linked: an investigation of the egg globe performed by collector Stefaan Missinne concluded that the Hunt–Lenox Globe is in fact a cast of it.
"'Here be dragons,' [is] a very interesting sentence," said Thomas Sander, editor of the ''Portolan'', the journal of the Washington Map Society. "In early maps, you would see images of sea monsters; it was a way to say there's bad stuff out there."&lt;ref name=Wapo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Meeri|title=Oldest globe to depict the New World may have been discovered|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-globe-to-depict-the-new-world-may-have-been-discovered/2013/08/19/503b2b4a-06b4-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html?hpid=z1|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical phrase used by ancient Roman and Medieval cartographers was ''HIC SVNT LEONES'' (literally, "here are [[lion]]s") when denoting unknown territories on maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Duzer|first=Chet|date=2014-06-04|title=Bring on the Monsters and Marvels: Non-Ptolemaic Legends on Manuscript Maps of Ptolemy’s Geography|url=http://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103923|journal=Viator|volume=45|issue=2|pages=303–334|doi=10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103923|issn=0083-5897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dragons on maps ==
[[File:Psalter World Map, c.1265.jpg|thumb|The 1265 [[Psalter world map]]]]
Dragons appear on a few other historical maps:
* The [[T and O map|T-O]] [[Psalter world map]] ({{circa|1250}} AD) has dragons, as symbols of [[sin]], in a lower "frame" below the world, balancing [[Jesus]] and [[angel]]s on the top, but the dragons do not appear on the map proper.
* The [[Borgia map]] (c. 1430), in the Vatican Library, states, over a dragon-like figure in [[Asia]] (in the upper left quadrant of the map), "''Hic etiam homines magna cornua habentes longitudine quatuor pedum, et sunt etiam serpentes tante magnitudinis, ut unum bovem comedant integrum.''" ("Here there are even men who have large four-foot horns, and there are even serpents so large that they could eat an ox whole.").
* The [[Fra Mauro Map]] (c. 1450) has the "[[Island of Dragons]]" ({{lang-it|Isola de' dragoni}}), an imaginary island in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Item 558 in: {{citation|title=Fra Mauro's World Map|authorlink=Piero Falchetta|first=Piero |last=Falchetta|publisher=Brepols |year=2006|isbn=2-503-51726-9|pages=294–295}}; also in [http://geoweb.venezia.sbn.it/cms/images/stories/Testi_HSL/FM_iscr.pdf the list online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an inscription near [[Herat]], [[Fra Mauro]] says that in the mountains nearby "there are a number of dragons, in whose forehead is a stone that  cures many infirmities", and describes the locals' way of hunting those dragons to get the stones. This is thought to be based on [[Albertus Magnus]]'s treatise ''De mineralibus''.&lt;ref&gt;"In le montagne de la citade de [[Herat|here]] sono dragoni assai, i qual hano una piera in fronte virtuosa a molte infirmitade".  Item 1457 in {{harvnb|Falchetta|2006|pp=462–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an inscription elsewhere on the map, the cartographer expresses his skepticism regarding "serpents, dragons and [[basilisk]]s" mentioned by "some historiographers".&lt;ref&gt;Item 460 in {{harvnb|Falchetta|2006|pp=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 19th-century Japanese map, the ''[[:File:Jishinnoben1855.jpg|Jishin-no-ben]]'', in the shape of [[ouroboros]], depicts a dragon associated with causing earthquakes.

== Other creatures on maps ==
* [[Ptolemy]]'s atlas in ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (originally 2nd century, taken up again in the 15th century) warns of [[elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus|hippos]] and [[Cannibalism|cannibals]].
* ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' (medieval copy of Roman map) has "in his locis elephanti nascuntur", "in his locis scorpiones nascuntur" and "hic cenocephali nascuntur" ("in these places elephants are born, in these places [[scorpion]]s are born, here [[Cynocephaly|Cynocephali]] are born").
* [[Cotton MS. Tiberius]] B.V. fol. 58v (10th century), British Library Manuscript Collection, has "hic abundant leones" ("here lions abound"), along with a picture of a lion, near the east coast of Asia (at the top of the map towards the left); this map also has a text-only serpent reference in southernmost [[Africa]] (bottom left of the map): "Zugis regio ipsa est et Affrica. est enim fertilis. sed ulterior bestiis et serpentibus plena" ("This region of Zugis is in Africa; it is rather fertile, but on the other hand it is full of beasts and serpents.")
* The [[Ebstorf map]] (13th century) has a dragon in the extreme south-eastern part of Africa, together with an [[asp (reptile)|asp]] and a [[basilisk]].
* [[Giovanni Leardo]]'s map (1442) has, in southernmost Africa, "Dixerto dexabitado p. chaldo e p. serpent".
* [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s Carta marina navigatoria (1516) has "an elephant-like creature in northernmost [[Norway]], accompanied by a legend explaining that this 'morsus' with two long and quadrangular teeth congregated there", i.e. a [[walrus]], which would have seemed monstrous at the time.
* Waldseemüller's Carta marina navigatoria (1522), revised by Laurentius Fries, has the morsus moved to the [[Davis Strait]].
* Bishop [[Olaus Magnus]]'s ''[[Carta Marina]]'' map of [[Scandinavia]] (1539) has many monsters in the northern sea, as well as a winged, bipedal, predatory land animal resembling a dragon in northern Lapland.
* On the maps surrounding [[imperialism]], up until the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 and the discoveries made by [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]], elephants were drawn in as is shown by this excerpt from "On Poetry: a Rhapsody" by [[Jonathan Swift]]: "So geographers, in Afric maps, With savage pictures fill their gaps, And o'er uninhabitable downs, Place elephants for want of towns."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19793">'''Hip hop studies''' is a multidisciplinary field of study that encompasses sociology, anthropology, communication and rhetoric studies, religious studies, [[cultural studies]], [[critical race theory]], [[Missiology|missiological studies]], [[art history]], [[dance]], [[musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[music theory]], and [[gender studies]].&lt;ref name=JHHS2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Monica|last2=Hodge|first2=Daniel White|last3=Coleman|first3=Jeffery|last4=Chaney|first4=Cassandra|title=The Hip in Hip Hop: Toward a Discipline of Hip Hop Studies|journal=Journal of Hip Hop Studies|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://savethekidsgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JHHS-Volume-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "hip hop studies" began circulating in the mid-2000s, and though it is not clear who first coined the term to label the field, the field of hip hop studies is oft cited as having been crystallized by the publication of ''That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader'' in 2003.&lt;ref name=TTJ2004&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Forman|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Neal|editor2-first=Marc Anthony|title=That's the Joint: The Hip Hop Studies Reader|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415969192|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''That's the Joint!'' includes approximately 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism. The publication of this anthology was unprecedented, and highlights the evolving and continuous influence of  "one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s."&lt;ref name=TTJ2004 /&gt; The publication of the first edition of ''That's the Joint!'' marked a consolidating moment for the field of hip hop studies because it brought together key writings on hip hop from a diversity of hip hop authorities.&lt;ref name=TTJ2004 /&gt;

[[Hip hop culture]], rooted in the 1970s post-industrial South Bronx, is polyvocal and is represented in five cultural modes: [[rap music]] (oral), [[turntablism]] or "[[DJing]]" (aural), [[B-boying|breaking]] (physical), [[graffiti]] art (visual), and knowledge (mental).&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt; Hip hop has, and continues to produce a remarkable array of thinkers who embody complex ideological makeups exemplified through their performances as writers, artists, poets, and scholars.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watkins|first1=S.

Craig Watkins]] labels the increasing interdisciplinary cohort of hip hop academics and scholars as the "hip-hop intelligentsia,"&lt;ref name="hip-hop intelligentsia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watkins|first1=S. Craig|title=Hip Hop Matters: Politics, Pop Culture, and the Struggle for the Soul of the Movement|date=2005|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0807009822|page=234|chapter=Chapter Nine: Artificial Intelligence?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that while this group of individuals may not often been discussed as an entity in and of itself, their existence is, without question, one of the greatest achievements of the hip hop movement.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; Watkins writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The growing array of hip-hop intellectuals is a spectacular indication of the movement's multifaceted demeanor and ceaseless energy...What has emerged is a body of thinkers who articulate a wide range of ideas that, in their unique way, map out the contradictory currents, ideas, and worldview that percolate throughout the phenomenal world of hip hop. From spoken-word artists to academic scholars hip-hop intellectuals are translating the movement into a vast mix of critical commentary and artistic expression. The results both energize and expand the image and imagination of the hip-hop intelligentsia."&lt;ref name="hip-hop intelligentsia" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hip hop studies is part of the larger [[Hip hop|hip hop movement]].&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; The research and teaching in this interdisciplinary field includes analyses of technology, pop culture, linguistics, globalization, geography, race, electoral politics, and a variety of aspects related to contemporary culture, as scholars attempt to critically assess hip hop as a movement.&lt;ref name=HHMatters2005 /&gt; Scholarship in hip hop studies is rooted in the foundational, Afro-diasporic [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] mechanism within hip hop culture.&lt;ref name=ForemanInterview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forman|first1=Murray|title='That's The Joint': A Scholarly Study of Hip-Hop|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4458410|accessdate=26 April 2015|agency=NPR|date=19 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies ==
{{Quote|text=The methodologies of examining hip hop are borrowed from sociology, politics, religion, economics, urban studies, journalism, communications theory, American studies, transatlantic studies, black studies, history, musicology, comparative literature, English, linguistics, and other disciplines.|sign=[[Michael Eric Dyson]]|source=''[https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Mean-Reflections-Hip-Hop/dp/0465018076 Know What I Mean?: Reflections on Hip-Hop]''(2007)}}

Hip hop studies' [[methodologies]], or methods of systematic inquiry and analysis, are drawn from a range of academic disciplines including anthropology, sociology, political science, history, linguistics, economics, performance studies, media and communicative studies, American studies, musicology, English and literature, women's and gender studies, and black studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyson|first1=Michael Eric|title=Know What I Mean? Reflections on Hip Hop|date=2010|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|location=New York|url=https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Mean-Reflections-Hip-Hop/dp/0465018076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Dimitriadis, formerly a professor in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Buffalo, was an academic who critically examined, amongst other topics, hip hop methodologies; writing "Questions of method are, at heart, questions about how one can best understand the world."&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dimitriadis|first1=Greg|title=Framing Hip Hop: New Methodologies for New Times|journal=Urban Education|date=2015|volume=50|issue=1|pages=31–51|doi=10.1177/0042085914563185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hip hop studies, this "world" encompasses the complexities of political, social, and economic exploitation of marginalized peoples, and hip hop practitioners'  resultant forms of resistant expression,&lt;ref name=Rose1994 /&gt; thus the frames of analysis used by scholars are equally complex and consider factors such as race, class, gender, gender identity, sexuality, location, and performance and performativity.&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015 /&gt; The use of [[ethnography]] is popular and preferred in hip hop studies because it is a mode of inquiry that enables a scholar to include a multiplicity of voices, and showcases the experiential knowledges of hip hop doers and consumers; ideally this method highlights the dual authority of practitioners' and academics' knowledges.&lt;ref name=Dimitriadis2015 /&gt;

== Foundational texts ==
Hip Hop studies has been growing as an academic discipline since the mid-1990s; two decades after its genesis. By the millennium and in the early 2000s, scholars such as [[Tricia Rose]], [[Michael Eric Dyson]], [[Cornel West]], [[Anthony B. Pinn]], [[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Jeff Chang]], [[Nelson George]], Bakari Kitwana, [[Mark Anthony Neal]], and Murray Forman, began engage Hip Hop's history, messages of resistance, social cognizance, personal awareness, political activism, pleasure and power, and community engagement in scholarly works that gave Hip Hop academic legitimacy.&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt;  Works by these authors are considered foundational texts in the field of Hip Hop studies because their research and publication served to legitimate Hip Hop as serious academic endeavor and since 2002 scholarly inquiry centralizing Hip Hop culture has multiple exponentially; exemplified by the inception of the [http://hiphoparchive.org Hip Hop Archive &amp; Research Institute at Harvard] in 2002,&lt;ref name=HHArchive@Harvard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=DJ Bobby|title=Hip Hop Archive &amp; Research Institute|url=http://hiphoparchive.org|website=Hip Hop Archive|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of the second edition of ''That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader'' in 2011.&lt;ref name=TTJ2011&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Forman|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Neal|editor2-first=Marc Anthony|title=That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tricia Rose's ''Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America '' (1994) ===
Discussions of scholarly writing on hip hop in the academia often begin with Tricia Rose's ''Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America'', published in 1994. This book is categorized within hip hop studies as being among the most important early full-length texts on rap and hip hop culture, which helped to establish hip hop studies as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woldu|first1=Gail Hilson|title=The Kaleidoscope of Writing on Hip-Hop Culture|journal=Notes|date=1 September 2010|volume=67|issue=1|pages=9–38|doi=10.1353/not.2010.0031}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rose's book gives a comprehensive account of the evolutionary history of hip hop culture. In Rose's words, ''Black Noise'' "examines the complex and contradictory relationships between forces of racial and sexual domination, black cultural priorities, and popular resistance in contemporary rap music,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|date=1994|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Introduction|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it outlines the social context of rap's existence. To achieve this analysis, Rose's includes a range of voices and perspectives by using an ethnographic approach; conducting interviews with hip hop performers and practitioners, as well as hip hop listeners and consumers.&lt;ref name=Rose1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Tricia|title=Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|date=1994|publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose's interviews were conducted throughout the United States, as well as in Hong Kong, China, and Japan.&lt;ref name=Rose1994 /&gt; Rose's groundbreaking work continues to be referenced as a foundational text by contemporary scholars because its detailed documentation of hip hop culture's revolution employs [[ethnography]], cultural theory, urban history and historiography, as well as [[Black feminism|black feminist thought]]; culminating in an extensive bibliography.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt;

=== Jeff Chang's ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation'' (2005) ===
Jeff Chang's comprehensive examination of hip hop, ''Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation'', received the American Book Award after its publication in 2005 and is often cited by hip hop cultural critics, hip hop journalists, popular-culture scholars, and hip hop academics.&lt;ref name=Chang2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Jeff|title=Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation|date=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42579-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang situates hip hop as "forged in the fires of the Bronx and Kingston, Jamaica,"&lt;ref name=Chang2005BACK&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Jeff|title=Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation|date=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-42579-1|page=Rear Cover Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that "hip-hop has been a generation-defining global movement," &lt;ref name=Chang2005BACK /&gt; shaped by the deindustrialization and globalization of the post-civil rights era.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt; Chang's method of inquiry and analysis hybrids statistical, historical, and ehtnographical data with a casual writing style that includes Chang's opinions, sections of extended dialogue, and interviews.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt; Chang's central themes in this text are race, and the intersections of race in hip hop agendas/politics.&lt;ref name=Chang2005 /&gt;

== College/university programs and degrees ==

[[Howard University]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]], was the first to offer a Hip Hop-specific class to students in 1991.&lt;ref name="ACADEMICYES2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/ACADEMIC-HIP-HOP-YES-YES-Y-ALL-2613595.php|title=ACADEMIC HIP-HOP? YES, YES Y'ALL.|last1=Harmanci|first1=Reyham|date=2007|website=SF Gate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proceeding two decades, colleges across the United States have begun to offer a variety of courses specifically about Hip Hop culture; these include top-ranked universities, such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Rice University|Rice]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[New York University|NYU]].&lt;ref name=JHHS2014 /&gt; Additionally, in 2012, the [[University of Arizona]] announced the implementation of a Hip Hop studies minor; the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wasserman|first1=Bonnie|title=Announcing a New Minor in Africana Studies with Concentration in Hip-Hop Cultures at the U of A!|url=http://africana.arizona.edu/news-events/announcing-new-minor-africana-studies-concentration-hip-hop-cultures-u|website=The University of Arizona: College of Humanities Africana Studies|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the University of Arizona's minor is the first interdisciplinary Hip Hop studies concentration of its kind, since 2009 at [[McNally Smith College of Music]] in St. Paul, Minnesota students can acquire a diploma in Hip Hop studies that focuses on Hip Hop music technique, music and audio production, and music industry economics and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diploma: Hip-Hop Studies|url=http://www.mcnallysmith.edu/diplomas/hip-hop-studies|website=McNally Smith College of Music|accessdate=5 March 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 [[Tiffin University]] in Ohio began offering a music performance degree for students with primary focus in emceeing and beatmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://polarentllc.com/producer-j-rawls-joins-tiffin-university-team/|title=Producer J Rawls Joins Tiffin University Team  Polar Ent LLC|website=polarentllc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiffin.edu/promusic|title=Professional Music|last=University|first=Tiffin|website=Tiffin University|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from classes and degree programs, development in the field has also been marked by the proliferation of conferences (domestically and internationally), symposiums, the development of readers and anthological texts, the establishment of the Hip Hop Archive and Research Institute at Harvard—each characteristic of a growing interest in and engagement with Hip Hop culture in academic discourse. In 2017, the top three universities to study Hip Hop at were [[McNally Smith College of Music]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campustales.com/281/top-3-universities-to-study-hip-hop-music|title=Top 3 Universities to Study Hip Hop Music|work=CampusTales|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques and critics ==

Hip Hop studies has not grown without critics, both within and outside the field. Davey D. (also known as: David Cook), a Bronx native and Hip Hop journalist, historian, adjunct professor, and community activist, has written and verbalized critiques of academic Hip Hop claiming that the narrow standards that define legitimate scholarly inquiry exclude individuals who do Hip Hop, in favor of published academics who may or may not have any lived or tangible connection to Hip Hop culture at all.&lt;ref name=ACADEMICYES2007 /&gt; In an article published by the ''San Francisco Globe'' in March 2007, Davey D. is quoted as saying: "You have an interesting phenomenon, where the 'hip-hop experts,' with university appointments attached to their name, have no credibility whatsoever in hip-hop circles. That, coupled with the fact that academia in a lot of places has always kept a distinct separation between what goes on in community and what happens on campus, is a source of tension."&lt;ref name=ACADEMICYES2007 /&gt; 
Hip hop's complex foundations have fostered a divergence of opinion amongst scholars regarding how writing on hip hop culture should be done.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt; Namely, this debate is centralized around questions of language, and for what audience(s) scholars should be writing to address: the academic and/or scholar, the dilettante, or the fan and/or self-self-proccalimed "hip hop head."&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt; Since approximately 1988, three categories of writing on hip hop culture have emerged: works by academics, works by journalists and cultural critics, and works by hip-hop devotees; critiques of hip hop studies include questions of which kind of writing is considered authentic or legitimate within the field, and the accessibility that outsiders, or non-academics, would have to those texts, both physically and comprehensively.&lt;ref name=Woldu2010 /&gt;
Other critics, such as [[Alex Beam]] a columnist for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', have claimed that the study of Hip Hop is unsuitable for critical academic study, citing the "celebration of ignorance, gangster-ism...and violence against women,"&lt;ref name=alexbeam&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beam|first1=Alex|title=Meet the rap-ademics|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2010/12/14/the_ivy_league_offers_its_esteemed_interpretation_of_hip_hop_lyrics/?p1=Features_link11|accessdate=5 March 2015|agency=Boston Globe|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mainstream rap and Hip Hop.&lt;ref name=alexbeam /&gt;

Despite the critiques previously mentioned, not all critics of Hip Hop studies are trying to point out the perceived flaws as ways to invalidate its place in academia. Hip Hop feminists and feminism offer critics of Hip Hop studies from a perspective which adds another facet to Hip Hop studies, one that not only involves but gives a platform and amplifies the voice of Black and Latinx women and the LGBTQ+ community as they face the most erasure in the world of Hip Hop studies, even though they were there from the very start. Published books such as ''Home Girls Make Some Noise: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123957643|title=Home girls make some noise : hip-hop feminism anthology|date=2007|publisher=Parker Publishing, LLC|others=Pough, Gwendolyn D., 1970-, Neal, Mark Anthony., Morgan, Joan.|isbn=1600430104|edition=First|location=Mira Loma, Calif.|oclc=123957643}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', is'' an anthology that features journals, poetry, and articles by both women of color and LGBTQ+ community which depict where Hip Hop began and the direction in which it very well may go.

The '''history of [[comics]]''' has followed different paths in different parts of the world. It can be traced back to early precursors such as [[Trajan's Column]], in [[Rome]], [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].

== Early narratives in art ==
[[File:Trajan's Column reliefs.jpg|thumb|right|Sequential depictions on [[Trajan's Column]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]
An example of an early precursor to print comics is [[Trajan's Column]].
Rome's [[Trajan's Column]], dedicated in 110 AD, is an early surviving example of a narrative told through [[Sequential art|sequential pictures]], while [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Greeks|Greek]] [[friezes]], medieval tapestries such as the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] and illustrated [[manuscript]]s also combine sequential images and words to tell a story. [[Biblia pauperum|Versions of the Bible relying primarily on images]] rather than text were widely distributed in Europe in order to bring the teachings of [[Christianity]] to the illiterate. In medieval paintings, multiple sequential scenes of the same story (usually a Biblical one) appear simultaneously in the same painting.

However, these works did not travel to the reader; it took the invention of modern printing techniques to bring the form to a wide audience and become a [[mass medium]].{{sfnm|1a1=Perry|1a2=Aldridge|1y=1989|1p=11|2a1=McCloud|2y=1993|2pp=11–14|3a1=Sabin|3y=1993|3pp=13–14}}

==Printing and cartoons==
{{also|Before 1900s in comics}}
The invention of the [[printing press]], allowing [[movable type]], established a separation between images and words, the two requiring different methods in order to be reproduced. Early printed material concentrated on [[religion|religious subjects]], but through the 17th and 18th centuries, they began to tackle aspects of [[politics|political]] and [[society|social life]], and also started to [[satire|satirize]] and [[caricature]]. It was also during this period that the [[speech bubble]] was developed as a means of attributing dialogue.

One of the first creators of comics was [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764). Hogarth created seven sets of sequential images on "Modern Moral Subjects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Randy|author2=Matthew J. Smith|title=The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture|year=2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9780826429360|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his works, ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', was composed of a number of canvases, each reproduced as a print, and the eight prints together created a narrative. As printing techniques developed, due to the technological advances of the [[industrial revolution]], magazines and newspapers were established. These publications utilized illustrations as a means of commenting on political and social issues, such illustrations becoming known as cartoons in the 1842. Soon, artists were experimenting with establishing a sequence of images to create a narrative.

While surviving works of these periods, such as [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow's]] ''[[A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish-Plot]]'' (c. 1682) as well as ''The Punishments of Lemuel Gulliver'' and ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] (1726), can be seen to establish a narrative over a number of images, it wasn't until the 19th century that the elements of such works began to crystallise into the [[comic strip]].

The [[speech balloon]] also evolved during this period, from the medieval origins of the ''phylacter'', a label, usually in the form of a scroll, which identified a character either through naming them or using a short text to explain their purpose. Artists such as [[George Cruikshank]] helped codify such ''phylacters'' as ''balloons'' rather than ''scrolls'', though at this time they were still called ''labels''. They now represented narrative, but for identification purposes rather than dialogue within the work, and artists soon discarded them in favour of running dialogue underneath the panels. Speech balloons were not reintroduced to the form until [[Richard F. Outcault]] used them for dialogue.{{sfn|Smolderen|2006}}

==Form established==
[[File:Toepffer Cryptogame 13.png|thumb|right|A page by [[Rodolphe Töpffer]], whose work is considered influential in shaping the comics form.]]
''[[The Glasgow Looking Glass]]'', published in 1826, was arguably the first comic strip.  A satirical publication, later known as ''The Northern Looking Glass'', it lampooned the fashions and politics of the times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLYNUOsMWvwC|title=International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature|author=Dennis Gifford|editor=Peter Hunt|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjWLaGvs0qEC|title=On Glasgow and Edinburgh|author=Robert Crawford|year=2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/books-poetry/have-i-got-old-news-for-you-glasgow-is-home-to-worlds-oldest-comic.1372064324|title=Have I got old news for you: Glasgow is home to world's oldest comic|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had all of the elements that make up the modern comic, including pictures with captions that display a continuous narrative told often in installments, and the use of speech bubbles, [[satire]] and caricature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/west-central/230141-glasgow-looking-glass-first-ever-comic-debate-at-glasgow-university/|title=Did you know that the first ever comic book was created in Glasgow?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodolphe Töpffer]], a Francophone Swiss artist, was a key figure in the early part of the 19th century. Though speech balloons fell from favour during the middle 19th century, Töpffer's sequentially illustrated stories, with text compartmentalized below images, were reprinted throughout Europe and the United States. The lack of [[Copyright|copyright laws]] at the time meant that [[Copyright infringement|pirated editions]] proliferated, and translated versions created a market on both continents for similar works.{{sfn|Beerbohm|2003}}

In 1843, Töpffer formalised his thoughts on the ''picture story'' in his ''Essay on Physiognomics'': "To construct a picture-story does not mean you must set yourself up as a master craftsman, to draw out every potential from your material—often down to the dregs! It does not mean you just devise caricatures with a pencil naturally frivolous. Nor is it simply to dramatize a proverb or illustrate a [[pun]]. You must actually invent some kind of play, where the parts are arranged by plan and form a satisfactory whole. You do not merely pen a joke or put a refrain in couplets. You make a book: good or bad, sober or silly, crazy or sound in sense."&lt;ref name="ref18"&gt;Translated by Weiss, E. in ''Enter: The Comics'', University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, pp.4. (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref18a"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/dp/2841620751 |title=Original French, extract |publisher=Amazon.fr |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref18b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lekti-ecriture.com/editeurs/Essai-de-physiognomonie.html |title=Original French, extract |publisher=Lekti-ecriture.com |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AllySloper.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Panels from the illustrated story ''Some of the Mysteries of Loan and Discount'', featuring [[Ally Sloper]] (1867).]]
In 1845, the [[Editorial cartoons|satirical drawings]], which regularly appeared in newspapers and magazines, gained a name: [[cartoons]]. (In art, a cartoon is a pencil or charcoal sketch to be overpainted.) The British magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', launched in 1841, referred to its 'humorous pencilings' as cartoons in a satirical reference to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the day, who were themselves organising an exhibition of cartoons, or preparatory drawings, at the time. This usage became common parlance, lasting to the present day.&lt;ref name="ref21"&gt;Varnum &amp; Gibbons, 2001. pp.77-78&lt;/ref&gt; Similar magazines containing cartoons in continental Europe included ''[[Fliegende Blätter]]'' and ''[[Le Charivari]]'', while in the U.S. ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'' and ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' were popular.&lt;ref name="ref22"&gt;{{cite news | title=Comics | work=St James Encyclopedia of pop culture (2002) | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100313 | accessdate=May 30, 2005 | first=Ian | last=Gordon | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1865 saw the publication of ''[[Max and Moritz]]'' by [[Wilhelm Busch]] by a German newspaper. Busch refined the conventions of sequential art, and his work was a key influence within the form, [[Rudolph Dirks]] was inspired by the strip to create ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'' in 1897.&lt;ref name="ref23"&gt;{{cite web|title=comic strip |work=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/comicstr.html |accessdate=June 22, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050728124410/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/comicstr.html |archivedate=July 28, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First serialized comics for a mass audience===
The first weekly comic to feature a regular character was ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'', which debuted in the British humour magazine ''Judy'' in 1867 and was created by [[C. H. Ross]] and illustrated by his French wife [[Emilie de Tessier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZlTAQAAQBAJ|title=Adult Comics|author= Roger Sabin|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QbbV7KK-HcAC|title=Cultural Theory: The Key Concepts|editor=Andrew Edgar, Peter Sedgwick|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 the then highly popular character was spun off into his own comic, ''Ally Sloper's Half Holiday'' published by Dalziel Brothers, eight pages long and printed in black and white at tabloid size. The magazine was extremely popular with the [[working class]] and may have had a circulation as high as 350,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YPk2N68PEyIC|title=Bryan Talbot|author=Lita Sorensen|year=2005|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, two more comic magazines debuted to the British public, ''[[Comic Cuts]]'' and ''[[Illustrated Chips]]'', establishing the tradition of the [[British comics|British comic]] as an [[anthology]] periodical containing comic strips.{{sfn|Sabin|1993|pp=17–21}}

In the United States, [[Richard F. Outcault|R.F. Outcault's]] work in combining speech balloons and images on ''[[The Yellow Kid|Hogan's Alley]]'' and [[The Yellow Kid]] has been credited as establishing the form and conventions of the comic strip,{{sfn|Sabin|1993|pp=133–134}} though academics have uncovered earlier works that combine speech bubbles and a multi image narrative. However, the popularity of Outcalt's work and the position of the strip in a newspaper retains credit as a driving force of the form.&lt;ref name="ref26"&gt;Marschall, Richard (February, 1989). "Oh You Kid". ''The Comics Journal'' 127, p. 72-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, Brian (2004) ''the comics: Before 1945''. [[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]] (United States). {{ISBN|978-0-8109-4970-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century and the mass medium==
The 1920s and 1930s saw further booms within the industry. The market for comic anthologies in Britain turned to targeting children through juvenile humor, with ''[[The Dandy]]'' and ''[[The Beano]]''. In Belgium, [[Hergé]] created ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' newspaper strip for [[Le Petit Vingtième|a comic supplement]]; this was successfully collected in a bound album and created a market for further such works. The same period in the United States had seen newspaper strips expand their subject matter beyond humour, with action, adventure and mystery strips launched. The collection of such material also began, with ''[[The Funnies]]'', a reprint collection of newspaper strips, published in tabloid size in 1929.

A market for such comic books soon followed, and by 1938 publishers were printing original material in the format. It was at this point that [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] launched, with ''[[Superman]]'' as the cover feature. The popularity of the character swiftly enshrined the superhero as the defining genre of [[American comic book]]s. The genre lost popularity in the 1950s but re-established its domination of the form from the 1960s until the late 20th century.

In Japan, a country with a long tradition for illustration, comics were hugely popular. Referred to as [[manga]], the Japanese form was established after World War II by [[Osamu Tezuka]], who expanded the page count of a work to number in the hundreds, and who developed a filmic style, heavily influenced by the Disney animations of the time. The Japanese market expanded its range to cover works in many genres, from juvenile fantasy through romance to adult fantasies. Japanese manga is typically published in large anthologies, containing several hundred pages, and the stories told have long been used as sources for adaptation into animated film. In Japan, such films are referred to as [[anime]], and many creators work in both forms simultaneously, leading to an intrinsic linking of the two forms.

During the latter half of the 20th century comics have become a very popular [[Comic book collecting|item for collectors]] and from the 1970s American comics publishers have actively encouraged collecting and shifted a large portion of comics publishing and production to appeal directly to the collector's community.

Writing in 1972, Sir [[Ernst Gombrich]] felt Töpffer had evolved a new pictorial language, that of an abbreviated art style, which allowed the audience to fill in gaps with their imagination.{{sfn|Gombrich|1972}}{{page needed|date=February 2012}}

The modern double use of the term ''comic'', as an adjective describing a genre, and a noun designating an entire medium, has been criticised as confusing and misleading. In the 1960s and 1970s, underground cartoonists used the spelling ''[[Underground comix|comix]]'' to distinguish their work from mainstream newspaper strips and juvenile comic books. Their work was written for an adult audience but was usually comedic, so the "comic" label was still appropriate.  The term ''[[graphic novel]]'' was popularized in the late 1970s, having been coined at least two decades previous, to distance the material from this confusion.&lt;ref name="ref38"&gt;''Var.'' (2003-4) {{cite web | title=The history of the term 'graphic novel' ... | url=http://www.geocities.com/rucervine/ | accessdate=June 26, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323155517/http://www.geocities.com/rucervine/|archivedate=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, comics scholarship started to blossom in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="ref39"&gt;Taylor, Laurie; Martin, Cathlena; &amp; Houp, Trena (2004) {{cite web | title=Introduction | work=ImageTexT Exhibit 1 (Fall 2004) | url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/exhibit1/introduction.shtml | accessdate=June 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a resurgence in the popularity of comics was seen, with [[Alan Moore]] and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] producing notable superhero works and [[Bill Watterson]]'s ''[[Calvin &amp; Hobbes]],'' and [[Gary Larson]]'s ''[[The Far Side]]'' being syndicated.

[[Webcomics]] have grown in popularity [[History of webcomics|since the mid 1990s]]. Since the inception of the [[World Wide Web]], artists have been able to self-publish comics on the [[Internet]] for a low cost. Hosting providers specifically designed for webcomics, such as [[Keenspot]] and [[Modern Tales]], allow for a type of [[print syndication|syndication]] of webcomics. [[Scott McCloud]] described in 2000 how creators of online comics can revolutionize the medium by embracing the digital space and making use of techniques such as [[infinite canvas]]. Webcomics became more prolific in the early 2000s, as respected comics awards such as the [[Eagle Awards|Eagle]] and [[Eisner Awards]] started adding [[List of webcomic awards|categories for digital comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=850|publisher=''Sequential Tart''|title=A Brief History of Webcomics &amp;ndash; The Third Age of Webcomics, Part One|last=Atchison|first=Lee|date=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Innocent Venus characters}}
In the near future, after the world population and economy is devastated by a series of simultaneous [[hypercane]]s,{{efn|Which occurred in 2010, in the ''Innocent Venus'' timeline.}} many different [[Political faction|faction]]s and fledgling nations appear. In Japan, an [[elite]] [[social class|class]] called ''[[Logos]]''{{efn|Originally, Logos was the name given to the system of special recovery zones. Over time, it also came to refer to those fortunate enough to be permanent residents of these zones.}} appears, controlling special zones in the country which have most of the wealth and resources. These special zones were created with the help of ''Power Assist Technology'',{{efn|In other words [[Powered exoskeleton]]s developed for both civil and military purposes.}} which allowed Japan to recover from the consequences of the worldwide disaster (which included a combination of [[land subsidence]] &amp; [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]] resulting in the [[Flash flood|permanent submerging]] of low-lying areas and a subsequent [[ice age]] in much of the [[Northern hemisphere]]), albeit to a strictly limited degree. The Logos exercise control over the ''Revenus'',{{efn|The origin of this term for the underclass is less clear, though it may refer to the fact that the Revenus acts as a cheap source of labor and certain other resources for the Logos (in French, the word Revenus can mean 'income', or alternatively 'return on investment'. It can also directly refer to a government's income, monetary or otherwise, from taxes and other [[Conscription|levies]]. The most common meaning of the term in modern French is 'Finance' though this is clearly not the implication of the term as it is used here). See also the derived English word [[wikt:revenue|revenue]].}}{{efn|Note that in some versions of the English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], Revenus is misspelled as 'Revinus'.}} a [[Underclass|lower class]] who mostly live in devastated &amp; often poverty stricken zones (urban or in close proximity) and areas (rural) known as [[Emmanuel Levinas|''Levinas'']]{{efn|Such routine [[law enforcement]] as exists in the Levinas (as opposed to [[riot control]] and [[Counter-insurgency|suppression]] operations which are generally carried out by the JDF [or occasionally Phantom in the case of the latter]) is conducted by the ''Levinas Police'', seemingly originally formed from the remnants of the old pre-disaster [[Law enforcement in Japan#Regional Public Safety Bureaus|regional police forces]]. The police in the Levinas are overstretched and under resourced, a situation which is made worse by the fact they are disliked by the Revenus for being 'dogs of the Logos', despite the fact that they are in much the same boat as the rest of the residents of the Levinas, albeit with a bit more certainty about where their next meal is coming from.}} (e.g. '''Levinas Sector Six''', '''Area 18''') and who struggle from day to day in order to stay alive. The Revenus are generally restricted{{efn|Except for a lucky few who have permits to work in the special zones, usually in low wage positions such as being [[servants]] for Logos families.}} from entering the special zones, causing tension which creates a [[resistance movement]] which fights back against the Logos.

With the tagline "A Near Future Late-Shogunate Action Animation", the story draws analogies with 19th-century Japan at the end of the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Shogunate]] period, just before the [[Boshin War]].{{efn|For example, the [[Director-general|''Director General'']] (of the Logos, and therefore post-disaster Japan in general, with the exception of the breakaway [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma Territory]]), who nominally heads up what was originally an [[Continuity of government|emergency government]] put in place during the aftermath of the disaster, can be said be a modern day [[Shogun]]. The fate of the pre-disaster [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Family]] is not made clear, though it's possible that they are kept in seclusion, much as the Emperor and his family was during the Tokugawa Shogunate.}}{{efn|Yet another example are the Logos zones, which can be said to equivalent in at least some respects to the [[Han system|''Han'' (Domain)]] system of the [[Edo period]].}}

The story proper is mainly set in 2035AD. Jō and Jin [[Defection|defect]] from ''Phantom'', an elite [[Irregular military|military]] [[special operations]] group which is used to help control the Revenus. When they escape, they take a young girl named Sana with them. The series follows them as they work to avoid being caught by Phantom and the regular military forces{{efn|Directly descended from the pre-disaster [[JSDF]] (right down to some of their older equipment, such as the [[Bell AH-1 Cobra#Japan|Fuji AH-1S]]) but now formally known as the ''Japan Defense Forces''. An alternate name is 'National Defense Forces'. They do not have the legal and political restrictions that the old ''Jieitai'' labored under, such as [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]]. This is partly because of the total collapse of the old political order including the constitution in the chaos following 2010 and partly due to an attempted full-scale invasion of Japan during the late 2020s by an alliance of hostile states calling itself the Asian Union, with the primary [[beachhead]] located at [[Kyushu]]. The JDF, using ''Heavy Warriors'' (effectively [[Chicken walker|walking]] [[medium tank]]s) &amp; [[main battle tank]]s supported by ''Light Warriors'' (soldiers in powered armor) and conventional infantry backed up in turn by other advanced technology such as high altitude [[aerostat]]s, along with the intervention of Phantom and it's ''Gladiator'' [[mech]]s at a pivotal point, were able to eventually decisively repel the invasion. (The air and sea power of the two sides having apparently mostly cancelled each other out by the closing stages of the campaign.)}}{{efn|Incidentally, it is implied in later episodes of the anime that some elements of the JDF including naval units had mutinied and joined Satsuma when it broke away from the rest of Japan around the late 2020s in the aftermath of the war with the Asian Union, once it had become clear how the Logos system had [[Tyranny|degenerated]] from what had been originally intended i.e. as a basis for the preservation &amp; ultimate recovery of Japan.}} of the Logos. However, there are more to things than meet the eye.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5958">'''Isabella Ormston Ford''' (1855–1924) was an English social reformer, [[suffragist]] and writer. She became a public speaker and wrote pamphlets on issues related to socialism, feminism and worker's rights. After becoming concerned with the rights of female mill workers at an early age, Ford became involved with trade union organisation in the 1880s. A member of the national administrative council of the [[Independent Labour Party]], she was the first woman to speak at a Labour Representation Committee (which became the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]) conference.

==Biography==
Isabella Ford was born 23 May 1855 in [[Headingley]], [[Leeds]], in the north of England. She was the youngest of eight children of [[Quaker]]s Robert Lawson Ford and Hannah (née Pease).&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; Her mother was a cousin of [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] [[Elizabeth Pease Nichol]].&lt;ref name=Crawford /&gt; Her father was a solicitor who ran a local night-school for mill-girls.&lt;ref name=histdic /&gt; Contact with these girls gave Ford and her sisters an insight into class differences and an interest in working conditions.&lt;ref name=histdic /&gt; When she was 16, she began teaching at her father's school.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

In the 1880s, Ford became involved with [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; She worked with tailoresses who were campaigning for better working conditions; she helped them to form a trade union and was involved when they went on strike in 1889.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;&lt;ref name=histdic /&gt; In 1890–91, she marched with workers from [[Lister Mills|Manningham Mills]] in [[Bradford]]. As a result of her involvement, she was elected a life member of the [[Leeds Trades and Labour Council]].&lt;ref name=histdic /&gt;

She helped found the Leeds [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and was president of the Leeds Tailoresses' Union.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; Her concerns were trade union organisation, socialism and female [[suffrage]]. She overcame a natural shyness to become an experienced public speaker, speaking at many meetings related to socialism, workers' rights and women's emancipation.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; She wrote many pamphlets, as well as a column in the ''Leeds Forward''. In 1895 she was elected [[Parish councils in England|parish councillor]] for [[Adel cum Eccup]] in Leeds.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

In the 1900s, Ford increased her focus on her work for the ILP, and was elected to the national administrative council.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; She became more involved in the national women's suffrage movement, but felt that feminism and the labour movement were equally important.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; In 1903 she spoke at the annual conference of the Labour Representation Committee (later the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]), and was the first woman to do so.&lt;ref name=histdic /&gt;

Following a 1904 debate with future politician [[Margaret Bondfield]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] described Ford as "a plain, middle-aged woman, with red face and turban hat crushed down upon her straight hair, whose nature yet seemed to me ... kindlier and more profound than that of her younger antagonist".&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

===Personal life===
Ford formed friendships with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden|Philip Snowden]], socialist writer [[Edward Carpenter]], poet [[Walt Whitman]], [[Josephine Butler]], [[Millicent Fawcett]] and [[Olive Schreiner]].&lt;ref name=Crawford /&gt;&lt;ref name=histdic /&gt; She lived most of her adult life with her sisters Bessie and [[Emily Ford|Emily]] in Adel Grange, the Leeds home that the family moved to when she was 10. Bessie Ford died in 1919 and her sisters moved to a smaller property called Adel Willows in 1922.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; Isabella Ford died 14 July 1924.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

==Posthumous recognition==
Ford's name and image, and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters, are etched on the [[plinth]] of the [[statue of Millicent Fawcett]] in [[Parliament Square]], London that was unveiled in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/women/millicent-fawcett-statue-parliament-square-london-caroline-criado-perez/ |title=Millicent Fawcett statue unveiling: the women and men whose names will be on the plinth |publisher=iNews |date= |accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1949">'''Katro''' is a traditional [[mancala]] game played by the [[Betsileo]] people in the [[Fianarantsoa Province]] of [[Madagascar]]. The game was first described by [[Alex de Voogt]] in 1998.

==Rules==
Katro is played on a 6 × 6 board (6 rows of 6 pits each). Each player controls half of the board (three rows). At game setup, two seeds are placed in each pit.

At his or her turn, the player [[Mancala#General gameplay|relay sow]]s the seeds from one of his or her pits, with the constraint that the chosen pit must be in the outermost non-empty row. As with most mancala-IV (i.e., mancalas with 4 rows), sowing is confined to the player's own rows. Sowing may occurs the player's pits in two "directions". Consider the following scheme:

&lt;code&gt;
: a b c d e f
: l k j i h g
: m n o p q r
: M N O P Q R
: L K J I H G
: A B C D E F
&lt;/code&gt;

The southern player can either sow like this:

&lt;code&gt;
: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R A B C....
&lt;/code&gt;

or like this:

&lt;code&gt;
: F E D C B A L K J I H G R Q P O N M F E D....
&lt;/code&gt;

If the last seed of the sowing in dropped in an empty pit, this may cause a capture if the following applies:

*the pit where the seed was dropped is the innermost non empty row;
*the opponent has a non empty pit in his or her innermost non empty row, in the same column.

If both conditions apply, all the seeds from the opponent's pit are captured, as well as the capturing seed. The player then resumes sowing, using the captured seeds.

The first player to be left without seeds loses the game.

'''Kaulā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: कौला) is the twelfth month in the [[Nepal Era]] calendar, the national [[lunar calendar]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Sambat gets national status |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5 |accessdate=19 May 2014 |newspaper=The Rising Nepal |date=24 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104054/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5 |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The month coincides with [[Ashvin]] (अश्विन्) in the [[Hindu lunar calendar]] and [[October]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

Kaulā begins with the [[new moon]] and the [[full moon]] falls on the 15th of the [[lunar month]]. The month is divided into the bright and dark fortnights which are known as Kaulā Thwa (कौला थ्व) and Kaulā Gā (कौला गा) respectively.

Kaulā is a festive month. On the third day of the bright fortnight, masked dances of the Goddess Rudrayani are performed in Khokna, a village to the south of [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Worshipping Rudrayani |url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Worshipping+Rudrayani&amp;NewsID=304584 |newspaper=The Himalayan Times |location=Kathmandu |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest event of the month is [[Dasain]], known as [[Mohani]] in [[Nepal Mandala]]. It is the longest religious celebration in the country, starting from the 1st day of the bright fortnight and continuing till the full moon day. However, the main celebrations last for four days from the 8th to the 11th days. The festivities consist of religious services in the clan's shrine house, family feasts, sword processions and masked dances of deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoek|first1= Bert van den|last2=Shrestha |first2= Balgopal |title=Guardians of the Royal Goddess: Daitya and Kumar as the Protectors of Taleju Bhavani of Kathmandu |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_19_02_03.pdf |accessdate=19 May 2014 |newspaper=CNAS Journal|page=191 |date=July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th day of the dark fortnight is the start of another great festival [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] or [[Swanti (festival)|Swanti]]. The first two days are dedicated to crows and dogs respectively. The 15th day is [[Lakshmi Puja]] when households worship the goddess of wealth in their private shrines.

This is a '''list of cultural references to ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''''', which was [[Emily Brontë]]'s only novel, specifically in literature and music.

For adaptations of the novel, see [[List of Wuthering Heights adaptations|List of ''Wuthering Heights'' adaptations]].

==References in literature==

They may have lids, and many lids have no doubt been lost. The equivalent shape in [[Korean ceramics]], where it was derived from Chinese examples, is called a [[Maebyeong]]. A distinct variant is the "truncated meiping", where there is only the top half of the usual shape, giving a squat vase with a wide bottom. This is largely restricted to [[Cizhou ware]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold (ed), ''The Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts'', p. 189, 1975, OUP, {{ISBN|0198661134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Menino de engenho''''' ('''Plantation boy''') is a [[novel]] written by the [[Brazil]]ian writer [[José Lins do Rego]]. It  was first published in [[1932 in literature|1932]]. 

==Synopsis==

Carlos Melo, or Carlinhos, narrates in [[Grammatical person|first person]], in a nostalgic manner, the childhood spent in the [[plantation]] Santa Rosa. When his father was sent to a mental house after killing his mother, Carlinhos moved from [[Recife]] to Santa Rosa, in the plantation that belonged to his grandfather, Coronel José Paulino. Carlinhos' childhood was divided between "good" and "evil": in the company of his aunt his behavior was more gentle (the "good"); living with his cousins, he was extroverted and libertine (the "evil").

Living in the plantation, Carlinhos became familiar with the [[social inequalities]] between the plantation masters and their employees; in addition, he almost joined the [[Cangaço]] (he even asked the bandit Antônio Silvino to let him follow the group). There Carlinhos also came to know love, first with his cousin Lili, who died as a child and later with another cousin, Maria Clara, who lived in Recife and spent a few days visiting the plantation. Maria Clara was a little older than Carlinhos and told him about all the fun and new things that happened in the city. But the romance didn't last long, as the cousin went back to Recife. Soon after, Carlinhos lost his "second mother": his aunt Maria got married and the boy was left to the care of his cold and strict aunt Sinhazinha.

However, aunt Sinhazinha's austerity made Carlinhos even more libertine: the boy, only twelve years old, caught gonorrhea. His relatives then decided to "set him straight" by sending him to school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1869">'''Nicholas Horner''' (died 4 March 1590) was an English [[Roman Catholic]] layman, [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] because he had relieved and assisted [[Christopher Bales]], a seminary priest. He is a Catholic martyr, [[beatified]] in 1987.

==Life==
Born at [[Grantley, Yorkshire|Grantley]] in [[Yorkshire]], he appears to have been following the calling of a tailor in London when he was arrested on the charge of harbouring Catholic priests. He was kept for a long time in a cell, contracted [[blood poisoning]] in one leg, and had it amputated.

He was afterwards set free, but when he was again found to be harbouring priests he was convicted of [[felony]], and as he refused to conform to the public worship of the [[Church of England]], was condemned. On the eve of his execution at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], he had a vision of a crown of glory hanging over his head; the story of this vision was told by him to a friend, who in turn transmitted it by letter to Father [[Robert Southwell (jesuit)|Robert Southwell]].

'''Nyau''' (also: ''Nyao'' meaning ''[[mask]]''&lt;ref&gt;D.D.Phiri: ''History of Malawi - From the earliest times to the year 1915''. in: CLAIM, pp.31 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; or ''initiation'') is a [[secret society]] of the [[Chewa people|Chewa]], an ethnic group of the [[Bantu peoples]] from [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]].&lt;ref name="Breugel 125-168"/&gt; The Nyau society consists of initiated members of the Chewa and Nyanja people, forming the cosmology or indigenous religion of the people. Initiations are separate for men and for women, with different knowledge learned and with different ritual roles in the society according to gender and seniority. Only initiates are considered to be mature and members of the ''Nyau''. The word ''Nyau'' is not only used for the society itself, but also for the indigenous religious beliefs or cosmology of people who form this society, the ritual dance performances, and the masks used for the dances. Nyau societies operate at the village level, but are part of a wide network of Nyau across the central and part of the southern regions of Malawi, eastern Zambia, western Mozambique and areas where Malawians migrated in Zimbabwe. During performances with the masks women and children often rush into the houses when a Nyau performer threatens, as the masks are worn by only male members of the society and represent male knowledge. At that moment in the performance and rituals, Nyau masked dancers are understood to be spirits of the dead. As spirits the masquerades may act with impunity and there have been attacks and deaths during performances in the past.&lt;ref name="Linden1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OttenbergBinkley2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ottenberg|first1=Simon|last2=Binkley|first2=David Aaron|title=Playful performers: African children's masquerades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3o_-JwBwW4C&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=19 June 2011|year=2006|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0286-6|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing [[westernization]] has led to a decrease in Nyau.

==History==
A cave painting in Zaire depicts ''Kasiya Maliro'', a type of Nyau mask that may date to 992 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="Bell2010" /&gt;  The Nyau cosmology continued during the time of the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] invasions in the mid-1800s and during the time of early colonists including Portuguese and British. According to local mythologies Nyau came from Malomba, a place in what is now the DRC.&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt; Due to heavy punishment for telling secrets to non-initiates about the Nyau cosmology (e.g. who are the men dancing) the origin of Nyau could not be clarified by the first missionaries and colonialists arriving in [[Maravi]].&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Rattray: ''Some Folk-Lore Stories and Songs in Chinyanja'', London: Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (1907), pp. 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Penalties went as far as the person revealing secrets being killed by members of the society.&lt;ref name="Breugel 125-168"/&gt; The arrival of missionaries during the 1920s had a growing influence on Nyau at the village level, which produced open conflict.&lt;ref name="Linden1974"/&gt; Though [[Christian missionaries]] banned Nyau in Chewa communities, the society and its practice survived under [[British colonial rule]] through adaptation that included some aspects of [[Christianity]]. Presently, it is still practiced with Chewa members belonging both to a [[Christian church]] and the Nyau society.&lt;ref name= "Embassy2007" /&gt; Although some other ethnic groups have developed cultural dances, such as the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]], [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]] and [[Mang'anja]],&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Schofeleers: ''Symbolic and Social Aspects of Spirits Worship among the Mang'anja'', Ph.D. Dissertation (1968) Oxford, pp. 307–415.&lt;/ref&gt;  the ''Nyau'' of the Chewa can be considered the most elaborate of the secret societies and dances in areas around [[Lake Malawi]].&lt;ref name="Hodgson1933"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgson |first = AGO |date= Jan–Jun 1933|title=Notes on the Achewa and Angoni of the Dowa District of the Nyasaland Protectorate |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=63|pages=146|jstor=2843914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chewa believe that life exists within their ancestors and those not yet born, as well as the living.&lt;ref name="Sitshwele2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.origins.org.za/news/entry/the_elephant_has_four_hearts_nyau_masks_and_rituals_a_book_review/|title=''The Elephant has Four Hearts: Nyau Masks and Rituals'' :a book review |last=Sitshwele|first=Miliswa |date=June 21, 2010|publisher=The Origins Centre is an initiative of the University of the Witwatersrand |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nyau beliefs include communication with those who are dead, or their spirits, calling this act ''pemphero lalikulu'' ("Great Prayer").&lt;ref name="Embassy2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malawiembassy-dc.org/gule.html|title=Gule Wamkulu |year=2007|publisher=Embassy of Malawi|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chewa believe in the presence of God in everyday life, and that God is both male (in the sky) and female (in the earth). Words for God include Chiuta, the great bow or rainbow in the sky and Namalango in the earth, like a womb, where seeds germinate and is a source of new life.&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Birch de Aguilar, Inscribing the Mask 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit world's symbolism is presented at the ''Gule Wamkulu'' ("Big Dance"), which incorporates ''mwambo'' ("traditions"), masks, song, dance and rules. Nyau incorporates sophisticated reverse role-playing, proverbs, mimicking and satire in performances. Primarily the ''Nyau'' perform their masked dances at [[funeral]]s, memorial services and initiations (for girls: [[Chinamwali]]). Each dancer represents a special character relating to the mask or animal structure he wears. The ''zilombo'' ("wild animals") are large constructions that cover the entire body and mostly represent animals, and the masks worn over the face are primarily ancestral spirits. The secrecy behind Nyau incorporates coded language, riddles, metaphor, myths and signing. Viewed with suspicion by outsiders, Nyau has been misunderstood and misrepresented by others, including the Christian church.&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curran1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curran |first=Douglas |date=Autumn 1999|title=Nyau Masks and Ritual |journal=African Arts|volume=68|issue=3|jstor=3337711|pages=68–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiation of men into the secret society begins with residing in a wooded grove, the place the dead are buried ([[cemetery]]) for a week or much longer in the past. Particularly in [[Zimbabwe]], Nyau members that migrated from Malawi and are now part of the [[Shona people|Shona Culture]] still practice Nyau rituals and hold Nyau religious beliefs. They perform dances in the suburbs of [[Mabvuku]], [[Highfield, Harare|Highfield]] and [[Tafara]]. They attempt to scare away people who wish to interview them saying "''Wavekutamba nemoto unotsva''" (you are now playing with fire you will get burnt).&lt;ref name=Zimbabwe/&gt;

Women and children and also some men may rush into the houses when a Nyau performer appears. Nyau is the presence of the dead, an encounter with a spirit and so associated with fear and ritual dread. However, senior women perform in the Gule Wamkulu with intricate clapping, singing, dancing and chanting, responding to the song of the masquerader and are close to the dancers. During the funeral period, women joke with the Nyau in a practice called ''kasinja'' whilst brewing beer and while staying awake the night before a funeral. Men and women both enter the graveyard grove burials at the end of the Nyau funeral performance. Initiated women attend the Nyau performances freely, though they will deny knowledge of the men wearing masks. The men are actual spirits in the ritual, and cannot be spoken of as men even though women will recognize their husbands, fathers, brother and uncles. Identifying the man wearing a mask is disrespectful to the religion, breaking the moment when the masquerade is the spirit of the dead, much as calling Eucharist a biscuit breaks the ritual moment when Christ is near and would be considered disrespectful to Christians. Uninitiated women and children, and uninitiated men, may be chased by Nyau performers and non-members are discouraged from coming near during funerals. In part this is to avoid outsiders from being disrespectful, not understanding the importance of a 'good' burial and the significance of the presence of the dead.&lt;ref name="Linden1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt; In [[Zambia]]n villages, boys may participate in groups called ''kalumbu'' who join a group from as young as five or six.&lt;ref name="Linden1974"/&gt; However, they must pay a joining fee (often around 2 ''[[Zambian kwacha|kwacha]]'' in 1993) which they raise by hunting and selling birds, or the fee is paid by their parents.&lt;ref name="Linden1974"/&gt; Upon joining the novices are often beaten with branches before learning the discipline.&lt;ref name="Linden1974"/&gt; The minimum age of boys or girls joining the ''Nyau'' itself is usually around ten years of age.&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Brian|title=Animals and ancestors: an ethnography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwWUUqApcj8C&amp;pg=PA135|accessdate=19 June 2011|date=14 September 2000|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-85973-491-9|pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dances==
[[File:Gule Wamkulu mask.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A ''Gule Wamkulu'' mask depicting a wild animal.]]
Nyau dances involve intricate footwork, flinging dust in the air. Dancers respond to specific drumbeats and songs depending on the mask type or character. The dancers, described as "fleet-footed or nimble-footed", appear in masks representing the dead, human being or animal; the weak-kneed run away from sights of such dances.&lt;ref name=Zimbabwe&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201006020093.html|title=Zimbabwe: Demystifying Intrigue of Nyau Culture|accessdate=18 June 2011|publisher=The Herald of the Government of Zimbabwe|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it may be considered in many places to be a [[folk dance]], this is certainly not the case; ''Nyau'' should rather be considered a religious dance, as its function is to communicate with the [[Veneration of the dead|ancestral world]].

Since 2005, '''''Gule Wamkulu''''' has been classified as one of the 90 [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]], a program by [[UNESCO]] for preservation of intangible cultural heritage. This dance form may date to the great Chewa Empire of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="UNESCO2005" /&gt; ''Gule Wamkulu'', or big dance, is the best-known and longest dance of the Nyau. It is also known as ''pemphero lathu lalikulu la mizimu'' ("great prayer to our ancestors") or ''gulu la anamwaliri'' ("dance of the ancestors"). Prior to the ''Gule Wamkulu'' dance, Nyau dancers observe a series of secret rituals which are associated with their society, a secret brotherhood.&lt;ref name="KalusaMtonga2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalusa|first1=Walima T.|last2=Mtonga|first2=Mapopa|title=Kalonga Gawa Undi X: a biography of an African chief and nationalist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDMp_rdE_d8C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=21 June 2011|date=2 January 2010|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9982-9972-5-6|pages=104–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is mainly performed at funerals and memorial services but also at initiations and other celebrations. The masks worn by the dancers on such performances are in the form of animals or "beasts" such as antelopes believed to capture the soul or spirit of the deceased that brings renewed life. The purpose of the dance is said to be a way of communicating messages of the ancestors to the villagers and making possible continued harvests and continued life. Nyau is a protection against evil and an expression of religious beliefs that permeate society.&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Breugel167"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breugel|first1=J. W. M. van|last2=Ott|first2=Martin|title=Chewa traditional religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpLXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Christian Literature Association in Malawi|isbn=978-99908-16-34-1|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attire==
The variety of masks resembling ancestors is huge and ever growing, unlike the animal structures. Some mask carvers are professionals while others are occasional artisans.&lt;ref name="UNESCO2005" /&gt; Over 400 masks which are associated with the Nyau society and the ''Gule wamkulu'' ritual are exhibited at the [[Kungoni#Chamare Museum|Chamare Museum]] in [[Dedza District]], [[Malawi]].&lt;ref name="Bell2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Deborah|title=Mask Makers and Their Craft: An Illustrated Worldwide Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6SMwQoawgoC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=18 June 2011|date=10 September 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4399-4|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masks===
[[File:Malawi face mask (UBC-2007).jpg|thumb|right|Malawi face mask]]
Nyau masks are constructed of wood and straw. and are divided into three types.&lt;ref name="Harding2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=Frances|title=The performance arts in Africa: a reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ua79p6OIBggC&amp;pg=PA291|accessdate=19 June 2011|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-26198-2|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is a feathered net mask, the second is a wooden mask and the third is a large zoomorphic basketry structure that envelops the entire body of the dancer.&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding2002"/&gt; Wearing the latter, dancers tend to turn around and around in a motion known as ''Nyau yolemba''.&lt;ref name="Harding2002"/&gt; They are representations of a large variety of characters, including wild animals such as antelope, lions and hyenas.&lt;ref name="OttenbergBinkley2006"/&gt; With names such as Bwindi, Chibano, and Wakana, the masks portray a variety of traits and types such as a philanderer, a helpless epileptic, lust, greed, foolishness, vanity, infertility, sorcery, and ambition.;&lt;ref name="Curran1999" /&gt; even a helicopter.&lt;ref name="UNESCO2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/22afr_uk.htm|title=Gule Wamkulu|year=2005 |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one Nyau member explains, the masks and performance represent all of humanity and all of the spirit world.&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;

There are a variety of mask types, some of which include:&lt;ref name="Breugel 125-168"/&gt;
* ''Bwana wokwera pa ndege/pa galimoto'' (Mister in a plane/in a car)  This mask shows how those who already had money and power in their lifetime will keep this even when they have passed in the ancestral world.
* ''Chabwera kumanda'' (the one who came back from the grave) is a character who misreads people and resembles an ancestor who hunts people in their dreams in order to get attention and offerings (e.g. beer, meat, etc.). His dance ''Chabwera kumanda'' chases people around which underlines his evil character.
* ''Kasinja'' or ''Kamchacha'' is the messenger of important ancestors. He sometimes partly plays some kind of moderator and tells which mask or animal is coming next to perform its dance.
* ''Kondola'' which originated as ''Msakambewa'' ("Mouse Hunter"), then changed into ''To Ndola'' (a man in a copper mining town), and then changed again, to ''Chizonono'' (someone afflicted with [[gonorrhea]]), is an example of a mask that has undergone transformation because of changing pressures and societal influences.
* ''Maliya'' (from [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]) represents a kind-hearted female ancestor. This dancer will sing and dance together with the people.
* ''Mfiti'' (male witch) wears a very nasty mask and has in general a very demolished and shaggy appearance. The outer shape resembles its evil character, since witches are believed to kill people with their ''juju''.
* ''Simoni'' (from [[Saint Peter]]) wears a red mask, resembling an Englishman with sunburn; he also wears a suit made of rags. This character might be a caricature of an English colonialist.

===Animal structures===
The Nyau members wearing animal structures resemble wild animals or ''nyama za ku tchire'', which appear at the time of death of people and therefore feared. There is some kind of hierarchy between the different animals, with some very respected animals (such as ''njobvu'', the elephant) and some less important. Highly respected animals are also believed to resemble very important ancestors such as chiefs or members of the Nyau cult. Most animal structures usually have a barrel-like shape, with an entry hole at the bottom. Inside the structure, bars are mounted to be able to carry the structure around. All structures completely cover the dancer, and the footprints are brushed away with branches by Nyau members.&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt; In the following some structures are explained in order of their importance.&lt;ref name="Breugel 125-168"/&gt;
*''Njobvu'' (the elephant) is the most important figure of all. Four Nyau dancers are needed to move this structure. ''Njobvu'' resembles an important chief, since the elephant is the most important animal for the Chewa, because of its size. Therefore, this rare structure is only seen at funerals for chiefs.
*''Ndondo'' (the snake) is the second-most important structure and is carried around by up to twelve men. It also resembles an important ancestor and is often seen at funerals for members of the Nyau.
*''Mkango'' (the lion) resembles the evil spirit of an ancestor, which attacks and even kills people. Therefore, some people run away as soon as they see ''Mkango'' approaching. The figure ''Mkango'' illustrates that ancestors must not be annoyed, just as a lion must not be annoyed, since it might attack people for their disrespect.

The antelope forms are considered the most beautiful and are widely known as Kasiyamaliro (to leave the funeral/burial behind). Standing ten feet tall and often covered in dried woven maize husks, these mask forms are the first to appear in performances to remember the deceased, as a sign that the deceased have now joined the spirits and ancestors. This is a time of remembrance and celebration of life.&lt;ref name="Birch"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35515">Sound is at the beginning of language learning. Children have to learn to distinguish different sounds and to segment the speech stream they are exposed to into units – eventually meaningful units – in order to acquire words and sentences. Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging: When you read, there are spaces between the words. No such spaces occur between spoken words. So, if an infant hears the sound sequence “thisisacup,” it has to learn to segment this stream into the distinct units “this”, “is”, “a”, and “cup.” Once the child is able to extract the sequence “cup” from the speech stream it has to assign a meaning to this word.&lt;ref name="Hoff, 2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Erika Hoff |title=Language development |publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning |location=Boston, MA |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-495-50171-9 |oclc=759925056  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the child has to be able to distinguish the sequence “cup” from “cub” in order to learn that these are two distinct words with different meanings. Finally, the child has to learn to produce these words. 
The acquisition of native language [[phonology]] begins in the womb&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/352781/description/Babies_learn_words_before_birth&lt;/ref&gt; and isn’t completely adult-like until the teenage years. Perceptual abilities (such as being able to segment “thisisacup” into four individual word units) usually precede production and thus aid the development of speech production.

== Prelinguistic development (birth – 1 year) ==

=== Perception ===

Children don’t utter their first words until they are about 1 year old, but already at birth they can tell some utterances in their native language from utterances in languages with different [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A precursor of language acquisition in young infants|journal=Cognition|year=1988|first1=J.|last1=Mehler|author2=P. Jusczyk, G. Lambertz, N. Halsted, J. Bertoncini, C. Amiel-Tison|volume=29|issue=2|pages=143–178 |url=|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(88)90035-2|pmid=3168420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1 month ====

===== Categorical perception =====
Infants as young as 1 month perceive some speech sounds as speech categories (they display [[categorical perception]] of speech). For example, the sounds /b/ and /p/ differ in the amount of breathiness that follows the opening of the lips. Using a computer generated continuum in breathiness between /b/ and /p/, Eimas et al. (1971) showed that English-learning infants paid more attention to differences near the boundary between /b/ and /p/ than to equal-sized differences within the /b/-category or within the /p/-category.&lt;ref name="Eimas 1971 303–306"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Speech perception in infants|journal=Science|year=1971|first1=P. D.|last1=Eimas|author2=E. R. Siqueland, P. Jusczyk, J. Vigorito|volume=171|issue=3968|pages=303–306 |url=|doi=10.1126/science.171.3968.303|pmid=5538846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their measure, monitoring infant sucking-rate, became a major experimental method for studying infant [[speech perception]].

[[Image:Eimas.jpg|frame|none|Fig. 1. Sucking rate for 20 ms VOT change across category boundary (left), 20 ms VOT change within category (middle), without VOT change (right). After Eimas et al.(1971).&lt;ref name="Eimas 1971 303–306"/&gt;]]

Infants up to 10–12 months can distinguish not only native sounds but also nonnative contrasts. Older children and adults lose the ability to discriminate some nonnative contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cross-language speech perception: Evidence for perceptual reorganization during the first year of life|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|year=1984|first1=J. F.|last1=Werker|author2=R. C. Tees|volume=7|issue=|pages=49–63 |url=|doi=10.1016/S0163-6383(84)80022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it seems that exposure to one’s native language causes the perceptual system to be restructured. The restructuring reflects the system of contrasts in the native language.

==== 4 months ====
At four months infants still prefer [[baby talk|infant-directed speech]] to adult-directed speech. Whereas 1-month-olds only exhibit this preference if the full speech signal is played to them, 4-month-old infants prefer infant-directed speech even when just the [[pitch contour]]s are played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acoustic determinants of infant preference for motherese speech|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|year=1987|first1=A.|last1=Fernald|authorlink=Anne Fernald|author2=P. K. Kuhl|volume=10|issue=3|pages=279–293 |url=|doi=10.1016/0163-6383(87)90017-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that between 1 and 4 months of age, infants improve in tracking the [[Prosody (linguistics)|suprasegmental]] information in the speech directed at them. By 4 months, finally, infants have learned which features they have to pay attention to at the suprasegmental level.

==== 5 months ====
Babies prefer to hear their own name to similar-sounding words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infants' recognition of the sound patterns of their own names|journal=Psychological Science|year=1995|first1=D. R.|last1=Mandel|author2=P. W. Jusczyk, D. B. Pisoni|volume=6|issue=5|pages=314–317 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1995.tb00517.x|pmid=25152566|pmc=4140581}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that they have associated the meaning “me” with their name, although it is also possible that they simply recognize the form because of its high frequency.

==== 6 months ====
With increasing exposure to the ambient language, infants learn not to pay attention to sound distinctions that are not meaningful in their native language, e.g., two acoustically different versions of the vowel /i/ that simply differ because of inter-speaker variability. By 6 months of age infants have learned to treat acoustically different sounds that are representations of the same sound [[categorical perception|category]], such as an /i/ spoken by a male versus a female speaker, as members of the same phonological category /i/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Perception of auditory equivalence classes for speech in early infancy|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|year=1983|first1=P. K.|last1=Kuhl|volume=6|issue=2–3|pages=263–285 |url=|doi=10.1016/S0163-6383(83)80036-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Statistical learning =====
{{Main|Statistical learning in language acquisition}}
Infants are able to extract meaningful distinctions in the language they are exposed to from statistical properties of that language. For example, if English-learning infants are exposed to a [[voicing (phonetics)|prevoiced]] /d/ to [[voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]] /t/ continuum (similar to the /d/ - /t/ distinction in Spanish) with the majority of the tokens occurring near the endpoints of the continuum, i.e., showing extreme prevoicing versus long voice onset times ([[bimodal distribution]]) they are better at discriminating these sounds than infants who are exposed primarily to tokens from the center of the continuum (unimodal distribution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infant sensitivity to distributional information can affect phonetic discrimination|journal=Cognition|year=2002|first1=J.|last1=Maye|author2=J. F. Werker, L. Gerken|volume=82|issue=3|pages=101–111 |url=|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(01)00157-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These results show that at the age of 6 months infants are sensitive to how often certain sounds occur in the language they are exposed to and they can learn which cues are important to pay attention to from these differences in frequency of occurrence. In natural language exposure this means typical sounds in a language (such as prevoiced /d/ in Spanish) occur often and infants can learn them from mere exposure to them in the speech they hear. All of this occurs before infants are aware of the meaning of any of the words they are exposed to, and therefore the phenomenon of statistical learning has been used to argue for the fact that infants can learn sound contrasts without meaning being attached to them.

At 6 months, infants are also able to make use of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] features of the ambient language to break the speech stream they are exposed to into meaningful units, e.g., they are better able to distinguish sounds that occur in [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] vs. unstressed [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Discrimination of polysyllabic sequences by one- to four-month-old infants|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1985|first1=R. G. |last1=Karzon |volume=39|issue=2|pages=326–342 |url=|doi=10.1016/0022-0965(85)90044-X|pmid=3989467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that at 6 months infants have some knowledge of the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] patterns in the speech they are exposed and they have learned that these patterns are meaningful.

==== 7 months ====
At 7.5 months English-learning infants have been shown to be able to segment words from speech that show a strong-weak (i.e., [[trochee|trochaic]]) [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] pattern, which is the most common stress pattern in the English language, but they were not able to segment out words that follow a weak-strong pattern. In the sequence ‘guitar is’ these infants thus heard ‘taris’ as the word-unit because it follows a strong-weak pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The beginning of word segmentation in English-learning infants|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1999|first1=P. W.|last1=Jusczyk|author2=D. M. Houston, M. Newsome|volume=39|issue=3–4|pages=159–207 |url=|doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0716|pmid=10631011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The process that allows infants to use [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] cues in speech input to learn about language structure has been termed “prosodic [[bootstrapping]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Morgan | first1= J. L. |author2= K.

==== 10-12 months ====
Infants now can no longer discriminate most nonnative sound contrasts that fall within the same sound [[categorical perception|category]] in their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cross-language speech perception: Evidence for perceptual reorganization during the first year of life|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|year=1984|first1=J F |last1=Werker |author2=R C Tees|volume=7|issue=|pages=49–63 |url=|doi=10.1016/S0163-6383(84)80022-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their perceptual system has been tuned to the contrasts relevant in their native language. 
As for word comprehension, Fenson et al. (1994) tested 10-11-month-old children’s comprehension vocabulary size and found a range from 11 words to 154 words.&lt;ref name="Fenson1994" /&gt; At this age, children normally have not yet begun to speak and thus have no production vocabulary. So clearly, comprehension vocabulary develops before production vocabulary.

=== Production ===

==== Stages of pre-speech vocal development ====
Even though children do not produce their first words until they are approximately 12 months old, the ability to produce speech sounds starts to develop at a much younger age. Stark (1980) distinguishes five stages of early speech development:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=R. E. | last=Stark |contribution=Stages of speech development in the first year of life| title=Child Phonology. Volume 1: Production| editor1-first=G.

Ferguson| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== 0-6 weeks: Reflexive vocalizations =====
These earliest vocalizations include crying and vegetative sounds such as breathing, sucking or sneezing. For these vegetative sounds, infants’ [[vocal folds|vocal cords]] vibrate and air passes through their vocal apparatus, thus familiarizing infants with processes involved in later speech production.

[[File:3 month old infant cooing in response to caregiver.ogv|thumb|A 14-week-old infant cooing as she interacts with a caregiver (''51 seconds'')]]

===== 6-16 weeks: Cooing and laughter =====
Infants produce cooing sounds when they are content. Cooing is often triggered by social interaction with caregivers and resembles the production of vowels.

===== 16-30 weeks: Vocal play =====
Infants produce a variety of vowel- and consonant-like sounds that they combine into increasingly longer sequences. The production of [[vowel]] sounds (already in the first 2 months) precedes the production of [[consonant]]s, with the first back consonants (e.g., [g], [k]) being produced around 2–3 months, and front consonants (e.g., [m], [n], [p]) starting to appear around 6 months of age. 
As for [[pitch contour]]s in early infant utterances, infants between 3 and 9 months of age produce primarily flat, falling and rising-falling contours. Rising [[pitch contour]]s would require the infants to raise [[glottis|subglottal]] pressure during the vocalization or to increase [[vocal folds|vocal fold]] length or tension at the end of the vocalization, or both. At 3 to 9 months infants don’t seem to be able to control these movements yet.&lt;ref name="Kent 1982 353–363"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acoustic features of infant vocalic utterances at 3, 6, and 9 months|journal=[[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]]|year=1982|first1=R.

Reduplicated [[babbling]] contains consonant-vowel (CV) [[syllable]]s that are repeated in reduplicated series of the same [[consonant]] and [[vowel]] (e.g., [bababa]). At this stage, infants’ productions resemble speech much more closely in timing and vocal behaviors than at earlier stages. 
Starting around 6 months babies also show an influence of the ambient language in their [[babbling]], i.e., babies’ [[babbling]] sounds different depending on which languages they hear. For example, French learning 9-10 month-olds have been found to produce a bigger proportion of [[voice (phonetics)|prevoiced]] [[stop consonant|stops]] (which exist in French but not English) in their [[babbling]] than English learning infants of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=VOT in the babbling of French- and English-learning infants|journal=Journal of Phonetics|year=2007|first1=D.

===== 10-14 months: Nonreduplicated babbling (or variegated babbling&lt;ref name="Oller1986" /&gt;) =====

Infants now combine different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s into [[syllable]] strings. At this stage, infants also produce various [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] patterns. During this transitional period from [[babbling]] to the first word children also produce “protowords”, i.e., invented words that are used consistently to express specific meanings, but that are not real words in the children’s target language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bates | first = E. |title = Language and Context: The Acquisition of Pragmatics | publisher = Academic Press | year = 1976 | location = New York, NY | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 12–14 months of age children produce their first word.
Infants close to one year of age are able to produce rising [[pitch contour]]s in addition to flat, falling, and rising-falling pitch contours.&lt;ref name="Kent 1982 353–363"/&gt;

== Development once speech sets in (1 year and older) ==

At the age of 1, children only just begin to speak, and their utterances are not adult-like yet at all. Children’s perceptual abilities are still developing, too. In fact, both production and perception abilities continue to develop well into the school years, with the perception of some [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] features not being fully developed until about 12 years of age.

=== Perception ===

==== 14 months ====
Children are able to distinguish newly learned ‘words’ associated with objects if they are not similar-sounding, such as ‘lif’ and ‘neem’. They cannot distinguish similar-sounding newly learned words such as ‘bih’ and ‘dih’, however.&lt;ref name="Werker 2002 1–30"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infants' ability to learn phonetically similar words: Effects of age and vocabulary size|journal=Infancy|year=2002|first1=J. F.|last1=Werker|author2=C. T. Fennel, K. M. Corcoran, C. L. Stager|volume=3|issue=|pages=1–30 |url=|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0301_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, while children at this age are able to distinguish [[syllable|monosyllabic]] [[minimal pair]]s at a purely phonological level, if the discrimination task is paired with word meaning, the additional cognitive load required by learning the word meanings leaves them unable to spend the extra effort on distinguishing the similar phonology.

==== 16 months ====
Children’s comprehension vocabulary size ranges from about 92 to 321 words.&lt;ref name="Fenson1994" /&gt; The production vocabulary size at this age is typically around 50 words. This shows that comprehension vocabulary grows faster than production vocabulary.

==== 18-20 months ====
At 18–20 months infants can distinguish newly learned ‘[[logatome|words]]’, even if they are phonologically similar, e.g. ‘bih’ and ‘dih’.&lt;ref name="Werker 2002 1–30"/&gt; While infants are able to distinguish [[syllable]]s like these already soon after birth, only now are they able to distinguish them if they are presented to them as meaningful words rather than just a sequence of sounds. 
Children are also able to detect mispronunciations such as ‘vaby’ for ‘baby’. Recognition has been found to be poorer for mispronounced than for correctly pronounced words. This suggests that infants’ representations of familiar words are [[phonetics|phonetically]] very precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spoken word recognition and lexical representation in very young children|journal=Cognition|year=2000|first1=D.|last1=Swingley|author2=R. N. Asley|volume=76|issue=2|pages=147–166 |url=|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00081-0|pmid=10856741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result has also been taken to suggest that infants move from a word-based to a [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]-based phonological system around 18 months of age.

===== Fast-mapping =====
Of course, the reason why children need to learn the sound distinctions of their language is because then they also have to learn the meaning associated with those different sounds. Young children have a remarkable ability to learn meanings for the words they extract from the speech they are exposed to, i.e., to map meaning onto the sounds. Often children already associate a meaning with a new word after only one exposure. This is referred to as “[[fast mapping]]”. 
At 20 months of age, when presented with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle and a cup) and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, even if they have never heard that [[pseudoword]] before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child meets word: "Fast mapping" in preschool children|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Research|year=1985|first=C.|last=Dollaghan|volume=28|issue=3|pages=449–454 |url=|pmid=4046586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acquisition of the novel name-nameless category principle|journal=Child Development|year=1994|first1=C.

[[Fast mapping]] is a necessary ability for children to acquire the number of words they have to learn during the first few years of life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=S. | last=Carey|contribution=The child as a word learner| title=Linguistics Theory and Psychological Reality| editor1-first=M.| editor1-last=Halle| publisher=MIT Press| place=Cambridge, MA| pages=264–293| year=1978 | contribution-url=| editor2=J. Bresnan, G. A. Miller| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2–6 years ====
At 2 years, infants show first signs of [[phonology|phonological]] awareness, i.e., they are interested in word play, rhyming, and [[alliteration]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoff, 2009"/&gt; Phonological awareness does continue to develop until the first years of school. For example, only about half of the 4- and 5-year olds tested by Liberman et al. (1974) were able to tap out the number of [[syllable]]s in multisyllabic words, but 90% of the 6-year-olds were able to do so.&lt;ref name="Liberman 1974 201–212"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Explicit syllable and phoneme segmentation in the young child|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1974|first1=I. Y.|last1=Liberman|author2=D. Shankweiler, F. W. Fischer, B. Carter|volume=18|issue=2|pages=201–212 |url=|doi=10.1016/0022-0965(74)90101-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most 3-4-year olds are able to break simple [[consonant]]-[[vowel]]-consonant (CVC) [[syllable]]s up into their constituents ([[syllable onset|onset]] and [[syllable rime|rime]]). The [[syllable onset|onset]] of a [[syllable]] consists of all the [[consonant]]s preceding the syllable’s [[vowel]], and the [[syllable rime|rime]] is made up of the vowel and all following consonants. For example, the onset in the word ‘dog’ is /d/ and the rime is /og/. Children at 3–4 years of age were able to tell that the [[pseudoword|nonwords]] /fol/ and /fir/ would be liked by a puppet whose favorite sound is /f/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Onsets and rimes as units of spoken syllables: Evidence from children|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1985|first=R.|last=Treiman|volume=39|issue=|pages=181–191 |url=|doi=10.1016/0022-0965(85)90034-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nursery rhymes, phonological skills and reading|journal=Journal of Child Language|year=1989|first1=P. E.|last1=Bryant|author2=L. Bradley, M. Maclean, J. Crossland|volume=16|issue=2|pages=407–428 |url=|doi=10.1017/S0305000900010485|pmid=2760133}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4-year olds are less successful at this task if the onset of the syllable contains a consonant cluster, such as /fr/ or /fl/. 
Liberman et al. found that no 4-year-olds and only 17% of 5-year-olds were able to tap out the number of [[phoneme]]s (individual sounds) in a word.&lt;ref name="Liberman 1974 201–212"/&gt; 70% of 6-year-olds were able to do so. This might mean that children are aware of syllables as units of speech early on, while they don’t show awareness of individual [[phoneme]]s until school age. Another explanation is that individual sounds do not easily translate into beats, which makes clapping individual phonemes a much more difficult task than clapping syllables. One reason why phoneme awareness gets much better once children start school is because learning to read provides a visual aid as how to break up words into their smaller constituents.&lt;ref name="Hoff, 2009"/&gt;

==== 12 years ====
Although children perceive [[rhythm]]ic patterns in their native language at 7–8 months, they are not able to reliably distinguish [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] words and [[phrase]]s that differ only in [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] placement, such as ‘HOT dog’ vs. ‘hot DOG’ until around 12 years of age. Children in a study by Vogel and Raimy (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The acquisition of compound vs. phrasal stress: the role of prosodic constituents|journal=Journal of Child Language|year=2002|first1=I.|last1=Vogel|author2=E. Raimy|volume=29|issue=2|pages=225–250 |url=|doi=10.1017/S0305000902005020|pmid=12109370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were asked to show which of two pictures (i.e., a dog or a sausage) was being named. Children younger than 12 years generally preferred the compound reading (i.e., the sausage) to the phrasal reading (the dog). The authors concluded from this that children start out with a lexical bias, i.e., they prefer to interpret phrases like these as single words, and the ability to override this bias develops until late in childhood.

=== Production ===

==== 12-14 months ====
Infants usually produce their first word around 12 –14 months of age. First words are simple in structure and contain the same sounds that were used in late [[babbling]].&lt;ref name="Vihman 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vihman | first = M. M. | authorlink = |title = Phonological Development. The Origins of Language in the Child | publisher = Blackwell | year = 1996 | location = Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lexical items they produce are probably stored as whole words rather than as individual [[segment (linguistics)|segments]] that get put together online when uttering them. This is suggested by the fact that infants at this age may produce the same sounds differently in different words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The role of vocabulary development in children's spoken word recognition and segmentation ability|journal=Developmental Review|year=1993|first=A. C.|last=Walley|volume=13|issue=3|pages=286–350 |url=|doi=10.1006/drev.1993.1015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 16 months ====
Children’s production vocabulary size at this age is typically around 50 words, although there is great variation in vocabulary size among children in the same age group, with a range between 0 and 160 words for the majority of children.&lt;ref name="Fenson1994" /&gt;

==== 18 months ====
Children’s productions become more consistent around the age of 18 months.&lt;ref name="Vihman 1996"/&gt; When their words differ from adult forms, these differences are more systematic than before. These systematic transformations are referred to as “[[phonology|phonological]] processes”, and often resemble processes that are typically common in the adult [[phonology|phonologies]] of the world’s languages (cf. [[reduplication]] in adult Jamaican Creole: “yellow yellow” = “very yellow” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gooden | first = S. |title = The Phonology and Phonetics of Jamaican Creole Reduplication | publisher = The Ohio State University, PhD Dissertation | year = 2003 | location = Columbus, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some common phonological processes are listed below.&lt;ref name="Hoff, 2009"/&gt;

===== Whole word processes (until age 3 or 4) =====
- ''Weak syllable deletion'': omission of an [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] [[syllable]] in the target word, e.g., {{IPA|[nænæ]}} for ‘banana’

- ''Final consonant deletion'': omission of the final [[consonant]] in the target word, e.g., {{IPA|[pikʌ]}} for ‘because’

- ''[[Reduplication]]'': production of two identical syllables based on one of the target word syllables, e.g., {{IPA|[baba]}} for ‘bottle’

- ''[[Consonant harmony]]'': a target word consonant takes on features of another target word consonant, e.g., {{IPA|[ɡʌk]}} for ‘duck’

- ''Consonant cluster reduction'': omission of a consonant in a target word cluster, e.g., {{IPA|[kæk]}} for ‘cracker’

===== Segment substitution processes (into the early school years) =====
- ''Velar fronting'': a [[velar consonant|velar]] is replaced by a [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] sound, e.g., {{IPA|[ti]}} for ‘key’

- ''Stopping'': a [[fricative consonant|fricative]] is replaced by a [[stop consonant|stop]], e.g., {{IPA|[ti]}} for ‘sea’

- ''Gliding'': a [[liquid consonant|liquid]] is replaced by a [[semivowel|glide]], e.g., {{IPA|[wæbɪt]}} for ‘rabbit’

==== 2 years ====
The size of the production vocabulary ranges from about 50 to 550 words at the age of 2 years.&lt;ref name="Fenson1994" /&gt; Influences on the rate of word learning, and thus on the wide range of vocabulary sizes of children of the same age, include the amount of speech children are exposed to by their caregivers as well as differences in how rich the vocabulary in the speech a child hears is. Children also seem to build up their vocabulary faster if the speech they hear is related to their focus of attention more often.&lt;ref name="Hoff, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How children use input to acquire a lexicon|journal=Child Development|year=2002|first1=E.|last1=Hoff|author2=L. Naigles|volume=73|issue=2|pages=418–433 |url=|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00415|pmid=11949900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the case if a caregiver talks about a ball the child is currently looking at.

==== 4 years ====
A study by Gathercole and Baddeley (1989) showed the importance of sound for early word meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of the role of phonological STM in the development of vocabulary in children: A longitudinal study|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|year=1989|first1=S. E.|last1=Gathercole|author2=A. D. Baddeley|volume=28|issue=2|pages=200–213 |url=|doi=10.1016/0749-596X(89)90044-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They tested the phonological memory of 4- and 5-year-old children, i.e., how well these children were able to remember a sequence of unfamiliar sounds. They found that children with better phonological memory also had larger vocabularies at both ages. Moreover, phonological memory at age 4 predicted the children’s vocabulary at age 5, even with earlier vocabulary and nonverbal intelligence factored out.

==== 7 years ====
Children produce mostly adult-like [[segment (linguistics)|segments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=When are speech sounds learned?|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders|year=1972|first=E. K.|last=Sander|volume=37|issue=1|pages=55–63 |url=|pmid=5053945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ability to produce complex sound sequences and [[syllable|multisyllabic]] words continues to improve throughout middle childhood.&lt;ref name="Vihman 1996"/&gt;

== Biological foundations of infants’ speech development ==

The developmental changes in infants’ vocalizations over the first year of life are influenced by physical developments during that time. Physical growth of the [[vocal tract]], brain development, and development of neurological structures responsible for vocalization are factors for the development of infants’ vocal productions.&lt;ref name="Hoff, 2009"/&gt;

=== Infants’ vocal tract ===
Infants [[vocal tract]]s are smaller, and initially also shaped differently from adults’ [[vocal tract]]s. The infant’s tongue fills the entire mouth, thus reducing the range of movement. As the facial skeleton grows, the range for movement increases, which probably contributes to the increased variety of sounds infants start to produce. Development of muscles and sensory receptors also gives infants more control over sound production.&lt;ref name="Hoff, 2009"/&gt;
The limited movement possible by the infant jaw and mouth might be responsible for the typical consonant-vowel (CV) alternation in [[babbling]] and it has even been suggested that the predominance of CV syllables in the languages of the world might evolutionarily have been caused by this limited range of movements of the human vocal organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Motor mechanisms in speech ontogeny: phylogenetic, neurobiological and linguistic implications|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|year=2001|first1=P. F.|last1=MacNeilage|author2=B. L. Davis|volume=11|issue=6|pages=696–700 |url=|doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(01)00271-9|pmid=11741020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences between the vocal tract of infants and adults can be seen in figure 3 (infants) and figure 4 (adults) below.

[[Image:infantvocaltract1.jpeg|thumb|left|Fig. 3. Infant vocal tract: H = hard palate, S = soft palate, T = tongue, J = jaw, E = epiglottis, G = glottis; After Vihman (1996)&lt;ref name="Vihman 1996"/&gt;]]

=== The nervous system ===
Crying and vegetative sounds are controlled by the [[brain stem]], which matures earlier than the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]]. Neurological development of higher brain structures coincides with certain developments in infants’ vocalizations. For example, the onset of cooing at 6 to 8 weeks happens as some areas of the [[limbic system]] begin to function. The limbic system is known to be involved in the expression of emotion, and cooing in infants is associated with a feeling of contentedness. Further development of the limbic system might be responsible for the onset of laughter around 16 weeks of age. The [[motor cortex]], finally, which develops later than the abovementioned structures may be necessary for canonical [[babbling]], which start around 6 to 9 months of age.&lt;ref name="Hoff, 2009"/&gt;

The '''Program on Negotiation''' ('''PON''') is a university [[consortium]] dedicated to developing the theory and practice of [[negotiation]] and [[dispute resolution]]. As a community of scholars and practitioners, PON serves a unique role in the world negotiation community. Founded in 1983 as a special research project at [[Harvard Law School]], PON includes faculty, students, and staff from [[Harvard University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Tufts University]].

The Program on Negotiation publishes the quarterly ''Negotiation Journal'' and the monthly ''Negotiation Briefings'' newsletter, and distributes the annual ''Harvard Negotiation Law Review''. Throughout the year PON offers a number of courses and training opportunities ranging in length from one day to an entire semester.

== History ==

In 1979, co-authors of the bestseller ''[[Getting to Yes|Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In]]'', [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury]], along with Bruce Patton founded the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]] (HNP), with a mission to improve the theory, teaching, and practice of negotiation and dispute resolution, so that people could deal more constructively with conflicts ranging from the interpersonal to the international. Fisher began by asking the question of what kind of advice could be given to both sides of a dispute, and in researching this question he came in contact with various professors, including James Sebenius, [[Lawrence Susskind]], [[Frank Sander]], and [[Howard Raiffa]], who collaborated to form the Program on Negotiation.

The Program on Negotiation was founded in 1983 as the world's first teaching and research center dedicated to negotiation and dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/about/|title=Welcome to the Program on Negotiation (PON)|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[umbrella organization]] with founding members from both Harvard and MIT, it soon expanded to include Tufts University as one of its consortium schools. Since the beginning, the Program on Negotiation has been multi-disciplinary, with scholars from economics, government, law, business, psychology, anthropology, education, and the arts. Faculty have focused on a wide range of research topics, including deal-making, diplomatic negotiations, international negotiations, psychological aspects of negotiations, decision-making, issues relating to ethics and trust, and labor negotiations.

Chair of the Program on Negotiation since 1994, Professor Robert H. Mnookin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/faculty/robert-mnookin-chair-pon-executive-committee/|title=Robert Mnookin, Chair, PON Executive Committee|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Samuel Williston Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Among his recent publications are the books, ''Beyond Winning: Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/beyond-winning-negotiating-to-create-value-in-deals-and-disputes/|title=Beyond Winning Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/bargaining-with-the-devil-when-to-negotiate-when-to-fight/|title=Bargaining with the Devil When to Negotiate, When to Fight|work=PON - Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==

PON offers a number of training programs throughout the year on a variety of topics including negotiation, mediation, conflict resolution, deal design, difficult conversations, and many more. PON seminars and courses are open to the public.

=== Author Sessions ===
The Program on Negotiation offers one day Author Sessions focused on recent book publications by PON faculty members as part of its Executive Education Series. Recent courses included: Deal-Making and Negotiauctions, Creating a World-class Negotiating Organization, Bargaining with the Devil, and Negotiating International Deals.

=== Executive Education ===
Executive Education courses last for three days, covering strategies for business leaders to handle both successful day-to-day management and long-term strategies for healthy workplace environments. Executives learn tactics for dealing with dirty tricks, threats, attacks, and stonewalls from the other side of the table.

=== Harvard Negotiation Institute ===
Harvard Negotiation Institute (HNI) classes are offered every June and September on the Harvard Law School campus and cover a broad range of negotiation and mediation skills, ranging from beginning to advanced techniques. Most of the courses offered are five-day classes. However, a 2-day Intensive Negotiation Workshop for Lawyers and Working Professionals is also offered. Recent course offerings included: a mediation workshop, Creating Value in Deals and Disputes, Tools for Preparing and Negotiating Effectively, Deal Design and Implementation, and Difficult Conversations.

=== PON Seminars ===
Open to participants from all disciplines and professional fields, the PON [[Seminars]] provide negotiation and [[mediation]] courses to the community. These semester-length courses are designed to increase public awareness and understanding of successful conflict resolution efforts.

Two courses are taught each year: Negotiation and Dispute Resolution in the fall, and Mediation and Conflict Management in the spring. Both courses provide participants with a conceptual framework and practical advice for professional and personal development in dispute resolution. Faculty is drawn from the PON community of scholars and practitioners of alternative dispute resolution.

The Program on Negotiation also hosts a variety of smaller workshops and intensive two-day courses in addition to their normal course offerings, including on-site training.

== Great Negotiator Award ==

The Program on Negotiation established the [[Great Negotiator Award]] in 2000 to honor individuals of extraordinary achievement in dispute resolution. The award is designed not only to honor the accomplishments of outstanding negotiators, but also to focus public attention on the important role of negotiation as society faces increasingly complex disputes in all sectors–public and private, technological and ethical, personal and professional. PON has recognized a diverse cast of distinguished negotiators from their respective fields: [[Juan Manuel Santos]], [[2016 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and President of [[Colombia]] (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/09/santos-receives-2017-great-negotiator-award/ |title= Santos receives 2017 Great Negotiator Award |publisher= news.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Martti Ahtisaari]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient and former President of [[Finland]] (2010); [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]], the artists who created [[The Gates]] in [[Central Park]] (2008); [[Bruce Wasserstein]], Chairman and CEO of [[Lazard]], an international financial advisory and asset management firm (2007); [[Sadako Ogata]], former [[United Nations]] high commissioner for refugees (2005); [[Richard Holbrooke]], former United States ambassador to the United Nations (2004); [[Stuart Eizenstat]], former U.S. ambassador to the [[European Union]] (2003); Ambassador [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], the United Nations’ special envoy for [[Afghanistan]] (2002); [[Charlene Barshefsky]], U.S. trade representative in the second [[Clinton administration]] (2001); and former U.S. Senator [[George J.

The '''[[Programme for International Student Assessment]]''' has had several runs before [[Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment#PISA_2012|the most recent one in 2012]]. The first PISA assessment was carried out in 2000. The results of each period of assessment take about one year and a half to be analysed. First results were published in November 2001. The release of raw data and the publication of technical report and data handbook only took place in spring 2002. The triennial repeats follow a similar schedule; the process of seeing through a single PISA cycle, start-to-finish, always takes over four years. 470,000 15-year-old students representing 65 nations and territories participated in PISA 2009. An additional 50,000 students representing nine nations were tested in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;PISA 2009 Technical Report, 2012, OECD, http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/60/31/50036771.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Every period of assessment focuses on one of the three competence fields of reading, math, science; but the two others are tested as well. After nine years, a full cycle is completed: after 2000, reading was again the main domain in 2009.

===PISA 2000===
The results for the first cycle of the PISA survey were released on 14 November 2001. 265,000 15 year-olds were tested in 28 OECD countries and 4 partner countries on mathematics, science and reading. An additional 11 countries were tested later in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.oecd.org/edu/school/programmeforinternationalstudentassessmentpisa/33690591.pdf|title = Literacy Skills for the World of Tomorrow: Further Results from PISA 2000|publisher = [[OECD]]|year = 2003|accessdate = 2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other studies==
The [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation]] between PISA 2003 and TIMSS 2003 grade 8 country means is 0.84 in mathematics, 0.95 in science. The values go down to 0.66 and 0.79 if the two worst performing developing countries are excluded. Correlations between different scales and studies are around 0.80. The high correlations between different scales and studies indicate common causes of country differences (e.g. educational quality, culture, wealth or genes) or a homogenous underlying factor of cognitive competence. [[European Economic Area]] countries perform slightly better in PISA; the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] and Asian countries in TIMSS. Content balance and years of schooling explain most of the variation.&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Wu: ''A Comparison of PISA and TIMSS 2003 achievement results in Mathematics.'' Paper presented at the AERA Annual Meeting, New York, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The results from PISA 2003 and PISA 2006 were featured in the 2010 documentary [[Waiting for "Superman"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKTfaro96dg|title=Waiting for "Superman" trailer|accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Education professor Yong Zhao has noted that PISA 2009 did not receive much attention in the Chinese media, and that the high scores in China are due to excessive workload and testing, adding that it's "no news that the Chinese education system is excellent in preparing outstanding test takers, just like other education systems within the Confucian cultural circle: Singapore, Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong."&lt;ref name=zhao&gt;{{citation|url = http://zhaolearning.com/2010/12/10/a-true-wake-up-call-for-arne-duncan-the-real-reason-behind-chinese-students-top-pisa-performance|title = A True Wake-up Call for Arne Duncan: The Real Reason Behind Chinese Students Top PISA Performance|author = Yong Zhao|date = 10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from [[Shanghai]], [[China]], had the top scores of every category ([[Mathematics]], [[Reading (process)|Reading]] and [[Science]]) in PISA 2009. In discussing these results, PISA spokesman [[Andreas Schleicher]], Deputy Director for Education and head of the analysis division at the OECD’s directorate for education, described Shanghai as a pioneer of educational reform in which "there has been a sea change in pedagogy". Schleicher stated that Shanghai abandoned its "focus on educating a small elite, and instead worked to construct a more inclusive system. They also significantly increased teacher pay and training, reducing the emphasis on rote learning and focusing classroom activities on problem solving."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2035586,00.html#ixzz17XACd2S2|title = China Beats Out Finland for Top Marks in Education|first = Peter|last = Gumbel|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = 7 December 2010|accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schleicher also states that PISA tests administered in rural China have produced some results approaching the OECD average: Citing further, as-yet-unpublished OECD research, Schleicher said, "We have actually done Pisa in 12 of the provinces in China. Even in some of the very poor areas you get performance close to the OECD average."&lt;ref name="ft-1"&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/20770bf6-01e7-11e0-b66c-00144feabdc0.html|work = [[Financial Times]]|date = 7 December 2010|title = Shanghai tops global state school rankings|first = Chris|last = Cook|accessdate = 28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schleicher says that for a developing country, China's 99.4% enrollment in primary education is "the envy of many countries". He maintains that junior secondary school participation rates in China are now 99%; and in Shanghai, not only has senior secondary school enrollment attained 98%, but admissions into higher education have achieved 80% of the relevant age group. Schleicher believes that this growth reflects quality, not just quantity, which he contends the top PISA ranking of Shanghai's secondary education confirms.&lt;ref name="ft-1" /&gt; Schleicher believes that China has also expanded school access and has moved away from learning by rote.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2010/12/07/why-are-chinese-schoolkids-so-good/|title = Why are Chinese schoolkids so good?|first = Henry|last = Mance|date = 7 December 2010|accessdate = 28 June 2012|work = [[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Schleicher, Russia performs well in rote-based assessments, but not in PISA, whereas China does well in both rote-based and broader assessments.&lt;ref name="ft-1" /&gt;

===Denmark===
[[University of Copenhagen]] Professor Svend Kreiner, who examined in detail PISA's 2006 reading results, noted that in 2006 only about ten percent of the students who took part in PISA were tested on all 28 reading questions. "This in itself is ridiculous,” Kreiner told Stewart. "Most people don't know that half of the students taking part in PISA (2006) do not respond to any reading item at all. Despite that, PISA assigns reading scores to these children."&lt;ref&gt;https://ifsv.sund.ku.dk/biostat/biostat_annualreport/images/c/ca/ResearchReport-2011-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
The stable, high marks of Finnish students have attracted a lot of attention. According to Hannu Simola&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Simola|first = Hannu|year = 2005|url = http://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hsimola/Finnish%20PISA%20Miracle%2005.pdf|title = The Finnish miracle of PISA: Historical and sociological remarks on teaching and teacher education|journal = Comparative Education|volume = 41|issue = 4|pages = 455–470|doi = 10.1080/03050060500317810}}&lt;/ref&gt; the results reflect a paradoxical mix of progressive policies implemented through a rather conservative pedagogic setting, where the high levels of teachers' academic preparation, social status, professionalism and motivation for the job are concomitant with the adherence to traditional roles and methods by both teachers and pupils in Finland's changing, but still quite paternalistic culture. Others advance Finland's low poverty rate as a reason for its success.&lt;ref name=NEA /&gt;&lt;ref name=NSSP /&gt; Finnish education reformer Pasi Sahlberg attributes Finland's high educational achievements to its emphasis on social and educational equality and stress on cooperation and collaboration, as opposed to the competition among teachers and schools that prevails in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cleland |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/12/what-americans-keep-ignoring-about-finlands-school-success/250564/ |title=What Americans Keep Ignoring About Finland's School Success – Anu Partanen |work=The Atlantic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Of the 74 countries tested in the PISA 2009 cycle including the "+" nations, the two Indian states came up 72nd and 73rd out of 74 in both reading and mathematics, and 73rd and 74th in science. India's poor performance may not be linguistic as some suggested. 12.87% of US students, for example, indicated that the language of the test differed from the language spoken at home. while 30.77% of Himachal Pradesh students indicated that the language of the test differed from the language spoken at home, a significantly higher percent&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pisa2009.acer.edu.au/interactive_results.php |title=Database – PISA 2009 |publisher=Pisa2009.acer.edu.au }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike American students, those Indian students with a different language at home did better on the PISA test than those with the same language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; India's poor performance on the PISA test is consistent with India's poor performance in the only other instance when India's government allowed an international organization to test its students&lt;ref&gt;http://ddp-ext.worldbank.org/EdStats/INDprwp08b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and consistent with India's own testing of its elite students in a study titled ''Student Learning in the Metros 2006.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.ei-india.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Student-Learning-in-the-Metros-Issue-2.pdf|title = Student Learning in the Metros|first = Educational|last = Initiatives|date = November 2006|work = Educational Initiatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies were conducted using TIMSS questions.  The poor result in PISA was greeted with dismay in the Indian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/poor-pisa-ranks-hrd-seeks-reason/896777|title = Poor PISA ranks: HRD seeks reason|first = Anubhuti|last = Vishnoi|date = 7 January 2012|work = The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that as of 2008, only 15% of India's students reach high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7267315.stm|publisher = BBC News|first = Zareer|last = Masani|title = India still Asia's reluctant tiger|date = 27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Two studies have compared high achievers in mathematics on the PISA and those on the U.S. [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP). Comparisons were made between those scoring at the "advanced" and "proficient" levels in mathematics on the NAEP with the corresponding performance on the PISA.  Overall, 30 nations had higher percentages than the U.S. of students at the "advanced" level of mathematics. The only [[OECD]] countries with worse results were Portugal, Greece, Turkey, and Mexico. Six percent of U.S. students were "advanced" in mathematics compared to 28 percent in Taiwan.  The highest ranked state in the U.S. (Massachusetts) was just 15th in the world if it was compared with the nations participating in the PISA. 31 nations had higher percentages of "proficient" students than the U.S. Massachusetts was again the best U.S. state, but it ranked just ninth in the world if compared with the nations participating in the PISA.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul E. Peterson]], Ludger Woessmann, [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]], and Carlos X. Lastra-Anadón (2011) "Are U.S. students ready to compete?  The latest on each state's international standing." ''Education Next'' 11:4 (Fall): 51–59. http://educationnext.org/are-u-s-students-ready-to-compete/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]], [[Paul E. Peterson]], and Ludger Woessmann (2011) "Teaching math to the talented." ''Education Next'' 11, no. 1 (Winter): 10–18. http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons with results for the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS) appear to give different results—suggesting that the U.S. states actually do better in world rankings.&lt;ref&gt;Gary W. Phillips (2007) ''Chance favors the prepared mind: Mathematics and science indicators for comparing states.'' Washington: American Institutes for Research (14 November); Gary W. Phillips (2009) ''The Second Derivative:International Benchmarks in Mathematics For U.S. States and School Districts.'' Washington, DC: American Institutes for Research (June).&lt;/ref&gt; This can likely be traced to the different material being covered and the United States teaching mathematics in a style less harmonious with the "Realistic Mathematics Education" which forms the basis of the exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PISA Mathematics: A Teacher’s Guide|url=https://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Inspection-Reports-Publications/Evaluation-Reports-Guidelines/insp_pisa_maths_teach_guide_pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Countries that commonly use this teaching method score higher on PISA, and less highly on TIMSS and other assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loveless|first1=Tom|title=International Tests Are Not All the Same|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/01/09-timss-pisa-loveless|website=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poverty====
Stephen Krassen, professor emeritus at the University of Southern California,&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/research/how-poverty-affected-us-pisa-s.html Valerie Strauss, "How poverty affected U.S. PISA scores", ''The Washington Post'', December 9, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mel Riddile of the [[National Association of Secondary School Principals|NASSP]] attributed the relatively low performance of students in the United States to the country's high rate of child [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], which exceeds that of other OECD countries.&lt;ref name=NEA&gt;"[http://neatoday.org/2010/12/09/a-look-at-the-economic-numbers-on-international-education-rankings/ The Economics Behind International Education Rankings]" National Educational Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NSSP&gt;{{citation|url = http://nasspblogs.org/principaldifference/2010/12/pisa_its_poverty_not_stupid_1.html|title = PISA: It's Poverty Not Stupid|date = 15 December 2010|first = Mel|last = Riddile|publisher = [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, individual US schools with poverty rates comparable to Finland's (below 10%), as measured by reduced-price school lunch participation, outperform Finland; and US schools in the 10–24% reduced-price lunch range are not far behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simplystatistics.org/2013/08/23/stratifying-pisa-scores-by-poverty-rates-suggests-imitating-finland-is-not-necessarily-the-way-to-go-for-us-schools/ |title=Stratifying PISA scores by poverty rates suggests imitating Finland is not necessarily the way to go for US schools |publisher=Simply Statistics |date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reduced price meal|Reduced school lunch]] participation is the only available intra-poverty indicator for US schoolchildren. In the United States, schools in locations in which less than 10% of the students qualified for free or reduced-price lunch averaged PISA scores of 551  (higher than any other OECD country). This can be compared with the other OECD countries (which have tabled figures on children living in relative poverty):&lt;ref name=NSSP /&gt;

====Sampling errors====
In 2013 Martin Carnoy of the Stanford University Graduate School of Education and Richard Rothstein of the [[Economic Policy Institute]] released a report, "What do international tests really show about U.S. student performance?", analyzing the 2009 PISA data base. Their report found that U.S. PISA test scores had been lowered by a sampling error that over-represented adolescents from the most disadvantaged American schools in the test-taking sample.&lt;ref&gt;See, [http://www.epi.org/publication/us-student-performance-testing/ Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein, "What do international tests really show about U.S. student performance?", Economic Policy Institute, January 28, 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; The authors cautioned that international test scores are often “interpreted to show that American students perform poorly when compared to students internationally” and that school reformers then conclude that “U.S. public education is failing.” Such inferences, made before the data has been carefully analyzed, they say, “are too glib”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/01/15/u-s-scores-on-international-test-lowered-by-sampling-error-report/ Valerie Strauss, "U.S. scores on international test lowered by sampling error: report", ''Washington Post'', January 15, 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; and "may lead policymakers to pursue inappropriate and even harmful reforms."&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy and Rothstein, "What do international tests really show about U.S. student performance?", Economic Policy Institute, January 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnoy and Rothstein observe that in all countries, students from disadvantaged backgrounds perform worse than those from advantaged backgrounds, and the US has a greater percentage of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The sampling error on the PISA results lowered U.S. scores for 15-year-olds even further, they say. The authors add, however, that in countries such as Finland, the scores of disadvantaged students tends to be stagnant, whereas in the U.S the scores of disadvantaged students have been steadily rising over time, albeit still lagging behind their those of their more advantaged peers. When the figures are adjusted for social class, the PISA scores of all US students would still remain behind those of the highest scoring countries, nevertheless, the scores of US students of all social backgrounds have shown a trajectory of improvement over time, notably in mathematics, a circumstance PISA's report fails to take into account.

Carnoy and Rothstein write that PISA spokesman Schleicher has been quoted saying that “international education benchmarks make disappointing reading for the U.S.” and that “in the U.S. in particular, poverty was destiny. Low-income American students did (and still do) much worse than high-income ones on PISA. But poor kids in Finland and Canada do far better relative to their more privileged peers, despite their disadvantages” (Ripley 2011)."&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher was quoted by Amanda Ripley to this effect in her 2011 book, ''The Smartest Kids in The World'' (Simon and Schuster).&lt;/ref&gt; Carnoy and Rothstein state that their report's analysis shows Schleicher and Ripley's claims to be untrue. They further fault the way PISA's results have persistently been released to the press before experts have time to evaluate them; and they charge the OECD reports with inconsistency in explaining such factors as the role of parental education. Carnoy and Rothstein also note with alarm that the US secretary of education [[Arne Duncan]] regularly consults with PISA's Andreas Schleicher in formulating educational policy before other experts have been given a chance to analyze the results.&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy and Rothstein, "What do international tests really show about U.S. student performance?", EPI, January 28, 2013. Another scholar, Matthew di Carlo of the Albert Shanker Institute, criticized PISA for reporting its results in the form of national rankings, since rankings can give a misleading impression that differences between countries' scores are far larger than is actually the case. Di Carlo also faulted PISA's methodology for disregarding factors such as margin of error. See [http://shankerblog.org/?p=1535 Matthew di Carlo, "Pisa For Our Time: A Balanced Look", [[Albert Shanker Institute]] website, January 10, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; Carnoy and Rothstein's report (written before the release of the 2011 database) concludes:&lt;blockquote&gt;We are most certain of this: To make judgments only on the basis of national average scores, on only one test, at only one point in time, without comparing trends on different tests that purport to measure the same thing, and without disaggregation by social class groups, is the worst possible choice. But, unfortunately, this is how most policymakers and analysts approach the field.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The most recent test for which an international database is presently available is PISA, administered in 2009. A database for TIMSS 2011 is scheduled for release in mid-January 2013. In December 2013, PISA will announce results and make data available from its 2012 test administration. Scholars will then be able to dig into TIMSS 2011 and PISA 2012 databases so they can place the publicly promoted average national results in proper context. The analyses we have presented in this report should caution policymakers to await understanding of this context before drawing conclusions about lessons from TIMSS or PISA assessments.&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy and Rothstein, "What do international tests really show about U.S. student performance?", EPI, January 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8545">{{About|quoting text|information about the punctuation mark|Quotation mark|economic usage|Financial quote|7=Quotation (disambiguation)|10=other uses|11=Quotation (disambiguation)}}

A '''quotation''' is the repetition of one  expression as part of another one, particularly when the quoted expression is well-known or explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to its original source, and it is indicated by ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.

A quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].

==Reasons for using quotations==
Quotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.&lt;ref&gt;Capone, A., &amp; Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common quotation sources==
Famous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines—with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics—have also become commonplace.

==Quotations and the Internet==
Chiefly a text medium in the beginning, the [[World Wide Web]] gave rise to any number of personal quotation collections that continue to flourish, even though very few of them seem to facilitate accurate information or correct [[citation]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The increase of written means of informal communication brought about by the [[Internet]] has produced the practice of using quotations as personal flags, as in one's own [[signature block]]. This is most commonly seen in [[email]] messages and [[Usenet]] posts, while it is almost never seen in [[blog]] posts. Quotations are also popular as a user's personal message, a line under the user's nickname in some [[Instant Messaging]] clients (and here they often go uncited). In all these cases, quotations are usually included to give a glimpse of the user's personality, to make a statement of their beliefs, or to spread views and ideas.

The sheer bulk of online quotations, combined with more efficient search engines, has effectively made the [[Internet]] the world's quotation storehouse, encompassing an unprecedented number of easily obtainable quotations. Though matters of accuracy still remain, features such as [[Amazon.com]]'s ''Search Inside the Book'' and [[Google Book Search]] may serve to alleviate such concerns.

==United Kingdom copyright law==
Section 30(1) of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] (apparently in transposition of Article 5(3)(d) of the [[Copyright Directive|EU Copyright Directive]] on quotations) allows fair dealing with a copyrighted work for the purpose of criticism or review, provided that it is accompanied by sufficient acknowledgement.

==Misquotations==
{{further|False attribution}}
Many quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.&lt;ref&gt;See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Star Trek'' catchphrase "[[Beam me up, Scotty]]" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include "[[Just the facts, ma'am]]" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), "[[Sherlock Holmes#"Elementary, my dear Watson"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]), "[[Luke, I am your father]]" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), "[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), "[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and "[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''). &lt;ref&gt;The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play. See [[q:List of misquotations|List of misquotations]] and [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/signature/elementary.asp "Elementary, My Dear Watson"] at Snopes.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webb ''did'' say: "All we want are the facts ma'am". See [[Just the facts, ma'am]], [[q:List of misquotations|List of misquotations]] and [http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/dragnet.asp "Just the Facts"] at Snopes.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/moments02.html Greatest Film Misquotes - Part 2], Tim Dirks at filmsite.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|nsdZKCh6RsU|We Dont Need No Stinkin Badges!}} although the last of these is spoken by one of the Mexican Bandits that Hedley Lamarr attempts to hire as mercenaries in ''Blazing Saddles''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dirty Harry quotation "Do you feel lucky, punk?" is a rewording of the original dialogue: "You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?" Humphrey Bogart's character Rick in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' never said "Play it again, Sam." The actual expression is "Play it, Sam." Mae West did not say "Why don't you come up sometime and see me?" in ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', but rather "Why don't you come up and see me sometime?"

'''Rural delivery service''' refers to services for the delivery of [[mail]] to [[rural area]]s.  Examples include [[Rural Free Delivery]] in the [[United States Postal Service|United States]] and the [[Rural Mail Box]] addressing system in [[Australia Post|Australia]]. Such services may be based on [[post road]]s, or may make use of alternate forms of transport, such as [[mail delivery by animal]], [[dogsled mail|including dogs]] and [[pigeon post|pigeons]].

Such services are in contrast to those suitable only to [[urban area]]s, such as the [[Prague pneumatic post]] and the [[London Pneumatic Despatch Company]].

== Plot ==
The newly established private high school for girls, Goryoukan Academy, has a hidden face that people on the outside don't know about. The world you know is under threat by aliens, named "Oburi" (apparitions). These enemies are too strong for normal humans, and are especially threatening due to the fact that they can travel through to the 'fourth' dimension where they can be safe. For some reason, certain young girls are able to harness the power to transverse these dimensions, and enter a 'fifth' dimension - a [[multiverse|parallel universe]].

The only ones capable of fighting this enemy of mankind are girls known as "Strikers", who have the ability to sense the fifth dimension. Goryoukan Academy is actually an organization that seeks out girls who are more than meets the eye and trains them up for the "Fifth Force", a combat force created to subjugate the Oburi.

There are endless amounts of parallel universes, all of which are similar but run in their own way. The Strikers are able to fight the Oburi by searching these alternate worlds for alternative "[[Memory card]]" (Memoca) costumes that are usable by them and effective against the "Oburi".

You have been chosen by a mysterious person to lead a group of 5 girls in defeating an enemy that is threatening to destroy the world. Why you were chosen and who you are yourself is a mystery...

== Gameplay ==
Schoolgirl Strikers is a card collecting mobile game with [[Role-playing game|RPG]] and [[visual novel]] influences. It was released in 2014 and is available for iOS and Android devices. Some of the things that make Schoolgirl Strikers different from your average card collecting game are the special story missions and the 3D battle system; along with the ability to dress the girls up as you see fit. The way the battle system as a whole works is also quite different; you can choose any girls you want (limited to 5 at a time) to be in your team as long as you have at least one card of them. Then you add main and sub "Memocas" to them instead of just simply putting the cards themselves in a battle deck. The main Memocas also affect the girls' appearances in battle.

'''Sexual identity''' is how one thinks of oneself in terms of to whom one is [[romance (love)|romantically]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexually]] attracted.&lt;ref name="Reiter"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiter L |title=Sexual orientation, sexual identity, and the question of choice|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|volume=17 |pages=138–50|year=1989}}[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g248324552457105/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sexual identity'' may also refer to '''sexual orientation identity''', which is when people identify or dis-identify with a [[sexual orientation]] or choose not to identify with a sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=apa2009&gt;{{cite journal|title=Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|pages=63, 86|date=2009|accessdate=February 3, 2015|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf|quote=Sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual identity and [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] are closely related to sexual orientation, but they are distinguished,&lt;ref name="Reiter"/&gt; with ''[[Identity (social science)|identity]]'' referring to an individual's conception of themselves, ''behavior'' referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and ''sexual orientation'' referring to romantic or sexual attractions toward persons of the opposite [[sex]] or [[gender]], the same sex or gender,  to both sexes or more than one gender, or to no one.

Historical models of sexual identity have tended to view its formation as a process undergone only by [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], while more contemporary models view the process as far more universal and attempt to present sexual identity within the larger scope of other major identity theories and processes.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670"&gt;Dillon, F. R., Worthington, R. L., &amp; Moradi, B. (2011). Sexual identity as a universal process In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles (Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2), (pp.649-670). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and identity ==
Sexual identity has been described as a component of an individual's identity that reflects their sexual self-concept. The integration of the respective identity components (e.g. moral, religious, ethnic, occupational) into a greater overall identity is essential to the process of developing the multi-dimensional construct of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Luyckx, K., Schwartz, S. J., Goossens, L., Beyers, W., &amp; Missotten, L. (2011). Processes of personal identity formation and evaluation. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles(Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2) (pp.77-98). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual identity can change throughout an individual's life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Karen, About Whoever: The Social Imprint on Identity and Orientation, NY, 2013 {{ISBN|9780981450513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosario | first1 = M. | last2 = Schrimshaw | first2 = E. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. | last4 = Braun | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | doi=10.1080/00224490609552298| pmc = 3215279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concordance/discordance in SO"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael W.

In a 1990 study by the Social Organization of Sexuality, only 16% of women and 36% of men who reported some level of [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]] had a homosexual or bisexual identity.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States|last=Laumann|first=Edward O.|year=1994|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72AHO0rE2HoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=the+social+organization+of+sexuality+1990&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kHfFtQQH7j&amp;sig=ZS5sk4GqzcR4e8mLVIHTNPsHt-Y#PPA299,M1|pages=298–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual identity is more closely related to sexual behavior than sexual orientation is. The same survey found that 96% of women and 87% of men with a homosexual or bisexual identity had engaged in sexual activity with someone of the same sex, contrasted to 32% of women and 43% of men who had same-sex attractions. Upon reviewing the results, the organization commented: "Development of self-identification as homosexual or gay is a psychological and socially complex state, something which, in this society, is achieved only over time, often with considerable personal struggle and self-doubt, not to mention social discomfort."&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

===Unlabeled sexuality===
Unlabeled sexuality is when an individual chooses to not label their sexual identity. This identification could stem from one's uncertainty about their sexuality or their unwillingness to conform to a sexuality because they don't necessarily like labels, or they wish to feel free in their attractions instead of feeling forced into same, other, both, or pan attractions because of their sexual identity. Identifying as unlabeled could also be because of one's "unwillingness to accept their sexual minority status."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Lisa M | year = 2007 | title = A dynamical systems approach to the development and expression of female same-sex sexuality | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 142–161 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00034.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because being unlabeled is the purposeful decision of no sexual identity, it is different from bisexuality or any other sexual identity. Those who are unlabeled are more likely to view sexuality as less stable and more fluid and tend to focus more on the “person, not the gender.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brooks | first1 = Kelly D. | last2 = Quina | first2 = Kathryn | year = 2009 | title = Women's sexual identity patterns: Differences among lesbians, bisexuals, and unlabeled women | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 56 | issue = 8| pages = 1030–1045 | doi=10.1080/00918360903275443}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
It is reported that some women who identify as unlabeled did so because they are unable or uncertain about the types of relationships they will have in the future. As such, this divergence from sexual labels could provide for a person to be able to more fully realize their "true" sexuality because it frees them from the pressure of liking and being attracted to who their sexual identification dictates they should like.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Development==
{{See also|Coming out|Homosexuality and psychology}}

===General===
Most of the research on sexual orientation identity development focuses on the development of people who are attracted to the same sex. Many people who feel attracted to members of their own sex [[coming out|come out]] at some point in their lives. ''Coming out'' is described in three phases. The first phase is the phase of "knowing oneself," and the realization emerges that one is sexually and emotionally attracted to members of one's own sex. This is often described as an internal coming out and can occur in childhood or at puberty, but sometimes as late as age 40 or older. The second phase involves a decision to come out to others, e.g. family, friends, and/or colleagues, while the third phase involves living openly as an [[LGBT]] person.&lt;ref name="hrccontinuum"&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=2007-05-04 |url=http://dev.hrc.org/issues/3333.htm |periodical=[[Human Rights Campaign]] |title=The Coming Out Continuum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102101657/http://dev.hrc.org/issues/3333.htm |archivedate=2007-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States today, people often come out during high school or college age. At this age, they may not trust or ask for help from others, especially when their orientation is not accepted in society. Sometimes they do not inform their own families.

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), "the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity" and "[r]ather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality."&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."/&gt;

Some individuals with [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation|unwanted sexual attractions]] may choose to actively dis-identify with a sexual minority identity, which creates a different sexual orientation identity from their actual sexual orientation.  Sexual orientation identity, but not sexual orientation, can change through [[psychotherapy]], [[support group]]s, and life events.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;  A person who has homosexual feelings can self-identify in various ways.  An individual may come to accept an LGB identity, to develop a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] identity, to reject an LGB identity while choosing to identify as [[ex-gay]], or to refrain from specifying a sexual identity.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation], pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' article on reconciling faith and homosexuality, researcher Judith Glassgold, who chaired the task force, stated, "We're not trying to encourage people to become ''ex-gay''’" and "there has been little research on the long-term effects of rejecting a gay identity, but there is 'no clear evidence of harm' and 'some people seem to be content with that path'".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124950491516608883 A New Therapy on Faith and Sexual Identity: Psychological Association Revises Treatment Guidelines to Allow Counselors to Help Clients Reject Their Same-Sex Attractions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models of sexual identity development===
Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development (e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989). These historical models have taken a view of sexual identity formation as a sexual-minority process only.&lt;ref&gt;Savin-Williams, R. (2011) Identity development among sexual-minority youth. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles(Eds), Handbook of identity theory and research (Vols 1 and 2) (pp.671-689). New York, NY: Springer Science + Business Media&lt;/ref&gt; However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted.&lt;ref&gt;Savin-Williams, R. (2005). The new gay teenager. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; More contemporary models take the stance that it is a more universal process.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morgan | first1 = E. M. | year = 2012 | title = Not always a straight path: College students' narratives of heterosexual identity development | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 66 | issue = 1–2| pages = 79–93 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-0068-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current models for the development of sexual identity attempt to incorporate other models of identity development, such as Marcia’s ego-identity statuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthington | first1 = R.

The [[Cass identity model]], established by Vivienne Cass, outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: (1) identity confusion, (2) identity comparison, (3) identity tolerance, (4) identity acceptance, (5) identity pride, and (6) identity synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cass | first1 = V.

E. | last2 = Miller | first2 = B. A. | year = 1997 | title = Validation of an Inclusive Modelof Sexual Minority Identity Formation on a Sample of Gay Men | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 53–78 | doi=10.1300/j082v32n02_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models of sexual identity development do not use discrete, ordered stages, but instead conceptualize identity development as consisting of independent identity processes. For example, D'Augelli's model describes six unordered independent identity processes: (1) exiting heterosexual identity, (2) Developing personal LGB identity status, (3) Developing a LGB social identity, (4) Becoming a LGB offspring, (5) Developing a LGB intimacy status, and (6) Entering a LGB community.&lt;ref&gt;D'Augelli, A. R. (1994). Identity development and sexual orientation: Toward a model of lesbian, gay, and bisexual development.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unifying Model of Sexual Identity Development is currently the only model that incorporates heterosexual identity development within its statuses to include compulsory heterosexuality, active exploration, diffusion, deepening and commitment to status, and synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Dillion, F. R., Worthington, R. L., &amp; Moradi, B. (2011). Sexual identity as a universal process. In S. J. Schwartz, K. Luyckx, &amp; V. L. Vignoles (Eds.), Handbook of identity theory and research (pp. 649-670). New York: Springer. &lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary models view sexual identity formation as a universal process, rather than a sexual minority one, in that it is not only sexual minorities that undergo sexual identity development, but heterosexual populations as well.&lt;ref name="Dillon, F. R. 2011 pp.649-670" /&gt; More recent research has supported these theories, having demonstrated that heterosexual populations display all of Marcia’s statuses within the domain of sexual identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Worthington | first1 = R.

“''There is a corner in everyone’s mind dreaming of a simple and natural life. We hope (through the Simple Life Festival) we can aggregate diverse creative elements, and then helps this society to look for innovative industry power.''” – Landy Chang

According to Landy Chang, the Simple Life Festival is not only a music festival; instead, based on the core spirit of music festival, the Simple Life Festival further extends the notion, and covers wider topics. It is composed of multiple concepts, including some international trendy issues, the launch of creative market, [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifting]], the thought of doing something you like, and make something you like rewarding.&lt;ref name=taiwan /&gt;

The '''Sko''' or '''Skou languages''' are a small [[language family]] spoken by about 7000 people, mainly along the coast of [[Sandaun Province]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], with a few being inland from this area and at least one just across the border in the Indonesian province of [[Papua (Indonesia)|Papua]] (formerly known as Irian Jaya). Skou languages are unusual in New Guinea for being tonal. Vanimo, for example, has three tones, ''high, mid, low.''

Currently there are linguists working on most of these languages, writing grammars, compiling dictionaries, and assisting the speakers to develop vernacular materials for use in schools.

== Classification ==
Skou languages were first linked by G. Frederici in 1912. In 1941, K.H. Thomas expanded the family to its current extent.

The Sko family is not accepted by [[Søren Wichmann]] (2013), who splits it into two separate groups.&lt;ref name="Wichmann2013"&gt;Wichmann, Søren. 2013. [http://www.langlxmelanesia.com/wichmann313-386.pdf A classification of Papuan languages]. In: Hammarström, Harald and Wilco van den Heuvel (eds.), History, contact and classification of Papuan languages (Language and Linguistics in Melanesia, Special Issue 2012), 313-386. Port Moresby: Linguistic Society of Papua New Guinea.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sko (Laycock 1975)===
Laycock posited two branches, Vanimo and Krisa:  
*Vanimo branch – [[Skou language|Skou]], [[Sangke language|Sangke]] (Nyao), [[Wutung language|Wutung]], [[Vanimo language|Vanimo]] (Dumo)
*Krisa branch – [[I'saka language|I’saka]] (Krisa), [[Rawo language|Rawo]], [[Puari language|Puari]], [[Barupu language|Barupu]] (Warapu)

===Skou (Ross 2005)===
However, Krisa is poorly supported and [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] abandoned it,
*[[I'saka language|I’saka]] (Krisa)
*[[Barupu language|Barupu]] (Warapu)
*[[Puari language|Puari]]

===Macro-Skou linkage (Donohue 2002)===
[[Mark Donohue (linguist)|Mark Donohue]] proposed a subclassification based on [[Sprachbund|areal diffusion]] he called ''Macro-Skou''.

==Pronouns==
The pronouns Ross reconstructs for proto-Skou are,

:{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''I''' || ''*na'' || '''we''' || ''*ne''
|-
| '''thou''' || ''*me'' || '''you''' || ?
|-
| '''he''' || ''*ka'' || '''they (M)''' || ''*ke''
|-
| '''she''' || ''*bo'' || '''they (F)''' || ''*de''
|}

The Skou languages also have a [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], with a distinction between [[inclusive and exclusive we]], but the forms are not reconstructable for the proto-language.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Klan-in-gainesville.jpg|thumb|A Klan rally against Jews in the South in 1922. Rural areas became increasingly reactionary in the 1920s, partly in reaction 25355555555555to the liberalism of urban areas.]] --&gt;
'''The 1920s''' was the rise of a variety of '''social issues''' amidst a rapidly changing world. Conflicts arose concerning what was considered acceptable and respectable and what ought to be proscribed or made illegal. The conflict quickly coalesced into one largely between the liberal [[urban area]]s against the conservative rural areas.

==Prohibition of alcohol==
{{main|Prohibition in the United States}}
During the 1920s, the population in cities rapidly grew. Crime and [[political corruption]] became common and acceptable. Following a relatively conservative period following the First World War, a liberalism began to spread throughout urban areas during the years following 1925. Urban areas began to hold increasingly [[Liberalism|liberal]] views of sex, alcohol, drugs, and homosexuality. The view that women and minorities were entitled to equality became increasingly prevalent in urban areas, especially among the educated. For example, the actor [[William Haines]], who was regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the No. 1 male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover [[Jimmie Shields]]. Many people in rural areas became increasingly shocked at all the changes they saw occurring and many responded by becoming reactionary. The [[Volstead Act]], a law meant to uphold the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], was difficult to enforce due to lack of funding, short staffing and a disregard and disdain for a law that was deemed ridiculous. The fact that members of congress became drunk from toasts after passing the Eighteenth Amendment{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} reveals that even those who were supposed to be setting an example did not take the law seriously. This lack of respect for the law enforcement eventually spread to other areas of culture, and many conservative members of the [[United States Congress]] criticized this lack of order as stemming from the rampant use of alcohol.

==Disputes over human origin and the Scopes trial==
{{main|Scopes Trial}}
It made for great oratory between eminent rivals, and it put the debate over teaching evolution on front pages across the country. But one thing the Scopes "monkey trial" of 1925 did not do was settle the contentious issue of evolution in the schools, which continues to incite strong passions and court actions to this day. 

The trial was about challenging a newly passed Tennessee state law against teaching evolution or any other theory denying the biblical account of the creation of man. Broadly, the case reflected a collision of traditional views and values with more modern ones: It was a time of evangelism by figures such as [[Aimee Semple McPherson]] and [[Billy Sunday]] against forces, including jazz, sexual permissiveness, and racy Hollywood movies, which they thought were undermining the authority of the Bible and Christian morals in society.

[[John Scopes]], the 24-year-old defendant, taught in the public high school in Dayton, Tenn., and included evolution in his curriculum. He agreed to be the focus of a test case attacking the new law, and was arrested for teaching evolution and tried with the American Civil Liberties Union backing his defense. His lawyer was the legendary [[Clarence Darrow]], who, besides being a renowned defense attorney for labor and radical figures, was an avowed agnostic in religious matters. 

The state's attorney was [[William Jennings Bryan]], a Christian, pacifist, and former candidate for the U.S. presidency. He agreed to take the case because he believed that evolution theory led to dangerous social movements. And he believed the Bible should be interpreted literally. 

The weather was stiflingly hot and the rhetoric equally heated in this "trial of the century" attended by hundreds of reporters and others who crowded the Rhea County Courthouse in July 1925. Rather than the validity of the law under which Scopes was being charged, the authority of the Bible versus the soundness of Darwin's theory became the focus of the arguments. 

"Millions of guesses strung together," is how Bryan characterized evolutionary theory, adding that the theory made man "indistinguishable among the mammals." Darrow, in his attacks, tried to poke holes in the Genesis story according to modern thinking, calling them "fool ideas that no intelligent Christian on earth believes." 

The jury found Scopes guilty of violating the law and fined him. Bryan and the anti-evolutionists claimed victory, and the Tennessee law would stand for another 42 years. But Clarence Darrow and the ACLU had succeeded in publicizing scientific evidence for evolution, and the press reported that though Bryan had won the case, he had lost the argument. The verdict did have a chilling effect on teaching evolution in the classroom, however, and not until the 1960s did it reappear in schoolbooks.

==Isolationism, immigration, and communism==
America's [[isolationist]] philosophy after [[World War I]] gave rise to a [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] feeling across the nation. This was concentrated in rural areas and especially in the [[Southern United States]] and Indiana, where the [[Ku Klux Klan]] gained widespread support and sought to persecute immigrants and minorities in the 1920s. At the same time, [[communism]] was still a new philosophy in government, and much of the general American public held a hostile view toward it, especially after the [[1919 United States anarchist bombings]]. The beginning of the 1920s saw the height and fall of [[First Red Scare]] as exemplified in the [[Sacco and Vanzetti|trials of Sacco and Vanzetti]]. This opposition to communism was caused by the bloody terror of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

===Ku Klux Klan===
Rising nativism and illiberality also found expression after World War I in the reemergence and phenomenal growth of the Ku Klux Klan. Unlike the original Reconstruction-era Klan which was purely a southern phenomenon intent on holding the freed slave in a position of inferiority, the modern Klan formed active chapters in every region of the country and temporarily gained both respectability and political power.

The time was ripe for a secret and seemingly all-powerful organization committed to reasserting traditional American values by force and intimidation if necessary. Such was the effect of World War I and the paranoia of the Red Scare. To millions of Americans in the postwar era, the country seemed beset with problems and on the verge of ruin. "The white, native-born Protestant American, as a member of the religious and racial majority, was usually incapable of doubting his native institutions. The blame for the maladies of his world must rest elsewhere. And so he looked to alien influences - Roman Catholics who supposedly challenged Protestant hegemony and the separation of church and state. Catholic, Orthodox, and Jewish immigrants crowding onto American shores, Negroes seeking more equitable treatment, American Jews who kept living costs up while wages went down, and numerous other elements of frustration before which he felt helpless. Then the Klan entered his community and offered him a way to fight back." Now was the time to fight back, to reassert traditional values, or lose forever those qualities which had made America great.

It's not surprising that the Klan's strongest supporters were residents of the rural and isolated countryside and city dwellers who had just recently arrived from the farm who were shocked by the lifestyles they witnessed in the big city. The drastic changes of the preceding half century had largely passed them by and lessened their influence in the country they felt they had once dominated. Now resentment of city and city people and nativism came together in the form of the Ku Klux Klan.

Using violence, intimidation, and organized political activity, the Klan lashed out at those groups which seemingly were defiling America with strange customs, strange religions, and strange morals. The Klan supported the deportations crusade of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer at the height of the Red Scare. The Klan pressured Congress to limit immigration into the country. Such limitations would also stem the flow of Roman Catholics and Jews into what had always been primarily a Protestant country.

Perhaps their strongest efforts, at least in Texas and other southwestern states, was to impose middle-class Protestant morality on all members of society no matter where they lived. According to Charles C. Alexander in his study The Klan in the Southwest : "There was also in the Klan a definite strain of moral bigotry. Especially in the Southwest this zeal found expression in direct, often violent, attempts to force conformity. Hence the southwestern Klansmanís conception of reform encompassed efforts to preserve premarital chastity, marital fidelity, and respect for parental authority; to compel obedience to state and national prohibition laws; to fight the postwar crime wave; and to rid state and local governments of dishonest politicians." Individuals in Texas thus were threatened, beaten, or tarred-and-feathered for practicing the "new morality," cheating on their spouses, beating their spouses or children, looking at women in a lewd manner, imbibing alcohol, etc.

The Klan began to participate in politics in order to cleanse this arena of corruption and to legislate their idea of moral behavior. Because it attracted, at least in the beginning, "respectable" members of society, the Klan quickly gained significant political power at the state and local levels of government. In Texas for instance the Klan was able to elect a number of local officials in Austin, Houston, and Dallas. Historians feel that members of the Klan probably constituted a majority of the Texas legislature between 1922 and 1924. The Texas Klan even had one of its own, Earl B. Mayfield of Austin, elected to the U. S. Senate at the height of its power. The Klan grew so powerful on the national scene by 1924 that opponents were unable to convince the Democratic party's convention that year to censure the Klan for its intolerance and violent methods.

It was widely recognized at the time that the Klan's most powerful chapter in the nation was that in Indiana.&lt;ref name=vpappab /&gt;  In 1923, the membership of the [[Indiana Klan]] exploded when local recruiter [[D. C. Stephenson|David Curtiss Stephenson]] became the organization's [[Grand Wizard]].  By late 1923, Stephenson led the Indiana Klan in breaking away from the national organization and forming a rival group.&lt;ref name = nicfh/&gt;  The Indiana Klan stressed more social issues than racism, as it promised to uphold moral standards, help enforce Prohibition, and end political corruption. The Klan also publicly attacked adulterers, gamblers, and undisciplined youths.&lt;ref name = madisom292&gt;{{cite book|author=Madison, James H|title=The Indiana Way|year=1990|pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson gained the support of many ministers and church congregations for these appeals to populist issues, and the Klan grew rapidly in Indiana.&lt;ref name=nicfh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main7.html|title=Indiana History Chapter Seven|publisher=Northern Indiana Center for History|accessdate=2013-11-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411163028/http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main7.html|archivedate=2008-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the height of its power the Klan had over 250,000 members, which was over 30% of state's white male population. The highest concentration was around the central part of the state.&lt;ref name = nicfh /&gt; Though it counted a high number of members statewide, its importance peaked in the 1924 election of [[Edward L. Jackson]] for governor.&lt;ref name=vpappab /&gt;  Switching from the Democrat to the more popular Republican Party, Stephenson sought to cement control over Indiana's political scene.  During the 1924 November elections in Indiana, Jackson and several other elected Republican officials in the state were handpicked by Stephenson after they signed pledges affirming support for him.  Following the election, Stephenson was then regarded as "the law in Indiana."&lt;ref name="Lutholtz"&gt;{{cite book

Yet just when the Klan seemed to wield such power and influence, it was actually on the verge of collapse. In the mid-twenties the Klan was beset by a series of internal struggles and scandals that resulted in political losses.  The fall of Klan's power in Indiana would have a devastating impact on the organization's influence nationwide.  

The Indiana Klan's influence was diminished in 1925 after Stephenson kidnapped and raped local educator [[Madge Oberholtzer]], who died soon afterwards in large part due to a [[staph infection]] she obtained as a result of the injuries Stephenson inflicted on her during this ordeal.  Though it was acknowledged that Oberholtzer's decision to attempt suicide by swallowing [[mercuric chloride]] tablets contributed to her kidney failure, it was determined through an [[autopsy]] that the injuries Stephenson inflicted on her were also sufficient enough to kill her because the staph infection which resulted from them had reached both her lungs and kidneys.&lt;ref name="Linder" /&gt;  The autopsy also determined that Oberholtzer also might have been saved if Stephenson had not refused to take her to a hospital while he took her hostage;&lt;ref name="Linder"&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/stephenson/atatevstprosecution.html Daniel O. Linder, "D.C. Stephenson"], Testimony, ''Famous Trials'', hosted at University of Missouri Law School, Kansas City&lt;/ref&gt; in her dying declaration, Oberholtzer claimed that she recanted her decision to allow herself to die and asked Stephenson to take her to a hospital,&lt;ref name=made5232 /&gt; but he refused to do so because she would not agree to marry him.&lt;ref name=made5232&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/stephenson/dyingdeclaration.html The Dying Declaration Of Madge Oberholtzer: The Key Evidence In The 1925 Trial Of D. C. Stephenson, From ''My Indiana'' by Irving Liebowitz (1964) (pp.195-203)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In November of 1925, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and was given a life sentence.  In addition to the rape and murder, evidence released during his trial gravely weakened the Indiana Klan's propaganda when it was revealed that Stephenson, who had often defended [[Cult of Domesticity|Protestant womanhood]] and Prohibition in public,&lt;ref name="Lutholtz" /&gt; was in private a womanizer and an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="Lutholtz" /&gt;  With the Stephenson affair damaging the Klan's image as upholders of law and morality, their influence on American society was severely crippled by 1926.&lt;ref name=vpappab&gt;[http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm Ku Klux Klan in Indiana] Accessed November 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1927, Stephenson would retaliate to Jackson's refusal to pardon him by having his aids release the documented pledges which proved that several Indiana politicians, including Jackson, had accepted bribes and other illegal favors from the Indiana Klan in exchange for their support.  The state filed indictments against Governor Jackson; George V. "Cap" Coffin, chairman of the Marion County Republican Party; and attorney Robert I. Marsh, charging them with conspiring to bribe former Governor [[Warren McCray]]. The mayor of Indianapolis, [[John L. Duvall|John Duvall]], was convicted and sentenced to jail for 30 days (and barred from political service for four years). Some Republican commissioners of [[Marion County, Indiana|Marion County]] resigned from their posts after being charged with accepting bribes from the Klan and Stephenson.&lt;ref name="Center"&gt;[http://centerforhistory.org/learn-history/indiana-history/the-golden-era-of-indiana-1900-1941 "Indiana and the Ku Klux Klan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507171643/http://centerforhistory.org/learn-history/indiana-history/the-golden-era-of-indiana-1900-1941 |date=2015-05-07 }}, Center for History&lt;/ref&gt;
     
The nativism of the postwar era peaked and began to recede with the passage of the National Origins Act and with it the appeal of the Klan lost its luster. Furthermore, the "respectable" members of the Klan, shocked by its violent tendencies, began to drop out and by the end of the decade the Klan was once again viewed by most Americans as part of the extremist lunatic fringe.

===Immigration and the National Origins Act===

Support for immigration restrictions, which began at the turn of the century and had built steadily for twenty years, led to congressional passage of the [[National Origins Act]]. This legislation severely restricted the total number of foreigners who would be allowed to enter the United States legally in any given year. It also instituted a quota system intentionally designed to hit Asia and eastern and southern Europe the hardest. The impact was to shut the doors of the country to Asians altogether and slow the flood of Italians, Poles, and Russians to a bare trickle of what it had been.

Immigration curtailment was unquestionably part of the rural counterattack of the 1920s. The countryside was the most Anglo-Saxon, the most Protestant, the most traditional area of the nation and the region that felt most threatened by continued immigration. The fact that rural residents were most supportive of immigration restrictions is clearly borne out by the fact that not a single congressman from south of the Mason-Dixon line or west of the Mississippi River voted against the National Origins Act. Only in the urban Northeast was there opposition. With the number of immigrants thus limited, many felt perhaps America could be saved.

===1928 US Presidential Election and revival of extreme nativism===

The urban-rural confrontation of the 1920s seems neatly symbolized by the presidential election of 1928 and the defection of many traditional Democrats to the Republican candidate because of their shock at the nomination of Al Smith by their own party.

The Republican Party was riding the crest of national popularity in 1928, basking in the glow of the economic boom which Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge had seemingly engineered. Herbert Hoover's election became inevitable when many lifelong Democrats in the South and Southwest rejected their party's nominee. Rural Democrats simply could vote for Smith because he seemed to represent everything that threatened their America.  He was a practicing Roman Catholic in a decade of virulent anti-Catholicism. He opposed national prohibition and openly flaunted the law during the election campaign. Furthermore, he was suspect because of his links to the urban political machine - Tammany Hall of New York City.

In contrast, Hoover, while a member of the Republican Party, which had long been discredited in the South and Southwest because of the Reconstruction experience, was a native of Iowa, one of the most rural states in the union. He was a Protestant who openly and forcefully supported Prohibition. Unlike Smith, he was untainted by any association with machine politics. Rather, his character and reputation seemed sterling. He had saved Europe from starvation in the aftermath of World War I by leading a volunteer relief campaign, he was a self-made millionaire, and, as secretary of commerce from 1921 to 1928, had helped produce the current economic boom. J. Frank Norris, a leading fundamentalist pastor in Texas, campaigned across the state on behalf of Hoover saying that the only real issue in the campaign was Smith's Catholicism. Norris and others painted dire pictures of the future should Smith be victorious. The pope would actually be running the country and very quickly separation of church and state and freedom of religion would be relics of America's distant past.

The strength of the urban-rural confrontation in the election can be seen in the fact that Texas - rural, Protestant, and solidly Democratic in its historic party affiliation - ended up in the Republican party column for the first time in its history. Nor was it alone. Hoover also carried the old Confederate states of Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia. Such was the strength of rural disaffection with an increasingly urban, industrial, and culturally diverse America

'''Street people''' are people who live a public life on the streets of a city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/street+people Dictionary definition of "street people"] - ''[[Dictionary.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/street-people Definition of "street people"], ''[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Street people are frequently [[homelessness|homeless]], sometimes [[mental illness|mentally ill]], and often have a transient lifestyle. Certain neighborhoods, especially those in neighborhoods near universities, such as [[Telegraph Avenue]] in [[Berkeley, California]], [[The Ave]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], or the [[Pearl Street Mall]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]] often host street people. They may also frequent bohemian commercial districts such as [[Colfax Avenue]] in Denver. Individual street people may be familiar figures to the entire community.

==Well-known street people==
Examples of well-known street people are [[José María López Lledín]] who lived a public life on the streets of [[Havana]] during the 1950s, [[Mr. Butch]] of Boston, [[Leslie Cochran]] of Austin, [[Juan (street protester)|Juan]] of Seattle, or [[Moondog|Louis Thomas Hardin]] ("Moondog") who was a street musician, inventor, and later homeless person in the 1940s through to 1970s in [[New York City]].

==Character of street people==
Contemporary street people in the United States include [[hippy|hippies]], some of whom may be [[beggar]]s who often ask for spare change on the streets;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-malanga_24edi.ART0.State.Edition1.4dac4e2.html "The Plague of Professional Panhandling"] opinion by Steven Malanga in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' August 26, 2008, accessed September 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; bag ladies who often have all their possessions in a shopping cart which accompanies them. They also may include [[Street performance|street performers]], and people with chronic [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].

The term street people is used somewhat loosely and may be used simply to refer to eccentric people who live in Bohemian neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/us/politics/07candidates.html "Republican Runs Street People on Green Ticket"] article by Marc Lacey in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 6, 2010, accessed September 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the defining characteristic is time spent in the street, wandering the streets for a substantial portion of their day or night. This street presence combined with their distinctive disheveled appearance, result in some individuals becoming familiar to residents of the neighborhood they frequent.

==Code of the Road==
[[Image:Leslie Cochran.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Leslie Cochran]] on South Congress in [[Austin, Texas]]]]
Street people are said to have an unwritten code or set of rules that govern interaction between street people. Referred to as the "Code of the Road" it emerged from the Hobo camps of the depression era to encompass urban street people.  The "Code of the Road" was detailed in Xploited Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://xploitedproductions.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=96&amp;Itemid=43 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718132303/http://xploitedproductions.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=96&amp;Itemid=43 |title=Code of the Road |author=The Boxman |publisher=[[Xploited magazine]] |date=April 2009 |archivedate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a social problem==
Poor economic and social conditions can result in accumulations of the homeless, often called street people, in certain neighborhoods. This may result in revival of [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws, or similar laws which may prohibit lying or sitting on the street. Results and attitudes vary, especially as liberal communities attempt to grapple with large numbers of the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/us/03bcjames.html "Santa Cruz Reduces Street Crime, but Its Model Is Not Cheap"] article by Scott James in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 2, 2010, accessed September 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sweden-bashing''' is when Sweden is subjected to unfair criticism by non-Swedes that is either motivated by a desire for increased standing in their own home countries, or intended to influence Swedish government policies or social institutions.

At a 2016 discussion forum titled "Transnationalizing Swedish–American Relations",&lt;ref name="JTAS_2016_Blanck_Hjorthén"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dag Blanck and Adam Hjorthén |title=Transnationalizing Swedish–American Relations: An Introduction to the Special Forum |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4nf10473 |journal= ''Journal of Transnational American Studies'' |quote=Finally, the circulation of discourses and ideas of Swedish and American modernity is a theme explored in this Forum through the article by Carl Marklund, dealing specifically with the phenomenon of "Sweden-bashing" during the years of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. Marklund argues that critical American discussions about the Swedish welfare state in the 1970s and 1980s were incorporated into the discourse of Swedish conservatives. This is one example were notions about American and Swedish modernities have resonated with each other during the twentieth and twenty-first century.32 Both Swedish conservatives and liberals used the United States as a source of inspiration as well as a warning, seeking not primarily to understand the United States but to promote or prevent social change in Sweden. Sweden has, in fact, occupied a similar position in the United States, as both a model and a dangerous example of a welfare state |volume=7 Number=1 |date=2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Carl Marklund, a postdoctoral researcher in Eastern European studies at [[Södertörn University]], argued that Swedish conservatives had been influenced by American criticism of the Swedish welfare state in the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref name="JTAS_2016_Blanck_Hjorthén" /&gt;{{rp|7}}  Marklund said that Swedes had "used the United States as a source of inspiration as well as a warning, seeking not primarily to understand the United States but to promote or prevent social change in Sweden."&lt;ref name="JTAS_2016_Blanck_Hjorthén" /&gt;{{rp|7}}  Furthermore, Marklund argued, Sweden was viewed similarly by Americans, "as both a model and a dangerous example of a welfare state."  Marklund referred to this as "Sweden-bashing".&lt;ref name="JTAS_2016_Blanck_Hjorthén" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The term has also been used by journalists and by Swedish government officials{{citation needed|reason=Have they really? No examples given.|date=February 2018}} discussing Swedish foreign relations, as well as by other commentators.

==In academia==

In proposing the use of the term "Sweden-bashing", historian Dr. Carl Marklund posited the phenomenon as follows:&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing"&gt;{{cite journal |title=From "False" Neutrality to "True" Socialism: US "Sweden-bashing" during the Later Palme Years, 1973–1986 |journal=''Journal of Transnational American Studies'' |volume=7 |number=1 |author=Carl Marklund |date=2016 |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0dt8v3mq}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he often cited exemplarity of Sweden among progressive countries worldwide—due to its Third World solidarity abroad as well as its social policies at home—also made it the subject of an admittedly marginal, but vocal genre of diagnosis and criticism, first from conservatives, later from liberals, that can be termed "Sweden-bashing." Key themes in this genre include allegedly totalitarian tendencies in the Swedish welfare state as well as a supposedly anti-Western bias in Swedish Cold War neutrality&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sweden-bashing was used in the 1960s U.S. presidential election between Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy.&lt;ref name=DNMarklund&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kulturdebatt/darfor-beskrivs-sverige-som-en-dystopi/ |work=Dagens Nyheter |title=Därför beskrivs Sverige som en dystopi |date=February 21, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960 while addressing the Republican National Committee, President Eisenhower described Sweden as a cautionary tale about socialism and government intrusion into the affairs of individuals.&lt;ref name=DNMarklund /&gt;  He described Sweden as engaging in an "experiment of almost complete paternalism", and cited what he said were allegedly high rates of alcoholism, suicide, and divorce, as well as a "lack of ambition".&lt;ref name=DNMarklund /&gt;

Although American criticisms of Swedish welfare policies were initially{{when|date=January 2018}} received with skepticism among Swedish conservatives, they gradually became accepted as part of a "shift to the right" in Sweden's self-image and perception abroad.&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  He wrote that this "underscor[ed] how originally distant actors, marginal discourses and random events may be amplified through transnational circulation of ideas and images", and noted that some regarded the shift to the right as evidence of a counter-strategy by business interests to oppose the [[Far-left politics|radical left]] of the 1970s, or as a "purposive elite strategy of political communication."&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

A renewal of negative American publicity about Sweden followed the Social Democrats' return to power in 1982, focusing on alleged problems of rising racism and xenophobia focused on immigrants.&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|7}}  He also noted that Gösta Grassman, a foreign affairs press officer with the Swedish government, had referred to criticism of the Swedish welfare state as "the 1984 reports" due to the portrayal of Sweden as a totalitarian state by such critics.&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|8}}  Grassman said that in this new strain of criticism, the previous portrayal of Sweden's welfare state as a ploy to mask what was allegedly a covert form of capitalism had evolved into a similar allegation that the welfare state masked what was allegedly a form of socialism.&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|8}}  The point of the reference to ''[[Nineteen Eighty-four]]'', the dystopian novel by [[George Orwell]], according to Grassman, was "to shock by reimagining a democratic, egalitarian, and prosperous Western society as 'totalitarian.'"&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|8}}

Marklund wrote that in the tumult of debate, "it became increasingly difficult to distinguish the foreign reporting on Sweden and the Swedish debate on Sweden from the Swedish discussion of the image of Sweden abroad."&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|8}}  While he acknowledged that the criticisms "can be viewed as examples of legitimate international journalism or political debate in Sweden itself", Marklund argued that they were often blown out of proportion in late 1983, both in foreign press coverage of Sweden and in the Swedish reception of that coverage.&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|9}}  He noted that in the Swedish foreign ministry, believing that foreign criticism was amplifying or even distorting the significance of some issues in the political discourse, summoned 150 correspondents of the foreign press corps to receive what ''The New York Times'' described as "a lecture on their supposedly less-than-objective articles about Sweden."&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|9}}  He wrote that the strategy backfired, as the journalists felt curtailed.&lt;ref name="Marklund_2016_Sweden_bashing" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

As Sweden's international visibility have increased there have developed a market for Sweden-bashing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/swedens-public-diplomacy-must-adapt-its-new-global-role USC Center on Public Diplomacy: Sweden’s Public Diplomacy Must Adapt to Its New Global Role]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ch.lu.se/nyheter/visa/article/james-pamment-swedens-public-diplomacy-must-adap/ Campus Helsingborg: James Pamment: Sweden's public diplomacy must adapt to its new global role]&lt;/ref&gt;{{According to whom|date=February 2018}}

==Discussion among politicians and government officials==
Conservatives may engage in Sweden bashing as Sweden managed to have both economic efficiency and equality, something they feel is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nd88AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA317&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;dq=%22Sweden-bashing%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cOpiNM5DJx&amp;sig=q0S63P72D7Pu3IEzgND1H4YXeC4&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie87ODpf3YAhXlCsAKHcw7CAY4ChDoAQg0MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sweden-bashing%22&amp;f=false Debating Democracy: A Reader in American Politics, p. 317]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2016 report to the Swedish Foreign Ministry, the Swedish Embassy in London indicated that the widely distributed "right-wing UK tabloid newspaper", the Daily Mail, said to be known for its "vigorous anti-immigration stance", was running a campaign against Sweden's refugee policy.&lt;ref name="thelocal_2016_daily_mail_migrant_campaign"&gt;{{citation |title=Daily Mail running migrant campaign against Sweden |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20160227/daily-mail-runs-campaign-against-sweden |publisher=''The Local'' |date=February 27, 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report said that Sweden was "being used as a deterrent and an argument against allowing more refugees into the UK" and was being characterised by the ''Daily Mail'' as "naive and an example of the negative consequences of a liberal migration policy."&lt;ref name="thelocal_2016_daily_mail_migrant_campaign" /&gt;

In mid-January, 2017, Czechoslovakia-born Swedish author [[Katerina Janouch]] made claims in an interview with a Czech television station which the Swedish government labelled as a "bizarre declaration".&lt;ref name="lemonde_Suède_bashing_2017"&gt;{{citation |title=Stockholm dit stop au "Suède bashing"|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/m-moyen-format/article/2017/01/30/stockholm-dit-stop-au-suede-bashing_5071314_4497271.html#bsrYXKMQU8F8uZWh.99 |author=Anne-Françoise Hivert |location=Malmö, Sweden|date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Janouch said that "Swedes were learning to use guns to defend themselves as a result of increased immigration,"&lt;ref name="thelocal_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20170118/theres-great-respect-for-the-swedish-model |title='There's great respect for the Swedish model': Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven has said that the world still has great respect for the Swedish model, despite increasing negative media coverage abroad |publisher=''The Local'' |date=January 18, 2017|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Swedish seniors do not have enough money for food, cancer patients were dying because of the long waiting lines caused by tens of thousands newly arrived refugees—77% of whom are men pretending to be minors—women are being raped, and 150,000 left Sweden for the United States and the UK.&lt;ref name="lemonde_Suède_bashing_2017" /&gt;  Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven spoke of "increasing negative media coverage abroad"&lt;ref name="thelocal_2017"/&gt; at [[Davos]]&lt;ref name="lemonde_Suède_bashing_2017" /&gt; and in interviews with the local Swedish media with reassurances that there was still "great respect for the Swedish model'.&lt;ref name="thelocal_2017" /&gt;

After [[Donald Trump]] claimed at a 2017 rally that Sweden had serious crime and social problems related to immigrants, Olle Lönnaeus published an article in ''Sydsvenskan'' accusing Trump of spreading [[fake news]], and said that "[a]s Trump wants to close the US border to Muslim immigration, it is in his interest to spread the idea that Europe’s most refugee friendly country is on the road to perdition."&lt;ref name="sydsvenskan_trump_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2017-02-21/trump-loves-to-hate-malmo-this-is-why |title=Trump loves to hate Malmö - this is why |author=Olle Lönnaeus |publisher=''Sydsvenskan''|date=February 21, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Jimmie Åkesson and Mattias Karlsson of the far-right,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first =William M. |last=Downs |title = Political Extremism in Democracies: Combating Intolerance |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year =2012 |pages=33, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-immigrant [[Sweden Democrats]] party published an op-ed in ''The Wall Street Journal'' arguing that Trump had understated Sweden's problems, not exaggerated them, and that riots, attacks on emergency service personnel, gang violence, gun violence, and anti-Semitism were booming as a result of immigration.&lt;ref name="WSJ_Åkesson_Karlsson_Trump_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-is-right-swedens-embrace-of-refugees-isnt-working-1487807010 |publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' |title=Trump Is Right: Sweden's Embrace of Refugees Isn't Working: The country has accepted 275,000 asylum-seekers, many without passports—leading to riots and crime |authors=Jimmie Åkesson and Mattias Karlsson |date=February 22, 2017 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reacting to the editorial, Sweden's justice and migration minister [[Morgan Johansson]] accused Åkesson and Karlsson of lying about the immigrant crime situation, saying "They're painting a picture of a country characterized by violence, when it's the exact opposite."&lt;ref name="thelocal_WSJ_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20170223/minister-morgan-johansson-blasts-sweden-democrats-wall-street-journal-op-ed-theyre-lying-about-sweden |title=Minister blasts Sweden Democrats' Wall Street Journal op-ed: 'They're lying about Sweden' |publisher=''The Local'' |author=Emma Löfgren|date=February 22, 2017|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion among journalists and other commentators==

In a 2002 opinion article in [[New York Times Magazine]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] economist [[Paul Krugman]] used the term "Sweden-bashing" in arguing that American conservatives attacked Swedish welfare policies as part of an effort to spread a misguided view that redistribution of wealth to poorer citizens promotes economic inefficiency.&lt;ref name="Krugman"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/20/magazine/for-richer.html |title=For Richer |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=October 20, 2002 |website=www.nytimes.com |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krugman argued that one influential conservative economic critique of Swedish policy was misguided because it focused on per-capita income, which Krugman argued was not a good measure of quality of life in Sweden, and because high wealth inequality in the United States skewed the available data.&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;

In an editorial titled ''Political Strategy Behind Sweden-Bashing'' in the daily newspaper [[Sydsvenskan]], Joakim Palmkvist and Olle Lonnaeus identified possible political motives that might explain some Israeli criticism of Swedish press freedoms, such as a desire by the critics to gain domestic support, to pressure Sweden as chairman of the European Union in advance of coming peace talks on the Palestinian conflict, or even to prompt a press crackdown by the Swedish government.&lt;ref name="Political Strategy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2009-08-24/political-strategy-behind-sweden-bashing|title=Political strategy behind Sweden-bashing: There are two possible reasons for Israeli political leaders to attack Sweden |last1=Palmkvist |first1= Joakim|last2=Lonnaeus|first2= Olle|date=August 24, 2009 |website=www.sydsvenskan.se |publisher=''Sydsvenskan'' |access-date=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Pertti Joenniemi, senior research fellow at the [[Danish Institute for International Studies]] (DIIS) in [[Copenhagen]], wrote&lt;ref name="Joenniemi_Denmark_Sweden_2013"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KhXtCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT217&amp;lpg=PT217&amp;dq=Disputed+Democratic+Identities:+the+Case+of+Danish-Swedish+Discord%22+by+Pertti+Joenniemi#v=onepage&amp;q=Disputed%20Democratic%20Identities%3A%20the%20Case%20of%20Danish-Swedish%20Discord%22%20by%20Pertti%20Joenniemi&amp;f=false |series=''Decentring the West: The Idea of Democracy and the Struggle for Hegemony''  |editor=Viatcheslav Morozov |location=New York and London |title=Chapter 10: Disputed Democratic Identities: the Case of Danish-Swedish Discord |author=Pertti Joenniemi |pages=199–201|date=2013 |accessdate=February 23, 2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781409449706}}&lt;/ref&gt; that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sweden has been categorized as a 'Nordic banana republic' (an expression used by the leader of the DPP) and seen as a 'Prozac nation' (doped into tranquility). It has been positioned in the 'Balkans' and labelled 'East European' (an expression employed by a DPP member of the European Parliament). It has further been talked about as being 'Asian' as well as 'totalitarian'. At large the discourse turned, at least for a while, quite aggravated and Orientalist."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to government agency [[Swedish Institute]], while much of the foreign media reporting on how Sweden was to handle so many migrants at one time was accurate, some people with a political agenda turned to Sweden-bashing.&lt;ref name="Sveriges_2017_bashing" /&gt; Sweden-bashing peaked again in 2016 as foreign media criticized Sweden's open immigration policies as swelling numbers of displaced peoples, refugee, and asylum seekers—many of whom had Sweden as their destination—travelled to Sweden via other European countries.&lt;ref name="Sveriges_2017_bashing"&gt;{{citation |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6624307 |publisher=Sveriges Radio |title='Sweden bashing' peaked during 2015 migration wave |quote=Some would like Sweden to be an element in their story of a failed state. |location=Sweden |date=February 17, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017 Sweden became the symbol of everything that many Republicans believe is wrong with Europe: feminism, environmentalism, and openness to refugees.&lt;ref name="euobserver_Sweden_fights_back_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=https://euobserver.com/nordic/136959 |publisher=euobserver |title=Sweden fights back as foreign leaders make up bad news |author=Aleksandra Eriksson| location=Brussels |date=February 20, 2017 |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Trump]] has been criticized for engaging in the Sweden-bashing by the hard-core American right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salon.com/2017/06/02/sweden-is-the-gateway-to-the-alt-right-anti-immigrant-agenda-in-europe_partner/ Salon: Sweden is the gateway to the alt-right anti-immigrant agenda in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; The former ambassador [[Zvi Mazel]] performed some Sweden bashing in the Israeli press where he came with several absurd statements.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;[http://www.trelleborgsallehanda.se/frontpage/sweden-condemned-in-israeli-press/ Trelleborgs Allehanda: Sweden condemned in Israeli press]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lego Movie''''' is a [[media franchise]] based on [[Lego]] [[construction toy]]s. It began with the [[The Lego Movie|2014 film of the same name]], which was directed and written by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]]. The success of the film led it to receiving two licensed video games, a [[The Lego Movie: 4D - A New Adventure|theme park film ride attraction]], two spin-off films and an [[Unikitty!|animated series]] among other pieces of media. A [[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part|sequel]] and a third spin-off film are both scheduled for release in 2019.

The majority of the films have been a success commercially and critically.

'''Thiotimoline''' is a fictitious chemical compound conceived by American [[biochemist]] and [[science fiction]] author [[Isaac Asimov]]. It was first described in a [[spoof scientific paper]] titled "The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline" in 1948. The major peculiarity of the chemical is its "endochronicity": it starts dissolving before it makes contact with water.

Asimov went on to write three additional short stories, each describing different properties or uses of thiotimoline.

==Chemical properties==

In Asimov's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule, there is at least one [[carbon atom]] such that, while two of the carbon's four [[chemical bonds]] lie in normal [[spacetime|space and time]], one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past.  Thiotimoline is derived from the bark of the (fictitious) shrub ''Rosacea karlsbadensis rugo'', and the thiotimoline molecule includes at least fourteen [[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] groups, two [[amine|amino]] groups, and one [[sulfonic acid]] group, and possibly one [[nitro compound]] group as well.  The nature of the [[hydrocarbon]] nucleus is unknown, although it seems in part to be an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]].

==Background==
In 1947 Asimov was engaged in doctoral research in chemistry and, as part of his experimental procedure, he needed to dissolve [[catechol]] in water.  As he observed the crystals dissolve as soon as they hit the water's surface, it occurred to him that if catechol were any more soluble, then it would dissolve ''before'' it encountered the water.&lt;ref name="earlyyears488_501"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/488/mode/2up |title=The early Asimov; or, Eleven years of trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1972 |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=488-501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time Asimov had been writing professionally for nine years and would soon write a doctoral dissertation. He feared that the experience of writing readable prose for publication might have impaired his ability to write the turgid prose typical of academic discourse, and decided to practice with a spoof article (including charts, graphs, tables, and citations of fake articles in nonexistent journals) describing experiments on a compound, thiotimoline, that was so soluble that it dissolved in water up to 1.12 seconds before the water was added.{{r|earlyyears488_501}}

Asimov wrote the article on 8 June 1947, but was uncertain as to whether the resulting work of fiction was publishable. [[John W. Campbell]], the editor of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' accepted it for publication on 10 June, agreeing to Asimov's request that it appear under a pseudonym in deference to Asimov's concern that he might alienate potential doctoral examiners at [[Columbia University]] if he were revealed as the author.{{r|earlyyears488_501}}

Some months later Asimov was alarmed to see the piece appear in the March 1948 issue of ''Astounding'' under his own name, and copies of the issue circulated at the Columbia chemistry department. Asimov believed that Campbell had done so out of greater wisdom. His examiners told him that they accepted his dissertation by asking a final question about thiotimoline, resulting in him having to be led from the room for laughing hysterically with relief. The article made Asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction, as chemists shared copies of the article. He heard that many children went to the [[New York Public Library]] trying to find the nonexistent journals.{{r|earlyyears488_501}}

=="The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline"==
In 1952, Asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called "The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline".  Like the first, it included charts, graphs, tables, and citations of fake articles from fake journals (along with one real citation: Asimov's own earlier spoof article from ''Astounding'', which was listed tongue-in-cheek as the ''Journal of Astounding Science Fiction'').  This second article described the use of thiotimoline to establish a quantitative classification of "certain mental disorders".  It also expounds a putative rationale for thiotimoline's behaviour: namely that the [[chemical bond]]s in the compound's structural formula are so starved of space that some are forced into the time dimension.  According to the second article, thiotimoline's time of solubility varies depending on the determination of the person adding the water.  It also claims that one effect is that when people with [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] add the water, some parts of the thiotimoline dissolve before others, due to some of the individual's personalities being more determined than others.  "The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline" appeared in the December 1953 issue of ''Astounding''.

The first two thiotimoline "articles" appeared together in Asimov's first collection of science essays, ''[[Only a Trillion]]'' (1957), under the joint title "The Marvellous Properties of Thiotimoline". Asimov also included the original article in his 1972 collection ''[[The Early Asimov]]''. The first article also appeared in ''Fifty Years of the Best Science Fiction from Analog '' (Davis Publications, 1982).

=="Thiotimoline and the Space Age"==
Asimov wrote a third thiotimoline article on 14 November 1959 called "Thiotimoline and the Space Age".  Instead of a fake scientific paper, this third article took the form of an address by Asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the American Chronochemical Society, a nonexistent scientific society.  In his address, Asimov "describes" his first experiments with thiotimoline in July 1947, and timing the compound's dissolution with the original endochronometer, "the same instrument now at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]".  Asimov laments the skepticism with which chronochemistry has been greeted in America, noting with sorrow that his address has only attracted fifteen attendees.  He then contrasts the thriving state of chronochemistry in the [[Soviet Union]], with the research town of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchevsk]], nicknamed "Tiotimolingrad", established in the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]].

According to Asimov, two Scottish researchers have developed a "telechronic battery", which uses a series of 77,000 interconnected endochronometers to allow a final sample of thiotimoline to dissolve up to a day before water is added to an initial sample.  Asimov says there is "strong, if indirect, evidence that the Soviet Union possesses even more sophisticated devices and is turning them out in commercial quantities".  He believes that the Soviets are using telechronic batteries to determine ahead of time whether [[timeline of artificial satellites and space probes|satellite launches]] will be successful.

Finally, Asimov describes attempts to create a "[[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg failure]]", to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it.  In every case where the thiotimoline dissolved, some accident occurred that caused some water to be added to it at the proper time.  Several attempts to create a Heisenberg failure in the mid-1950s coincided with a [[Hurricane Carol|series]] [[Hurricane Edna|of]] [[Hurricane Diane|hurricanes]] striking New England in such a manner as to suggest that nature would find a way to add water whatever man decided, if man were to be resolute in not adding water.  Asimov speculated that [[Noah]]'s [[Flood myth|flood]] may have been brought about by thiotimoline experiments among the ancient [[Sumer|Sumerians]]. He then concludes with some speculation about thiotimoline's potential applications as a [[weapon of mass destruction]] by deliberately using it to artificially induce hurricanes.

"Thiotimoline and the Space Age" appeared in the October 1960 issue of ''Astounding'', which was then in the final stages of changing its name to ''Analog''.  The article was reprinted in full in ''[[Opus 100]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Asimov Chronicles: Fifty Years of Isaac Asimov]]'' (1989).

=="Thiotimoline to the Stars"==
Asimov's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled "Thiotimoline to the Stars", which he wrote for [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''[[Astounding: The John W. Campbell Memorial Anthology|Astounding]]'' (1973). In it, Admiral Vernon, Commandant of the Astronautic Academy, gives a speech to the graduating "Class of '22". Vernon's speech explains that thiotimoline was first mentioned in 1948 by a semi-mythical scientist named Azimuth or Asymptote, but that serious study of the compound didn't begin until the 21st century scientist Almirante worked out the theory of [[steric hindrance|hypersteric hindrance]]. Later scientists worked out ways to form endochronic molecules into [[polymer]]s, allowing large structures such as [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s to be built out of endochronic materials. One effect of endochronicity is that if one fails to add water to an object that has reacted to water, the object will travel into the future in search of water to interact with.

An individual with sufficient inborn talent, Vernon explains, can perfectly balance a starship's endochronicity with relativistic [[time dilation]], so that a ship traveling at relativistic speeds can age at the same rate as the rest of the universe, allowing it to return to its starting point within months, rather than centuries, of its departure. Vernon emphasizes that starship pilots are expected to match endochronicity with relativity exactly: a sixty-second difference between the two is regarded as barely acceptable, and a 120-second difference is considered grounds for dismissal.  Vernon also emphasizes that endochronic molecules are unstable, and must be renewed before each trip, so that an endochronic ship that finds itself lost might not have sufficient endochronicity to return to its proper time. A ship that finds itself in the future might be able to re-endochronize itself if the technology still exists; a ship that finds itself in the past will be marooned there.

Finally, Vernon reveals that the auditorium where he is giving his speech is actually an endochronic starship, and that during his speech, they have all flown to the outskirts of the [[Solar System]].  The graduates felt no acceleration because canceling out time dilation also caused the canceling out of inertia. When Vernon concludes his speech, the graduates will be landing in the [[United Nations]] Port at [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], where they will be spending the weekend.

After they land, Vernon receives an awful shock and passes out when his pilot informs him that the ship is surrounded by Indians. Vernon wrongly assumed the pilot meant [[Red Indians]], and thought that they had landed centuries in the past. But the pilot only meant that they had landed at the correct time but near [[Calcutta]], India.

Asimov included "Thiotimoline to the Stars" in his 1975 collection ''[[Buy Jupiter and Other Stories]]''.

==Other references to thiotimoline==
In Glen Bever's story "And Silently Vanish Away" a chemist with the unique ability to use psychokinetic catalysis to speed up difficult reactions is shocked by a lab explosion and the mixture he was working on gets changed. Under analysis the structure never appears to be the same twice and when the substance is injected into lab rats they start to silently and suddenly vanish. It is found that one part of the compound is a molecule which spreads out into four dimensions. The four-dimensional molecule is thiotimoline. The story appeared in the November 1971 issue of ''Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact''.

Topi H. Barr's story "Antithiotimoline" deals with a chemist who accidentally creates a thiotimoline-like compound which extrudes only into the past, enabling the scientist to create images of past events. The narrator complains that thiotimoline is extremely difficult to obtain, and suspects that the CIA or other agencies are controlling the supply for their own reasons. The story appeared in the December 1977 issue of ''Analog''.

[[Spider Robinson]]'s story "Mirror mirror, off the wall", published in ''Time Travelers Strictly Cash'' in 1981, also references thiotimoline.

In [[Robert Silverberg]]'s 1989 story "The Asenion Solution", thiotimoline is used to send excess quantities of [[The Gods Themselves|plutonium-186]] to the end of time, where they will fall over the brink into [[anti-time]] and lead to the [[Big Bang]].  "The Asenion Solution" appeared in the Asimov [[festschrift]] ''[[Foundation's Friends]]''.

The November/December 2001 and March/April 2002 issues of the [[IEEE Design &amp; Test of Computers]] included spoof articles on the use of thiotimoline for debugging computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MDT.2001.10043 The Last Byte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MDT.2002.10009 Yet Another Thiotimoline Application&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game [[We Happy Few]], a mysterious liquid called "motilene" acts as the primary source of electrical power in the setting, and is pumped throughout the city in pipes in lieu of a traditional electrical grid, or alternatively placed into special jars to act as portable batteries. A research note can be found in one location which makes reference to "thiomotilene crystals" and their "endochronic properties", which in turn strongly suggests motilene's name be derived from thiotimoline.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Depictions of '''tobacco smoking in art''' date back at least to the pre-Columbian [[Maya civilization]], where smoking had religious significance. The motif occurred frequently in painting of the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]], in which people of lower social class were often shown smoking [[pipe smoking|pipes]]. In European art of the 18th and 19th centuries, the social location of people – largely men – shown as smoking tended to vary, but the stigma attached to women who adopted the habit was reflected in some artworks. Art of the 20th century often used the [[cigar]] as a [[status symbol]], and parodied images from [[tobacco advertising]], especially of women. Developing health concerns around tobacco smoking also influenced its artistic representation. Recently tobacco has impacted on art in a quite different way, with the conversion of many [[Cigarette machine|cigarette vending machines]] into [[Art-o-mat]] outlets, selling miniature artworks the shape and size of a [[cigarette]] packet.

==Maya art==
[[File:Smoking Monkey.jpg|thumb|alt=Maya vase.| Vase of the Smoking Monkey. A ceramic artifact from the Maya lowlands created in the late Classic period. A spider monkey possibly representing a deity smokes a cigarette.]]

[[Maya civilization|Mayas]] were perhaps the first people to represent tobacco smoking in art. Mayas smoked heavily, and they believed that their gods did too.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Tobacco and Religion." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 27-36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious ritual]]s often involved [[tobacco]]: offerings were given to certain gods and tobacco smoke warded off evil deities.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Many tribes viewed tobacco as a supernatural, magical substance (perhaps because of its strong physiological and sometimes [[hallucinogen]]ic effects).&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Because of tobacco's significance, it is not surprising that Mayas produced artistic representations of smoking.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; The artwork mostly portrays religious rituals and myths involving [[god]]s or [[lord]]s because ordinary people and actions were considered too unimportant and unworthy for time consuming art pieces.&lt;ref name= b&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "The Classification of Archaeological Material." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 111-13. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous depictions of smoking can be found from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic epoch]] (3rd through 8th centuries). Though what substance deities and people are smoking cannot be said for certain, scholars generally conclude that the smoked substance is tobacco after studying archaeological materials.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; The representations are occasionally confusing as the Mayas portrayed [[smoke]] and [[cigar]]s in varied ways.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; Smoke can be illustrated with black dots, black and red dots (with red indicating sparks), converging scrolls, or converging coils.&lt;ref name= b/&gt;&lt;ref name= a&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Scenes Almost Certainly Representing the Act of Smoking." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 114-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Converging scrolls also sometimes represent [[foliage]], speech, fire, smells, and other things.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; Cigars are usually funnel-shaped (or torch-shaped) and vary greatly in size.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; [[Cigarette]]s (small, slender cigars in this case) resemble modern cigarettes (narrow, long rectangles) or elongated ovals.&lt;ref name= b/&gt;

===Codices===
Mayas created [[Codex|codices]] chronicling their history and culture, and they constructed pages from ''copo'' - plant fiber on bark or deerskin with lime.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; Though [[Missionary|missionaries]] destroyed many codices, one of the remaining codices (the Codex Madrid ) contains depictions of smoking.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; Gods smoke cigars on pages 79b, 86b, 87, and 88.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; The Codex Madrid also contains [[glyph]]s thought to mean “smoking.” &lt;ref&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Tobacco and the Mayas." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 11-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone monuments and frescos===
The Sanctuary of the [[Temple of the Cross]] at [[Palenque]] (a Maya city in current [[Mexico]]) houses a monument called “El Fumador” (Spanish for “The Smoker”). The stone door panel features an elderly deity blowing smoke from a large cigar. Because of the cigar's funnel shape (which compares to cigars currently used by rural [[South America]]n tribes) and the outward flaring smoke, scholars believe the monument depicts a religious ritual similar to those performed by other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; No other stone monuments depicting smoking are known, but there may have been others.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

The only known Maya painting to depict smoking is found at [[Tulum]] (a Maya city on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in current Mexico). The Temple of the Diving God houses the [[fresco]], and the painting features monsters (perhaps birds) smoking large cigars.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

===Ceramics and other artwork===
Mayans also portrayed smoking on [[ceramic]] objects including boxes, plates, vases, and bowls.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; The ceramics were carved or painted multiple colors (typically black, white, and red). Important ceramics featuring smoking include the Vase of the Dancing Lord, the Reynolds vase (at the [[Museum of the American Indian]]), Plate of the Smoking God, the Woman, and the Monkey (at the National Museum of Guatemala), Vase of the Smoking Monkey, and Bowl of the Eleven Deities, Five of Them Smoking.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

The Vase of the Danse Macâbre depicts a smoking [[skeleton]] carrying a jar or pouch and another skeleton and two [[jaguar]]s also holding pouches or jars. The carried objects are believed to hold tobacco or tobacco mixed with other substances.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; They display the sign of darkness, so tobacco may have been associated with rituals relating to death.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

Though the majority of depictions show gods and lords, some artifacts portray the everyday. For example, the Plate of the Smoking Husband depicts a man smoking a cigarette and his wife rolling dough inside their home.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

Other artifacts depicting smoking have also been found including a shell carving, which is now housed at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

==Dutch art during the Golden Age==
[[File:Smell.jpg|thumb|alt=Smell.|''Smell'' (1637) by Jan Miense Molenaar. This oil painting exemplifies tobacco's usage in comedic Dutch works.]]

The ordinary person in the 17th century [[Dutch Republic]] viewed tobacco as a novelty and associated smoking with [[social deviance]]. A divide existed between the medicinal use of tobacco, which was widely accepted, and recreational use, which was seen as low class and inappropriate for more respected citizens including church and government leaders.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Johann Neander's ''Tabacologia'', written in 1622, demonstrates the prevalent belief that tobacco held curative and preventative properties for a wide range of diseases.&lt;ref name= ivan&gt;Gaskell, Ivan. "Tobacco, Social Deviance, and Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century." Looking at Seventeenth-Century Dutch Art: Realism Reconsidered. Ed. Wayne E. Franits. New York: Cambridge UP, 1997. 68-77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, smoking's prevalence among [[sailor]]s, [[soldier]]s, and the [[Rural poverty|rural poor]] along with its [[Substance intoxication|intoxicating]] effects led to an association with the lowliest people.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Thus, smoking became a tool for artists to designate someone's rank in society, and painters including [[Adriaen Brouwer]], the Ostade brothers, and [[David Teniers II]] employed smoking in their portrayals of the low classes. Smoking also became a comedic prop for painters especially in festival and burlesque paintings.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; [[Ivan Gaskell]] (Curator of Paintings, Sculpture, and Decorative Arts in the [[Harvard Art Museums]]) argues that "If we trace the imagery of topsy-turvydom in Dutch art we find tobacco to be a key element in scenes of comic disorder".&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

[[Jan Steen]], perhaps the most famous comic painter during the 17th century, often included [[pipe smoking]], which took on sexual connotations in his paintings of [[brothel]]s and [[tavern]]s. For example, a man packing tobacco into a pipe along with pipes leaning against [[chamberpot]]s symbolized sexual [[flirtation]]s and [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]].&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; These were often used for a comic effect, especially in illustrations of robbers stealing from intoxicated patrons of brothels and taverns.

Moreover, women smoking in Steen's paintings subverted [[cultural norms]] and added an additional comic effect as men almost exclusively smoked during that time period. Short pipes, especially, implied the most debased women and the ugliest [[prostitute]]s.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Moreover, pipes, especially a pair of crossed pipes, symbolized rhetoricians—guilds of actors and poets that held festivals emphasizing pleasure.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Several of Steen's paintings were created to illustrate [[proverb]]s including: "as the old sing, so the young pipe (soo de ouden songen, soo pijpen de jongen)" &lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;—meaning the youth will pick up poor habits like smoking by imitating adults. Finally, Steen often included negative implications of smoking even when he painted smoking for a comic effect by depicting smokers next to a [[beggar]]’s crutches or whipping branches to reiterate to the viewer that smoking will lead to “punishment, poverty, and beggary".&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

Because of economic interests in importing tobacco from the [[New World]] to [[Europe]] and even starting domestic tobacco farming, [[Amsterdam]] merchants worked to reduce smoking stigmatization.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; By the late 17th century, smoking long-stemmed and polished pipes became acceptable for more respectable males while the lower classes smoked from cruder and shorter pipes. [[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] also gained popularity, and depictions of smoking and tobacco in paintings and drawings became more representative of the mundane and everyday than comically absurd situations and social outcasts.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

==18th century to 21st century==
[[File:Munch SelfBurningCigarette.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Munch Self-Portrait.|Edvard Munch ''Self-Portrait with Burning Cigarette'']]

Following the [[Golden Age]], tobacco usage in artwork lost prominence. The decline of smoking representations is most likely due to the influence of [[Rococo]] age elegance, which made snuff the preferred choice.&lt;ref name= tempel&gt;Tempel, Benno. "Symbol and File: Smoking in Art since the Seventeenth Century." ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mM5bYb_uVcwC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=Tempel,+Benno.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vx9OUeenEMHs0QGcqoGQAg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tempel%2C%20Benno.&amp;f=false Smoke: a Global History of Smoking]''. Ed. Sander L. Gilman and Xun Zhou. London: Reaktion, 2004. 206-217. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Though snuff usage increased, snuff portrayals never became as common as those of cigars, cigarettes, and pipes in European paintings. Against norms of the time period, French artist [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], who was inspired by Golden Age artwork, occasionally included pipes in his pieces.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; One such painting is a [[still life]] entitled ''Smoking Kit with Drinking Pot.'' The pipe in this piece lacks symbolic meaning.

In the late 18th century and early 19th century, smoking took on new and varied symbolic meanings. During this time period, men were the primary smokers, and smoking was not an acceptable habit for women who were expected to be ideal mothers or mistresses.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; In the [[Romantic period]], people believed smoking held a close association with [[intellectualism]]. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Stéphane Mallarmé]]'' exemplifies art from this time. The painting shows an upper class man with a lit cigar in his hand and that same hand resting on top of an open book. His eyes are look into the distance seeming to be deep in thought. Benno Tempel (curator of the [[Kunsthal]], [[Rotterdam]]) argues that smoking in this painting symbolizes a modern lifestyle even though smoking had been around for centuries.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé (Manet).jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé.| Édouard Manet's ''Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé'']]

The [[Impressionism|impressionists]] painted scenes of everyday life that included cigars, cigarettes, or pipes, but they did not put symbolic importance in them.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; The [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionists]] returned symbolic meaning to smoking instruments. One notable painting was done by [[Vincent van Gogh]] called ''Skull with a Burning Cigarette''. Although this painting seems to be an anti-smoking warning, it was actually representative of the [[black humor]] and [[practical joke]]s popular during that time.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Edvard Munch]] launched this trend with his painting ''Self-Portrait''. It shows the artist with a cigarette against a dark background and an eerie look across his face. Munch used smoke to symbolize psychological problems.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

By the 20th century, cigarettes, cigars, and pipes all had their own specific meanings and connotations that developed across history. By playing off these meanings, artists conveyed a fuller understanding of an artwork to the viewer. For example, the cigar came to represent a social [[status symbol]], and artists included cigars in paintings to show emphasize social classes and power differences. [[Heinrich Maria Davringhausen]]’s ''The Black Marketeer'' depicts a boss with a boxful of cigars and a lit one at the edge of his desk. This demonstrates the unequal social relationship between the employer and the employee.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Pablo Picasso]] also used the pipe in his piece called ''The Poet''. This painting relies on the inseparable connection between literature and the pipe to provide the viewer with a better understanding of the painting.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

===Pop art===
With the rise of [[Pop art|Pop Art]], art pieces became more cynical. Pop art culture targeted clichés that evolved from the [[tobacco industry]]. [[Mel Ramos]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]] are two notable artists who poked fun at the industry.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Following the stigmatization of tobacco in America, pop art has shed a negative light on smoking. [[Claes Oldenburg]]’s sculpture ''Giant Fagends'' depicts how [[Tobacco addiction|cigarette addiction]] exemplifies the American's wasteful [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Duane Hanson]]’s ''Supermarket Shopper'' shows a miserable middle-aged woman to represent how present day Americans view smokers: ruled by the addiction and lack will-power.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

===Modern art===

Various forms of [[modern art]] have also included cigarettes. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]] displayed Jac Leiner's ''Lung'' in March 2009. This piece features 1200 [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] packs neatly folded and strung together.

It demonstrates the addictive power of cigarettes because the artist cannot overcome the addiction to finish something that he presumably loves to do: paint.&lt;ref name= polke&gt;Polke, Sigmar.

==Smoking, women, and art==
During the 17th century, Dutch paintings with women and pipes symbolized misfortune. Women in these paintings are rarely the ones in possession of the pipe, and the Dutch artists meant to send a moral message that foolish behaviors like smoking will lead people into [[wikt:hardship|hardship]]s.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

Artwork in the 18th century included pipes to convey an [[exoticism]] and [[eroticism]] even though depictions of smoking went out of fashion in the Western World.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; An example is [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]]’s ''A French Woman in Turkish Costume in a Harmam Instructing her Servant'', which features a woman with a long pipe standing in a position of authority.

In the 19th century, artists, [[Caricature|caricaturists]], fine [[Pottery|potters]], and even [[novelist]]s depicted women smoking. Though portrayals of women smokers became more common, they were shown in a negative light because smoking was still not acceptable for women.&lt;ref name= mitchell&gt;Mitchell, Dolores. "Women and Nineteenth- Century Images of Smoking." Smoke: a Global History of Smoking. Ed. Sander L. Gilman and Xun Zhou. London: Reaktion, 2004. 206-217. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, artwork that incorporated smoking was kept in rooms reserved only for men including smoking saloons, [[billiard room]]s, and libraries.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt; Impressionists employed pipes to distinguish males from females and emphasize their different [[social status]]es. In [[Georges Seurat]]’s ''A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte'', the male in the white suit holds a cigar, and even in this snapshot of everyday life, there is an implicit [[hierarchy]] between him and the woman who is with him.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt;

Prostitutes were the first women in this time period to be depicted with pipes, cigars, or cigarettes as seen in artwork from Vincent van Gogh and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. The women used smoke and make-up (as seen from their very white faces) to attract male clients.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt; Some artists wanted to change social norms and de-stigmatize smoking for women. [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]] was one notable woman who studied illustrating for many years in [[Paris]] and then discovered [[photography]]. Her piece titled ''Self- Portrait'' depicts her holding a cigarette in one hand and a [[beer stein]] in the other. She is not dressed provocatively like most females who were associated with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and cigarettes during this time. Instead, she realistically captures aspects of her life and complicates the society's understanding of [[middle class]] women.&lt;ref name= mitchell/&gt; Jane Atché commercially published color [[lithograph]]s of women smokers without any sexual connotations. Her prints offered sophisticated woman who enjoyed cigarettes.&lt;ref name= mitchell/&gt;
[[File:Auguste Levêque -Suzanne02.jpg|thumb|Painting by Auguste Levêque. ''Portrait of Suzanne'']]

Resulting from new representations of women smokers from artists like Frances Benjamin Johnston and Jane Atché, smoking became more socially acceptable for women. Eventually, smoking grew into a phenomenon for women. Tobacco products took on varied meanings in the 20th century. During the [[Roaring Twenties]], women smoked cigarettes to appear chic and sophisticated.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Yet, paintings with female prostitutes holding with cigars took on a negative meaning because women from low classes were not meant to have objects connected with the upper class. These pieces showed women as seductresses who tricked men into giving them wealth and power.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

Smoking began losing its attractiveness as the 20th century progressed, and art followed this trend. Artists mocked the cigarette industry for using highly [[Sexualization|sexualized]] images of women in [[advertising]].&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Mel Ramos created artwork depicting naked women on cigars. Tom Wesselmann exploited the clichés of sex and cigarettes by painting an exposed breast behind an ashtray.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Present day artists acknowledge smoking as a health risk, but some want to fight modern, [[taboo]] perceptions of tobacco instead of demonizing smoking. [[Sarah Lucas]]’s photo titled "Fighting Fire with Fire" shows herself with a cigarette in the corner of her mouth. This one picture sums up the evolution of the relationship between woman, smoking, and art. According to Benno Tempel, this photo shows that “at times when society tries to create taboos, art can break through them”.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

==Art-o-mat==
[[Art-o-mat]] machines sell pocket-size art pieces for $5.00 throughout the world. The apparatuses are converted [[Cigarette machine|cigarette vending machines]], which are now banned in the [[United States]]. Currently, 90 machines exist with one in [[Quebec]], one in [[Vienna]], and the rest throughout the United States. Private businesses, cultural centers, art museums, universities, and other locations possess Art-o-mats, and they receive $1.50 for each piece sold. Some renowned sites include New York City's [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Los Angeles]].

Over three hundred artists from ten different countries have created original artwork for the machines. $2.50 goes to the artist whenever someone buys their work. The pieces come in white containers the size of a cigarette pack (roughly two inches by three inches) and wrapped in [[cellophane]]. They range from miniature sculptures to jewelry to tiny paintings. Almost every media imaginable has been used including wood, glass, watercolors on canvas, clay, Styrofoam, magnets, stained-glass, and bronze.&lt;ref name= newsweek/&gt; Contributing sculptor Jules Vital said, “This project gives artists the opportunity to get their work into major venues, and it's cheap for buyers.".&lt;ref name= newsweek&gt;Rankine, Jerome. "Must Have: Pull Lever, Get Culture." Newsweek. Newsweek, Inc., 22 September 2003. Web. 28 April 2010. &lt;http://www.newsweek.com/id/60175&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clark Whittington]] built the first machine for his 1997 art show at a café in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. The original machine sold Whittington's black &amp; white photographs for $1.00, and Cynthia Giles, the owner of the café, requested that the machine remain after the show ended. Shortly afterward, Whittington formed Artists in Cellophane (A.I.C.) with other artists from the Winston-Salem area to build more art vending machines and to create pieces for them.

Today, A.I.C. sponsors the Art-o-mat machines with the goal of increasing art consumption by packaging art in an easily accessible manner. Whittington hopes collectors will form a habit of art buying and become interested in buying larger pieces from local artists.&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove-Mather, Bootie. "Art-O-Mat Aims For Collectors." CBS News. CBS Interactive Inc., 25 February 2003. Web. 28 April 2010. &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/25/national/main541998.shtml&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; He collects the remaining $1.00 from each purchase to maintain the machines. A.I.C. seeks to unite art with consumerism and commerce and looks to expand to new locations and recruit new artists.&lt;ref&gt;"The Story behind Art-o-mat." Art-o-mat. Artists in Cellophane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7133">{{For|the mythological people|Tuatha Dé Danann}}

'''''Túath''''' (plural ''túatha'') is the [[Old Irish]] term for the basic political and jurisdictional unit of Gaelic Ireland. ''Túath'' can refer to both a geographical territory as well the people who lived in that territory.&lt;ref name=RIA&gt;{{Cite book| first = | last = The Royal Irish Academy | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1990 | month = | title = Dictionary of the Irish Language | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher = Greystone Press | location = Antrim, N.Ireland | isbn =0-901714-29-1 | url=http://www.dil.ie/42241| page = 612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Social structure==

In ancient Irish terms, a household was reckoned at about 30 people per dwelling. A ''[[trícha cét]]'' ("thirty hundreds"), was an area comprising 100 dwellings or, roughly, 3,000 people. A ''túath'' consisted of a number of allied ''trícha céta'', and therefore referred to no fewer than 6,000 people. Probably a more accurate number for a ''túath'' would be no fewer than 9,000 people.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{Cite book| first = Myles | last = Dillon | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1994 | month = | title = Early Irish Literature | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher = Four Courts Press | location = Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland | isbn = 1-85182-177-5 | url = | nopp = true| page = xiv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''túath'' was a self contained unit, with its own executive, assembly, courts system and defence force. ''Túatha'' were grouped together into [[confederations]] for mutual defence. There was a hierarchy of ''túatha'' statuses, depending on geographical position and connection to the ruling dynasties of the region.&lt;ref name=NKPI&gt;{{cite web|last=Ó Corráin|first=Donnchadh||title=Nationality and Kingship in Pre-Norman Ireland|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/nation_kingship.html|work=CELT|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization of ''túatha'' is covered to a great extent within the [[Brehon law]]s, Irish laws written down in the 7th century, also known as the ''Fénechas''.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Nerys t.|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|title= Cattle Lords and Clansmen: The Social Structure of Early Ireland|date=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Pess|location=|isbn= 978-0268161460|page=|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=JGIFDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT228&amp;lpg=PT228&amp;dq=gaelic+tuath+tricha+cet+organisation+medieval&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=334SDlStcJ&amp;sig=n-paEMSfvKL08slwCaviZ2nvQ3E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjphsyq78_dAhUiglwKHShTArc4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gaelic%20tuath%20tricha%20cet%20organisation%20medieval&amp;f=false|accessdate=|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old Irish political system was altered during and after the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Elizabethan conquest]], being gradually replaced by a system of [[barony (Ireland)|baronies]] and [[counties]] under the new colonial system. Due to a loss of knowledge, there has been some confusion regarding old territorial units in Ireland, mainly between ''trícha céta'' and ''túatha'', which in some cases seem to be overlapping units, and in others, different measurements altogether.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''trícha céta'' were primarily for reckoning military units; specifically, the number of fighting forces a particular population could rally.&lt;ref name=Dillon/&gt; Some scholars equate the ''túath'' with the modern parish, whereas others equate it with the barony. This partly depends on how the territory was first incorporated into the county system. in cases where [[surrender and regrant]] was the method, the match between the old ''túath'' and the modern barony is reasonably equivalent. Whereas in cases like [[Ulster]], which involved large scale colonisation and confiscation of land, the shape of the original divisions is not always clear or recoverable.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
	 
''Túath'' in Old Irish means both "the people", "country, territory", and "territory, petty kingdom, the political and jurisdictional unit of ancient Ireland".&lt;ref name=RIA/&gt; The word possibly derives from [[Proto-Celtic]] *''toutā'' ("tribe, tribal homeland"; cognate roots may be found in the Gaulish god name [[Toutatis]]), which is perhaps from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''tewtéh₂'' ("tribesman, tribal citizen").{{cn|date=September 2018}} In [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] it is spelled ''tuath'', without the [[Acute accent|fada]] accent, and is usually used to refer to "rural districts" or "the country" (as in "the countryside"); however the historical meaning is still understood and employed, as well.&lt;ref name=ODonaill&gt;{{cite web|last=Ó Dónaill|first=Niall||title=Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla|url=https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/Tuath

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23531">[[Video gaming]] in [[Indonesia]] is a growing sector, holding the 16th largest market in the world and about half the [[Southeast Asia]]n market in 2017. Over 40 million people in the country are active gamers, with [[mobile gaming]] being the dominant sector in terms of revenue. The development of video games in the country began with imported consoles and arcade centers, prior to developments of online gameplay in [[PC game]]s and increasing prevalence of the [[internet café]]s. Mobile games began gaining importance as smartphones were introduced.

The Indonesian video game industry contributed about USD 1.1 billion to the [[Economy of Indonesia|national economy]], despite only earning a small fraction of the local gaming revenues. [[Video game piracy]] is also prevalent across the country, making up the majority of installed games.
==History==
Development of video games in Indonesia began in the mid-1980s through imported video game consoles such as the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Arcade centers also appeared, including major chains [[Timezone (video arcades)|Timezone]] which started in Indonesia at 1995 and Amazone which was established in 2001. According to a designer from [[Namco Bandai]], 1,000 of the 1,500 arcade machines distributed in [[Asia Pacific]] operated in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="iwatani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iwatani|first1=Toru|title=Video Games Around the World|date=2015|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262527163|pages=249–263|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pZb5CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219134542/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pZb5CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263|archivedate=2018-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later on, by the late 1990s and early 2000s [[PC game]]s such as ''[[StarCraft (video game)|StarCraft]]'' and ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'' caught on alongside their online features.&lt;ref name="iwatani"/&gt; While most of the games were imported, there were several locally developed games such as ''Nusantara Online'' (a MMO which featured precolonial [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Jeremy A.|last2=Nadeau|first2=Kathleen M.|title=Pop Culture in Asia and Oceania|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781440839917|page=335|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ot2uDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA335|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219134542/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ot2uDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA335|archivedate=2018-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also several localized games, such as ''[[Audition Online]]'' which was localized as ''AyoDance'' when it was launched for Indonesia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iskandar|first1=Eddy Dwinanto|title=Megaxus Bidik Pasar Game Mobile dengan Audition Ayodance Mobile|url=https://swa.co.id/swa/listed-articles/megaxus-bidik-pasar-game-online-dengan-audition-ayodance-mobilee|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=SWA|date=18 January 2018|language=id|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219134542/https://swa.co.id/swa/listed-articles/megaxus-bidik-pasar-game-online-dengan-audition-ayodance-mobilee|archivedate=19 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to a major boom in [[internet café]]s (known locally as ''warnet'', a portmanteau of ''[[warung]] internet''), which had 2,500 locations across the country in 2002 and 5,000 by 2007.&lt;ref name="iwatani"/&gt;

Due to the size of the Indonesian market, several games were localized specifically for the nation's audience. Examples include South Korean online [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Special Force (2004 video game)|Special Force]]'' which featured levels in [[Jakarta]] with the [[Monumen Nasional]] as a background and ''[[Harvest Moon (video game)|Harvest Moon]]''.&lt;ref name="iwatani"/&gt; Matahari Studios, which closed down in 2010, is often credited as being the first local video game developer in the country, although it more often took outsourcing work from major studios instead of developing its own games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sukarno|first1=Puput Ady|title=Sejarah Perkembangan Industri Game di Indonesia|url=http://industri.bisnis.com/read/20140303/105/207515/sejarah-perkembangan-industri-game-di-indonesia|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=Bisnis Indonesia|date=3 March 2014|language=id|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804112938/http://industri.bisnis.com/read/20140303/105/207515/sejarah-perkembangan-industri-game-di-indonesia|archivedate=4 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Matt|title=Matahari Studios closes doors|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/matahari-studios-closes-doors|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=GamesIndustry|date=4 February 2010|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613060307/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/matahari-studios-closes-doors|archivedate=13 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, growth in the number of [[smartphone]] users have fueled growth in mobile online games, aided by the lower development costs associated for local developers. This change also allowed extension of the playerbase beyond typical youth gamers to a more casual demographic, with the game platforms including [[Facebook]] in addition to the application stores of [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref name="iwatani"/&gt;

==Rating==

* '''7+''' (for ages 7 and up)
* '''13+''' (for ages 13 and up)

==Piracy==
Video game piracy is common in Indonesia, with [[The Software Alliance|BSA]] estimating 84% of all software installed in Indonesia throughout 2013 being unlicensed.&lt;ref name="iwatani"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seizing Opportunity Through License Compliance - BSA Global Software Survey|url=http://globalstudy.bsa.org/2016/downloads/studies/BSA_GSS_US.pdf#page=5|publisher=The Software Alliance|accessdate=16 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712235716/http://globalstudy.bsa.org/2016/downloads/studies/BSA_GSS_US.pdf#page=5|archivedate=12 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many stores in Indonesia offer illegally downloaded video games burned into DVDs for significantly less than its normal retail price, with Wii games being sold for IDR 20,000 (USD 2) or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=In Indonesia, Pirated Games for Two Bucks a Pop|url=https://kotaku.com/5883625/in-indonesia-pirated-games-for-two-bucks-a-pop/|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=9 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702084207/http://kotaku.com/5883625/in-indonesia-pirated-games-for-two-bucks-a-pop/|archivedate=2 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of [[Copyright law of Indonesia|Indonesian copyright laws]], video game companies are required to bring the lawsuits against the illegal merchants to court, the cost of which would often outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Janottama|first1=Bramaseta|title=Video Game Pirates Are Behind Indonesia's Thriving Gamer Culture|url=https://www.vice.com/en_id/article/4xe5dm/video-game-pirates-are-behind-indonesias-thriving-gamer-culture|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=Vice|date=31 March 2017|language=en-id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When online-only consoles such as the [[PlayStation 3]] was released in Indonesia, authorized dealers initially controlled the distribution. However, once piracy took up these distributors withdrew from the country, causing a scarcity of authentic video game copies and raising the prices–resulting in further increase in piracy.&lt;ref name="iwatani"/&gt;

The '''Warring states crystal glass''' (戰國水晶杯 / 水晶杯) is an artifact found in a [[Warring States period]] [[mausoleum]] tomb, which dates just before 221 [[BCE]] [[Qin dynasty]], [[China]].  The glass however, looks no different from a modern drinking glass.

==Dimensions==
The glass measures 15.4 [[centimetre|cm]] tall.  It has a round opening and is transparent.&lt;ref name="Wenbao"&gt;Wenbao.net. "[http://www.wenbao.net/html/whyichan/64th/16shuijingbei.htm Chinese cultural heritage protection official web list]." ''水晶杯.'' Retrieved on 2010-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  The glass is made from a natural high quality crystal.  It looks no different from a modern drinking glass.  The artifact is one of 64 that can never leave China soil.&lt;ref name="Wenbao" /&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1990 the glass was unearthed in [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang province]]. Specifically in Bansaan town (半山鎮), Shitang village (石塘村) in a Warring states period mausoleum.&lt;ref name="Wenbao" /&gt;  The item was found underground about one [[metre]] deep.&lt;ref&gt;Xihuyoulan.com.

'''"Who Stole the Cookie from the Cookie Jar?"''' or the '''Cookie Jar Song''' is a sing-along [[game]] of [[children's music]]. The song is an [[infinite-loop motif]], where each [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] directly feeds into the next. The game begins with the children sitting or standing, arranged in an inward-facing [[circle]]. 

The song usually begins with the group leader asking who stole a [[cookie]] from an imaginary (or sometimes real) [[cookie jar]], followed by the name of one of the children in the circle.  The child questions the "accusation," answered by an affirmation from the "accuser," followed by continued denial from the "accused."  The accuser asks who stole the cookie, followed by the accused's saying the name of another child in the circle. The call-and-answer is potentially [[infinite recursion|infinitely recursive]], limited only by the number of participants or the amount of time the participants wish to spend on it.

Sometimes, a clapping or snapping beat is used by the children in the circle.  Sometimes, the other children in the group sing along with the "accuser" after the "accused" has been identified.  Some variations on the theme include the use by teachers of the song as a lesson in keeping with a [[beat (music)|beat]] and [[improvisation (music)|improvisation]].  As with many children's songs, there can be many variations on the execution of the performance.  

The song's lyrics are usually:
:'''Accuser:''' Who stole/took the cookie/cookies from the cookie jar?
:(''name of a child in the circle'') stole/took the cookie/cookies from the cookie jar.
:'''Accused:''' Who, me?
:'''Accuser/Group:''' Yes, you!/Yeah, you!
:'''Accused:''' Not I!/Couldn't be!/Not me!/Wasn't me!
:'''Accuser/Group:''' Then who?
 

This is followed by the "accused" saying the name of someone else, as "(''name of a child in the circle'') stole the cookie from the cookie jar," and the subsequent back-and-forth lines are repeated.  The song may be repeated [[ad infinitum]] or it may end - if it is being performed as part of a game, where members of the group are eliminated by failing to keep up with the prescribed beat or eliminated as a result of being chosen as one of the accused.

The song, and game, is featured as one of the sequences in ''[[Grandpa's Magical Toys]]''; the only accusation that is missing is that of the Dutch Girl, and she reveals that she got all the toys and the last cookie.  The song was also done on three episodes of [[Barney &amp; Friends]]. A variation of the song has been used in [[Smart4life]] commercials in the US beginning in 2009. The song was also used in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]." The song was used in The Simpsons episode "Kamp Krustier" where Chief Wiggum arrests two kids after they sing it in a group activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2500">A '''wonton font''' (also known as '''Chinese font''', '''chopstick font''' or '''chop-suey font''', '''type''' or '''lettering''') is a [[font]] with a visual style expressing "Asianness" or "Chineseness".

Styled to mimic the brush strokes used in [[Chinese character]]s, wonton fonts are often used to convey a sense of [[Orientalism]].

== Controversy ==
Some [[Asian-Americans]] {{who|date=November 2018}} find the use of these fonts offensive or racist, particularly when paired with caricatures which hark back to the [[Yellow Peril]] images of the late 19th century and 20th century. In 2002, the clothing retailer [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] experienced a public relations disaster when it produced a series of T-shirts with [[Sinodonty and Sundadonty|buck-toothed images]] and wonton font slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strasburg |first=Jenny |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2002/04/19/MN102999.DTL |title=Abercrombie recalls T-shirts many found offensive |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2002-04-19 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Cubs were hit with backlash from the Asian community after a similarly offensive T-shirt was produced by an independent vendor in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=WITTENMYER|first=GORDON|title=Fukudome doesn't find racist T-shirts in Wrigleyville funny|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/901817,CST-SPT-gordo18.article|accessdate=21 August 2013|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=April 18, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514064503/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/901817,CST-SPT-gordo18.article|archivedate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The questionable use of such fonts was recently the subject of an article in the ''Wall Street Journal'' by cultural commentator [[Jeff Yang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yang |first=Jeff |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/06/20/is-your-business-font-racist |title=Is Your Font Racist? - Speakeasy |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World domination''' (also called '''global domination''' or '''world conquest''') is a hypothetical [[power structure]], either achieved or aspired to, in which a single political authority holds the power over all or virtually all the inhabitants of the planet Earth. Various individuals or regimes have tried to achieve this goal throughout history, without ever attaining it.
The theme has been often used in works of [[fiction]], particularly in [[political fiction]], as well as in [[conspiracy theories]] (which may posit that some person or group has already secretly achieved this goal), particularly those fearing the development of a "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" involving a [[world government]] of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.&lt;ref name="Camp 1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camp, Gregory S.|title=Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia|publisher=Commish Walsh|year=1997|asin=B000J0N8NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlet and Lyons 2000"&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Chip Berlet|Berlet Chip]]; Lyons, Matthew N.|title=Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort |url=http://www.publiceye.org/tooclose/index.html|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2000|isbn=1-57230-562-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldberg, Robert Alan|title=Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-300-09000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barkun, Michael|title=[[A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America]]|publisher=University of California Press; 1 edition|year=2003|isbn=0-520-23805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenster 2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fenster, Mark|title=Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture|publisher=University of Minnesota Press; 2nd edition|year=2008|isbn=0-8166-5494-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and political ideologies==
{{main|World government}}
[[File:Achaemenid Empire (flat map).svg|thumb|right|By 500 BC, [[Darius the Great]] had created the largest empire up until that time, but it was still only a fraction of the land and people of the Earth.]]

Historically, world domination has been thought of in terms of a [[nation]] expanding its power to the point that all other nations are subservient to it. This may be achieved by establishing a [[hegemony]], an indirect form of government and of imperial dominance in which the ''hegemon'' (leader state) rules geopolitically subordinate states by means of its implied power—by the threat of force, rather than by direct military force. However, domination can also be achieved by direct military force. In the 4th century BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] notably expressed a desire to conquer the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Green|first=Peter| authorlink=Peter Green (historian)| year=2007| title= Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age|page= 23|publisher=Phoenix|location=London| isbn=978-0-7538-2413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a legend persists that after he completed his military conquest of the known [[ancient world]], he "wept because he had no more worlds to conquer",&lt;ref&gt;Eric Donald Hirsch, William G. Rowland, Michael Stanford, ''The New First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'' (2004), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; although he was unaware of China farther to the east and had no way to know about civilizations in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bruun, Millicent Haines, ''The World Story'' (1963), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the full size and scope of the world known, it has been said that "world domination is an impossible goal", and specifically that "no single nation however big and powerful can dominate a world" of well over a hundred interdependent nations and billions of people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Atlantic Community Quarterly]]'' (1979), Volume 17, p. 287. At the time, the source specified that there were about 140 nations and about four billion people.&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposite view was expressed by [[Hans Morgenthau]]. He stressed that the mechanical development of weapons, transportation, and communication makes "the conquest of the world technically possible, and they make it technically possible to keep the world in that conquered state." Its lack was the reason why great ancient empires, though vast, failed to complete universal conquest of their world and perpetuate the conquest. Now, however, this is possible. Technology undoes both geographic and climatic barriers. "Today no technological obstacle stands in the way of a world-wide empire," as "modern technology makes it possible to extend the control of mind and action to every corner of the globe regardless of geography and season."&lt;ref&gt;[[Politics Among Nations|Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace]], 4th edition, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1967, pp. 358–365.&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenthau continued on the technological progress:
{{quote|
It has also given total war that terrifying, world-embracing impetus which seems to be satisfied with nothing less than world dominion… The machine age begets its own triumphs, each forward step calling forth two or more on the road of technological progress. It also begets its own victories, military and political; for with the ability to conquer the world and keep it conquered, it creates the will to conquer it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Politics Among Nations]], pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Earlier, impressed with the swift opening of World War II, Derwent Whittlesey wrote in 1942:
{{quote|
The swift march of conquest stunned or dazzled the onlookers… The grandiose concept of the world domination became possible as a practical objective only with the rise of science and its application to mechanical invention. By these means the earth’s scattered land units and territories became accessible and complementary to each other, and for the first time the [[world state]], so long a futile medieval ideal, became a goal that might conceivably be reached.&lt;ref&gt;Derwent Whittlesey, ''German Strategy of World Conquest'', (Essex: F. E. Robinson &amp; Co, 1942), p 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Yet before the entrance of the United States into this War and with Isolationism still intact, US strategist [[Hanson W. Baldwin]] projected:
{{quote|
Tomorrow air bases may be the highroad to power and domination… Obviously it is only by air bases … that power exercised in the sovereign skies above a nation can be stretched far beyond its shores… Perhaps… future acquisitions of air bases … can carry the voice of America through the skies to the ends of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson W. Baldwin, ''United We Stand! Defense of the Western Hemisphere'', (New York &amp; London: Whittlesey House, 1941), p 189, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the early 17th century, Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] proposed that world domination could be achieved through control of the [[ocean]]s, writing that "whosoever commands the sea commands the [[trade]]; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself".&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], "A Discourse of the Invention of Ships, Anchors, Compass, &amp;c.", ''The Works of Sir Walter Ralegh, Kt.'' (1829, reprinted 1965), vol. 8, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, [[Halford John Mackinder]] offered another influential theory for a route to world domination, writing:

:"Who rules [[Eastern Europe|East Europe]] commands the [[The Geographical Pivot of History#The World-Island and the Heartland|Heartland]]:&lt;br&gt;Who rules the Heartland commands the [[Afro-Eurasia|World-Island]]:&lt;br&gt;Who rules the World-Island commands [[Earth|the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Halford John Mackinder]], ''Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction'' (1919), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of ideologies ([[anarchism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Nazism]], and [[capitalism]]) actively pursue the goal of establishing a form of government consistent with their political beliefs, or assert that the world is moving "naturally" towards the adoption of a particular form of government (or self), authoritarian or anti-authoritarian. These proposals are not concerned with a particular nation achieving world domination, but with all nations conforming to a particular social or economic model. A goal of world domination can be to establish a [[world government]], a single common political authority for all of humanity. The period of the [[Cold War]], in particular, is considered to be a period of intense ideological polarization, given the existence of two rival blocs—the capitalist [[Western Bloc|West]] and the communist [[Eastern Bloc|East]]—that each expressed the hope of seeing the triumph of their ideology over that of the enemy. The ultimate end of such a triumph would be that one ideology or the other would become the sole governing ideology in the world.

In certain [[religion]]s, some adherents may also seek the [[Religious conversion|conversion]] (peaceful or [[Forced conversion|forced]]) of as many people as possible to their own religion, without restrictions of national or ethnic origin. This type of spiritual domination is usually seen as distinct from the temporal dominion, although there have been instances of efforts begun as [[holy war]]s devolving into the pursuit of wealth, resources, and territory. Some [[Christianity|Christian]] groups teach that a false religion, led by [[false prophet]]s who achieve world domination by inducing nearly universal worship of a [[False god|false deity]], is a prerequisite to [[end time]]s described in the [[Book of Revelation]]. As one author put it, "[i]f world domination is to be obtained, the masses of little people must be brought on board with religion".&lt;ref&gt;Buddy Selman, ''Because God Made a Promise to Abraham'' (2011), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, speakers have accused nations or ideological groups of seeking world domination, even where those entities have denied that this was their goal. For example, [[J. G. Ballard]] quoted [[Aldous Huxley]] as having said of the United States entering the [[First World War]], "I dread the inevitable acceleration of American world domination which will be the result of it all...Europe will no longer be Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. G. Ballard]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/13/biography.aldoushuxley?INTCMP=SRCH Prophet of Our Present]. Review of ''[[Aldous Huxley]]: An English Intellectual'' by Nicholas Murray. ''The Guardian'', 13 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Geert Wilders]] argued in 2012 that "[[Islam]] is an ideology aiming for world domination rather than a religion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Wilders|first=Geert |authorlink=Geert Wilders|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/14/geert-wilders-5-questions-with-decker/|title=DECKER: 5 Questions with Geert Wilders|interviewer=Brett M. Decker|work=The Washington Times|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 characterized the [[2008 Israel–Gaza conflict]] as a proxy action by Islam against the West, contending that "[t]he end of Israel would not mean the end of our problems with Islam, but only... the start of the final battle for world domination".&lt;ref&gt;[[Geert Wilders]] [http://europenews.dk/en/node/14505 Speech at the Four Seasons, New York (25 September 2008)].&lt;/ref&gt;
