On 13 February 2008, the [[Parliament of Australia]] issued a formal '''apology to Indigenous Australians''' for forced removals of Australian indigenous children (often referred to as the [[Stolen Generations]]) from their families by Australian federal and state government agencies. The apology was delivered by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23117918-5001021,00.html|title=Kevin Rudd racing to historic Aboriginal apology|accessdate=27 January 2008|last=Lewis|first=Steve|date=27 January 2008|work=Daily Telegraph (Australia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stances on the proposed apology==
For more than a decade since the ''Bringing Them Home'' report was submitted to [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[John Howard]], he and his coalition colleagues consistently rejected calls for a formal government apology, though some coalition government members stated that they were personally sorry for the outcomes of the policy. They were concerned that a formal apology could be construed as an admission of deliberate wrongdoing, rather than acknowledging that the originally stated intentions of the government were believed to be in the interests of the children and their futures. Howard and his supporters were concerned that such an apology would suggest that the government would be admitting liability in any [[duty-of-care]] legal proceedings.

After the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] the newly installed [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] announced on 11 December 2007 that the government would make an apology to Indigenous Australians, the wording of which would be decided in consultation with Aboriginal leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/how-to-say-sorry-and-heal-the-wounds/2007/12/11/1197135463459.html|title=How to say sorry and heal the wounds|accessdate=11 December 2007|last=Peatling|first=Stephanie|date=11 December 2007|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Party opposition was split on the issue. Its leader [[Brendan Nelson]] initially said that an apology would risk encouraging a "culture of guilt" in Australia. However, support for an apology was expressed by other senior Liberals, such as [[Malcolm Turnbull]], [[Peter Costello]], [[Bill Heffernan]], and former Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Lewis|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23140963-662,00.html|title=Liberals ready to think about saying sorry|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=1 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203143500/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C23140963-662%2C00.html|archivedate=3 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Liberal minister [[Judi Moylan]] said: "I think as a nation we owe an apology. We shouldn't be thinking about it as an individual apology&amp;nbsp;— it's an apology that is coming from the nation state because it was governments that did these things."&lt;ref&gt;Schubert, Misha (30 January 2008), [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/liberal-division-grows-on-apology/2008/01/29/1201369135991.html "Liberal division grows on apology"], ''The Age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson later said that he supported the government apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Gartrell|url=http://news.smh.com.au/national/howard-will-not-attend-apology-20080208-1qzm.html|title=Howard will not attend apology|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 February 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027235926/http://news.smh.com.au/national/howard-will-not-attend-apology-20080208-1qzm.html|archivedate=27 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a party meeting, the Liberal Party as a whole expressed its support for an apology, and it achieved bipartisan consensus. Nelson stated: "I, on behalf of the Coalition, of the alternative government of Australia, are{{sic}} providing in-principle support for the offer of an apology to the forcibly removed generations of Aboriginal children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Hoare|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-07/opposition-joins-rush-to-say-sorry/1035432|title=Opposition joins rush to say sorry|work=ABC News|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyn Austin, chairwoman of Stolen Generations Victoria, expressed why she believed an apology was necessary, recounting her experiences as a stolen child:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought I was being taken just for a few days. I can recall seeing my mother standing on the side of the road with her head in her hands, crying, and me in the black FJ Holden wondering why she was so upset. A few hundred words can't fix this all but it's an important start and it's a beginning[...]
I see myself as that little girl, crying myself to sleep at night, crying and wishing I could go home to my family. Everything's gone, the loss of your culture, the loss of your family, all these things have a big impact.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Dewi (1 February 2008), [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/sorry-statement-should-acknowledge-cultural-loss-says-stateleader/2008/01/31/1201714153311.html "'Sorry' statement should acknowledge cultural loss, says state leader"], ''The Age''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


==Apology text==
At 9:30am on 13 February 2008, Rudd presented the apology to Indigenous Australians as a [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to be voted on by the house. The form of the apology was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ping|last=Lo|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/02/12/2160871.htm|title=The words Rudd will use to say 'sorry'|newspaper=abc.net.au|date=12 February 2008|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dylan|last=Welch|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudd-says-sorry/2008/02/13/1202760342960.html|title=Kevin Rudd says sorry|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=13 February 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227111927/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudd-says-sorry/2008/02/13/1202760342960.html|archivedate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|I move:&lt;br&gt;
That today we honour the Indigenous peoples of this land, the oldest continuing cultures in human history.&lt;br&gt;
We reflect on their past mistreatment.&lt;br&gt;
We reflect in particular on the mistreatment of those who were Stolen Generations—this blemished chapter in our nation's history.&lt;br&gt;
The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future.&lt;br&gt;
We apologise for the laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians.&lt;br&gt;
We apologise especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country.&lt;br&gt;
For the pain, suffering, and hurt of these Stolen Generations, their descendants and for their families left behind, we say sorry.&lt;br&gt;
To the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry.&lt;br&gt;
And for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture, we say sorry.&lt;br&gt;
We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation.&lt;br&gt;
For the future we take heart; resolving that this new page in the history of our great continent can now be written.&lt;br&gt;
We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians.&lt;br&gt;
A future where this Parliament resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again.&lt;br&gt;
A future where we harness the determination of all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to close the gap that lies between us in life expectancy, educational achievement, and economic opportunity.&lt;br&gt;
A future where we embrace the possibility of new solutions to enduring problems where old approaches have failed.&lt;br&gt;
A future based on mutual respect, mutual resolve and mutual responsibility.&lt;br&gt;
A future where all Australians, whatever their origins, are truly equal partners, with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country, Australia.|Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister of Australia, 13 February 2008, at a sitting of the Parliament of Australia.|source=}}

==Opposition leader's parliamentary reply and reaction==
[[File:2263391713 bde6dd94ee o.jpg|thumb|Crowds turn their backs part way through [[Brendan Nelson]]'s apology reply.&lt;ref name=backturn/&gt;]]

Brendan Nelson also delivered a 20-minute speech. He endorsed the apology but in his speech Nelson referred to the "under-policing" of [[child welfare]] in Aboriginal communities, as well as a host of social ills blighting the lives of Aboriginal people.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Alice Springs Crown Prosecutor Nanette Rogers with great courage revealed to the nation in 2006 the case of a four-year-old girl drowned while being raped by a teenager who had been sniffing petrol. She told us of the two children&amp;nbsp;– one a baby&amp;nbsp;– sexually assaulted by two men while their mothers were off drinking alcohol. Another baby was stabbed by a man trying to kill her mother.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 February 2008. Retrieved 12 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nelson's speech was considered controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands of people who had gathered in public spaces in Canberra and Melbourne to hear the apology turned their backs on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In [[Perth]], people booed and jeered until the screen was switched off. In Parliament House's Great Hall, elements of the audience began a [[slow clap]], with some finally turning their backs. There were similar reactions and walk-outs in Sydney and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=backturn/&gt;

After the ceremony, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] unanimously adopted the proposed apology motion. Six members of Nelson's opposition caucus — [[Don Randall]], [[Sophie Mirabella]], [[Dennis Jensen]], [[Wilson Tuckey]], [[Luke Simpkins]], and [[Alby Schultz]] — left the House in protest at the apology.&lt;ref name=backturn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fury-over-nelsons-sorry-reply/2008/02/13/1202760367682.html|title=Fury over Nelson's 'sorry' response|work=The Age|date=13 February 2008|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Dutton]] was the only Opposition front bencher to abstain from the apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/to-some-hes-the-messiah-to-others-a-duplicitous-polly-20091006-glh1.html|title=To some he's the messiah, to others a duplicitous polly |work=The Age|date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
[[Tom Calma]], Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, gave a speech formally responding to the government's apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/speeches/response-government-national-apology-stolen-generations|title=Response to government to the national apology to the Stolen Generations|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senate consideration==
Later that day, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] considered a motion for an identical apology. The Leader of the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], Senator [[Bob Brown]], attempted to amend the motion to have it include words committing parliament to offering compensation to those who suffered loss under past indigenous policies, but was opposed by all the other parties. The original motion was passed unanimously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds130208.pdf|title=Senate: Official Hansard, No. 1, 2008|publisher=Parliament of Australia, ''[[Hansard]]''|date=13 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216213456/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds130208.pdf|archivedate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Crawshaw|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23206550-29277,00.html|title=Brown defeated in 'sorry' compo bid|newspaper=news.com.au|date=13 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216145347/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C23206550-29277%2C00.html|archivedate=16 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Brookes completed a bachelor's degree at the [[University of Otago]] in 1976, then won scholarships to [[Bryn Mawr College]] in Pennsylvania, where she completed a [[master's degree]] (1978) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] (1982).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/otagomagazine/issue33/profiles/otago038388.html|title=A woman's history|website=www.otago.ac.nz|language=en-nz|access-date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her PhD thesis topic was abortion in England during the inter-war period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brookes was offered a post-doctoral scholarship at Otago and a permanent position in the university's Department of History in 1983.

In 1986, Brookes and her colleague [[Dorothy Page (historian)|Dorothy Page]] introduced the first university-level women's history paper in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2004, Brookes became head of the Department of History and guided the amalgamation of the department with the art history department to form the Department of History and Art History. She held the position until 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== ''A History of New Zealand Women'' ==
Brookes' sole-authored publication, ''[[A History of New Zealand Women]]'' ([[Bridget Williams Books]], 2016), won the 2017 [[Ockham New Zealand Book Awards|Ockham New Zealand Book Award]] in the Illustrated Non-Fiction category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/ockham-award-dunedin-historian|title=Ockham award for Dunedin historian|date=2017-05-17|work=Otago Daily Times Online News|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book represents over thirty years of research on the topic of New Zealand women's history (inaugurated by a 1986 volume Brookes co-edited with [[Margaret Tennant]] and [[Charlotte Macdonald]], ''Women in History'').

Marion Castree describes ''A History of New Zealand Women'' as "a superb New Zealand history through the perspective of women's lives and all they contributed to our comparatively short but intense experience in Aotearoa. . . . Beautifully illustrated and designed, this book will never date."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vicbooks.wordpress.com/2016/04/13/a-history-of-new-zealand-women-by-barbara-brookes/|title=Review: A History of New Zealand Women by Barbara Brookes|last=Castree|first=Marion|date=13 April 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susanna Andrew, writing for noted.co.nz, says the book is "a brilliant examination of how we got to where we are now. […] Brookes has marked every change and shift with clarity and scholarly precision." Charlotte Paul, writing for the ''[[The New Zealand Medical Journal|New Zealand Medical Journal]]'', says that Brookes "weaves different perspectives of Māori and Pakeha lives into a tapestry that enriches our sense of what it is to be a New Zealander."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Charlotte|date=7 April 2017|title=Book Review: ''A History of New Zealand Women''|url=http://www.nzma.org.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/55538/Paul-FINAL.pdf|journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal|publisher=[[New Zealand Medical Association]]|volume=130|issue=1453|pages=74–76|issn=1175-8716|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Stuart "Stu" Kennedy, Jr''' is an [[oral historian]] of American diplomats. He is the founder and current director of the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program at the [[Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]]. Since 1985 he has conducted over a thousand oral histories of retired American diplomats.

==Biography==
Born in Chicago in 1928, Kennedy moved with his mother and two elder brothers to the Pasadena area of California in the early 1930s, where he attended a series of public elementary schools. Later his mother took him to [[Annapolis]] where a brother attended the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]]. Living in Annapolis he developed a strong interest in history, particularly American. He went to [[Kent School]] in Connecticut, graduating in 1946 then on to Williams College where he obtained an honors degree in history. Upon graduating in 1950, Kennedy joined the United States Air Force as an enlisted man in the intelligence branch. After a year's study of Russian at the [[Army Language School]] in [[Monterrey, California]], he served in Korea during the [[Korean War]] and Germany. At the end of his four-year enlistment he studied at [[Boston University]] and received a MA in history.  Having taken and passed the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] written examination in 1954 he took the oral examination after leaving the Air Force and passed that hurdle and entered the Foreign Service in 1955.

==Work==
In his 30 years in the Foreign Service Kennedy was a consular officer dealing with the protection of American citizens abroad, the issuance of visas to foreigners and assistance to the growing throng of Americans visiting overseas in Frankfurt, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, then in the war zone of [[South Vietnam]] as consul general, then in more peaceful Athens, Greece, Seoul, South Korea and finally Naples, Italy as consul general.

Kennedy retired from the Foreign Service in 1985 and wrote a well-received history of the [[United States Consular Service]] which was published in 1990 by the Greenwood Press.  A revised edition was published in 2015 and covered the years up to 1924. Realizing that the work of American diplomats was barely acknowledged, except for a few great names, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], in the teaching of [[American history]], he started an oral history program, first at [[George Washington University]] in 1985 and then at [[Georgetown University]]. These efforts were barely funded and the oral history did not have much support until the creation of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training in 1986 by a group of retired Foreign Service officers. Since that time Stu Kennedy has been director of the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program of the Association. He has conducted some 1,000 oral histories of retired American diplomats whose careers range from the 1920s to the present. These are inclusive interviews running about 10 hours, especially those done in later periods, and cover early childhood, education, experiences outside the diplomatic period as well as service to the State Department. Both career and non-career officers are covered. The texts of the interviews are available on the [[Library of Congress]]'s website, [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/diplomacy/index.html Frontline Diplomacy], and on the website of the [http://adst.org/oral-history/oral-history-interviews/ Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training].

Kennedy was awarded the Foreign Service Cup from the Director General of the Foreign Service in 1997 for his work as an oral historian and in 2014 received the Award for Lifetime Contribution to American Diplomacy from the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). As of 2017 he is still conducting interviews.

The '''''Chronicon Novaliciense''''' (or '''''Chronicle of Novalesa''''') is a monastic [[chronicle]] which was written in the mid-eleventh century in the [[Susa valley|valley of Susa]]. 

The ''Chronicle of Novalesa'' was written, c.1050, by an anonymous monk at the monastery of [[Novalesa Abbey|San Pietro in Novalesa]].  The ''Chronicon'' was written in the form of a [[rotulus]] (or scroll) rather than a [[codex]]. The original, and sole extant copy, of the scroll is preserved in Turin (Archivio di Stato, Nuova collezione, "museo").&lt;ref&gt;Morreale, 'Chronicon'.&lt;/ref&gt; The scroll consists of twenty-eight pieces of parchment sewn together, of which fragments are now missing. The work is divided into five sections, plus an appendix; of which sections four and five are incomplete.

The ''Chronicon'' relates the story of monastery of Novalesa from its foundation, by the patrician Abbo in 726, up to the mid-eleventh century. Its main purpose was to emphasise the connection between the revived eleventh-century community at Novalesa and the earlier community of monks, who had been forced to abandon the monastery in 906 by incursions into the western Alps by [[Saracen|Saracens]] (Muslims from [[Al-Andalus]]). When the monks finally returned to Novalesa, in the early eleventh century, they found that their monastery had lost its formerly important status in the region. The anonymous author of the ''Chronicon'' blamed [[Arduin Glaber|Arduin Glaber of Turin]] for this. The ''Chronicon'' accuses Arduin Glaber of taking advantage of the monks’ absence to usurp their lands in the valley of Susa.&lt;ref&gt;Alessio, ''Cronaca'', V.19, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text draws on both oral sources and written ones. In addition to charters (legal documents, recording grants of rights and/or authority), the anonymous author made use of narrative sources including [[Paul the Deacon|Paul the Deacon's]] ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'', the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', and the Latin heroic epic [[Waltharius]].&lt;ref&gt;Morreale, 'Chronicon'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several archeological excavations have taken place at the site of the museum itself. Excavations were conducted between 2000 and 2003 during renovations on the Palace (in the basement and in the inner courtyard) under the direction of the City Museum curator. These revealed many historical artifacts and remains from the [[Urnfield Culture]], the Late [[Hallstatt period]], the Middle and Late [[La Tène period]], the [[Roman Imperial]] period, the [[Late Medieval period]] and the [[Early Modern period]]s. Of note were two graves of La Tène warriors that were discovered in an Early Roman in-fill deposit during the investigation in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Štrajhar|first=Metka |last2= Gaspari  |first2=Andrej |date=December 2013 |title= Ostanki dveh srednjelatenskih bojevniških grobov iz Turjaške palače v Ljubljani/Remains of two Middle La Tène Warrior graves from the Auersperg Palace in Ljubljana|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=165116 |journal=PRIL.

The '''County of Durango''' ({{lang-eu|Durangoko Merinaldea}}), also known as ''Land of Durango'' and ''Merindad of Durango'', was the ancient political administration of the territory that is now known as [[Durangaldea]], in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] region of [[Biscay]]. This political administration included all the towns and [[elizate]]s that existed within its territory. The elizates were all governed by the [[Fuero|Foral law]], while the towns had their own law. The county of Durango was a [[vassal state]] of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] (later, [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), and in the 13th Century it became a constituent part of the [[Lordship of Biscay]].&lt;ref name="Auñamendi Señorío"&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/45746/33813 Incorporation to the Lordship] at the Auñamendi Entziklopedia (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been part of the territory of Biscay since then. Its capital city was the town of [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]].

== History ==

The first known reference of the existence of a political organization in the territory of Durango was in the year 1050, when Eneco Lupiz is appointed regent of "the territories of [[Lordship of Biscay|Biscay]] and Durango". It appears again in the record of a committee that took place in the church of San Agustin-Etxebarria in the year 1053, this time with the name ''Duranko''.&lt;ref name="Early history Auñamendi"&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/45746/33813 History of Durangaldea: early history] entry at the Auñamendi Entziklopedia (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The County of Durango is also mentioned along the [[County of Álava]] in relation to its close relationship with the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. During the 11th century the lands of Durango, along with the [[Lordship of Biscay]], moved back and forward between the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and Navarre, that kept losing and reconquering the land. In the year 1200, [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] invades the county of Alava and lays siege to the city of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]].&lt;ref name="In the year 1200 Auñamendi"&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/45746/33812 History of Durangaldea: Year 1200] entry at the Auñamendi Entziklopedia (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Alava and Durango are then ultimately conquered by Castile. In the year 1212, Castilian king Alfonso VIII merges the County of Durango into the [[Lordship of Biscay]], which is awarded to [[Diego López II de Haro]] for his war efforts in the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]. However, Durango maintained its economical and political autonomy, despite being now part of the Lordship.

== Territory ==

The County of Durango was formed by twelve [[Elizate|elizates]] and four towns or cities that occupy the same territory that today does [[Durangaldea]], a region of the province of [[Biscay]] and successor of this county. The elizates were [[Abadiño]], [[Berriz]], [[Mallabia]], [[Mañaria]], [[Iurreta]], [[Garai, Biscay|Garai]], [[Zaldibar]], Arrazola, Axpe, Apatamonasterio, [[Izurtza]] and San Agustin-Etxebarria, while the four towns were [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]] (also the capital), [[Elorrio]], [[Ermua]] and [[Otxandio]].

In 1630 Elorrio annexed the elizate of San Augstin-Etxebarria, and in present time the elizates of Axpe, Arrazola and Apatamonasterio are joined together forming the municipality of [[Atxondo]].

== Political institutions ==

=== Audience House ===

[[File:Casa Astola.JPG|thumb|right|250px|House of Astola in Astola, [[Abadiño]].]]

The ordinary meetings between the representatives of the [[elizate]]s and towns took place in the called the Audience House. The first documented Audience House was located in the neighborhood of Kurutzesaga in [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], which was known as "the Old Audience" and it is known that there were issues about its ownership between the County and the administration of the town of Durango. 

In 1578, long after the incorporation of the county into the [[Lordship of Biscay]], the House of Astola is acquired and the meetings start taking place there. This house dates the year 1570 and takes place of a previous one, destroyed in a fire. In the House of Astola lived some of the authorities of the County and was also the location of the county's prison. 

=== The Foral Field ===

The extraordinary meetings between the representatives of the County were held in a field between the hermitages of San Salvador and San Clemente in the neighborhood of Gerediaga, [[Abadiño]], under an oak and seated on stones positioned on a semicircle. The building still stands on its original location and has been recently reformed by the Government of [[Biscay]]. The oak was lost around the 18th century.

'''Erasure''' in [[blazon]]ry, the language of [[heraldry]], is the tearing off of part of a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]], leaving a jagged edge of it remaining. Due to the usual construction of blazons, this is most often found in its [[adjective|adjectival]] form (i.e., '''erased'''), usually applied to animate charges, most often used of heads but sometimes other body parts.  When a tree or other plant is shown uprooted (with the bare roots showing), it is '''eradicated'''.&lt;ref&gt;James Parker, [http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/Jpglosse.htm A Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry] (1894; new edition by James Parker and Company, Oxford, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''erased'' is most often used of an animal's head, when the neck is depicted with a ragged edge as if forcibly torn from the body.  ''Erased'' heads are distinct from those ''couped'', in that the former are cut off along a jagged line while the latter are cut off along a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Woodcock, John Martin Robinson, ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|0-19-211658-4}}), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Craig (geologist)|John Craig]]'s dictionary of 1854 says: {{quote|In Heraldry, anything is said to be erased which appears forcibly torn off, leaving the edges jagged and uneven.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Craig (geologist)|John Craig]]', ''A new universal, technological, etymological, and pronouncing dictionary of the English language'' (vol. 1, 1854), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vTJAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA656#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 656]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms of erasure==
[[File:Boar's head erased (scottish heraldry).svg|thumb|100px|right|A boar's head ''erased'']]
There are different traditions for the erasing of heads. For instance, with the head of a [[bear]], whether couped or erased, in English heraldry the separation is done horizontally under the neck, which is not lost, whereas in Scottish heraldry the usual practice is for the head to be separated from the body vertically, without keeping the neck attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Boutell, ''Heraldry'' (F. Warne, 1950), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esther Norma Arrostito''' (January 17, 1940 &amp;ndash; January 15, 1978) was an Argentine political activist and leftist militant, initially close to communist ideology. In 1970, she became one of the founders of the [[Peronism|peronist]] revolutionary movement [[Montoneros]] along with Fernando Abal Medina, who developed a romantic relationship with her. She played a key role in the kidnapping and killing of General [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]].

==Early years==
Arrostito was born in [[Buenos Aires]], the daughter of a middle-class couple, and grew up in a leftist background, ideologically opposed to Peronism.&lt;ref name=proyecto/&gt; She graduated as an elementary school teacher and married a communist militant, Rubén Ricardo Roitvan.&lt;ref&gt;Baschetti, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; She later became a hard-line militant under the influence of a left-wing Peronist leader of Irish ancestry, John William Cooke.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  Arrostito was the only founder of Montoneros with neither [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] nor Nationalist affiliation.&lt;ref name=proyecto/&gt;

==Militance==

===Killing of Aramburu===
Norma Arrostito left the communist party in 1967, and joined the organization ''Comando [[Camilo Torres Restrepo|Camilo Torres]]'', where she met Mario Eduardo Firmenich, Carlos Ramus and Fernando Abal Medina. She fell in love with the latter, despite being seven years older than he was, and broke her relationship with Roitvan. They were trained in guerrilla warfare in [[Cuba]] during 1968, and back in Argentina they split from the ''Comando Camilo Torres'' to create a new cell.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined by Nélida Arrostito, a sister of Norma and her husband, Carlos Alberto Maguid.&lt;ref name= Maguid&gt;Andersen, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' was ''Gaby'' (shortened form of  the name ''Gabriela'') or ''Gaviota'' (seagull).&lt;ref&gt;Bonasso, 269&lt;/ref&gt; The organization carried out in a series of operations against the security forces, which ended on 1 June 1970 in the kidnapping and murder of General [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]], a former ''de facto'' President and one of the leaders of the [[Revolución Libertadora]] which overthrew [[Juan Domingo Perón|Perón]] in 1955. Norma played a supporting role during the kidnapping and she wrote and sent "dispatches" to the media updating  the process of  "trial" and  "execution"  of Aramburu. This operation, code named ''Pindapoy'', marked the first public action of Montoneros.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina was then under military rule, but the return of Peron to power was a matter of time. The death of Aramburu prompted the fall of president [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] and triggered a huge manhunt of suspected terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September, a police raid caught Ramus and Abal Medina in a restaurant in [[William C. Morris, Buenos Aires|William Morris]], a neighborhood in the western outskirts of Buenos Aires, killing both of them after a brief shootout.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; After Abal Medina's death, Arrostito was known inside the organisation as ''la viuda'' ("the widow").&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amnesty===
After the military departed from power, Arrostito and her camarades of Montoneros were granted an amnesty by a decree of [[Héctor José Cámpora]], who had won the presidential elections of March 1973.&lt;ref name=Maguid/&gt; She became staff supervisor of [[Oscar Bidegain]], Governor of [[Buenos Aires Province]] and sympathizer of Montoneros ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 1973, the magazine ''La Causa Peronista'' published an interview with Arrostito and Firmenich where they described in detail the kidnapping and assassination of Aramburu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060706222932/http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Mario_Firmenich_y_Norma_Arrostito_cuentan_c%C3%B3mo_muri%C3%B3_Aramburu Wikisource ] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clandestinity and death==
{{See also|National Reorganization Process}}
During Perón's last term (1973–1974), the relationship between the right wing of the party and leftist organisations, including Montoneros strained to the point of no return. In his [[May Day]] speech, Perón took sides and denounced Montoneros as ''imberbes'' ("beardless brats") and mercenaries to the service of foreign interests.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was proscribed after Perón's death in July, and by September Norma and his companions were forced to live in hideouts and to meet in secret. Meanwhile, the guerrilla operations against security forces reached its climax in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 1976, a military coup overthrew president [[María Estela Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]]. The armed forces stepped up the repression not only of leftist guerrillas, but also of their affiliates and even relatives. Arrostito was reported shot and killed after a fierce firefight with an army patrol on 2 December 1976. The truth was that Norma was captured alive and illegally imprisoned at the Navy's school of  mechanical engineering, the [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics|ESMA]] (''Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada'').&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=978980 ''Norma Arrostito, la “montonera” más peligrosa y famosa''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military faked her death in order to keep Montoneros in the belief that a lot of compromising information had been lost with her. Arrostito, however, endured more than a year of torture and humiliation without betraying her camarades.&lt;ref name=proyecto&gt;[http://www.proyecto-nacional.com.ar/companeros/norma-arrostito/#prof ''Proyecto Nacional''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was eventually killed by a [[lethal injection]] of [[Sodium thiopental|pentothal]] on 15 January 1978.&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt; Her body was never found.&lt;ref name=proyecto/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6482">In [[art history]], '''formalism''' is the study of art by analyzing and comparing form and [[Style (visual arts)|style]]. Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes [[composition (art)|compositional]] elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be of secondary importance.

==History==
The historical origin of the modern form of the question of aesthetic formalism is usually dated to [[Immanuel Kant]] and the writing of his third Critique where Kant states: "Every form of the objects of sense is either ''figure'' (''Gestalt'') or ''play'' (''Spiel''). In the latter case it is either play of figures or the mere play of sensations. The charm (''Reiz'') of colors... may be added, but the delineations (''Zeichnung'') in the... composition (''Komposition'')... constitute the proper object of the pure judgment of taste."&lt;ref&gt;Kant. ''Critique of Judgment''. Section 14.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant's position stating: "Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation... In the parts of the ''Critique of Judgment'' in which form is emphasized as the essential aspect of beauty, Kant is consistently a pure formalist."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Crawford, ''Kant's Aesthetic Theory'' (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1974), p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary definition==
The philosopher Nick Zangwill of Glasgow University has defined formalism in art as referring to those properties "that are determined solely by sensory or physical properties—so long as the physical properties in question are not relations to other things and other times."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, ''The Metaphysics of Beauty'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2001), p.&amp;nbsp;56, {{ISBN|0801438209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and architect Branko Mitrovic has defined formalism in art and architecture as "the doctrine that states that the aesthetic qualities of works of visual art derive from the visual and spatial properties."&lt;ref&gt;Branko Mitrović, ''Philosophy for architects'' (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, [2011]), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the observation that works of art can in general contain formal properties and nonformal properties, the philosopher Nick Zangwill has delineated three types of formalism as they are encountered at the turn of the 21st century. First, Zangwill identifies ''extreme formalists'' who think "that all works of art are purely formal works—where a work is purely formal if all its aesthetic properties are formal aesthetic properties," then he defines ''anti-formalist'' thinkers as those who "think that no works of art have formal aesthetic properties."&lt;ref name="z84"&gt;Zangwill 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; The third type which Zangwill identifies as representing the transition of the philosophy of aesthetics into the 21st century is that of ''moderate formalism'', where its principal exponents defend the principle "that all the aesthetic properties of works of art in a select class are formal, and second, that although many works of art outside that class have nonformal aesthetic properties, many of those works also have important formal aesthetic properties that must not be ignored."&lt;ref name="z84"/&gt;

The philosopher Michalle Gal has offered a moderate version of formalism, entitled "Deep Formalism", which is a symbolic formalism based on philosophical aestheticism. The artwork is defined by her as deep form: "a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6|title=Aestheticism: Deep Formalism and the Emergence of Modernist Aesthetics|last=Gal|first=Michalle|date=2015|publisher=Peter Lang AG|year=|isbn=9783035199925|location=|pages=14|language=en|doi=10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or pre-determined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones.

==Uses in art history==
A formal analysis is an academic method in [[art history]] and criticism for [[analysis|analyzing]] works of [[art]]: "In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use 'formal analysis'. This means they describe things very carefully. These descriptions, which may include subjective vocabulary, are always accompanied by illustrations, so that there can be no doubt about what exists objectively".&lt;ref&gt;Review by: Clemency Chase Coggins of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'' edited by Margaret W. Conkey and Christine A. Hastorf, p.&amp;nbsp;233, ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (Summer, 1992), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34, Maney Publishing, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/529988 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francesco Carotta''' (born 1946 in [[Veneto]], [[Italy]])&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Carotta's [http://carotta.de/subseite/autor.html CV]. {{cite linked authority file|id=no2005-29212}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Italian writer who developed a theory that the [[historical Jesus]] was based on the life of [[Julius Caesar]], that the [[Gospels]] were a rewriting of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historical sources, and that [[Christianity]] developed from the cult of the deified Caesar. This theory is generally ignored in academic circles.

==Caesarian origin of Christianity==
Francesco Carotta's theory runs contrary to all established [[Quest for the historical Jesus|theories on the historical Jesus]]. Carotta postulates that the historical person behind the Biblical figure Jesus Christ was not [[Jesus of Nazareth]], but the Roman statesman [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], from whose cult [[Christianity]] developed over the course of several generations.

=== ''Jesus was Caesar'' ===
The thesis of Carotta's book ''Jesus was Caesar'' is based on a comparison of the [[gospel]]s, especially the earliest [[Gospel of Mark]], with the ancient sources about the last years in the life of Caesar and his immediate legacy. Roman sources include [[Appian]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Suetonius]], who all relied to some extent on Caesar's contemporary [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]] and his [[Lost work#Classical world|lost]] ''Historiae'', which according to Carotta might constitute the "Latin Ur-Gospel". This is augmented by comparisons from [[archaeology]], [[numismatics]], [[iconography]], [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]], and [[Worship|ritual]] traditions. Carotta argues that the multiple parallels he sees between the lives and cults of Caesar and Jesus can best be explained by his theory that Jesus Christ is based on the deified Julius Caesar, transformed and mirrored in the eastern [[Greek people|Hellenistic]] and [[Judaism|judaizing]] regions of the [[Roman Empire]].

Within Carotta's theory the gospels are ''[[transtextuality|hypertexts]]'' after a ''[[Diegesis#In literature|diegetic transposition]]''&lt;ref&gt;Following the [[literary theory]] introduced by {{cite book
  | last = Genette
  | first = Gérard

  | title = Palimpsestes. La littérature au second degré
  | publisher = Seuil
  | year = 1982

  | isbn = 2-02-006116-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Roman sources (''hypotexts'') on Caesar's life from the beginning of the Civil War, the crossing of the [[Rubicon]], until his [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassination]], funeral and [[Apotheosis|deification]], conforming to Jesus' mission from the [[River Jordan|Jordan]] to his [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. Textually transformed from [[Rome]] to [[Jerusalem]] in Caesar's eastern [[veteran]] [[Colonia (Roman)|colonies]], the Gospel narrative with its altered geography, dramatic structure, its characters and newly adopted cultural environment, would therefore have been written neither as a [[Mimesis|mimetic]] approximation of Caesarian attributes nor as a [[Mythology|mythological]] amalgam, but as a directly dependent, albeit mutated rewriting (''réécriture'') of actual history.

He argues that, following this initial transposition, there was at first a redaction of the Caesarian Ur-Gospel inspired by [[Augustus|Augustan]] history and theogony, whereby the later [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptic gospels]] by [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] incorporated (among other [[pericope]]s) the [[Nativity of Jesus]], originally transposed from the nativity of Augustus, and the resurrection narrative, according to the chronological-biographical structures in the historical account by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. Later generations produced more discrete traditions like the [[Gospel of John]], the [[Acts of the Apostles]], and the [[Book of Revelation]]. According to Carotta, the ultimate early Christian metamorphosis of the eastern Caesar-religion, which was to reinterpret the foundational cult of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julian imperial dynasty]] with regard to the contested Palestine, was provoked by the new [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] [[Theocracy|theopolitical]] ideology, which also induced the rewriting of the vita of [[Vespasian]]'s court historian [[Flavius Josephus]] into the [[hagiography]] of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] in the second part of Acts.

Carotta's book and its translations have drawn little serious academic attention. Except for few [[feuilleton]] write-ups&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Citation

Outside of Germany his theory drew little response, while the 2003 Dutch translation caused a controversial and at times heated debate in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] media: historian [[Thomas von der Dunk]], philosopher [[Andreas Kinneging]] and philosopher [[Paul Cliteur]] were among those who supported Carotta's theory, while philosopher Willem J. Ouweneel, theologian Matthijs de Jong, historians Marc van Uytfanghe and Anton van Hooff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skepsis.nl/carotta.html |title=Atheïstisch bijgeloof |author=Anton van Hooff |work=[[Skepter]] 15(4) |publisher=[[Stichting Skepsis]] |date=December 2002}} (including a 4 November 2007 addendum)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Dutch Bible Society'' dismissed the book.&lt;ref&gt;For earlier summaries of the Dutch debate cf. also {{Citation

[[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]] criticized Carotta for avoiding explanations on why the "figure called Jesus Christ" would have been "invented" and given a "life modeled on that of Julius Caesar", and "why there should be four versions of the career of Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Fred Batt''' (born 2 September 1955)  is a former businessman, nightclub owner, singer, actor and self-styled [[Demonology|demonologist]] and historian known for his regular appearances on the British [[Paranormal television|paranormal]] [[reality television]] series ''[[Most Haunted]]''. He claims to be the United Kingdom's only demonologist.&lt;ref name=Dorking/&gt;

Batt states that his interest in the occult began as a teenager. He made his first appearance as a presenter on ''[[Most Haunted]]'' in 2008 on a live Hallowe'en special;&lt;ref name=Dorking&gt;[http://www.dorkingandleatherheadadvertiser.co.uk/Dorking-Demonologist-Fred-Batt-new-series-Haunted/story-22723798-detail/story.html 'Dorking Demonologist Fred Batt to front new series of Most Haunted' - ''Dorking and Leatherhead Advertiser'' - 19 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; he had previously appeared as a guest on the show in 2003 at his nightclub Caesar's in Streatham. He became a regular presenter on the show in the 2010-11 series and rejoined for the current series in 2013.

From 1994 to 2010 he owned Caesar's, a 1,900-capacity nightclub on Streatham High Street;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/in/fred-batt-17146a1a Batt's profile on [[LinkedIn]]]&lt;/ref&gt; in an episode of ''[[Most Haunted]]'' filmed here in 2003 he claimed the venue was haunted by the spirit of [[Ruth Ellis]] who had worked there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streathamguardian.co.uk/news/4075421.Ghostbusters_to_inspect_doomed_nightclub/ 'Ghostbusters to inspect doomed Caesar's  nightclub' - ''Streatham Guardian'' - 26 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Batt became involved in lengthy licensing hearings lasting 13 hours in Lambeth when the police and local councillors objected to Caesar's receiving a new alcohol licence because of the heavy drain the venue placed on police resources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/30/localgovernment.comment 'The Longest Lambeth Licensing Hearing in Living Memory' - ''[[The Guardian]]'' - 30 June 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he became the first person in the UK to be fitted with a light adjustable lens (LAL) to correct vision impairment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8392749.stm 'Giving old eyes a new lease of life' - [[BBC News]] - 5 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hadera bus station suicide bombing''' was a 1994 [[Hamas]] [[suicide attack]] on a passenger bus departing from the central bus station in [[Hadera]] for [[Tel Aviv]], Israel. Six were killed and 30 injured. The attack came exactly one week after another Hamas attack, the [[Afula Bus suicide bombing]]. Both attacks were motivated officially by Hamas as retribution for the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]] conducted against Muslim worshippers in February by [[Baruch Goldstein]].&lt;ref name="Pape" &gt;[[Robert Pape]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOlnH3f_dXwC&amp;pg=PA66 ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism,''] [[Random House]] 2005 pp.66-68&lt;/ref&gt; The attack took place on the Israeli [[Yom Hazikaron|Fallen Soldiers and Victims of Terrorism Remembrance Day]].

Hamas bombmaker [[Yahya Ayyash]] built a bomb using two kilograms of home-made [[acetone peroxide]] explosive. Twenty-one-year-old Amar Salah Diab Amarna, a native of [[Ya'bad]] in the [[West Bank]], was selected for the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of April 13, 1994, Amarna boarded the 9:30 AM bus to Tel Aviv. At 9:40 AM, as the bus was pulling out of the station, Amarna placed the bag containing the bomb on the floor of the bus, "where shrapnel could rip through vital arteries in the [[groin]] area," and detonated it.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

As Israeli rescue workers converged on the scene of the explosion, a second [[pipe bomb]] exploded. Hamas later claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=4965 Suicide and Car Bomb Attacks in Israel Since the Declaration of Principles (September 1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6247">The '''Hamar Chronicle''' ({{lang-no|Hamarkrøniken}}) is a book written in the 1500s by an unknown author. It describes life in the town of [[Hamar]] during the Catholic era (until 1537).&lt;ref name="SNL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamarkrøniken|url=https://snl.no/Hamarkr%C3%B8niken|website=Store norske leksikon|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Næss|first1=Harald S.|title=A History of Norwegian Literature|date=1993|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, NB|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is an important source for the study of Hamar's history because it describes the settlement of the town.&lt;ref name="Hoilund"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Høilund|first1=Mari Kristin|title=Historie som argument. Hamarkaupangen får nytt liv|date=2007|publisher=Universitetet i Oslo|location=Oslo|page=12ff.|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/25086/11-5Historiexsomxargument.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is first and foremost a local patriotic depiction of Hamar in the [[Middle Ages]]. It discusses the most important buildings (the [[Cathedral Ruins in Hamar|cathedral]], the bishop's residence, St. Olaf's Monastery, the cruciform church, Saint George's Church, the town hall, and the prison) as well as the life of the town and how it was governed, and it contains a short narrative about the last bishop's departure from the town. In addition, it lists all of the bishops in Hamar during the Catholic era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnesen|first1=Arne Gude Smith|last2=Hummer|first2=Lars|title=Hamar-krøniken: med andre kilder til kunnskap om det gamle bispesaete|date=1937|publisher=Cammermeyer|location=Oslo|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The author of the Hamar Chronicle is unknown, but from the language and the description there is reason to believe that the author was from [[Hedmarka]], if not Hamar itself. On the other hand, the book tells about its origins: on July 22, 1553 many important people gathered at the Hamar farm (i.e., the bishop's residence) to review the bishop's letters and books. Following royal orders from Copenhagen, some of the Catholic archives were to be registered, and [[lensmann]] [[Christen Munk]], the son-in-law of Truid Ulfstand, was to be responsible. He had gathered freeholders with [[Udal law|allodial tenure]] and other secular men together, and together they were to record the most important of the town's buildings, streets, organization and population. Strikingly, it also presents many memories of the city's golden age and a narrative of earthquakes and the last bishop's struggle. It is widely believed that these observations were added by Trugels the cantor, the church choral director.&lt;ref name="Hoilund"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bull|first1=Francis|title=Norsk litteratur historie: bd. Norges litteratur, fra reformasjonen til 1814|date=1958|publisher=H. Aschehoug|location=Oslo|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portents before the bishop's capture==
The Hamar Chronicle describes portents before [[Mogens Lauritssøn|Bishop Mogens]] was captured. The chronicle says that in the middle of the night all the bells in the cathedral, the monastery, and the church began to ring of their own accord. In the church and the cathedral it was as though it were the middle of the day, and there was a sound as if two armies would fight. The chronicle goes on to say: ''Dernest om höy dags tijd beteede sig en gresselig stor orm oc forferdelig, som kaldis Siöormen, udi Miöß, som var gandske lang oc meget stor, oc siuntes at naa fra öens landt oc jnd udi Kongsland''&lt;ref name="Dokumentasjonsprosjektet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamarkrøniken|url=http://www.dokpro.uio.no/litteratur/hamarkroeniken/|website=Dokumentasjonsprosjektet|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|140}} (Next there appeared in the middle of the day an enormously large and abominable sea serpent, called the Sjøorm, in Lake [[Mjøsa]], which was exceedingly long and very large, and it seemed to be coming from the island [i.e., [[Helgøya, Hedmark|Helgøya]], the 'holy island'] and approaching the land of the king.) It then relates how one of the bishop's men killed the beast with an arrow and how they disposed of its enormous carcass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egerer|first1=Juliane|title=Von Waldtrollen und Hauszwergen : Norwegens übernatürliche Wesen als Erzählfiguren|date=2010|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Berlin|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regarding the last bishop==
{{main|Battle of Hamar}}
Finally, the chronicle describes the occasion and the events of the day that Bishop Mogens was captured and sent to [[Denmark]]. The bishop had to surrender because of [[Truid Ulfstand]]'s forces' modern weapons: bullets and gunpowder against the bishop's arrows and [[crossbow]]s. When the bishop left the city, he fell on his knees and thanked God for every day he had spent in the city. He asked the city to pray for him and said he would return. Then the chronicle states that he prayed: ''O Gud fader udi himmelen, findes vj icke för, da Gud giffue det vj findis i himmerige. Denne bön bad hand med grædende taare oc sagde, vale, vale, vale.''&lt;ref name="Dokumentasjonsprosjektet"/&gt;{{rp|146}} (O God, Father in heaven, we do not exist for gifts from God, but to find heaven. He prayed this prayer while crying tears, and said farewell, farewell, farewell.)

==Hamar's coat of arms==
[[File:hamar_komm.png|frame|Hamar's coat of arms]]
The chronicle also describes what Hamar's coat of arms looked like, and it is from this depiction that today's municipal coat of arms  was designed in 1899, on the occasion of the town's 50th anniversary. The chronicle states: ''Hammers vaaben det var en vhrhane med udslagen vinger vdi toppen paa it grönt furutræ''&lt;ref name="Dokumentasjonsprosjektet"/&gt;{{rp|129}} (Hamar's coat of arms was a [[black grouse]] with outspread wings at the top of a green  pine). The chronicle says that this coat of arms was carved into the woodwork over the town hall in the old marketplace.

'''Insect collecting''' refers to the collection of [[insect]]s and other [[arthropod]]s for scientific study or as a [[hobby]]. Because most insects are small and the majority cannot be identified without the examination of minute morphological characters, [[entomologist]]s often make and maintain insect collections. Very large collections are conserved in [[natural history museum]]s or [[University|universities]] where they are maintained and studied by specialists. Many college courses require students to form small collections. There are also amateur entomologists and collectors who keep collections.

Historically, insect collecting has been widespread and was in the [[Victorian age]] a very popular educational [[hobby]]. Insect collecting has left traces in European [[cultural history]], literature and songs (e.g., [[Georges Brassens]]'s ''La chasse aux papillons'' (''The Hunt for Butterflies'')). The practice is still widespread in many countries, and is particularly common among [[Japan]]ese youths.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Collecting techniques==
{{details|Insect trap}}
[[Image:Robinson trap.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Moth trap|Robinson light trap]] for collecting moths]]
Insects are passively caught using [[Tullgren funnel|funnels]], [[pitfall trap]]s, [[Bottle trap for insects|bottle traps]], [[Malaise Trap|malaise traps]], [[flight interception trap]]s and other passive types of [[insect trap]]s, some of which are baited with small bits of sweet foods (such as honey). Different designs of ultraviolet light traps such as the [[Robinson trap]] are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects (especially moths) during faunistic survey studies. Aspirators or "[[pooter]]s" suck up insects too small or delicate to handle with fingers.&lt;ref name=" Martin, J.E.H. 1977 " &gt;Martin, J.E.H. 1977.

[[File:Kite-net-2.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Butterfly net|insect net]]]]
[[Image:Little Haven Nature Reserve, sweep-netting - geograph.org.uk - 1581841.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sweep netting for grassland insects]]
Several different types of nets are commonly used to actively collect insects. [[Butterfly net|Aerial insect nets]] are used to collect flying insects. The bag of a butterfly net is generally constructed from a lightweight mesh to minimize damage to delicate [[butterfly]] wings. A [[sweep net]] is used to collect insects from grass and brush. It is similar to a butterfly net, except that the bag is generally constructed from more rugged material.The sweep net is swept back and forth through vegetation quickly turning the opening from side to side and following a shallow figure eight pattern. The collector walks forward while sweeping, and the net is moved through plants and grasses with force.This requires a heavy net fabric such as sailcloth to prevent tearing, although light nets can be used if swept less vigorously. Sweeping continues for some distance and then the net is flipped over, with the bag hanging over the rim, trapping the insects until they can be removed with a pooter. Other types of nets used for collecting insects include [[beating net]]s and aquatic nets.&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;[[Charles Valentine Riley]], 1892 ''Directions for collecting and preserving insects'' Bulletin (United States National Museum) no. 39, pt. F. Washington,Govt. Printing Off. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20176  Full text online here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leaf litter sieve]]s are used by [[Coleoptera|coleopterists]] and to collect larvae.

Once collected, a [[killing jar]] is used to kill required insects before they damage themselves trying to escape. However, killing jars are generally only used on hard-bodied insects.  Soft-bodied insects, such as those in the [[larvae|larval]] stage, are generally [[Fixation (histology)|fixed]] in a vial containing an [[ethanol]] and water solution.&lt;ref name ="Hongfu, Zhu, 1949" &gt;Hongfu, Zhu, 1949 ''How to know the immature insects; an illustrated key for identifying the orders and families of many of the immature insects with suggestions for collecting, rearing and studying them, by H. F. Chu.'' Pictured key nature series Dubuque, Iowa,W. C. Brown Co.[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/29017 Full text online here]
&lt;/ref&gt; Another now mostly historical approach is [[Caterpillar inflation]] where the innards were removed and the skin dried.&lt;ref name=gibb&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibb |first=Timothy J|last2=Oseto |first2=Christian  |date=2006 |title=Arthropod Collection and Identification: Laboratory and Field Techniques |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |page=67|isbn=0123695457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage and curation==
{{details|Entomological equipment for mounting and storage}}
[[Image:MuseumfürNaturkundeInsectPreparation (2).jpg|thumb|left|Equipment for preparation]]
The usual method of display is in a glass-covered box, with the insects mounted on specially made non corrosive [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|insect pins]] stuck into suitable foam plastic or paper covered cork at the bottom of the box. Common [[pin]]s are not used. Very small insects may be pinned on "minuten" (very tiny headless pins) stuck into a block of foam plastic on a standard insect pin. Alternatively they may be glued onto a small piece of card on the pin. There are specific procedures for proper mounting that are used to show off the insects' essential characteristics. Techniques and equipment may be varied to deal with various species or requirements. For example, one or both of the wings of a [[beetle]] or [[grasshopper]] can be pulled open and fanned out to show the wing structure that otherwise would be hidden. At least the date and place of capture should be written or computer printed onto a piece of paper or card transfixed by the pin. This is called a data label.&lt;ref name="Uys &amp; Urban"&gt;V.M. Uys &amp; R.P. Urban (Eds.): "How to Collect and Preserve Insects and Arachnids". Pretoria 2006. 112 p. {{ISBN|1-86849-311-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Insect Safari - beetle 36.jpg|thumb|200px|Part of a beetle collection. The insects are transfixed by entomological pins which allow handling and which also pierce the data label]]

Rare insects, or those from distant parts of the world, may also be acquired from dealers or by trading. Some noted insect collections have been sold at [[auction]].&lt;ref name ="Murray S. Upton, 1997" &gt;"A rich and diverse [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] : the history of the [[Australian National Insect Collection]]; 1926–1991".

==In popular culture==
''[[Pokémon]]'' creator [[Satoshi Tajiri]]'s childhood hobby of insect collecting is the inspiration behind the popular video game series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inshorts.com/news/pokemon-inspired-from-creators-bug-collection-hobby-1468331005757 Pokémon inspired from creator’s bug collection hobby], inshorts&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences''' is a biennial conference discussing topics of [[Heraldry|heraldic]] and [[genealogy|genealogical]] interest. The Congress brings together scholars and other interested persons from all the nations of Europe and from many countries around the world. The first Congress was held in Barcelona in 1929; at the second Congress, held in 1953, it was decided that future meetings would be held every two years (there have been two exceptions).

Memorable 22nd Congress held in Ottawa in 1996 ''"for the first time beyond the birthplace of modern scientific studies in genealogy and heraldry"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.press.uottawa.ca/book/genealogica-heraldica |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714215501/http://www.press.uottawa.ca/book/genealogica-heraldica |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }} {{ISBN|978-0-7766-0472-5}} Boudreau,Claire.Vachon,Auguste.Cogné,Daniel.''"Genealogica &amp; Heraldica .Proceedings of the 22nd International Congress of Genealogical and heraldic Sciences in Ottawa from August 18 to 23,1996 .Message from his Excellency the Right Honourable Roméo LeBlanc, Governor of Canada,Patron of the 22nd Congress"''. p.21&lt;/ref&gt; had Honourable [[Roméo LeBlanc]], [[Governor General of Canada]] and his wife Her Excellency Mrs [[Diana Fowler LeBlanc]] as its patrons.The 2006 congress in [[St. Andrews]], had [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] as its patron, and the 2008 congress in Quebec City had [[Michaëlle Jean]], [[Governor General of Canada]] as its patron.

The main themes of the Congresses have changed greatly over the years, and some disciplines have ceased to form any part of the Congresses' study. Abandoned subjects include [[sphragistics]] and [[iconography]], which were dealt with at Paris, and [[vexillology]], which was to have been one of the themes at Congresses after Bern. [[Genetics]], which had been a subject of discussion at Stockholm in 1960, did not reappear until the Ottawa Congress of 1996. [[chivalry|Chivalric orders]] were another discarded subject, despite featuring in the congresses held at Rome/Naples, Madrid, Stockholm and Edinburgh, as well as in a few papers presented at Madrid in 1982.

[[Image:Monte Cassino Opactwo 1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The restored abbey at Monte Cassino]]
'''Johannes Hymonides''', known as '''John the Deacon of Rome''' (d. between 876 and 882), was a [[deacon]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]]. Few details are known of his life: after the death of [[Pope Nicholas I|St Nicholas I]], he was briefly exiled from Rome at the behest of the emperor [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II]], but was recalled by [[Pope Hadrian II|Adrian II]]. Possessed of considerable learning, he was closely associated with [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius|Anastasius]], Librarian of the Roman Church (died 879).

At the instance of [[Pope John VIII]] (872-82), John wrote a [[biography|life]] of [[Pope Gregory I|St. Gregory the Great]], making use of the works of this [[pope]] and above all of extracts made at an earlier date from the pope's letters in the [[Vatican Secret Archives|archives of the Roman Church]]. The work is divided into four books: in the first he gives an account of the life of Gregory up to the time of his [[pope|pontificate]]; in the second, of his activities as pope; in the third, of his teachings; and in the fourth, of his progress in [[perfection]]. The life was most recently edited by the [[Congregation of St. Maur|Maurists]].&lt;ref&gt;In vol. 4 of their edition of the ''opera omnia'' of Gregory the Great (1705, Paris). Reprinted in [[Patrologia Latina]] 75, 59-242. For a list of editions of the text, see L. Castaldi, ''Iohannes Hymmonides Diaconus Romanus. Vita Gregorii I Papae. I. La tradizione manoscritta'', 2004, Florence, 370-86.&lt;/ref&gt; For John VIII, John also composed in 876 an adaptation of the [[Cena Cypriani]].

John also intended to write a detailed [[History of Christianity|history of the Church]], and at his request the aforesaid Anastasius compiled a history in three parts (''tripartita'') from Greek sources for the use of John, whose purpose, however, was never executed. On the invitation of Bishop [[Gaudericus of Velletri]] (867-79), he undertook to re-edit the ''Gesta Clementis'', a life of [[Pope Clement I]] (died about end of the 1st century), but did not live to finish the work, which Gaudericus undertook to complete, though it never appeared in full. 

A letter from [[John the Deacon (Church of Rome)|a certain Johannes Diaconus]] to Senarius, "[[vir illustris]]", treats of the ceremonies of [[baptism]]; it is not however, the work of the John treated here, but of an older deacon of this name.&lt;ref&gt;ed. ''P.L.'', LIX, 399-408.&lt;/ref&gt; The short [[exegesis|commentary]] on the [[Heptateuch]] based on [[Church Fathers|patristic]] sources in  [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] manuscript Lat. 12309 is also no longer attributed to John.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3233">[[Image:Becker 1885 2.jpg|right|thumb|Two pages from Becker's "Weltgeschichte" (1885 edition)]]
'''Karl Friedrich Becker''' (11 March 1777 – 15 March 1806) was a German [[educator]] and [[historian]]. His most noted work was ''World History for Children and Teachers of Children'' ({{lang-de|Weltgeschichte für Kinder und Kinderlehrer}}) which was widely used and much edited and revised by other noted historians after Becker's death.

==Biography==
Becker was a native of [[Berlin]]. He studied history and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Halle]], and after finishing his studies, worked as a tutor in [[Cottbus]]. From 1798 to 1800 he was a schoolteacher in [[Berlin]], but due to poor health had to resign from teaching and devote his time to literary and historical work. Becker died on 15 March 1806 at the age of 29. His grave is preserved in the [[Protestant]] ''Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde'' (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of [[Jerusalem's Church]] and [[Deutscher Dom|New Church]]) in [[Kreuzberg|Berlin-Kreuzberg]], south of [[Hallesches Tor (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hallesches Tor]].

==Works==
Becker is remembered today as author of the nine-volume ''Weltgeschichte für Kinder und Kinderlehrer''. This work was published in Berlin between 1801 and 1805, and after his death was continued, edited and revised by numerous authors. Karl Ludwig Woltmann added a tenth volume, and Karl Adolf Menzel two more. [[Wilhelm Adolf Schmidt]]'s edition of 1860-67 contains 20 volumes, including [[Karl Eduard Arnd]]'s ''Geschichte der letzten vierzig Jahre'' and its continuations to 1867. The same author's ''Geschichte der Jahre 1867-1871'' (1st vol., 1872) also served as a supplement. [[Johann Wilhelm Löbell]] was an editor. Though gaining in fullness and accuracy, the revisions lost something of the charm of Becker's original presentation.

Other publications by Becker include:
* ''Tales from history for young people'' ({{lang-de|Erzählungen aus der Alten Welt für die Jugend}}; 3 vols., 1801-1803, Halle; 4th vol. by Günther, 1842, containing ''Die Perserkriege''; 9th and revised ed. by Eckstein, 1857; later edition by [[Hermann Masius]], 1873)
* ''Poetry from the Viewpoint of the Historian'' ({{lang-de|Die Dichtkunst aus dem Gesichtspunkt des Historikers}}; Berlin, 1803)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11968">This is a '''list of German far-right periodicals (post-1945)'''. In post-[[World War II]] Germany, after the defeat of the [[Nazis]] and [[Nazi Germany]], the far-right was outlawed by the Allied occupation forces, preventing political continuity of the [[Nazi Party]] in a new, post-war form. In [[West Germany]], reformed far-right parties were able to reestablish a foot hold in the [[Bundestag|national parliament]] in the early years of the new Federal Republic, courtesy in part to the post-war issues the new country faced. With the recovery of the German economy, the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'', the far-right declined in appeal. The far-right, from the 1960s, was characterised by fragmentation and infighting. Following the [[German reunification]], in the early 1990s, the far-right has regained strength and become more of a threat to the democratic Germany again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Stöss|date=12 September 2006|title=Geschichte des Rechtsextremismus|trans-title=History of the far-right|url=http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/rechtsextremismus/41907/geschichte-des-rechtsextremismus|language=German |work=[[Federal Agency for Civic Education]]|location= |access-date=1 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Hoser |date=|title=Rechtsextremismus|trans-title=The Far-right|url=https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/Rechtsextremismus#Rechtsextremismus_und_Herrschaft_des_Nationalsozialismus|language=German |work=[[Historisches Lexikon Bayerns]]|location= |access-date=1 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Germany]], a communist country, the far-right was declared extinct by the government despite the fact that a quarter of all members of the ruling communist party, in 1954, had formerly been members of the Nazi Party. Despite the official line, racism and far-right ideology existed and, towards the end of the country's existence in the late 1980s, increased. It was however swept under the carpet by the ruling authorities as ordinary violence and hooliganism rather than being allowed to be seen as a resurface of far-right ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bernd |last=Wagner|date=2 January 2018|title=Vertuschte Gefahr: Die Stasi &amp; Neonazis|trans-title=Hidden danger: The Stasi and Neo-Nazis|url=https://www.bpb.de/geschichte/deutsche-geschichte/stasi/218421/neonazis|language=German |work=[[Federal Agency for Civic Education]]|location= |access-date=1 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] classifies the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] ({{lang-de|Rechtsextremismus}}) as a movement against the equality of all people as guaranteed by the German constitution, and as enemies of the democratic nature of the German state. Their aim is to establish an authoritarian state, modelled on the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''. The far-right places undue value on race and ethnicity which results in xenophobia and racism. [[Antisemitism]] is a core principal of their ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rechtsextremismus|trans-title=The Far-right|url=https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/service/glossar/_lR#rechtsextremismus|language=German |work=[[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]]|location= |access-date=30 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Far-right publications generally glorify Germany's Nazi past and the armed forces of the era, the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]], offering historically revisionist publications and attempting to promote the myth of the ''[[Clean Wehrmacht]]'' and ''Clean Waffen-SS''. Far-right publisher are however careful to not out-rightly [[Holocaust denial|deny or trivialise]] [[the Holocaust]], this being a criminal offence in Germany, as many have been prosecuted for such offences in the past.&lt;ref name="Geschichte" /&gt;

The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, as of 2017, classifies three political parties as far-right, the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD), ''[[Die Rechte]]'' and [[Der III. Weg]], with a combined membership of 6,050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rechtsextremistische Parteien|trans-title=Far-right Parties|url=https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/arbeitsfelder/af-rechtsextremismus/zahlen-und-fakten-rechtsextremismus/rechtsextremistische-parteien-2017s|language=German |work=[[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]]|location= |access-date=30 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a small number of long-standing far-right newspapers and magazines have been published since the early 1950s, like the ''[[National Zeitung]]'' and ''[[Nation Europa]]'', while a larger number of publications have only existed for a short duration.&lt;ref name="Bdp" &gt;{{cite web |first=Gabriele|last=Nandlinger|date=25 May 2007|title=Rechtsextreme Schwarz-Weiß-Malerei - Ein kurzer Überblick über die tonangebenden rechtsextremen Printmedien|trans-title=Far-right black &amp; white vision: A short overview of the major far-right print medias|url=http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/rechtsextremismus/41714/rechtsextreme-schwarz-weiss-malerei?p=all|language=German |work=[[Federal Agency for Civic Education]]|location= |access-date=30 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pulp magazine ''[[Der Landser]]'', which existed for almost 60 years, glorified the German armed forces and omit the war crimes committed by Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS, without providing any historical context and was eventually terminated after a complaint by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]].&lt;ref name=cardw&gt;{{cite news|author=Carla Bleiker|title=Publishing house terminates German pulp mag 'Der Landser'|url=http://www.dw.de/publishing-house-terminates-german-pulp-mag-der-landser/a-16989362|accessdate=14 April 2015|work=Deutsche Welle|date=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The far-right print media in Germany is predominately organised in the ''{{ill|Gesellschaft für freie Publizistik|de}}'', GfP, the largest far-right association of publishers, authors and book sellers, which was formed by former SS officers and Nazi officials in 1960.&lt;ref name="Rand" /&gt; The number of far-right publishers in Germany independent of political parties has declined from 45 in 2001 to 30 in 2016.&lt;ref name="Geschichte" &gt;{{cite web |first=Thomas|last=Pfeiffer|date=19 December 2016|title=Das Kapillarsystem – Geschichte und Entwicklung der rechtsextremistischen Presse|trans-title=History and development of the far-right press|url=http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/rechtsextremismus/239223/geschichte-der-rechtsextremen-presse|language=German |work=[[Federal Agency for Civic Education]]|location= |access-date=1 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''North American archaeological periods ''' divides the history of [[pre-Columbian]] North America into a number of named successive eras or periods, from the earliest-known human habitation through to the early Colonial period which followed the [[European colonization of the Americas]].

==Stage classification==

One of the most enduring classifications of archaeological periods and cultures was established in [[Gordon Willey]] and [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]]' 1958 book ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology.'' They divided the archaeological record in the Americas into 5 phases, only three of which applied to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gordon R. Willey and Philip Phillips | title=Method and Theory in American Archaeology | publisher= University of Chicago Press| year=1957 | isbn=978-0-226-89888-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these divisions has diminished in most of North America due to the development of local classifications with more elaborate breakdowns of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeology of prehistoric native America: an encyclopedia|first1=Guy E|last1=Gibbon|first2=Kenneth M |last2=Ames|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|pages=638–639|isbn=0-8153-0725-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. The [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indians stage]] and/or [[Lithic stage]]
:2. The [[Archaic stage]]
:3. [[Formative stage]] or Post-archaic stage - At this point the North American classifications system differs from the rest of the Americas.

For more details on the five major stages, still used in Mesoamerican archaeology, see [[Mesoamerican chronology]] and [[Archaeology of the Americas]].

'''Mary Jane Katzmann''' (also known as, Mrs. William Lawson; [[sobriquet]], '''M. J. K.'''; January 15, 1828 – March 23, 1890) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] author, editor, historian, and poet. 

Katzmann published short poems from time to time, and afterwards became a regular contributor to various periodicals and newspapers, including the ''Colonist'', the ''Record'', and the ''Guardian''. For two years, she edited the ''Provincial Magazine'', one of the earliest of its kind published in Halifax. For this, she wrote "Tales of our Village,"—sketches of the early history of Dartmouth and Preston interwoven with local traditions. She invariably signed all she wrote with her initials, M. J. K., and by this sobriquet, became well known to all her friends.{{sfn|Lawson|1893|p=7-}}

She was married in 1869 to William Lawson, Esq., of Halifax, in which town she was then living. After her marriage, her time was largely given to work among the poor, and to social and benevolent schemes, particularly those connected with the [[Church of England]], of which she was a devoted member. She preserved to the end of her life that love for literary work which she had early displayed, and any event of interest in the community was sure to call forth sympathetic lines which were now signed with the initials M. J. K. L. In 1887, she obtained the Akins Historical Prize of [[University of King's College|King's College]], [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]], for her ''History of the, Townxhi* of Dartmouth, Preston, and Lawrencetown''. She died at Halifax, on Sunday, March 23, 1890, after several weeks of painful illness, leaving one child, a daughter.{{sfn|Lawson|1893|p=7-}}

==Early life and education==
Mary Jane Katzmann was born at "Maroon Hall" in [[Preston, Nova Scotia]], the second daughter of Mary Prescott and Lieutenant Christian Conrad Casper Katzmann.&lt;ref name=trees&gt;"[http://histfam.familysearch.org/getperson.php?personID=I8215&amp;tree=Kings Mary Jane Katzmann]," Family Search, CommunityTrees.org, Web, May 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, who was a native of [[Hanover, Germany]], came to Nova Scotia with H. M. 60th Regiment, or King's German Legion, in which he was a Lieutenant. earned a [[British Army]] commission in the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref name=dcbo&gt;"Lois K. Kernaghan, "[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5617&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=ychzfqkvzape Katzmann, Mary Jane (Lawson)]", Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, Web, May 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When he left the regiment, about 1822, he settled in Preston, where he resided until his death on December 15, 1843. Her mother was a Nova Scotian, a granddaughter of Dr. Jonathan Prescott, of Massachusetts, who came to Nova Scotia and settled there with other New England Loyalists. Through him the family claims relationship with the historian Prescott.{{sfn|Lawson|1893|p=7-}}

From a very early age, Katzmann showed unusual intelligence and signs of that love for literature which always characterized her. She could read at the age of three, and from that time devoured eagerly the limited number of books which were at her disposal in Maroon Hall. ''Scott's Tales of a Grandfather'' and ''Chambers Journal'' were her especial favourites. Owing to the remoteness of the country district in which she lived, educational advantages were few; and, save for the help given by her own family, she was almost entirely self-taught.&lt;ref name=dcbo/&gt; Her quickness of perception and wonderful memory no doubt compensated to a great extent for the lack of other advantages.led there with other New England Loyalists. Through him the family claims relationship with the historian Prescott.{{sfn|Lawson|1893|p=7-}}

==Career==
In 1845, her poetry came to the attention of [[Joseph Howe]], who praised it in his "Nights with the Muses" column in ''The Nova Scotian.''&lt;ref name=answers/&gt; Between 1848 and 1851, Katzmann published a large amount of verse in the ''[[Halifax Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=answers&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/topic/mary-jane-katzmann Mary Jane Katzmann]," ''Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature'', Answers.com, Web, May 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1852, she became editor of ''The Provincial,'' a new literary journal,&lt;ref name=answers/&gt; "and under her expert guidance it became possibly the best of the early Nova Scotian periodicals. The format and printing were superior, and the quality of the contributions was commendable.... Katzmann tailored her publication to attract a wide audience, both male and female; she also strove to include articles of regional origin rather than selected reprints."&lt;ref name=dcbo/&gt;

The magazine "was well received by its readers but sufficient subscriptions were not forthcoming, and publication ceased with the December 1853 issue. Nothing further is known of the editor until 1866, when she was operating the Provincial Bookstore in Halifax."&lt;ref name=dcbo/&gt;

In 1869, Katzmann married Halifax businessman William Lawson.&lt;ref name=answers/&gt; She turned over the bookstore to her sister, and became a proper non-working Victorian wife (though she continued to write). She spent much time on "charitable and social causes, particularly those associated with the Church of England."&lt;ref name=dcbo/&gt; They had one daughter.

Lawson worked a series she had written in the ''Provincial'', "Tales of Our Village,"&lt;ref&gt;Annie Innis Dagg, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJwyLyaT9KYC&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lawson, Mary Jane Katzmann]," ''The Feminine Gaze: A Canadian compendium of non-fiction women authors and their books, 1836-1945'' (Wilfrid Laurier U P, 2001), 165, Google Books, Web, May 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; into the book, ''History of the Townships of Dartmouth, Preston and Lawrencetown, Halifax County, N.S.'', for which she won the Akins Historical Prize from King's College in 1887.

She died of [[cancer]] in Halifax in 1890.&lt;ref name=answers/&gt;

Her two books, ''Frankincense and Myrrh'' (a collection of her poetry) and ''History of the Townships of Dartmouth, Preston, and Lawrencetown, Halifax County, N.S.''," were published posthumously in 1893, edited by poet Constance Fairbanks and historian [[Harry Piers]].

==Writing==
"As a poet Katzmann was prone to generalities, melodramatic effects, and dull religious and moral didacticism — characteristics that mark the verse of contemporary ‘female poets’ in Britain and the United States upon whom she patterned herself," says the ''Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature'', "but she was always technically competent, at her best when writing descriptive verse or charming song-like lyrics."&lt;ref name="answers"/&gt;

''The [[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] (DCBO)'' calls her prize-winning historical study, ''History of the Townships of Dartmouth, Preston and Lawrencetown, Halifax County, N.S.'', "her enduring contribution to Canadian literature. Although it relies heavily on description and anecdote, and reads much like a Victorian travelogue, the book nevertheless reveals a fine sense of historical detail and comprehension." As well, "although it can in no way be compared to a modern sociological study, it does convey, in a fashion which many early regional histories lack, a colourful sense of the people and the times."&lt;ref name="dcbo"/&gt;

==Recognition==
The ''DCBO'' says of Katzmann's career: "In an age when women accomplished little beyond the circle of home and charity, her success, although limited to the provincial sphere, was threefold: as the capable and youthful editor of a successful, if short-lived, periodical, as an able businesswoman in a circle dominated by male initiative, and as one of the first native Nova Scotian women to achieve literary recognition, and certainly the first to make an enduring impression."&lt;ref name=dcbo/&gt;

The phrase '''''more danico'''''&lt;ref&gt;The rules of English spelling often result in the proper noun being capitalized, but this is not present in the Latin.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Medieval Latin]] legal expression which may be translated as "in the [[Danes|Danish]] manner", i.e. under [[Medieval Scandinavian law|Medieval Scandinavian]] [[custom (law)|customary law]]". It designates a type of traditional [[marriage]] practiced in northern Europe during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;"The ''mos Danicus'' with regard to marriage or concubinage, or rather with regard to some third state between marriage and concubinage, is often mentioned in the Norman history of the time." Freeman, p. 624.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Danish" formerly meant "[[Norsemen|Norse]]" (cf. [[Danish tongue]]).

== The institution ==
The examples that have come down to us involve powerful rulers in a union with a highborn woman of somewhat lesser rank. Rarely, it occurred to legitimize an abduction, as with [[Rollo]] and [[Poppa of Bayeux|Poppa]], who was taken after a battle at [[Bayeux]]; but this is not a defining characteristic. While [[Roman law]] had not distinguished between [[elopement (marriage)|elopement]] and [[bride kidnapping]] (both being ''raptus in parentes''), the distinction was significant in Germanic law. Still, according to Reynolds, the consent of the ''parentes'' was required in the ''more danico'' case. This consent could still be obtained after the fact, if an elopement was involved.

{{quote|It is possible, therefore, that marriage ''more danico'' was neither informal marriage nor even legitimized abduction, but simply secular marriage contracted in accordance with Germanic law, rather than ecclesiastical marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word "secular" here should not be interpreted to mean that no context of Germanic religion was involved. Although the form of any ritual that might have been employed is unknown, it is sometimes assumed that it was a type of [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Thrupp, pp. 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

''More danico'' permitted [[polygyny]] (serial or simultaneous), but is not synonymous with it. The "putting away" of a ''more danico'' wife could apparently be done at the mere wish of the husband; the rights of the wife are unclear. Often the putting away was done with the intention of marrying a still higher-ranking woman ''more christiano''; but since there are numerous instances of the husband returning to the ''more danico'' wife, it is possible that the relationship had merely been deactivated or kept in the background. The union could also be fully dissolved, so that the wife was free to marry another man. Her consent in the matter may or may not have been required; again, the consensual aspect is unknown. (See [[More danico#Historical examples|below]].)

By tradition and customary law, the children of such a relationship were in no way considered of lesser rank or disadvantaged with respect to inheritance. Many sons ''more danico'' went on to become dukes or kings by succession or conquest.

Increasingly discouraged by the Christian Church, the practice gradually died out. Proponents of the [[Friedelehe]] theory claimed that the institution left a vestige in the institution of [[morganatic marriage]], but this interpretation is now discredited {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

== Status of Germanic marriages in a Christian society ==
{{quote|In the middle and north of France, where there was less Roman law in the customary law, Roman law was not accepted in bulk or as authoritative in itself; but it influenced the customary law.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Osborn Taylor. ''The Classical Heritage of the Middle Ages'', pp. 66-67. Third edition. New York: The MacMillan Company, 1911. Available online [https://books.google.com/books?id=OFsMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67 here.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was not until the nation consciousness of the western nations was well developed and national laws were codified that it became the norm that all persons in a country were to be subject to the same law. Previously, each man was held accountable according to the laws of his own people.
{{quote|In France in the course of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries the old Germanic principle of the personality of the law, that is, of law as applicable to persons according to their race, had given way to the principle of territoriality, that is, of law as valid within a certain country.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By accepting baptism and vassalage under a Christian prince under [[Charles the Simple]] after the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]] in 911, Rollo had placed the [[Vikings]] of [[Normandy]] on the inevitable path of Christianization; but they clung to some old customs.

There was a perennial political tension between canon law and the traditional law. The Church deprecated this type of traditional union, employing the terms "bastardy" and "concubinage". On a purely political level, temporal rulers of more fully Christianized entities did not ignore the advantage of denigrating their enemies in moral terms with respect to their marriage customs.

The instrumentality of Christian clergy at a marriage ceremony was not specifically required by the Church until the [[Council of Trent]] on November 11, 1563.

== Historical examples ==
The [[Rome|Roman]] [[ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Tacitus]] writing in his ''[[De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' described the customs of the Germanic tribes and praised their [[monogamy]]. However, by the [[Viking Age]] they had acquired a reputation for their [[polygyny]].

Speaking of the [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Adam von Bremen]] said: {{quote|For every man has two or three or more women at the same time, according to the extent of his power; the rich and the rulers have more than they can count.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Norman chronicler William of Jumieges uses the term explicitly to refer to two relationships:

* [[Rollo]], founder of the Norman dynasty, had taken captive at Bayeux, [[Poppa of Bayeux|Poppa]], daughter of a count, Berengar. [[Dudo of Saint-Quentin]] relates that they had been joined in marriage ("''connubium''"), William of Jumieges describing that Rollo had joined himself to her by ''more danico''. She was mother of his son [[William I, Duke of Normandy|William Longsword]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B3m9MzLojtIC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=Poppa+of+Bayeux+more+danico&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J3wZT-f_L8Si4gSSu-jyDQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Poppa%20of%20Bayeux%20more%20danico&amp;f=false Philip Lyndon Reynolds: Marriage in the Western Church: the Christianization of marriage during the Patristic and Early Medieval Periods (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is related that he put Poppa aside to marry [[Gisela of France|Gisela]], daughter of [[Charles the Simple]], and that when Gisela died, he returned to Poppa. However, the absence of any record of this royal princess or her marriage in Frankish sources suggests the entire supposed marriage to Gisela may be apocryphal.
* William Longsword in his turn, had a son and heir by a woman whose name is given as Sprota. William of Jumieges reports that Longsword was bound to her pursuant to the ''mos danicus'' ("''danico more iuncta''").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B3m9MzLojtIC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=Poppa+of+Bayeux+more+danico&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J3wZT-f_L8Si4gSSu-jyDQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Poppa%20of%20Bayeux%20more%20danico&amp;f=false Philip Lyndon Reynolds: Marriage in the Western Church: the Christianization of marriage during the Patristic and Early Medieval Periods (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Flodoard]] refers to her simply as Longsword's 'Breton concubine' ("''concubina britanna''").&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbaldw.home.mindspring.com/hproject/prov/sprot000.htm Stewart Baldwin, Henry Project: "Sprota"].&lt;/ref&gt; William would formally marry [[Luitgarde of Vermandois]], daughter of Heribert II, count of Vermandois. [Dudo iii, 32 (p.&amp;nbsp;70)], who following William's death remarried to Thibaut, count of Blois. Sprota, who was mother of Longsword's heir, [[Richard I, Duke of Normandy]], is said to have been forced to become concubine of Esperleng, the rich owner of several mills, by whom she became mother of [[Rodulf of Ivry]], although it is unclear if this occurred at the time of William's marriage to Luitgarde, or at his death.

Modern historians have applied the term to various irregular or polygynous unions formed by several other monarchs of the Viking age, including [[Harald Fairhair]], [[Canute the Great]], [[Harold Godwinson]] and [[Cerball mac Dúnlainge]].

== The Latin phrase ==
Known to us from the histories of [[William of Jumièges]] and [[Orderic Vitalis]], the purport of the phrase ''more danico'' is based in both the historical context, as well as in the meaning of the words within the fabric of the Latin language and the underlying [[Old Norse]].

Orderic Vitalis spoke [[Old English]] until the age of ten, when he was forced to adopt [[Norman French]]; he wrote in a stilted, but fluent and educated [[Medieval Latin]]. In the vernacular he would have spoken of the custom as ''danesche manere'' (Norman French), as would William of Jumièges, who was Norman, but also wrote in Latin.

=== More ===
''More'' "by custom" is the [[ablative]] case of the Latin word for "manner", the [[nominative|subject form]] being ''mos'' (cf. ''[[More judaico]]'', "according to Jewish custom").&lt;ref&gt;Hence the pedantic ''mos danicus'' of the Victorian historian, e.g. [[William Augustus Freeman]].&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Lewis &amp; Short]]'s ''Latin Dictionary'', the semantic range of the Latin word ''mos'' is elongated along the axis of ''arbitrary↔required'', extending from "wont" or "caprice" on the one end, to "law" or "precept" on the other end:

* I. "Manner, custom, way, usage, practice, fashion, wont, as determined not by the laws, but by men's will and pleasure, humor, self-will, caprice." ''[[O tempora o mores!]]'' "Oh what times, what fashions! ([[Cicero]]).
* II. "The will as a rule for action, custom, usage, practice, wont, habit" ''Leges mori serviunt.'' "Laws serve custom." ([[Plautus]]).
* III. In an archaic or poetic sense, and in post-Augustinian (that is, Mediaeval) Latin: "A precept, law, rule." ''[[Mos maiorum]]''. The (unwritten) [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]].

Thus the term ''mos/mor-'' captures the ambiguity between the official Christian view of the practice as a despicable and self-indulgent "fashion", on the one hand, and the Germanic institution sanctioned by ancient traditional "law", on the other hand (cf. [[Marriage 'à la façon du pays'|Marriage ''à la façon du pays'']], "marriage according to local custom").

=== Danico ===
During the [[Viking Age]], the essentially tribal entities that became the modern [[Scandinavia]]n nations differed in some customs, but had a concept of themselves as a unity. For example, according to the [[Gray Goose Laws]] of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] recorded in 1117, Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders and Danes spoke the same language, using ''dǫnsk tunga'' or ''dansk tunga'' ("Danish tongue") or ''norrønt mál'' ("Nordic language") to name their language, [[Old Norse]]. Here "dansk" meant "Norse". Furthermore,''more danico'' (Danish ''efter dansk skik'') was not merely a "Norse custom", but prevalent among other Germanic peoples such as the [[Franks]] (see [[More danico#Frankish|above]]).

{{quote|Rollo died in 927, and was succeeded by his son William "Long Sword," born of his union ''more danico'' with Poppa, daughter of count Berenger; he showed some attachment to the Scandinavian language, for he sent his son William to Bayeux to learn Norse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Normandy |display=Normandy # History |volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is also worth noting that [[Rollo]], founder of the Norman dynasty, is claimed as Norwegian in the Norse sagas,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. the [[Orkneyinga saga]] and the [[Historia Norwegiæ]]&lt;/ref&gt; but as Danish by [[William of Jumièges]].

'''Movses Khorenatsi''' (ca. 410–490s AD; {{lang-hy|[[wikt:Մովսես|Մովսես]] [[wikt:խորենացի|Խորենացի]]}}, {{IPA-hy|mɔfˈsɛs χɔɾɛnɑˈtsʰi|pron}}, also written as ''Movsēs Xorenac‘i'' and '''Moses of Khoren''', '''Moses of Chorene''', and '''Moses Chorenensis''' in Latin sources) was a prominent [[Armenia]]n historian from the period of [[Late Antiquity]] and the author of the ''[[History of Armenia (book)|History of Armenia]]''.

Khorenatsi is credited with the earliest known historiographical work on the [[history of Armenia]] written in Armenian, but was also a [[poet]], or [[hymnodist|hymn writer]], and a [[Philology|grammarian]]. The ''History of Armenia'' was written at the behest of Prince [[Sahak II Bagratuni|Sahak]] of the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] and has had an enormous impact on Armenian historiography. It was used and quoted extensively by later medieval Armenian authors. Although other Armenians such as [[Agathangelos]] had previously written histories on Armenia, Movses' work holds particular significance because it contains unique material on the old oral traditions in Armenia before its conversion to Christianity and, more importantly, traces Armenian history from Movses' day back to its origins.

Khorenatsi is considered to be the "father of Armenian history" (''patmahayr''), and is sometimes referred to as the "Armenian [[Herodotus]]."&lt;ref name="byzantinoslavica112"&gt;To Hellēnikon: Byzantinoslavica, Armeniaca, Islamica, the Balkans and modern Greece.

London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2001, p. 181 {{ISBN|0-7007-1452-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Khorenatsi's work became the first attempt of a universal history of Armenia.&lt;ref name="byzantinoslavica112" /&gt;

Movses identified himself as a young disciple of [[Mesrop Mashtots]], inventor of the [[Armenian alphabet]], and is recognized by the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] as one of the [[Holy Translators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Giusto Traina|Traina, Giusto]]. "Մովսես Խորենացու «Դասական» Ավանդության Հայոց Պատմության Ա գրքի 5-րդ գլուխին մեջ" ("The 'Classical' Tradition of Movses Khorenatsi in Chapter 5 of Book I in the ''History of Armenians''"). ''[[Patma-Banasirakan Handes]]'' 134 (1992), pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Movses' biographical details are given at the very end of the ''History of the Armenians'' but additional information provided by later medieval Armenian historians have allowed modern scholars to piece together additional information on him. Movses was believed to have been born in the village of Khorni (also spelled as Khoron and Khoronk) in the Armenian province of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] or [[Turuberan]] sometime in 410.&lt;ref&gt;For this reason, some have also referred to him as Movses of Taron.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars contend that if he was born here, he would have then been known as Movses of '''Khorneh''' or '''Khoron'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Stepan Malkhasyants|Malkhasyants, Stepan]]. "Introduction" in Movses Khorenatsi's ''Հայոց Պատմություն, Ե Դար'' [History of the Armenians, 5th Century]. [[Gagik Sargsyan|Gagik Kh. Sargsyan]] (ed.) Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1997, p. 7. {{ISBN|5-540-01192-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They instead move the location of his birth from Taron to the Armenian [[Syunik Province|province of Syunik]], in the village of Khorena in the region of Harband.&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his education in Syunik' and was later sent to be taught under the auspices of [[Mesrop Mashtots]],&lt;ref&gt;Great historians from antiquity to 1800: an international dictionary, by Lucian Boia, 1989 – 417 pages, P. 9&lt;/ref&gt; the creator of the [[Armenian alphabet]], and [[Catholicos]] [[Isaac of Armenia|Sahak Partev]]. In having considerable difficulty translating the [[Bible]] from Greek to Armenian, Mesrop and Sahak felt the need to send Movses and several of their other students to [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], at that time the center of education and learning, so that they themselves learn the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Syriac language]]s, as well as [[grammar]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Gagik Sargsyan|Sargsyan, Gagik Kh]]. «Մովսես Խորենացի» [Movses Khorenatsi]. [[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1982, vol. viii, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Armenia ===
The students left Armenia sometime between 432 and 435. First they went to [[Edessa]] where they studied at the local libraries. Then they moved towards Jerusalem and Alexandria. After studying in Alexandria for five to six years, Movses and his classmates returned to Armenia, only to find that Mesrop and Sahak had died. Movses expressed his grief in a [[lament]] at the end of ''History of the Armenians'':
{{quotation|While they [Mesrop and Sahak] awaited our return to celebrate their student’s accomplishments [i.e., Movses’], we hastened from [[Constantinople|Byzantium]], expecting that we would be dancing and singing at a wedding...and instead, I found myself grieving at the foot of our teachers' graves...I did not even arrive in time to see their eyes close nor hear them speak their final words.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Movses Khorenatsi. ''Հայոց Պատմություն, Ե Դար'' [History of the Armenians, 5th Century], Annotated translation and commentary by Stepan Malkhasyants. Gagik Kh. Sargsyan (ed.) Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1997, 3.68, p. 276. {{ISBN|5-540-01192-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
To further complicate their problems, the atmosphere in Armenia that Movses and the other students had returned to was one that was extremely hostile and they were viewed at with contempt by the native population. While later Armenian historians blamed this on an ignorant populace, Persian ideology and policy also lay at fault, since its rulers "could not tolerate highly educated young scholars fresh from Greek centers of learning."&lt;ref&gt;Hacikyan, Agop Jack, Gabriel Basmajian, Edward S. Franchuk, and Nourhan Ouzounian. ''The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the Oral Tradition to the Golden Age, Vol. I''. Detroit: Wayne State University, 2000, p. 307. {{ISBN|0-8143-2815-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this atmosphere and persecution by the Persians, Movses went into hiding in a village near [[Vagharshapat]] and lived in relative seclusion for several decades.

[[File:Moses of Chorene.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Movses depicted in a 14th-century Armenian manuscript.]]
Gyut, [[Catholicos of All Armenians]] (461–471), one day met Movses while traveling through the area and, unaware of his true identity, invited him to supper with several of his students. Movses was initially silent, but after Gyut's students encouraged him to speak, Movses made a marvelous speech at the dinner table. One of the Catholicos' students was able to identify Movses as a person Gyut had been searching for; it was soon understood that Gyut was one of Movses' former classmates and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Gyut embraced Movses and, being either a [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian Christian]], or, at least, tolerant of them (since Movses was also Chalcedonian), brought his friend back from seclusion and appointed him to be a bishop in Bagrevan.

=== ''History of the Armenians'' ===
Serving as a bishop, Movses was approached by Prince Sahak Bagratuni (died in 482 during Charmana battle against Persian army), who, having heard of Movses' reputation, asked him to write a history of the Armenians, especially the biographies of Armenian kings and the origins of the Armenian ''[[nakharar]]'' families.&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian historian Artashes Matevosyan placed Movses' completion of ''History'' to the year {{CE|474}} based on his research on the ''Chronicle'' by the sixth century Armenian historian Atanas Taronatsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Matevosyan, Artashes S. "Մովսես Խորենացին և Աթանաս Տարոնացու Ժամանակագրությունը" [Movses Khorenatsi and Atanas Taronatsi's ''Chronicle''] ''Patma-Banasirakan Handes'' 124 (1989), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his primary reasons for taking up Sahak Bagratuni's request is given in the first part of ''Patmutyun Hayots'', or ''History of the Armenians'': "For even though we are small and very limited in numbers and have been conquered many times by foreign kingdoms, yet too, many acts of bravery have been performed in our land, worthy of being written and remembered, but of which no one has bothered to write down."&lt;ref&gt;Movses Khorenatsi. ''History of the Armenians'', 1.4, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is a first historical record that covered the whole history of Armenia from a very ancient period until the death of the historian. His ''History'' served as a textbook to study the history of Armenia until the eighteenth century. Movses' history also gives a rich description of the oral traditions that were popular among the Armenians of the time, such as the romance story of ''[[Satenik|Artashes and Satenik]]'' and the birth of the god [[Vahagn]]. Movses lived for several more years, and he died sometime in the late {{CE|490s}}.

== Literary influence ==
Three possible early references to Movses in other sources are usually identified. The first one is in [[Ghazar Parpetsi]]’s ''History of the Armenians'' (about 500 A.D.), where the author details the persecution of several notable Armenian individuals, including the “blessed Movses the philosopher,” identified by some scholars as Movses Khorenatsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Hasratyan, Morus. “Որ՞ն է Մովսես Խորենացու ծննդավայրը.” [Where was Movses Khorenatsi’s Birthplace?] ''Lraber Hasarakakan Gituyunneri'' 12 (1969), pp. 81–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{hy icon}} Hovhannisyan, Petros. "Review of ''History of the Armenians''." ''Banber Yerevani Hamalsarani''. 45 (1982), pp. 237–239.&lt;/ref&gt; But there is no indication in Parpetsi that this Movses had "composed any historical works."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert W. Thomson|Thomson, Robert W.]] "Introduction" in Moses Khorenats'i. ''History of the Armenians''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, p. 3. {{ISBN|0-674-39571-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second one is the ''Book of Letters'' (sixth century), which contains a short theological treatise by "Movses Khorenatsi."&lt;ref&gt;Brock, S. P. "Review of ''The Incarnation: a study of the doctrine of the Incarnation in the Armenian Church in the 5th and 6th centuries according to the Book of Letters''." ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 46 (1983), pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this treatise, not being an historical work, cannot be convincingly attributed to the historian Movses.&lt;ref name="Mahe 13"&gt;{{fr icon}} See Annie and [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]]'s introduction to their translation of Moïse de Khorène ''Histoire de l'Arménie''. Paris: Gallimard, 1993, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The third possible early reference is in a tenth-eleventh centuries manuscript containing a list of dates attributed to Athanasius (Atanas) of Taron (sixth century): under the year 474, the list has "Moses of Chorene, philosopher and writer." This mention is, however, considered as too uncertain.&lt;ref name="Mahe 13" /&gt;

== Authorship study ==
{{Main|History of Armenia (book)}}

=== Hypercritical phase ===
Beginning in the nineteenth century, as a part of a general trend in those years to reexamine critically the validity of classical sources, Movses' ''History'' was cast into doubt. The conclusions reached by [[Alfred von Gutschmid]] ushered in the "[[Historical method|hypercritical]] phase"&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]]'s review of Aram Topchyan's ''The Problem of the Greek Sources of Movsēs Xorenac‘i's History of Armenia'', in ''[[Revue des Études Arméniennes]]'' 30 (2005–2007), p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Traina, Giusto. "Moïse de Khorène et l'Empire sassanide," in Rika Gyselen (ed.), ''Des Indo-Grecs aux Sassanides: Données pour l'histoire et la géographie historique''. Peeters Publishers, 2007,  p. 158. {{ISBN|978-2-9521376-1-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the study of Movses' work. Many European and Armenian scholars writing at the turn of the twentieth century reduced its importance as a historical source and dated the ''History'' to sometime in the seventh to ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Topchyan, Aram. ''The Problem of the Greek Sources of Movsēs Xorenacʻi's History of Armenia''. Leuven: Peeters Publishers, 2006, pp. 5–14, notes 21–22, 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stepan Malkhasyants]], an Armenian philologist and expert of [[Classical Armenian]] literature, likened this early critical period from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries to a "competition," whereby one scholar attempted to outperform the other in their criticism of Movses.&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', pp. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern studies ===
In the early decades of the twentieth century, scholars such as [[F. C. Conybeare]], [[Manuk Abeghian]], and [[Stepan Malkhasyants]] rejected the conclusions of the scholars of the hypercritical school. Ethnographic and archaeological research during this time confirmed information which was found only in Movses' work and supported their view to move back the dating to the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hacikyan et al. ''Heritage of Armenian Literature'', pp. 305–306.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Earlier critical points were revived&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Aram Toptchyan. "Moïse de Khorène" in Claude Mutafian (ed.), ''Arménie, la magie de l'écrit''. Somogy, 2007, p. 143. {{ISBN|978-2-7572-0057-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the second half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]]. "On the Date of Pseudo-Moses of Chorene." ''[[Handes Amsorya]]'' 75 (1961), pp. 467–471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', pp. 3–5, 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[Robert W. Thomson]], the former holder of the chair in Armenian Studies at [[Harvard University]] and the translator of several classical Armenian works, claimed that Movses' account contained various anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Robert W.

{{quotation|If so, how does one explain then Moses’s complete preoccupation with the events preceding A.D. 440 and his silence regarding the events leading up the Arab incursions and occupation of Armenia between 640–642? Moreover, if the definite purpose of the ''History'' was for “boosting the reputation of the Bagratuni family” then these events should have been central theme of his history; the skilful handling of which brought the Bagratid pre-eminence.... The ecclesiastical interests do not point to the eighth century. There is no echo of the [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian controversy]] which engaged the Armenians from 451 to 641 when the ecclesiastical unity formulated by the council of Theodosiopolis was renounced.&lt;ref name=VN /&gt;}}

[[Gagik Sargsyan]], an Armenian scholar of the [[Classics]] and a leading biographer of Movses, also admonished Thomson for anachronistic hypercriticism and for stubbornly rehashing and "even exaggerating the statements once put forward" by the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century scholars, and in particular, by Grigor Khalatyants (1858–1912).&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian, Gaguik [Gagik Kh. Sargsyan]. ''The "History of Armenia" by Movses Khorenatzi'', trans. by Gourgen A. Gevorkian. Yerevan: Yerevan University Press, 1991, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Sargsyan noted that Thomson, in condemning Movses' failure to mention his sources, ignored the fact that "an antique or medieval author may have had his own rules of mentioning the sources distinct from the rules of modern scientific ethics."&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian. ''"History of Armenia" by Movses Khorenatzi'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson's allegation of Movses' [[plagiarism]] and supposed distortion of sources was also countered by scholars who contended that Thomson was "treating a medieval author with the standards" of twentieth century [[historiography]] and pointed out that numerous classical historians, Greek and Roman alike, engaged in the same practice.&lt;ref name=VN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian. ''"History of Armenia" by Movses Khorenatzi'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Aram Topchyan, a Research Fellow at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] of Armenian Studies, concurred with this observation, and noted that it was odd that Thomson would fault Movses for failing to mention his sources because this was an accepted practice among all classical historians.&lt;ref&gt;Topchyan. ''Problem of the Greek Sources'', pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khorenatsi's work is recognized as an important source for the research of [[Urartu|Urartian]] and early Armenian history.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, Arthur. ''The Encyclopedia of Ancient Civilizations''. 1980, p. 117. "It is interesting that Moses Khorenatsi, writing in the eighth century and regarded as the father of Armenian history, indicates his awareness of elements of continuity between Urartian and Armenian history."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovskiĭ, Boris B. ''The Ancient Civilization of Urartu''. New York: Cowles Book Co., 1969, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Konstantine Hovhannisyan|Hovhannisyan, Konstantine]]. ''Erebooni''. Yerevan: Hayastan Pub.

'''Near Eastern Archaeology''' (sometimes known as '''Middle Eastern archaeology''') is a regional branch of the wider, global discipline of [[archaeology]]. It refers generally to the excavation and study of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[material culture]] of the [[Near East]] from antiquity to the recent past.

==Definition==
The description "Near Eastern" for this branch of archaeology is, of course, highly Eurocentric and Americocentric, reflecting the origins and growth of the field in Western academic traditions. However, in the absence of better solutions, and the continued heavy involvement of Western academics, the term has taken hold and remains in frequent use.

The definition of the Near East is usually based on the [[Fertile Crescent]]; the region between the Nile Valley (modern [[Egypt]]) and Mesopotamia (modern [[Iraq]]). Also usually included are [[Iran]], the [[Arabian peninsula]] and its islands, Anatolia (modern-day [[Turkey]]), [[Cyprus]] and [[North Africa]] west of Egypt. The history of archaeological investigation in this region grew out of the 19th century discipline of [[Biblical archaeology]], efforts mostly by Europeans to uncover evidence for [[Bible|Biblical]] ([[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments) narratives. Much archaeological work in this region is still influenced by that discipline, although within the last three decades there has been a marked tendency by some archaeologists to dissociate their work from Biblical frameworks.

Near Eastern Archaeology is a term with a wide, often generalised application, and is frequently divided into further regional sub-branches, the archaeology of modern states in the region or along broad thematic lines. Regions can be loosely defined, but are often based on recognizable entities that evidence cultural cohesion and coincide with topographical zones. Scholars may differ on the way the region is divided. Regional divisions also may change from period to period.

The most common fields of study are [[Biblical archaeology]] dealing with the region and history of the [[Bible]]; [[Assyriology]] dealing with [[Mesopotamia]]; [[Egyptology]] dealing with the ancient history of what is today [[Egypt]] and parts of the [[Sudan]]; and [[prehistoric archaeology]] which is not tied to a region but instead deals with the origins of [[culture]] before the invention of [[writing]].

==Geographic subdivisions==
[[Egyptology]] is one example of a specialized branch that deals with the Nile Valley cultures of Egypt and associated regions in sub-Saharan Africa, the Sinai Peninsula to the east, and parts of North Africa. It includes language studies, history and archaeology and their related disciplines. Nowadays, there is much work also done on the prehistoric archaeological record and its practitioners are best described as prehistorians.

The name [[Levant]] (or Syria-Palestine) is used to refer to the area adjacent to the east coast of the Mediterranean. The southern region included in this term encompasses [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], and part of [[Jordan]]. [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] was its ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] name and was also in use during the [[Crusade]]s (1095–1291), the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (1517-1917) and the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] (1918–1948). The same region is also called the [[Holy Land]], the [[Land of Israel]], and [[Canaan]] because of biblical associations. The foregoing names can be perceived as having political overtones, meaning that the more neutral, geographically based term the [[southern Levant]] has become popular with archaeologists who wish to refer to this area without prejudice or political orientation.  In many contexts the Sinai Peninsula is also considered to be part of the southern Levant, although it is part of the modern state of Egypt. Archaeologically, it is distinguished from the heartland of Egypt, the Nile Valley and Delta.

The term northern Levant can be used to refer to [[Lebanon]], the Syrian littoral and portions of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey in the province of [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. More usually,  these regions are included in greater Syria, a name used to refer to the whole area between Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Arabia. The Mediterranean coast of Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and parts of Northern Israel are also known as [[Phoenicia]], after the ancient kingdom. However, this term suffers from the same problems as Canaan and equivalents and so is generally now only used in a strict historical sense.

The landmass of [[Anatolia]], most of modern Turkey, is bordered by several seas and includes parts of Northern Mesopotamia. The [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rise in Turkey and flow south into Iraq.

[[Cyprus]] (ancient [[Alashiya]]), a large island in the eastern Mediterranean was a separate cultural entity during most periods of human occupation. However, its proximity to both Anatolia and the northern and southern Levant was responsible for influences from and to both these regions. This was especially the case as Cyprus was an important source of copper for much of the region.

[[Mesopotamia]] ("The Land of Two Rivers") is considered to begin more or less near the modern border with Iraq and refers to the flat valley of the southern [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers and their tributaries. These rivers empty into the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway that separates Iraq from Iran. Sumerology is a very specialized discipline that deals with the history, language and archaeology of ancient [[Sumer]] (southern Mesopotamia), mostly during the [[4th millennium BCE|4th]] and 3rd millennium BCE. [[Assyriology]] deals with the [[Assyria]]ns who succeeded the Sumerians and covers much of the region while that language was still in use.

[[Iran]], sometimes known as [[Persia]], includes a large plateau and its periphery, including the [[Zagros Mountains]]. Sub-disciplines of this region deal mostly with the languages, history and archaeology of regions within this large area.

The Arabian Peninsula and its offshore islands is a separate geographical zone that has contacts with Sinai, the well-watered regions to the north, and by sea with the far-east.

==Organisations==
Due to the historic interest in the archaeology of the Near East, especially due to the Biblical links of the area, there are a large number of organisations dedicated to the archaeological investigation of the region. These include the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] which publishes the journal ''[[Near Eastern Archaeology Magazine]]'', the [[Council for British Research in the Levant]] which publishes the journal [http://www.art.man.ac.uk/ARTHIST/levant.htm Levant], and [[The Netherlands Institute for the Near East]] which publishes the journal [http://www.nino-leiden.nl/publication/bibliotheca-orientalis Bibliotheca Orientalis].

The '''North European hypothesis''' was a linguistic and archaeological theory that tried to explain the spread of the [[Indo-European languages]] in [[Eurasia]] from an original homeland ([[Urheimat]]) located in southern [[Scandinavia]] or in the [[North German Plain]].{{sfn|Vere Gordon Childe|1926|p=178}} This hypothesis, advanced by [[Karl Penka]], [[Hermann Hirt]], [[Gustaf Kossinna]] and others, had some success in the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century being endorsed by [[National Socialism]] {{sfn|Francisco Villar|1997|p=42-47}} but is today considered outdated by the majority of the academics who tend to favor the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].{{refn|group=note|See:
* Mallory: "The Kurgan solution is attractive and has been accepted by many archaeologists and linguists, in part or total. It is the solution one encounters in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and the ''Grand Dictionnaire Encyclopédique Larousse''."{{sfn|Mallory|1989|p=185}}
* Strazny: "The single most popular proposal is the Pontic steppes (see the Kurgan hypothesis)...".{{sfn|Strazny|2000|p=163}}}}
It has been recently recovered by [[Jean Haudry]] and [[Carl-Heinz Boettcher]].

==Overview==
According to Penka, the first to propose a Nordic Urheimat, the primitive Indo-European people had to be sedentary farmers native of the north, formed without external interference since the [[Paleolithic]].{{sfn|Francisco Villar|1997|p=42-47}} The presence of the term to indicate the [[copper]] (*''ayes'') in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European vocabulary would restrict the homeland (Urheimat) in a culture of the late [[Neolithic]] or the [[Chalcolithic]]. Terms in favor of a northern location would be, among others, the ones to indicate the [[beech]] (''bhāghos'') and the [[sea]] (*''mori'').{{sfn|Francisco Villar|1997|p=42-47}}

For Boettcher, the very first period of formation of the future proto-Indo-European peoples began in the late Paleolithic, when global warming, which followed the [[Wurm glaciation]], allowed to the [[hunter-gatherers]] settled in the gliacial shelters to repopulate [[northern Europe]], now free of [[ice]]s. They gave rise to archaeological manifestations such as the [[Hamburg culture]] and the [[Federmesser culture]]. In these areas of the north are common boreal phenomena apparently described in some indoeuropean myths.{{sfn| Carl-Heinz Boettcher|1999|p=28}} These groups of hunters and fishermen are the basis of the next [[Maglemosian culture]] (9000-6500 BC approximately). The rising of the sea level in northern Europe caused the flooding of part of the territories occupied by Maglemosians ([[Doggerland]]) and drove them south. The heirs of this culture developed the cultures of [[Ertebølle culture|Ertebølle]] and Ellerbek.{{sfn| Carl-Heinz Boettcher|1999|p=68}} Boettcher compares their activities with those of the [[Vikings]] of the following millenniums. They are described as a developing warrior society, which deals with trade and piracy, going up the rivers to raid the lands occupied by the [[Danubian culture|Danubian farmers]] of the southern plains, subduing them and become their leaders.

The fusion of these two populations gave rise to the so-called [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (4200-2600 BC), extended from the [[Netherlands]] to north-western [[Ukraine]],{{sfn|J.P.Mallory|1997|p=596}} which would be the original habitat of the first Indo-Europeans; for Haudry "''The Neolithic Funnelbecker culture agrees well with the traditional image of the Indo-European people confirmed by linguistic paleontology: in this culture there are simultaneously breeding and plant cultivation, the [[horse]], the [[wagon]] and the [[battle-axe]], fortifications and signs of a hierarchically organized society ''".{{sfn|Jean Haudry|1999|p=155}} The first Indo-European culture would be then a synthesis of the Ertebølle culture and the final stages of the [[Linear Pottery culture]].{{sfn| Carl-Heinz Boettcher|1999|p=148}} This prehistoric fusion of two different populations would explain some common myths to the [[Indo-European mythology]] studied by [[Georges Dumezil]] as the [[Rape of the Sabines]] in [[Rome]] or the war between the [[Aesir]] and [[Vanir]] of [[Norse mythology]], that would show the union between warrior groups and groups of producers/farmers.

Later cultures, such as the [[Globular Amphora culture]] and the [[Corded Ware culture]] would represent the expansion of the Indo-Europeans (or ''Indogermanen'') from their original locations in the [[North European Plain]] toward [[Russia]] ([[Middle Dnieper culture]], [[Fatyanovo-Balanovo culture]]{{sfn|Vere Gordon Childe|1926|p=177}}) and [[Asia]] ([[Koban culture]]{{sfn|Vere Gordon Childe|1926|p=177-178}}). Similar movements of [[Nordic race|Nordic]] populations would have irradiated from the north to the west and the [[southern Europe|south of Europe]], including in [[Anatolia]] ([[Troy]],{{sfn|Vere Gordon Childe|1926|p=177}}) between the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]].

Translations appeared in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="olfertdapper"/&gt; Dapper never traveled to Africa but used reports by Jesuit missionaries and other (Dutch) explorers. Within a few years he published about [[China]], [[India]], [[Persia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Arabia]]. His books became well known in his own time. The fine plates include views of Algiers, Benin, Cairo, Cape Town, La Valetta, Marrakech, St. Helena, Tangier, Tripoli, Tunis, as well as, animals and plants.

Dapper was buried on 29 December 1689 in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="olfertdapper"/&gt;

==Influence==
To this day, Dapper's book ''Description of Africa'' is an important text for Africanists.&lt;ref name="olfertdapper"/&gt;

In Amsterdam, the street Dapperstraat was named after him. The Dutch writer [[Willem Frederik Hermans]] wrote a book on him with the title ''Het Evangelie van O. Dapper Dapper'' (1973).

In [[Paris]], the [[Musée Dapper]] named for him opened in 1986.&lt;ref name="museedapper"&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Foundation  | publisher = [[Musée Dapper]]  | url = http://www.dapper.com.fr/en/foundation.php  | accessdate = 2008-05-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080125151501/http://dapper.com.fr/en/foundation.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter S.

[[File:Retrato de Pedro Mejía.jpg|thumb|Pedro Mejía]]

'''Pedro Mejía''' (old Spanish spelling: '''Pero Mexía'''), (between 17 January and 6 September 1497 &amp;ndash; 17 January 1551) was a [[Spain|Spanish]]  [[Renaissance]] writer, humanist and historian.

He was born and died in [[Seville]], where he lived for the majority of his life and for which there is always a special affection in his writings.

He studied humanities and law at Seville and Salamanca universities. He maintained correspondence with [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]], [[Luis Vives]] and [[Juan Gines de Sepulveda]]. In 1548, he was appointed official chronicler of the court of [[Emperor Charles V]].

His major work is ''Silva de varia lección'' (''A Miscellany of Several Lessons'') (1540), which became an early  best seller across Europe. It was reprinted 17 times in the sixteenth century and was translated into Italian (1542), French (1552) and English (1571).  Within a century, ''Silva'' reached 31 editions in Spanish, and 75 in foreign languages. It is an encyclopedic miscellany or mixture of subjects of interest across the  diverse repertoire of humanistic knowledge of the time. The work takes material from the ''Attic Nights'' by [[Aulus Gellius]], the ''Banquet of the Sophists'' by [[Athenaeus]], the ''Saturnalia'' of [[Macrobius]], the ''Memorable deeds and sayings'' of [[Valerius Maximus]], the ''Inventor of all things'' by  [[Polidoro Virgilio]], the ''Moralia'' and ''Parallel Lives'' of [[Plutarch]] and, above all,  the ''Natural History'' of [[Pliny the Elder]]. It also contains work by   Erasmus of Rotterdam. Traces of this miscellany can be found in works by  [[Mateo Alemán]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Montaigne]], to mention only a few of the authors he influenced.

Other major works by Mexia are ''Historia imperial y cesárea'' (1545), ''Historia del Emperador Carlos V'' (unfinished and unpublished) and ''Coloquios y Diálogos'' (1547).

'''Reuven Amitai''' (born August 23, 1955), also '''Reuven Amitai-Preiss''', is an Israeli-American historian and writer, specializing in pre-modern [[Islamic]] civilization, especially Syria and Palestine during the time of the [[Mamluk Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kahnplus.com/ftp/NEW/authors/amitai_reuven.htm "Reuven Amitai"] at Kahnplus.com&lt;/ref&gt; In his 20s he moved to Israel, and became history professor at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

==Biography==
Amitai was born in Philadelphia in 1955, and studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 1976 he made the ''[[aliyah]]'' to Israel, intending to live and work on a [[kibbutz]] while also pursuing Middle Eastern Studies. He worked at the kibbutz for six  years as a [[welder]], and then decided to return to academic studies. He enrolled at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where he eventually received a Masters and Doctorate, focusing on the history of Islam, especially during the time of the Crusades, the [[Mamluk]]s, and the [[Mongol Empire]], a time period spanning the 11th to 16th centuries. He spent a year as a visiting fellow at [[Princeton University]] from 1990–91, and [[St. Antony's College]] in Oxford from 1996–97. Returning to the Hebrew University, he became a teacher, then Chairman of the Department of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies from 1997–2001, and director of the Institute of Asian and African Studies twice, in 2001–04 and 2008–10.&lt;ref&gt;http://islamization.huji.ac.il/members_amitai.html&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2005, he became director of the Nehemia Levtzion Center for Islamic Studies, whose goal was to encourage research public activity related to Islamic studies.&lt;ref name=focus&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prof. Amitai takes pride in graduate program|journal=Focus 32: Newsletter of the Rothberg International School|publisher=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem|date=Spring 2006|page=7|url=http://overseas.huji.ac.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/focus_32.pdf|format=pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008043108/http://overseas.huji.ac.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/focus_32.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010 to 2014, he served as Dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

'''Rotem Kowner''' ({{lang-he|רותם קובנר}}; born 11 July 1960 in [[Mikhmoret]]) is an [[Israel]]i [[historian]] and [[psychologist]] specializing in the history of modern Japan, and a full [[professor]] in the Department of Asian Studies at the [[University of Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japan-studies.org/Rotem-Kowner.html Israeli Association for Japanese Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Rotem Kowner was born in Mikhmoret and lived his early years in the [[Kibbutz]] of [[Ma'ayan Tzvi]]. At the age of three, his family moved to [[Haifa]], where he grew up and went to the [[Hebrew Reali School]]. Upon graduation, he entered the [[Israeli Navy]] and subsequently served as an officer on a [[missile boat]].

== Academic career ==
After majoring in East Asian Studies and psychology at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], he studied for a year at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and then for six years at the [[University of Tsukuba]] in [[Japan]]. Upon receiving his Ph.D., he continued in postdoctoral studies at the Center for East Asian Studies, [[Stanford University]], and at the Hebrew University. In 1998 he began teaching at the [[University of Haifa]] as a senior lecturer and was promoted to professor in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Kowner, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt; Kowner worked extensively to mark the centenary of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and to stress its regional and global repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;David Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, Journal of Slavic Military Studies 20 (2007), p. 775&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in organizing international conferences, initiated collaborative works, and published several books as well as many articles about this topic. Since 2010, his research focus has shifted to the examination of the development of [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[racism]] in modern [[East Asia]] and in Japan in particular. Kowner maintains that the question of race, the distress over foreign racism, and the implementation of racist policies in its own colonies have been among the most critical and painful issues in the history of modern Japan and that they were also among the determinants of its national decision-making, at least until the end of [[World War II]].

Kowner has been as a visiting professor at [[Tokyo]]'s [[Waseda University]], the [[University of Geneva]], and the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and serves on the editorial board of several academic journals. He is the co-founder of the biennial conferences of Asian Studies in Israel and the Israeli Association of Japanese Studies (IAJS). He has been member of the university's Senate, Board of Governors, and Executive Committee of his own university and currently serves as the director of its liberal arts program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://east-asia.haifa.ac.il/staff/rkowner.html The Department of Asian Studies, Staff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220321/http://east-asia.haifa.ac.il/staff/rkowner.html |date=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simon Scarrow''' (born 3 October 1962) is a UK-based author, born in [[Nigeria]] and now based in [[Norfolk]]. Scarrow completed a master's degree at the [[University of East Anglia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/creativewriting/alumni/s-u|title=Alumni S - U|publisher=Uea.ac.uk|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after working at the [[Inland Revenue]], and then went into [[teacher|teaching]] as a lecturer, firstly at [[East Norfolk Sixth Form College]], then at [[City College Norwich]].

He is best known for his ''[[Eagles of the Empire]]'' series of [[Roman military]] fiction set in the territories of the Roman Empire, covering the [[Roman conquest of Britain|second invasion of Britain]] and the subsequent prolonged campaign undertaken by the rump of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. As of June 2016, there are 16 books in the series; the latest, "Day of the Caesars", was published in 2017.&lt;ref name="Scarrow Home Page - Eagle Series"/&gt;

He has also written another series, ''[[The Revolution Quartet|Revolution]]'', focusing on [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], whose first title, ''[[Young Bloods (novel)|Young Bloods]]'', was published in 2006. The second volume, ''[[The Generals (novel)|The Generals]]'', was released on 31 May 2007 and the third volume ''[[Fire and Sword (novel)|Fire and Sword]]'' was released in January 2009. The fourth and final novel of the series was released in Jun 2010 and is called ''[[The Fields of Death]]''. He began publishing a new series in 2011 titled ''Gladiator''.

==Books==
Asked by the ''Edinburgh Book Review'' about the inspiration behind his interest in the Roman era, Scarrow said, "Firstly, great [[Latin]] teachers – Gordon Rodway and then Reg Nash, who inspired a love of the language and more enduringly a fascination with Roman history and culture. Secondly, when I was growing up in the seventies [[Peplum (film genre)|swords and sandals]] epics seemed to be on the TV regularly. Not to mention the brilliant ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]''".&lt;ref name="Edinburgh Book Review 26 March 2015"&gt;{{cite news |author= Wander |title= Interview with Simon Scarrow |url= http://www.edinburghbookreview.co.uk/news/interview-with-simon-scarrow | date= 26 March 2015|work= Edinburgh Book Review |location= Edinburgh| accessdate=28 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarrow cites the inspiration for his 'earthy' characters as being from his time in the [[Officer Training Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarrow.co.uk/page15.html|title=The Gladiator|publisher=Scarrow.co.uk|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Eagles of the Empire'' series===
The ''[[Eagles of the Empire]]'' series centres upon two main protagonists, [[Eagles of the Empire#Main characters|Quintus Licinius Cato]] and [[Eagle Series#Main characters|Lucius Cornelius Macro]], who are both [[legionary|Roman soldiers]]. Macro, a veteran with nearly 15 years' service (at the start of the first novel) in the Roman Army, has recently been appointed to the Centurionate. Cato is in his teen years, grew up in the Imperial Palace as a slave, and at the start of the series joins the Eagles as Macro's Optio. The first book starts in 42 [[Anno Domini|AD]]. The books cover the experiences of the two soldiers, initially as experienced [[centurion]] and new [[optio]], in battles in Germania and the invasion of Britain by [[Claudius]] as part of the [[Legio II Augusta]]. The 6th book ''[[The Eagle's Prophecy]]'' has them serving as part of the Imperial Navy east of Italy. The 7th and 8th put them in Rome's eastern provinces as agents of the Emperor's secretary [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus]]. The 9th sees them shipwrecked on the island of [[Crete]], fighting against a full-scale uprising. The 11th is set in Rome with the leads hoping to save the emperor from the shady Liberators. ''The Blood Crows'' is set once again in Britannia. The two protagonists are faced with defeating tribal rebels.

The two characters Cato and Macro were additionally used in one book of the [[TimeRiders]] series: Gates of Rome. They served as supporting characters when the three protagonists travel back to ancient Rome. Scarrow allowed his brother Alex to make use of the characters in his novel.

In 2007 the publisher announced the intention to cease using the word "Eagle" in the title of books in this series, starting with ''Centurion''. The change was apparently because the publisher wanted to attract more new readers to the series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">In [[historical linguistics]], '''sister languages''', also known as '''sibling languages''' or '''brother languages''' are cognate languages; that is, languages that descend from a common ancestral language, the so-called [[proto-language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction|year=2004|author=Campbell, Lyle|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53267-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjXrrOJhex8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22Sister+language%22+cognate&amp;lr=&amp;ei=0A8SSLStApDAygSPnojnCg&amp;sig=RdQkRFbxnQ1rUzIHLLBGE9KsmEE|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every language in a [[language family]] that descends from the same language as the others is a sister to them.

A commonly given example is the [[Romance languages]], each one of which is a continuation of spoken [[Latin]]. [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] have about 89% [[lexical overlap]], meaning the words share 89 percent of the same characteristics and root origins.  Both Italian and French have a huge number of similar words. Similarly, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] have about 89% lexical overlap, so many words are shared or similar between those two languages (see also [[cognate (linguistics)|cognates]]). Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian's]] overlap is lower, at about 67%. Spanish and Portuguese have undergone [[Arabic language|Arabic]] influence and Romanian has undergone many different influences over the years, particularly from the [[Slavic languages]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Along with a large amount of shared vocabulary, the Romance languages share numerous features of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]] because they are all continuations of their common ancestor, Latin. 

The [[Scots language]] is considered to be a sister language of [[English language|English]], as they are both descended from the common ancestor Old English (via Early [[Middle English]]). The phonological development of the two languages is divergent, with different loanwords entering each language from sources such as Norse, Latin and French. Political and cultural events have largely dictated the decline of broad Scots as a standard variety in the modern period, and Scots is currently confined to largely spoken use and unofficial functions.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Older Scots A Linguistic Reader'', (Scottish Text Society: Edinburgh, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Computer hacking}}

In [[computing]], a '''Trojan horse''', or '''Trojan''', is any [[malware|malicious computer program]] which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] story of the deceptive [[Trojan Horse|wooden horse]] that led to the fall of the city of [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

Trojans are generally spread by some form of [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]], for example where a user is duped into executing an e-mail attachment disguised to appear not suspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else . Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]], contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between viruses, worms, and Trojans?|url=http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&amp;id=TECH98539|publisher=Symantec Corporation|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trojans may allow an attacker to access users' personal information such as banking information, passwords, or personal identity. It can infect other devices connected to the network. [[Ransomware]] attacks are often carried out using a Trojan.

Unlike [[computer virus]]es and [[Computer worm|worms]], Trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Origin of the concept ==
This terminology occurred for the first time in a US Air Force report in 1974 on the analysis of vulnerability in computer systems.&lt;ref name="Multics"&gt;{{Citation 
| authors = Karger, P.A. and R.R. Schell
| title = Multics Security Evaluation:  Vulnerability Analysis , ESD-TR-74-193, 
| volume = II
| date = June 1974
| journal  = HQ Electronic Systems Division: Hanscom AFB, MA
| url = http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/karg74.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made popular by [[Ken Thompson]] in his 1983 Turing Award acceptance lecture "Reflections on Trusting Trust",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title = Reflection on Trusting Trust
| author = Ken Thompson
| journal = Commun. ACM 
| volume = 27
| number = 8

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; subtitled:
: ''{{quotation |  To what extent should one trust a statement that a program is free of Trojan horses?  Perhaps it is more important to trust: the people who wrote the software.}}''
He mentioned that he knew about the possible existence  of Trojan horses in a report on the security of [[Multics]] of which he was unfortunately unable to find a reference. However Paul Karger and Roger Schell affirm that this is their above cited report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Malicious uses==
Trojan in this way may require interaction with a malicious controller (not necessarily distributing the Trojan) to fulfill their purpose. It is possible for those involved with Trojans to scan computers on a network to locate any with a Trojan installed, which the hacker can then control.&lt;ref name="Crapanzano"&gt;Jamie Crapanzano (2003): [http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/malicious/deconstructing_subseven_the_trojan_horse_of_choice_953 "Deconstructing SubSeven, the Trojan Horse of Choice", SANS Institute], Retrieved on 2009-06-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Trojans take advantage of a security flaw in older versions of Internet Explorer and Google Chrome to use the host computer as an [[anonymizer|anonymizer proxy]] to effectively hide Internet usage,&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite news
 | url=http://www.spywareloop.com/news/trojan-horse

 | accessdate=July 28, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling the controller to use the Internet for illegal purposes while all potentially incriminating evidence indicates the infected computer or its IP address. The host's computer may or may not show the internet history of the sites viewed using the computer as a proxy.  The first generation of anonymizer Trojan horses tended to leave their tracks in the [[page view]] histories of the host computer.  Later generations of the Trojan tend to "cover" their tracks more efficiently.  Several versions of [[Sub7]] have been widely circulated in the US and Europe and became the most widely distributed examples of this type of Trojan.&lt;ref name="Crapanzano" /&gt;

In German-speaking countries, [[spyware]] used or made by the government is sometimes called ''govware''. Govware is typically a Trojan software used to intercept communications from the target computer. Some countries like Switzerland and Germany have a legal framework governing the use of such software.&lt;ref name="cupa"&gt;Basil Cupa, [http://www.zora.uzh.ch/81157/1/Cupa_Living_in_Surveillance_Societies_2012.pdf Trojan Horse Resurrected: On the Legality of the Use of Government Spyware (Govware)], LISS 2013, pp. 419–428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of govware Trojans include the Swiss [[MiniPanzer and MegaPanzer]]&lt;ref name="tech"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Chaos Computer Club#Staatstrojaner|German "state trojan" nicknamed R2D2]].&lt;ref name="cupa"/&gt; German govware works by exploiting security gaps unknown to the general public and accessing smartphone data before it becomes encrypted via other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = German federal police use Trojan virus to evade phone encryption |url = http://www.dw.com/en/german-federal-police-use-trojan-virus-to-evade-phone-encryption/a-42328466| website = DW| accessdate = 2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the popularity of botnets among hackers and the availability of advertising services that permit authors to violate their users' privacy, Trojans are becoming more common. According to a survey conducted by [[BitDefender]] from January to June 2009, "Trojan-type malware is on the rise, accounting for 83-percent of the global malware detected in the world." Trojans have a relationship with worms, as they spread with the help given by worms and travel across the internet with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bitdefender.com/NW1094-en--BitDefender-Malware-and-Spam-Survey-finds-E-Threats-Adapting-to-Online-Behavioral-Trends.html BitDefender.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808080907/http://news.bitdefender.com/NW1094-en--BitDefender-Malware-and-Spam-Survey-finds-E-Threats-Adapting-to-Online-Behavioral-Trends.html |date=August 8, 2009 }}
Malware and Spam Survey''&lt;/ref&gt; BitDefender has stated that approximately 15% of computers are members of a botnet, usually recruited by a Trojan infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Vasily Ivanovich Modestov''' ({{lang-ru|Василий Иванович Модестов}}, 24 January 1839, [[Valdaysky District|Valday]], [[Novgorod Governorate]], [[Imperial Russia]], — 13 February 1907, [[Rome]], [[Italy]]) was a Russian [[historian]], [[philologist]], [[publicist]] and [[translator]].

A [[Saint Petersburg University]] graduate who lectured at the [[Odessa University|Odessa]], [[Kazan University|Kazan]] and [[Kiev University|Kiev Universities]], as well as his [[alma mater]] (in 1886—1889), Modestov was a prominent authority on the history and culture of [[Ancient Rome]], as well as earlier [[Apennine Peninsula]] cultures ([[Etruscan civilization]], [[Messapii]]). He contributed to ''[[Istorichesky Vestnik]]'', ''[[Golos (newspaper)|Golos]]'', ''Nov'', ''Filologicheskoye Obozrenye'', as well as the [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]], providing entries on the history and culture of Rome. Modestov translated into Russian semimal works by [[Tacitus]] (The Complete Tacitus, Vols. 1—2, 1886—87), [[Horace]], [[Spinoza]], as well as the ''[[:de:Reallexikon des classischen Alterthums für Gymnasien|Reallexikon des classischen Alterthums für Gymnasien]]''. Among his best-known original works were ''The History of Ancient Rome'' (Vols. I-II, 1902—1909) and ''Tacitus and his Work. Historical and Literary Study'' (Тацит и его сочинения. Историко-литературное исследование, 1864).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/109981/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2 Василий Иванович Модестов].

The '''Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (VWI)''' is a research centre dedicated to the research and documentation of and education on all aspects of [[antisemitism]], [[racism]] and the [[Holocaust]], including its emergence and aftermath. It was designed by Simon Wiesenthal as well as international and Austrian researchers. The institute is located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It is financed by the City of Vienna and the Austrian [[:de:Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft|Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy]].

== History ==
The [[Jewish Community Vienna]] (Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien, IKG) and several other renowned institutions initiated the idea to establish an international [[Shoah]] research institute in Vienna in 2002. [[Simon Wiesenthal]] was still personally involved in designing the concept for the institute before his death in 2005.

In December 2002, the City of Vienna confirmed that it would financially support the project with a sum to match that to be provided by the Republic of Austria. In March 2008, support by the Republic of Austria for the VWI was also finally confirmed in a speech in the council of ministers. There followed the establishment of the office, taking up work in the spring of 2009.

The preliminary phase in 2010 and 2011 is to see the groundwork being laid for a specialized scholarly library and an institute-affiliated archive (based on the Holocaust-relevant documents of the IKG archive) as well as the design and trial of various forms of public events – such as lectures, book presentations, conferences and workshops as well as public media interventions in remembrance of the Shoah. This was followed by the preparation of a scholarly research program as well as a long-term development plan for the institute.

In December 2016, VWI moved to its new premises in the city centre of Vienna on Rabensteig 3.

== Organisation ==

=== Supporting body ===

The supporting body of the VWI is an association that had been formed in the founding phase of the VWI by the Jewish Community Vienna, the [[Jewish Documentation Center]]  (Dokumentationszentrum des Bundes Jüdischer Verfolgter des Naziregimes), the [[Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance]] (Dokumentationsarchiv des österreichischen Widerstandes DÖW), the [[Institute for Contemporary History, University of Vienna|Institute of Contemporary History at the University of Vienna]] (Institut für Zeitgeschichte der Universität Wien), the Institute of Conflict Research (Institut für Konfliktforschung), the [[Jewish Museum Vienna]]  and the International Research Centre for Cultural Studies (Internationales Forschungszentrum Kulturwissenschaften, IFK). Following a dispute on the permission for use of the archive of the Jewish Community Vienna, the Institute of Conflict Research and the IFK left the supporting body in November 2009, their representatives also resigning from their posts in the VWI board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Pelinka]], [http://www.profil.at/articles/0946/560/257261_s6/ ''Mein Abschied vom Wiener Wiesenthal Institut''], guest commentary for the Austrian magazine "profil", November 16, 2009; [[Ingo Zechner]], [http://www.profil.at/articles/0950/560/257261/ ''Zensur durch Muzicant''], guest commentary for the Austrian magazine "profil", December 8, 2009; [http://www.profil.at/articles/0947/560/255775/ Report on the resignation of the International Academic Advisory Board], "profil" November 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After the settlement of this dispute, a lending agreement on the use of the Holocaust-relevant materials in the IKG archive – as envisaged by the original board of directors – was signed by the new board of directors in November 2009. Subsequently, the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]] and the Centre for Jewish Cultural History at the [[University of Salzburg]] (Zentrum für jüdische Kulturgeschichte, Universität Salzburg) joined the supporting body of the VWI in the beginning of 2010. The development of the institute and preparation for full operation was continued on the basis of the step-by-step plan as agreed on in the founding phase. With the arrival of the first fellows in autumn 2012 the institute started its all-out operation.

===Board of Directors===
The Board of Directors of the VWI is appointed by the members of the supporting body. This holds the highest decision-making power in all organisational aspects of the VWI.

[[Anton Pelinka]] was the first Chairman of the Board, the historian and philosopher [[Ingo Zechner]] VWI's first Managing Director. In November 2009, after a dispute on the proper usage of the archives of the IKG (intended to become a part of the holdings of the VWI), several members of the Board and the Managing Director resigned. Under the new Chairman of the Board, the professor of law at the University of Salzburg, Georg Graf, is deputies being Brigitte Bailer-Galanda and [[Ariel Muzicant]] this conflict – well documented in the Austrian media - finally was settled, and a contract on the usage of the archives already worked out by the former Board in accordance with the IKG was signed.

In January 2010, the Viennese contemporary historian Béla Rásky became VWI's new Managing Director. As of October 2012, sociologist Éva Kovács from the Centre of Social Studies at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] became the institute's Research Programme Director.

===International Academic Board===
The International Academic Board is a key actor in all academic issues. The board consists of at least nine, maximum twelve internationally renowned experts, of whom no more than three are allowed to be from within Austrian academic institutions. Particular care is taken that the board remains interdisciplinary. Members and employees of members of the supporting body of the VWI cannot join the International Academic Board. The International Academic Board is elected for a period of three years at the general assembly, like the board.

As of January 2018, the members of the board are as follows (in alphabetical order):

* Nanci Adler ([[NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies|NIOD]], Amsterdam)
* Jolanta Ambrosewicz-Jacobs ([[Jagiellonian University|Uniwersytet Jagielloński, Kraków]])
* Peter Black ([[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]])
* Susanne Heim ([[Institut für Zeitgeschichte|Institute of Contemporary History]], Munich-Berlin)
* Robert Graham Knight ([[Loughborough University]], Leicestershire)
* Dan Michman (International Institute for Holocaust Research, [[Yad Vashem]], Jerusalem; [[Bar-Ilan University]], Ramat Gan)
* Anthony [[Dirk Moses]] ([[European University Institute]], Florence)
* [[Dirk Rupnow]] ([[University of Innsbruck]])
* Irina Sherbakova ([[Memorial (society)|Memorial]], Moscow)
* Sybille Steinbacher (Fritz Bauer Institut, Frankfurt)
* Dominique Trimbur ([[Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah]])
* Yfaat Weiss (Simon-Dubnow-Institut, Leipzig)

== Activities ==
[[File:VWI Kaschlgasse.JPG|thumb|"Vestiges in a forgotten place": former {{Interlanguage link multi|Synagogue Vienna 20, Kaschlgasse|de|3=Synagoge Kaschlgasse}} – November 9, 2010]]

The activities of the VWI fall into the three categories research, documentation and education. Within these categories, the institute addresses all issues related to antisemitism, racism and the Holocaust, including its emergence and aftermath.

Research is to be international and interdisciplinary at the VWI. It takes one of two forms: on the one hand, there is an annually announced fellowship program for Senior, Research and Senior Fellows, while on the other hand research projects of varying length will be conducted. Various research projects on the history of antisemitism and the Holocaust have been already worked out by the Research Programme Director, the Managing Director and the staff members of the institute (with the support of the Academic Advisory Board), are already filed for application.

Since November 2010, VWI is a member in the consortium for the EU project  [http://www.ehri-project.eu European Holocaust Research Infrastructure – EHRI] which entered in its second phase – EHRI-2 – in the end of 2014.

The aim of the documentation project of the VWI is to unite thematically relevant but hitherto separated archival materials, ensure their safekeeping and make them accessible to search tools. A first step in this direction has been taken in the form of cooperation in producing the online platform [http://www.ns-quellen.at ns-quellen.at] which had been commissioned to the "Research Office. Association for Academic and Cultural Services" ([http://www.forschungsbuero.at Forschungsbüro. Verein für wissenschaftliche und kulturelle Dienstleistungen]) and was completed in March 2011. Digitalization of the Holocaust-relevant parts of the IKG archive began in September 2010 with work on the so-called Jerusalem materials of the archive. This work is conducted using the archival software "scopeArchiv", which is in widespread use in Austria. The [https://search-vwi.obvsg.at/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=VWI&amp;dscnt=0&amp;dstmp=1468626546478&amp;vid=VWI&amp;backFromPreferences=true scholarly library of the VWI] of the VWI is currently numbering approx. 14,000 volumes so far, concentrating to some extent on books on Holocaust-Studies which are not accessible in Austria. The institute library is a public reference library. The library catalogue can be searched via the [[Österreichischer Bibliothekenverbund|Austrian joint library system]] (OBV).

Since the autumn of 2012, the institute hosts two senior, two research and four junior fellows a year. In general, the call for proposals is announced at the end of a calendar year. Decision on grants is made by a sub-commission of the Academic Advisory Board and a research staff member of the VWI in the spring of each year.

In the autumn of 2014, the e-Journal of the institute – [http://simon.vwi.ac.at S:I.M.O.N. - Shoah: Intervention. Methods. DocumentatiON.] - went online, publishing the peer-reviewed manuscripts of the Simon Wiesenthal Lectures, the Working Papers of the fellows and articles selected by the Editorial Committee. VWI's book series is edited by the Viennese publishing house [http://www.newacademicpress.at new academic press].

The institute's German-speaking, annual newsletter [http://www.vwi.ac.at/index.php/publikationen/newsletter VWI im Fokus] informs on all upcoming events and activities.

== Events ==
[[File:VWI LectureRJPelt.jpg|thumb|Fifth Simon Wiesenthal Lecture by [[Robert Jan van Pelt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/wienerwiesenthal#p/c/72BB77A61263B302/3/UTS5Pk_agDg|title=Wiener Wiesenthal Institut für Holocaust-Studien|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; – June 10, 2010]]

To achieve its aims of education, the VWI organises events such as book presentations, media and/or arts interventions in the public space in remembrance of the Shoah. An exhibition centre and an online platform are planned for when the institute has taken up full operation.

The "Simon Wiesenthal Lectures" which have by now grown into a VWI trademark event, aim to bring current Holocaust research to a wider public with the help of renowned international researchers. They take place approx. every two months in the roof-top foyer of the Austrian State Archives at the [[Minoritenplatz]] in Vienna.

At the end of a calendar year, VWI organises its annual "Simon Wiesenthal Conference": In 2011, the conference's topic was "Scores of Commemoration. The Holocaust in Music", while in 2012, "[[:File:VWI SWC2012 Poster.jpg|Before the Holocaust had its Name]]. Early Confrontations of the Mass Murder of the Jews". In 2013, VWI - together with the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] - hosted the Simon Wiesenthal Conference under the title "Collaboration in Eastern Europe during World War II and the Holocaust".

[[Image:ToyokuniActor.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Utagawa Toyokuni]]; The Kabuki actor Onoe Eisaburo I; c. 1800.]]
'''''Yakusha-e''''' (役者絵), often referred to as "actor prints" in English, are Japanese [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] or, rarely, paintings, of [[kabuki]] actors, particularly those done in the ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' style popular through the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) and into the beginnings of the 20th century. Most strictly, the term ''yakusha-e'' refers solely to portraits of individual artists (or sometimes pairs, as seen in this work by [[Sharaku]]). However, prints of kabuki scenes and of other elements of the world of the theater are very closely related, and were more often than not produced and sold alongside portraits.

''Ukiyo-e'' images were almost exclusively images of urban life; the vast majority that were not landscapes were devoted to depicting courtesans, sumo, or kabuki.

Realistic detail, inscriptions, the availability of playbills from the period, and a number of other resources have allowed many prints to be analyzed and identified in great detail. Scholars have been able to identify the subjects of many prints down to not only the play, roles, and actors portrayed, but often the theater, year, month, and even day of the month as well.

==Development of the form==

Over the course of the Edo period, as ''ukiyo-e'' as a whole developed and changed as a genre, ''yakusha-e'' went through a number of changes as well. Many prints, particularly earlier ones, depict actors generically, and very plainly, showing in a sense their true natures as actors merely playing at roles. Many other prints, meanwhile, take something of the opposite tack; they show kabuki actors and scenes very elaborately, intentionally obscuring the distinction between a play and the actual events it seeks to evoke.

Only a few artists were innovative enough to stand apart from the masses, creating works more distinctive in style. These artists, beginning with [[Katsukawa Shunshō]], depicted actors elaborately and idealistically, but with the realistic details of individualized faces. Individual actors, such as [[Ichikawa Danjūrō V]], can now be recognized across roles and even as depicted by different artists.

[[Torii Kiyonobu]] (1664–1729) was likely one of the first to produce actor prints in the mainstream ''ukiyo-e'' style. An artist from the [[Torii school]] which painted theater signboards, Kiyonobu was no stranger to the theater or to artistic depictions of it. In 1700, he published a book of full-length portraits of Edo kabuki actors in various roles. Though he took much, stylistically, from the Torii school style as a whole, there are significant elements of his style that were innovative and new. His dramatic forms would guide the core of ''ukiyo-e'' style for the next eighty years. It is possible that his prints may have even affected kabuki itself, as actors sought to match their performances to the dramatic, bombastic, and intense poses of the art.

By the 1740s, artists such as [[Torii Kiyotada]] were making prints depicting not only the actors themselves, in portraits or in stage scenes, but the theaters themselves, including the audience, architecture, and various staging elements.

Throughout the 18th century, many ''ukiyo-e'' artists produced actor prints and other depictions of the kabuki world. Most of these drew strongly upon the Torii style, and were essentially promotional works, "generalized, highly stylized billboards meant to attract the crowd with their bold line and color".&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1978). "Images of the Floating World." Old Saybrook, CT: Konecky &amp; Konecky. p117.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1760s and the emergence of Katsukawa Shunshō that actors began to be portrayed in such a way that the individual actors could be identified across different prints depicting different roles. Shunshō focused on facial features and idiosyncrasies of the individual actors.

This drastic change in style was emulated by Shunshō's students of the [[Katsukawa school]], and by many other ukiyo-e artists of the period. The realistic, individualized style replaced that of the Torii school's idealistic, dramatic, but ultimately generalized style which had dominated for seventy years.

Sharaku is one of the most famous and influential ''yakusha-e'' printers along with Kiyonobu; working roughly a century after Kiyonobu, the two are often said to represent the beginnings and peak of kabuki depictions in prints. Sharaku's works are very bold and energetic, and demonstrate an unmistakably unique style. His portraits are easily among the most individualized and distinctive portrayals in all of ukiyo-e. However, his personal style was not emulated by other artists, and can be seen only in the works created by Sharaku himself, during the incredibly short period in which he produced prints, between 1794 and 1795.

Meanwhile, [[Utagawa Toyokuni]] emerged almost simultaneously with Sharaku. His most well-known actor prints were published in 1794–1796, in a collection called ''Yakusha butai no sugata-e'' (役者舞台の姿絵, "Views of Actors on Stage"). Though his works lack the unique energy of Sharaku's, he is considered one of the greatest artists in "large-head" portraits, and in ukiyo-e in general for his depictions of other subjects and in other formats. Though the figure print began to enter serious decline around the turn of the 19th century, headshot portraits continued to be produced. Artists of the [[Utagawa school]], emulating Toyokuni's style, created highly characterized depictions of artists that, while not particularly realistic, were nevertheless highly individualized. The characters and, perhaps, actual appearances of a great number of individual actors, who would otherwise be known only by their names, are thus known to modern scholarship.

==A Later Development==
[[File:Yoshiiku- Kabuki Actors Greeting the Lunar New Year 1863..jpg|frame]]
The sentiments of the above paragraph notwithstanding, there appeared a  開花年齢 [A Flowering Age] of 役者絵 (c.1860-75), when actors’ names could again be printed alongside their image, even if any scenic background was added by other artists (which was normally acknowledged), and, more importantly, date identifications were ascribed by means of singe Censor Seal.&amp;nbsp;There prints, of Kabuki virtuosi, were abundant, numbering more than the usual press runs, they included images of, for example:  young 一 代目河原崎権十郎 [Kawarazaki Gonjuro I ]; the newly-renamed 四代目中村芝 [Nakamura Shikan IV]; the aging 四代目市川小團 次 [Ichikawa Kodanji IV]; and the 15-year-old, virtuoso 女形 [onnagata; ladies’ roles] 三代目 沢村田之助 [Sawamara Tanosuke III].  This blossoming of 役者絵 -- they truly are portraits, not merely good caricatures -- advertised plays in the season; new presentations of any said play, which could number many in a season, replete with new costumes (contemporary reports claimed that costumes only lasted some weeks in performance), or were presented ''gratis'' as souvenirs of any presentation.  All were eagerly awaited by an insatiably acquisitive, theater-going public. See the description of the print here by clicking on the image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2341">'''İsmet Miroğlu''' (1944–1997) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] academic. He was a full professor at the Department of History of [[İstanbul University]].

Professor Miroğlu was born in the [[Bayburt]] province of [[Turkey]]. He was a graduate of the Department of History of [[İstanbul University]] in 1969 and was recruited as a research assistant within the same department. In 1974 he gained a degree of doctor of history (PhD) by his dissertation titled "The [[Sandjak]] of [[Bayburt]] in the 16th Century" (''16. Yüzyılda Bayburt Sancağı'', in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]). In 1981, Miroğlu became an [[associate professor]] of history by his dissertation on the [[Sandjak]] of [[Kemah, Erzincan|Kemah]]. In 1989 he became a full professor.

Between 13 May 1987 and 31 December 1990, Professor İsmet Miroğlu was the Director General of the [[Turkey|Turkish State]] Archives, an institution attached to the Prime Minister's office of the [[Republic of Turkey]]. He led the modernization and re-organization of state archives, which cover both the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and the [[Turkey|Republic]] periods of [[Turkey]].

On 31 December 1990 he left his position at the State Archives and returned to academic life at the [[Istanbul University]]. Besides his academic career, he was the founder and consultant of a monthly history journal in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] entitled ''Tarih ve Medeniyet'' (History and civilization). The first issue of this journal was published in March 1994.

Professor İsmet Miroğlu died on 23 October 1997, after cancer treatment, in [[İstanbul]].

To keep his memory alive, [[BKY]]-[[Babıali Kültür Yayıncılığı]], a publishing house based in [[İstanbul]], published a book on behalf of Miroğlu which is titled ''Bin Atlının Akınları'' (Campaigns of 1000 cavaliers). The book contains some short articles of Professor Miroğlu on [[Ottoman history]].
