'''α-Eleostearic acid''' or '''(9''Z'',11''E'',13''E'')-octadeca-9,11,13-trienoic acid''', is an [[organic compound]], a [[conjugated fatty acids|conjugated fatty acid]] and one of the [[isomer]]s of [[octadecatrienoic acid]]. It is often called simply '''eleostearic acid''' although there is also a [[beta-eleostearic acid|β-eleostearic acid]] (the all-''trans'' or (9''E'',11''E'',13''E'') isomer). Its high [[Polyunsaturated fatty acid|degree of unsaturation]] gives [[tung oil]] its properties as a [[drying oil]].

==Biochemical properties==
[[Image:bittermelonfruit.jpg|thumb|left|α-Eleostearic acid makes up about 60% of the fatty acids from bitter gourd oil.]]

In their pioneering work on [[essential fatty acid]]s, Burr, Burr and Miller compared the nutritional properties of α-eleostearic acid (ELA) to that of its isomer [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA).  ALA relieved essential fatty acid deficiency; ELA did not.&lt;ref name=Burr/&gt;

A '''biocidal natural building material''' is a [[natural building material]] which has [[biocide|biocidal]] properties. The biocidal properties of biocidal natural building materials are inherent to the material, rather than being supplemented afterwards. This makes that the material is long lasting and inexpensive, as no additional processing needs to be done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1999/v4-457.html Biocidal natural building materials having biocidal properties in original natural state]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* core wood soaked with plant saps: e.g. core wood soaked with the biocidal plant saps from [[Pinus canariensis]] (natural durability: 150 years)
* several tropical (hard)wood species
* resins and plant juices as [[latex]] have (fairly) long durability due to [[Latex allergy|protective proteins]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11795">In [[mathematics]], a '''Borel set''' is any set in a [[topological space]] that can be formed from [[open set]]s (or, equivalently, from [[closed set]]s) through the operations of [[countable]] [[union (set theory)|union]], countable [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], and [[relative complement]].  Borel sets are named after [[Émile Borel]].

For a topological space ''X'', the collection of all Borel sets on ''X'' forms a [[sigma-algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebra]], known as the '''Borel algebra''' or '''Borel &amp;sigma;-algebra'''.  The Borel algebra on ''X'' is the smallest σ-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).

Borel sets are important in [[measure theory]], since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a [[Borel measure]].  Borel sets and the associated [[Borel hierarchy]] also play a fundamental role in [[descriptive set theory]].

In some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the [[compact set]]s of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many [[well-behaved]] spaces, including all [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[σ-compact space]]s, but can be different in more [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] spaces.

== Generating the Borel algebra ==

In the case ''X'' is a [[metric space]], the Borel algebra in the first sense may be described ''generatively'' as follows.

For a collection ''T'' of subsets of ''X'' (that is, for any subset of the [[power set]] P(''X'') of ''X''), let
* &lt;math&gt;T_\sigma &lt;/math&gt; be all countable unions of elements of ''T''
* &lt;math&gt;T_\delta &lt;/math&gt; be all countable intersections of elements of ''T''
* &lt;math&gt; T_{\delta\sigma}=(T_\delta)_\sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

Now define by [[transfinite induction]] a sequence ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m'' is an [[ordinal number]], in the following manner:
* For the base case of the definition, let &lt;math&gt; G^0&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of open subsets of ''X''.
* If ''i'' is not a [[limit ordinal]], then ''i'' has an immediately preceding ordinal ''i &amp;minus; 1''. Let 
*: &lt;math&gt; G^i = [G^{i-1}]_{\delta \sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;
* If ''i'' is a limit ordinal, set
*:&lt;math&gt; G^i = \bigcup_{j &lt; i} G^j. &lt;/math&gt;

The claim is that the Borel algebra is ''G''&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[first uncountable ordinal|first uncountable ordinal number]]. That is, the Borel algebra can be ''generated'' from the class of open sets by iterating the operation

:&lt;math&gt; G \mapsto G_{\delta \sigma}. &lt;/math&gt;

to the first uncountable ordinal.

To prove this claim, note that any open set in a metric space is the union of an increasing sequence of closed sets. In particular, complementation of sets maps ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' into itself for any limit ordinal  ''m''; moreover if ''m'' is an uncountable limit ordinal, ''G&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' is closed under countable unions.

Note that for each Borel set ''B'', there is some countable ordinal &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''B'' can be obtained by iterating the operation over &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. However, as ''B'' varies over all Borel sets, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; will vary over all the countable ordinals, and thus the first ordinal at which all the Borel sets are obtained is &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the first uncountable ordinal.

=== Example ===
An important example, especially in the [[probability theory|theory of probability]], is the Borel algebra on the set of [[real number]]s. It is the algebra on which the [[Borel measure]] is defined.  Given a real random variable defined on a [[probability space]], its  [[probability distribution]] is by definition also a measure on the Borel algebra.

The Borel algebra on the reals is the smallest σ-algebra on '''R''' which contains all the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]].

In the construction by transfinite induction, it can be shown that, in each step, the [[cardinality|number]] of sets is, at most, the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. So, the total number of Borel sets is less than or equal to
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 \cdot 2 ^ {\aleph_0}\, = 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, the cardinality of the collection of Borel sets is equal to that of the continuum (compare to the number of Lebesgue measurable sets that exist, which is strictly larger and equal to &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;).

== Standard Borel spaces and Kuratowski theorems ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] --&gt;
{{see also|Standard Borel space}}

Let ''X'' be a topological space. The '''Borel space''' associated to ''X'' is the pair (''X'',''B''), where ''B'' is the σ-algebra of Borel sets of ''X''.

[[George Mackey|Mackey]] defined a Borel space somewhat differently, writing that it is "a set together with a distinguished σ-field of subsets called its Borel sets." &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Mackey| first=G.W. | title=Ergodic  Theory  and Virtual  Groups |  year=1966 | journal=Math. Ann.|volume=166|pages=187&amp;ndash;207|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|issue=3|authorlink=George Mackey|doi=10.1007/BF01361167|issn=0025-5831|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01361167|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern usage is to call the distinguished sub-algebra ''measurable sets'' and such spaces [[measurable space|''measurable spaces'']]. The reason for this distinction is that the Borel sets are the σ-algebra generated by ''open'' sets (of a topological space), whereas Mackey's definition refers to a set equipped with an ''arbitrary'' σ-algebra. There exist measurable spaces that are not Borel spaces, for any choice of topology on the underlying space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87838/is-every-sigma-algebra-the-borel-algebra-of-a-topology Jochen Wengenroth (mathoverflow.net/users/21051), Is every sigma-algebra the Borel algebra of a topology?, http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87888 (version: 2012-02-09)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurable spaces form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] in which the [[morphism]]s are [[measurable function]]s between measurable spaces. A function &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[measurable function|measurable]] if it [[pullback|pulls back]] measurable sets, i.e., for all measurable sets ''B'' in ''Y'', &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable set in ''X''.

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a [[Polish space]], that is, a topological space such that there is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] ''d'' on ''X'' which defines the topology of ''X'' and which makes ''X'' a complete [[separable space|separable]] metric space.  Then ''X'' as a Borel  space is [[isomorphic]] to one of
# '''R''', 
# '''Z''', 
# a finite space. 
(This result is reminiscent of [[Maharam's theorem]].)

Considered as Borel spaces, the real line '''R''', the union of '''R''' with a countable set, and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; are isomorphic.

A '''[[standard Borel space]]''' is the Borel space associated to a [[Polish space]]. A standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Srivastava| first=S.M. | title=A Course on Borel Sets |  year=1991 | publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] | isbn=0-387-98412-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum.

For subsets of Polish spaces, Borel sets can be characterized as those sets which are the ranges of continuous injective maps defined on Polish spaces.  Note however, that the range of a continuous noninjective map may fail to be Borel.  See [[analytic set]].

Every [[probability measure]] on a standard Borel space turns it into a [[standard probability space]].

== Non-Borel sets ==
{{anchor|counterexample}}

An example of a subset of the reals which is non-Borel, due to [[Nikolai Luzin|Lusin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lusin | first=Nicolas | year=1927 | title=Sur les ensembles analytiques | journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae | publisher=Institute of mathematics, Polish academy of sciences | volume=10 | pages=1–95 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (see Sect. 62, pages 76–78), is described below. In contrast, an example of a [[non-measurable set]] cannot be exhibited, though its existence can be proved.

Every [[irrational number]] has a unique representation by an infinite [[continued fraction]]

:&lt;math&gt;x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{\ddots\,}}}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is some [[integer]] and all the other numbers &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; are ''positive'' integers. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all irrational numbers that correspond to sequences &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; with the following property: there exists an infinite [[subsequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_{k_0},a_{k_1},\dots)&lt;/math&gt; such that each element is a [[divisor]] of the next element. This set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not Borel. In fact, it is [[analytic set|analytic]], and complete in the class of analytic sets. For more details see [[descriptive set theory]] and the book by [[Alexander S. Kechris|Kechris]], especially Exercise (27.2) on page 209, Definition (22.9) on page 169, and Exercise (3.4)(ii) on page 14.

Another non-Borel set is an inverse image &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[0]&lt;/math&gt; of an [[Parity function#Infinite parity function|infinite parity function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon \{0, 1\}^{\omega} \to \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. However, this is a proof of existence (via the axiom of choice), not an explicit example.

==Alternative non-equivalent definitions==

According to [[Paul Halmos|P. Halmos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Halmos|1950|loc=page 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subset of a locally compact Hausdorff topological space is called a ''Borel set'' if it belongs to the smallest [[Sigma-ring|σ–ring]] containing all compact sets.

Norberg and Vervaat &lt;ref&gt;Tommy Norberg and Wim Vervaat, Capacities on non-Hausdorff spaces, in: ''Probability and Lattices'', in: CWI Tract, vol. 110, Math. Centrum Centrum Wisk. Inform., Amsterdam, 1997, pp. 133-150&lt;/ref&gt; redefine the Borel algebra of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;–algebra generated by its open subsets and its compact [[Saturated set|saturated subset]]s. This definition is well-suited for applications in the case where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not Hausdorff. It coincides with the usual definition if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[second countable]] or if every compact saturated subset is closed (which is the case in particular if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff).

'''Clever Bins Limited''' was UK company that provided [[solar energy|solar]]-powered street [[litter bin]] that displayed digital [[outdoor advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=2515319 "Clever Bins a trademarked term"], ''Intellectual Property Office'', Published 5 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clever Bin==
The 'Clever Bins' came with [[A2 paper size|A2]] sized display panels that were lit up by directional [[LED]] beams. The panels came with military standard [[Riot shield]]ing. Some models of the bin could broadcast messages to nearby [[mobile device]]s.

The bins used solar power that, even in cloudy conditions, could charge the units for up to 7 hours of illumination. The level of illumination was regulated depending on the power available.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Funding==

In August 2009, Sachiti failed to find an investor on the BBCs TV show [[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragons' Den]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/entrepreneurs/williamsachiti.shtml "BBC Dragons Den Pitch"]''BBC Dragons Den Pitch '', Broadcast August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constantin Carathéodory''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Κωνσταντίνος Καραθεοδωρή ''Konstantinos Karatheodori''; 13 September 1873 – 2 February 1950) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] who spent most of his professional career in Germany. He made significant contributions to the [[real analysis|theory of functions of a real variable]], the [[calculus of variations]], and [[measure theory]]. His work also includes important results in [[conformal mapping|conformal representations]] and in the theory of boundary correspondence. In 1909, Carathéodory pioneered the ''Axiomatic Formulation of Thermodynamics'' along a purely geometrical approach.

== Origins ==
[[File:Caratheodory Constantin and Stephanos.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Constantin Caratheodory with his father.]]

Constantin Carathéodory was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Greeks|Greek]] parents and grew up in [[Brussels]]. His father Stephanos, a lawyer,  served as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassador to [[Belgium]], [[St. Petersburg]] and Berlin. His mother, Despina, née Petrokokkinos, was from the island of [[Chios]]. The Carathéodory family, originally from [[Bosnochori]] or [[Vyssa]], was well established and respected in [[Constantinople]], and its members held many important governmental positions.

The Carathéodory family spent 1874–75 in Constantinople (now Istanbul), where Constantin's paternal grandfather lived, while his father Stephanos was on leave. Then in 1875 they went to Brussels when Stephanos was appointed there as Ottoman Ambassador. In Brussels, Constantin's younger sister Julia was born. The year 1879 was a tragic one for the family since Constantin's paternal grandfather died in that year, but much more tragically, Constantin's mother Despina died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Cannes]]. Constantin's maternal grandmother took on the task of bringing up Constantin and Julia in his father's home in Belgium. They employed a German maid who taught the children to speak German. Constantin was already bilingual in French and Greek by this time.

Constantin began his formal schooling at a private school in Vanderstock in 1881. He left after two years and then spent time with his father on a visit to Berlin, and also spent the winters of 1883–84 and 1884–85 on the [[Italian Riviera]]. Back in Brussels in 1885 he attended a grammar school for a year where he first began to become interested in mathematics. In 1886, he entered the high school Athénée Royal d'Ixelles and studied there until his graduation in 1891. Twice during his time at this school Constantin won a prize as the best mathematics student in Belgium.

[[Image:Caratheodory family.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) pictured sitting with his father, brother in law and sister, Carlsbad 1898]]

At this stage Carathéodory began training as a military engineer. He attended the École Militaire de Belgique from October 1891 to May 1895 and he also studied at the École d'Application from 1893 to 1896. In 1897 [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a war broke out]] between Ottoman Empire and Greece. This put Carathéodory in a difficult position since he sided with the Greeks, yet his father served the government of the Ottoman Empire. Since he was a trained engineer he was offered a job in the British colonial service. This job took him to Egypt where he worked on the construction of the [[Assiut]] dam until April 1900. During periods when construction work had to stop due to floods, he studied mathematics from some textbooks he had with him, such as [[Camille Jordan|Jordan's]] ''Cours d'Analyse'' and Salmon's text on the analytic geometry of [[conic sections]]. He also visited the [[Pyramid of Cheops|Cheops pyramid]] and made measurements which he wrote up and published in 1901&lt;ref&gt;Brussells 1901 (Hayez);Ges. math. Schr. V. 273-281&lt;/ref&gt;. He also published a book on Egypt in the same year which contained a wealth of information on the history and geography of the country. &lt;ref&gt;H Aigyptos, Syllogos Ophelimon Biblion, no 14, 118 pp Athens 1901, 1928, New York 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies and university career ==
Carathéodory studied engineering in [[Belgium]] at the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], where he was considered a charismatic and brilliant student.

===University Career===

1900  Studies at [[University of Berlin]].
1902  Completed graduation at [[University of Göttingen]] (1904 Ph.D, 1905 Habilitation)
1908  Dozent at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]
1909  Ordinary Professor at [[University of Hannover|Hannover Technical High School]].
1910  Ordinary Professor at [[Wrocław University of Technology|Breslau Technical High School]].
1913  Professor following Klein at [[University of Göttingen]].
1919  Professor at [[University of Berlin]]
1919  Elected to [[Prussian Academy of Science]].
1920  University Dean at [[Ionian University of Smyrna]] (later, [[University of the Aegean]]).
1922  Professor at [[University of Athens]].
1922  Professor at [[Athens Polytechnic]].
1924  Professor following Lindemann at [[University of Munich]].
1938  Retirement from Professorship. Continued working from Bavarian Academy of Science

===Doctoral students===
Carathéodory had about 20 doctoral students among these being [[Hans Rademacher]], known for his work on analysis and number theory, and [[Paul Finsler]] known for his creation of [[Finsler space]].

===Academic contacts in Germany===
Carathéodory's contacts in Germany were many and included such famous names as: [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]], [[Einstein]], [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz|Schwarz]], [[Lipót Fejér|Fejér]]. During the difficult period of World War II his close associates at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences were Perron and Tietze.

===Academic contacts in Greece===
While in Germany Carathéodory retained numerous links with the Greek academic world about which detailed information may be found in Georgiadou's book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at Gŏttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carathéodory helped the Greek topologist [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos]] take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching in Athens University Carathéodory had as undergraduate student Evangelos Stamatis who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.&lt;ref&gt;J P Christianidis &amp; N Kastanis: ''In memoriam Evangelos S Stamatis (1898–1990) Historia Mathematica 19 (1992) 99-105''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculus of Variations===
In his doctoral dissertation Carathéodory originated his method based on the use of the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to light propagation in optics. The method became known as ''the royal road to the calculus of variations''.&lt;ref&gt;H. Boerner, ''Carathéodory und die Variationsrechnung'', in A Panayotopolos (ed.), Proceedings of C. Carathéodory International Symposium, September 1973, Athens (Athens, 1974), 80–90.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the same idea has been taken into the theory of [[optimal control]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Bellman|Bellman]] for his ''Dynamic programming'' in its continuous-time form used Carathéodory's work in the form of the [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]]. [[Rudolf E. Kálmán|Kálmán]] also explicitly used Carathéodory's formulation in his initial papers on optimal control. See e.g. R. E. Kalman: ''Contributions to the theory of optimal control''. Boletin de la Sociedad Matematica Mexicana 1960&lt;/ref&gt; The method can also be extended to multiple integrals.

===Real Analysis===
He proved an [[Carathéodory's existence theorem|existence theorem]] for the  solution to ordinary differential equations under mild regularity conditions.

===Theory of measure===
He is credited with the [[Carathéodory extension theorem]] which is fundamental to modern set theory. Later Carathéodory extended the theory from sets to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.

===Theory of functions of a complex variable===
He greatly extended the theory of [[conformal transformation]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Shields: ''Carathéodory and Conformal Mapping'' Math. Intelligencer vol.10(1), 1988&lt;/ref&gt; proving his [[Carathéodory's theorem (conformal mapping)|theorem]] about the extension of conformal mapping to the boundary of Jordan domains.  In studying boundary correspondence he originated the theory of [[prime end]]s.

===Thermodynamics===
In 1909, Carathéodory published a pioneering work "Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carathéodory|first=Constantin|title=Untersuchungen ueber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik|trans-title=Examination of the foundations of Thermodynamics| journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=67|year=1909|pages=355–386|doi=10.1007/bf01450409|translator-last=Delphinich|translator-first=D. H.|url=http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/caratheodory_-_thermodynamics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he formulated the [[Laws of Thermodynamics]] axiomatically. It has been said{{according to whom|date=January 2014}} that he was using only mechanical concepts and the theory of [[Johann Friedrich Pfaff|Pfaff']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s differential forms. But in reality he also relied heavily on the concept of an [[adiabatic process]]. The physical meaning of the term adiabatic rests on the concepts of [[heat]] and [[temperature]]. Thus, in Bailyn's survey of thermodynamics, Carathéodory's approach is called "mechanical", as distinct from "thermodynamic".&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, Woodbury NY, {{isbn|0-88318-797-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carathéodory's "first axiomatically rigid foundation of thermodynamics" was acclaimed by [[Max Born]]&lt;ref&gt;Max Born: ''The Born–Einstein Letters'', MacMillan 1971&lt;/ref&gt; but criticized by [[Max Planck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ist.utl.pt/ist12219/data/68.pdf Constantin Carathéodory and the axiomatic thermodynamics]'' by Lionello Pogliani and Mario N. Berberan-Santos&lt;/ref&gt;

In his theory he simplified the basic concepts, for instance ''heat'' is not an essential concept but a derived one. He formulated the axiomatic principle of irreversibility in thermodynamics stating that inaccessibility of states is related to the existence of entropy, where temperature is the integration function. The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was expressed via the following axiom: "In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state." In this connexion he coined the term [[adiabatic accessibility]].&lt;ref&gt;adiabatic accessibility = [[:de:Adiabatische Erreichbarkeit|adiabatische Erreichbarkeit]]; see also Elliott H. Lieb, Jakob Yngvason: [http://de.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9708200 ''The Physics and Mathematics of the Second Law of Thermodynamics''], Phys. Rep. 310, 1–96 (1999) and Elliott H. Lieb, (editors: B. Nachtergaele, J.P. Solovej, J. Yngvason): ''Statistical Mechanics: Selecta of Elliott H. Lieb'', 2005, {{isbn|978-3-540-22297-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optics===
Carathéodory's work in [[optics]] is closely related to his method in the calculus of variations.  In 1926&lt;ref&gt;''Über den Zusammenhang der Theorie der absoluten optischen Instrumente mit einem Satz der Variationsrechnung'', Münchener Sitzb. Math. -naturw Abteilung 1926 1–18; Ges. Math. Schr. II 181–197.&lt;/ref&gt; he gave a strict and general proof that no system of lenses and mirrors can avoid [[Aberration in optical systems|aberration]], except for the trivial case of plane mirrors.
In his later work he gave the theory of the [[Schmidt telescope]].

===Historical===
During the 2nd World War Carathéodory edited two volumes of [[Euler]]'s Complete Works dealing with the Calculus of Variations which were submitted for publication in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Euler Opera Omnia, Series 1 (a) vol.24: ''Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas maximi minimive gaudentes sive solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti''.  Lausanne &amp; Geneva 1744 (M. Bousquet) ed. C. Carathéodory Zürich 1952 (Fuesli). (b) vol.25 ''Commentationes analyticae ad calculum variationum pertinentes''. ed C. Carathéodory Zürich 1952 (Fuesli).&lt;/ref&gt;

===A conjecture===
He is credited with the authorship of the [[Carathéodory conjecture]] claiming that a closed convex surface admits at least two [[umbilic point]]s. As of 2007, this conjecture remained unproven despite having attracted a large amount of research.

== The University of Smyrna ==
[[File:Ionian University of Smyrna.jpg|thumb|Photo of the [[Ionian University of Smyrna]].]]

At the time, Athens was the only major educational centre in the wider area and had limited capacity to sufficiently satisfy the growing educational need of the eastern part of the Aegean Sea and the [[Balkans]]. Constantin Carathéodory, who was a Professor at the [[University of Berlin]] at the time, proposed the establishment of a new University &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/books-ideas/article/?aid=127956 Constantin Carathéodory: A Biography, newspaper article, 2000 "''(...) Είχε γνωρίσει τον Ελευθέριο Βενιζέλο από το 1895, στην Κρήτη, και από το 1913 είχε προτείνει τη δημιουργία δεύτερου ελληνικού πανεπιστημίου στη Θεσσαλονίκη. Ο πόλεμος που ξεσπάει μεταθέτει τις αποφάσεις. Στην Ελλάδα θα επανέλθει το 1930-32, όταν θα αποδεχθεί τη θέση του κυβερνητικού επιτρόπου και θα οργανώσει τα πανεπιστήμια Αθήνας και Θεσσαλονίκης με τον νόμο 5343/32, ο οποίος ίσχυε μέχρι προσφάτως. Από τη θέση αυτή θα τον απολύσει η κυβέρνηση Παπαναστασίου που διαδέχεται τον Βενιζέλο το 1932 και εκεί θα σταματήσει η ενεργός ανάμειξή του στα κοινά της Ελλάδας.''" (greek)]&lt;/ref&gt; - the difficulties regarding the establishment of a Greek university in [[Constantinople]] led him to consider three other cities: [[Thessaloniki]], [[Chios]] and [[Smyrna]].&lt;ref name="The importance of the foundation of the University of Smyrni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elemedu.upatras.gr/eriande/synedria/synedrio4/praktika1/pyrgiotakis.htm|title=The importance of the foundation of the University of Smyrna(Essay)|publisher=Department of Primary Education, University of Patras|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614082453/http://www.elemedu.upatras.gr/eriande/synedria/synedrio4/praktika1/pyrgiotakis.htm|archivedate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the invitation of the Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] he submitted a plan on 20 October 1919 for the creation of a new University at [[Smyrna]] in Asia Minor, to be named [[Ionian University of Smyrna]]. In 1920 Carathéodory was appointed Dean of the University and took a major part in establishing the institution, touring Europe to buy books and equipment. The university however never actually admitted students due to the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|War in Asia Minor]] which ended in the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]]. Carathéodory managed to save books from the library and was only rescued at the last moment by a journalist who took him by rowing boat to the battleship Naxos which was standing by.&lt;ref name="Constantin Carathéodory: His life and work"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24grammata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Caratheodori-24grammata.com_.pdf |title=Constantin Carathéodory: His life and work(Essay)|publisher=National Technical University of Athens |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222123424/http://www.24grammata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Caratheodori-24grammata.com_.pdf |archivedate=2017-12-22}}"''His daughter Mrs Despina Rodopoulou – Carathéodory referred to this period: “He stayed to save anything he could: library, machines etc which were shipped in different ships hoping that one day they will arrive in Athens. My father stayed until the last moment. George Horton, consul of U.S.A. in Smyrni wrote a book... which was translated in Greek. In this book Horton notes: “One of the last Greek I saw on the streets of Smyrna before the entry of the Turks was Professor Carathéodory, president of the doomed University. With him departed the incarnation of Greek genious of culture and civilization on Orient.” ''"&lt;/ref&gt; Carathéodory brought to Athens some of the university library and stayed in Athens, teaching at the university and technical school until 1924.

In 1924 Carathéodory was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Munich, and held this position until retirement in 1938. He later worked from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences until his death in 1950.

The new Greek University in the broader area of the Southeast Mediterranean region, as originally envisioned by Carathéodory, finally materialised with the establishment of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="Brief History of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/history|title=Brief History|publisher=Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic talent ==
Carathéodory excelled at languages, much like many members of his family did. [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[French language|French]] were his first languages, and he mastered [[German language|German]] with such perfection, that his writings composed in the German language are stylistic masterworks.&lt;ref&gt;Denker, Forscher und Entdecker: eine Geschichte der Bayerischen Akademie
 By Dietmar Willoweit p.263&lt;/ref&gt; Carathéodory also spoke and wrote [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and the [[ancient languages]] without any effort. Such an impressive linguistic arsenal enabled him to communicate and exchange ideas directly with other mathematicians during his numerous travels, and greatly extend his fields of knowledge.

Much more than that, Carathéodory was a treasured conversation partner for his fellow professors in the Munich Department of Philosophy. The well-respected, German [[philology|philologist]], professor of ancient languages Kurt von Fritz praised Carathéodory, saying that from him one could learn an endless amount about the old and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics. Fritz had numerous philosophical discussions with Carathéodory.

The Greek language was spoken exclusively in Carathéodory's house – his son Stephanos and daughter Despina went to a German high school, but they obtained daily additional instruction in Greek language and culture from a Greek priest. At home, they were not allowed to speak any other language.

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Caratheodory constantin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Constantin Caratheodory at a mature age.]]

In 2002, in recognition of his achievements, the University of Munich named one of the largest lecture rooms in the mathematical institute the Constantin-Carathéodory Lecture Hall.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~fmwus/download/ausgabe07.pdf Constantin Carathéodory-Hörsaal], mathe-lmu, Nr. 7/2002, Hrsg. Förderverein Mathematik in Wirtschaft, Universität und Schule an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München e.V., S. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Known correspondence Carathéodory–Einstein can be seen as facsimile in Einstein Archives Online (11 items). Three letters concern mathematics and these are printed in vol.8 of Einstein's Collected Works (Princeton Univ. Press 1987) now freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/papers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These letters are not on relativity but on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation which was of interest to Einstein in quantum mechanics. Carathéodory's work on relativity is in his 1924 paper referenced below &lt;/ref&gt;

In the town of Nea Vyssa, where Caratheodory's family came from, there is the unique Caratheodory's family museum. The museum is located in the central square of the town nearby the church and there are many personal items of Constantin as well as letters that he had exchanged with A. Einstein, for more information visit the original website of the club http://www.s-karatheodoris.gr. On the other hand, the Greek authorities intended for a long time to create a museum honoring Karatheodoris in [[Komotini]], a major town of the northeastern Greek region, which is more than 200&amp;nbsp;km far away for the town of Nea Vyssa where his family came from. On 21 March 2009, the museum "Karatheodoris" (Καραθεοδωρής) opened its gates to the public, in Komotini.&lt;ref&gt;{{el_icon}}{{cite web|url=http://www.karatheodori.gr/index.php?op=news&amp;lop=viewNew&amp;nid=20|title=Caratheodory Museum Opening|publisher= Friends of C.Caratheodory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org.au/media_news.php?act=detail&amp;id=267|title=Caratheodory Museum Opens|publisher=Hellenic Republic Embassy at Australia, Press and Communication Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2009/09-03-20.ana.html#36|title=Caratheodory Museum enriched with new exhibits|publisher=Athens News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coordinator of the Museum, Athanasios Lipordezis (Αθανάσιος Λιπορδέζης), noted that the museum gave home to original manuscripts of the mathematician of about 10,000 pages including correspondence of Carathéodory with the German mathematician Arthur Rozenthal for the algebraization of measure. Also visitors can view at the showcases the books ''" Gesammelte Mathematische Schriften Band 1,2,3,4 ", "Mass und Ihre Algebraiserung", " Reelle Functionen Band 1", " Zahlen/Punktionen Funktionen "'' and many more. Handwritten letters of C.Carathéodory to [[Albert Einstein]], [[Hellmuth Kneser]] and photographs of the Carathéodory family are on display.

The effort to furnish the museum with more exhibits is continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{el_icon}}{{cite web|url=http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,dt=23.03.2009,id=53237924|title=The museum of C.Carathéodory at Komotini|publisher=Eleftherotipia, major Greek newspaper|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002122646/http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,dt=23.03.2009,id=53237924|archivedate=2011-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{el_icon}}{{cite web|url=http://portal.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathextra_1_02/04/2009_273714| title= Carathéodory Museum: attractor|publisher=Kathimerini, major Greek newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{el_icon}}{{cite web|url=http://www.makthes.gr/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=35863|title=The museum of Carathéodory opened its gates to the public|publisher=Macedonia, Greek major newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4010">[[Image:Glider Instrument Panel.png|right|thumb|250px|Pilot's view of a [[Schempp-Hirth Janus]]-C [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]]. The yaw string (red wool) on the canopy and the [[turn and bank indicator]] (top center of the instrument panel) both show the glider is not in coordinated flight.  The glider is slipping slightly nose-left.  ''Coordinated flight'' can be restored by the pilot applying pressure to the right rudder pedal.]]
[[File:Türk Yıldızları 2210.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Türk Yıldızları]] performing a coordinated turn. In team [[aerobatics]] the notion is especially important, as sideslip may likely result in an in-flight collision.]] 
In [[aviation]], '''coordinated flight''' of an [[aircraft]] is flight without [[Slip (aerodynamic)|sideslip]].&lt;ref name=Clancy14.6&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 14.6&lt;/ref&gt;  

When an aircraft is flying with zero sideslip a [[turn and bank indicator]] installed on the aircraft’s instrument panel usually shows the ball in the center of the spirit level. The occupants perceive no lateral acceleration of the aircraft and their weight to be acting straight downward into their seats. 

Particular care to maintain coordinated flight is required by the pilot when entering and leaving turns.&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;[[Transport Canada]]: ''Flight Training Manual'', 4th edition, page 9. Gage Publishing, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7715-5115-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Coordinated flight is usually preferred over uncoordinated flight for the following reasons:
*it is more comfortable for the occupants
*it minimises the [[drag (physics)|drag]] force on the aircraft
*it causes fuel to be drawn equally from tanks in both wings
*it minimises the risk of entering a [[Spin (flight)|spin]]

==Instrumentation==
[[Airplane]]s and [[helicopter]]s are usually equipped with a [[turn and bank indicator]] to provide their pilots with a continuous display of the lateral balance of their aircraft so the pilots can ensure coordinated flight.

Glider pilots attach a piece of coloured string to the outside of the canopy to sense the [[sideslip angle]] and assist in maintaining coordinated flight.

==Axes of rotation==
{{main|Aircraft principal axes}}
An airplane has three axes of rotation:  
#'''Pitch''' – in which the nose of the airplane moves up or down. This is typically controlled by the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] at the rear of the airplane.
#'''Yaw''' – in which the nose of the airplane moves left or right. This is typically controlled by the [[rudder]] at the rear of the airplane.
#'''Roll''' (bank) – in which one wing of the airplane moves up and the other moves down. This is typically controlled by [[aileron]]s on the wings of the airplane.

Coordinated flight requires the pilot to use pitch, roll and yaw control simultaneously. See also [[flight dynamics]].

==Coordinating the turn==
If the pilot were to use only the [[Rudder#Aircraft_rudders|rudder]] to initiate a turn in the air, the airplane would tend to "skid" to the outside of the turn. &lt;ref name=Clancy14.7&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 14.7&lt;/ref&gt;

If the pilot were to use only the [[ailerons]] to initiate a turn in the air, the airplane would tend to "slip" toward the lower wing.&lt;ref name=Clancy14.7/&gt;

If the pilot were to fail to use the [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]] to increase the [[angle of attack]] throughout the turn, the airplane would also tend to "slip" toward the lower wing.&lt;ref name=Clancy14.6/&gt;

However, if the pilot makes appropriate use of the rudder, ailerons and elevator to enter and leave the turn such that sideslip and lateral acceleration are zero the airplane will be in coordinated flight. &lt;ref name=Clancy14.7/&gt;

He and his wife, Sally Gaines, began the committee in 1978.  They required help from students at [[Stanford University]], [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]], and [[Earlham College]].  From the information he collected he co-wrote a chapter in the book ''California Riparian Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=UhjbO_CC_VoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=UhjbO_CC_VoC&amp;pg=PA528&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=California Riparian Systems: Ecology, Conservation, and Productive Management|chapter=Destruction of Riparian Systems Due to Water Development in the Mono Lake|editor-last=Warner|editor-first=Richard E.|editor-last2=Hendrix|editor-first2=Kathleen M.|last=Stine|first=Scott|last2=Gaines|first2=David|last3=Vorster|first3=Peter|pages=528-533|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520050358|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This got scientist engaged to help.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1541">'''Dempster Brothers, Inc.''' of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], was an industrial firm that made [[waste collection vehicle|waste handling vehicles]] including  the '''Dempster Dumpmaster''' and '''Dempster Dinosaur'''. The firm was originally established by [[George Roby Dempster]] with his brothers Thomas and John Dempster.

==Dempster Dumpmaster==
The Dempster Dumpmaster, introduced in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tigerdude.com/garbage/frontload/index.html|title = Front-End Loaders|accessdate = 2014-12-30|website = History of refuse collection (or the garbage truck)|publisher = tigerdude.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first commercially successful, front-loading [[garbage truck]] in the United States. The product uses the ''Dempster-Dumpster'' system of mechanically emptying standardized metal containers, which had been patented by the company in 1937. It had arms at the front that picked up a [[dumpster]] and lifted it over the cab to tip it into the hopper. A rearward-traveling compacting panel compressed the garbage stored in the truck, and was also used to push it out through a door at the back when it was being emptied.

The '''Ensted Power Station''' (also known as the '''Aabenraa Power Station''') ({{lang-da|Enstedværket}}) is a [[Thermal power station|thermal power plant]] in [[Aabenraa]], [[Denmark]]. The power station is fueled by [[coal]], [[straw]] and [[woodchips]]. It is operated by [[DONG Energy]].

The power station has two units, which went in service in 1969 and 1977. The older unit, which was in 1997 transformed in a combined gas- and steam-turbine plant, has a total height from {{convert|127.7|m}} with its chimney on the roof. The chimney of the other unit is {{convert|180.7|m}} tall. Coal is delivered to the power station by ship. The harbour of the power plant is with a depth of {{convert|18|m}} the deepest of Denmark.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1663">The '''Exotic Tropic Timber Enterprises''' (ETTE) was formed by Fernando Robleda as a logging company in Liberia in February 1997. It later supplied arms to [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]] for his "[[Operation No Living Thing]]" in January 1998, in return for concessions, or a license, to harvest the [[Cavalla Reforestation and Research Plantation]] in Liberia. The supply of arms was in addition to cash payments made directly to Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein A (2011). The shadow world: Inside the global arms trade. New York, USA: Farrar, Straus and Giroux.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The company had received a license in May 1997 but this was revoked when Taylor came to power. The Ukrainian-Israeli [[Leonid Minin]] traveled with Robleda to Liberia to meet with Taylor in September 1998 to set up the deal. Minin became chairman of the board of ETTE on 10 December four days before the company was granted the license.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein A (2011). The shadow world: Inside the global arms trade.

A '''triggering sequence''', also called an '''explosive train''', is a sequence of events that culminates in the [[detonator|detonation]] of [[explosives]]. For safety reasons, most widely used high explosives are difficult to detonate. A primary explosive of higher sensitivity is used to trigger a uniform and predictable detonation of the main body of the explosive. Although the primary explosive itself is generally a more sensitive and expensive compound, it is only used in small quantities and in relatively safely packaged forms. By design there are low explosives and [[high explosive]]s made such that the low explosives are highly sensitive (i.e. their 'Figure of Insensitivity' is low) and high explosives are comparatively insensitive. This not only affords inherent safety to the usage of explosives during handling and transport, but also necessitates an explosive triggering sequence or explosive train. The explosive triggering sequence or the explosive train essentially consists of an 'initiator', an 'intermediary' and the 'high explosive'.   

For example, a match will not cause [[plastic explosive]] to explode, but it will light a fuse coupled with a blasting cap which will detonate a primary explosive that will shock a secondary high explosive and cause it to detonate. In this way, even very insensitive explosives may be used; the primary detonates a "booster" charge that then detonates the main charge. Triggering sequences are used in the mining industry for the detonation of [[ANFO]] and other cheap, bulk, and insensitive explosives that can not be fired by only a [[blasting cap]] or similar item.

== Low explosive train ==
An example of a low-explosive train is a rifle cartridge, which consists of 
# a [[Explosive primer|primer]] consisting of a small amount of [[primary explosive |primary]] [[high explosive]] which initiates the explosive train
# an [[igniter]] which is initiated by the primer and creates a flame that ignites the propellant
# a [[propellant]] consisting of a [[secondary explosive |secondary]] [[low explosive]] that emits a large amount of gas as it [[deflagration |deflagrates]].

== High explosive train ==
High-explosives trains can be either two-step (e.g., [[detonator]] and [[dynamite]]) or three-step (e.g., detonator, [[explosive booster|booster]] of [[primary explosive]], and main charge of [[secondary explosive]]).

=== Primary components ===
A high explosive train includes three primary high explosive components which are used to initiate explosives:
# [[Fuse (explosives)|Fuse]] or [[fuze]]
# [[Explosive_primer|Primer]]
# [[Detonator]]

Detonators are often made from [[tetryl]] and [[fulminate]]s.

=== Secondary components ===
In an explosive train there are two secondary high explosive components:
# [[explosive booster|Booster]]s
# [[Bursting charge]]s, also known as [[main charge]]s

Examples of bursting charges are
* [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]
* [[Composition B]]
* [[RDX]]
* [[PETN]]

=== Tertiary components ===
#[[main charge]]

Examples of main charges are
* [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]
* [[Composition B]]
* [[PETN]]

In some cases, the main charge is so insensitive that using typical primary materials becomes impractical due to large amount required. Thus, an explosive booster is used to deliver sufficient shockwave to the main charge.

The most significant tertiary material in widespread use is [[ANFO]].

The '''Ford C-Max''' (stylized as '''Ford C-MAX''' and previously called the '''Ford Focus C-Max''') is a [[compact MPV|compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV)]] produced by the [[Ford Motor Company]] since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=25711 |title=New Ford C-Max production begins in Saarlouis, Germany |publisher=Media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525173914/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=25711 |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Ford Grand C-Max''' has a larger [[wheelbase]].

Ford introduced the C-Max in the United States as its first [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid-only]] line of vehicles, which includes the '''C-Max Hybrid''', released in September 2012, and the '''C-Max Energi''' [[plug-in hybrid]], launched in October 2012. Although the C-Max was initially available only in Europe, the first generation was partially available in New Zealand. With the introduction of the new [[large MPV]]s [[Ford S-Max|S-Max]] and [[Ford Galaxy|Galaxy]], the C-Max is now the mid-sized [[multi-purpose vehicle]] in Ford's lineup, above the [[Ford B-Max|B-Max]].

C-Max Mk I was the first product to use the [[Ford C1 platform]], also used by the [[Ford Focus (second generation, Europe)|Ford Focus Mk II]] and the compact MPV [[Mazda Premacy|Premacy/Mazda5]]. Its internal code name is C214.

It seats five passengers and has a large amount of cargo space, which can be increased by folding the rear seats flat. Some models feature diagonally sliding outer rear seats. It also shares the control blade independent rear suspension from the Focus.

===Engines and transmissions===
The available [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder engines]] are the same as the Focus.&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.6 L''' [[Ford Sigma engine|Duratec]] was the basic engine for C-Max, 1.6 L Ti-VCT Duratec was also available.&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.8/2.0 L''' [[Ford Duratec engine|Duratec HE]] are the rest of available petrol engines&lt;br /&gt;

===Facelift===
In December 2006, the facelifted version of the C-Max was revealed at the 2006 [[Bologna Motor Show]] and went on sale in late spring 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=24947&amp;make_id=trust Ford Motor Company - Press Release - Ford Previews New C-Max At Bologna Motor Show] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125214513/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=24947&amp;make_id=trust |date=January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-facelift version of the car (2003–2007) was called the Ford Focus C-Max. The name change to C-Max is attributable to Ford's MPV strategy of creating a 'Max' branded line of MPVs, starting with the [[Ford S-Max]], launched in 2006.

The facelift brought the car in line with Ford's 'Kinetic Design' design language, evidenced through its twin trapezoidal grilles, large wheel arches and angular headlights. However, as the car does not have a bodyshell originally designed for 'Kinetic Design,' Ford officially states that the car contains only 'elements' of the design language.

Alongside the third generation [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus Mk III]], the second generation C-Max (C344) is built on Ford's new [[Ford C1 Platform|Global C platform]]. The appearance is inspired by the [[Ford Iosis#Iosis MAX|Iosis Max]] concept, shown at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. In addition, Ford added a long wheelbase, seven-seat [[minivan]] variant of the C-Max, the Ford Grand C-Max&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/234878/new_focus_on_horizon.html|title=New Focus on horizon|publisher=autoexpress.co.uk|date=2009-03-30|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paukert |first=Chris |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/03/ford-teases-new-five-seat-c-max-people-mover-ahead-of-frankfurt/ |title=Ford teases 2011 five-seat C-Max people mover ahead of Frankfurt debut |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early European models include 5 seats, and 7-seat models entered the market at the end of 2010 (except Russia, where there is only the 7-seat model). At the 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]], Ford announced a 7-seat C-MAX for the North American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/15/all-new-2011-ford-focus-to-debut-at-detroit-auto-show/ |title=All new 2011 Ford Focus to debut at Detroit Auto Show |publisher=Auto blog.com |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this model was cancelled prior to launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korzeniewski |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/09/ford-cancels-seven-passenger-c-max-for-north-america-focuses-so/ |title=Official: Ford cancels seven-passenger C-Max for U.S., focuses solely on Hybrid and Energi models |publisher=Auto Blog |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford unveiled the Ford C-Max Energi [[plug-in hybrid]] and the C-Max Hybrid at the 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]]. Like the conventional C-Max, the C-Max Energi and Hybrid are five-seat only. They replace the [[Ford Escape|Ford Escape Hybrid]] and [[Mercury Mariner|Mercury Mariner Hybrid]] since Ford discontinued the [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] brand after the 2011 [[model year]] and the Escape Hybrid after the 2012 year model. The C-Max is Ford's first hybrid-only line of vehicles. Both the plug-in and hybrid version designs are based on the European gasoline- and diesel-powered versions.&lt;ref name="SFC101212"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/C-Max-Hybrid-A-Ford-challenges-Prius-3915780.php|title=C-Max Hybrid: A Ford challenges Prius|date=2012-10-12|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ann M. Job|accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C-Max Hybrid was released in the United States in September 2012 as a 2013 [[model year]],&lt;ref name="USales0912" /&gt; followed by the release of the plug-in Energi version by mid October 2012.&lt;ref name="EnergiSales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/fords-evs-starting-slow-and-waiting-market-125120.html|title=Ford's Electric Cars: Starting Slow, and Waiting for the Market|date=2012-11-02|publisher=PluginCars.com|author=Jim Motavalli|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the C-Max Energi in the United States ended in September 2017, while Hybrid production ended in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-discontinues-c-max-production-for-u-s-market/ |title=Ford will discontinue C-Max production for U.S. market |publisher=Motor Trend |date= |accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===
The new Mk III platform is the first in its class to support [[Torque Vectoring]] Control (TVC).&lt;ref name="fordfan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordfan.de/fordcars/fordhighlights/ford-grand-c-max_3014/der-neue-ford-c-max-im-detail_2469/index.html |title=Ford Grand C-MAX / FordHighlights / FordCars / Ford Fan Site |publisher=Fordfan.de |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redesigned C-Max features flat folding third row seats, a hands free power lift gate, rear view camera, park assist, and panoramic sunroof. HD Radio, Sirius XM, Sync, dual-zone climate control system, and navigation system come as standard or as available options on the different trim lines.

The aerodynamics ([[drag coefficient]], ''c&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'') of the car has been improved, being 0,30 for the 5 seater and 0,32 for the Grand C-Max.&lt;ref name="fordfan1"/&gt;

===Conventional engines and transmissions===

Like the previous C-Max, the new C-Max also comes with a range of petrol and diesel [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder engines]] which are shared with the Focus:
* '''1.0 L''' [[Ford Ecoboost engine|Ecoboost]] comes available in two states of tune, alongside the 1.6 - 100&amp;nbsp;hp and 125&amp;nbsp;hp guises.
* '''1.6 L''' [[Ford Sigma engine|Duratec Ti-VCT]] is available in three spec, 85PS, {{Convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 125PS&lt;br /&gt;

The gasoline-electric hybrid model base pricing starts at {{USD|24,995}}, including destination and delivery.&lt;ref name=WP0712/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/2017/Ford/C-Max-Hybrid/SE-FWD/Pricing|title=New 2017 Ford C-Max Hybrid SE FWD MSRP Prices|website=NADAguides|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specifications ====
[[File:Ford C-Max Hybrid Automobile on Display at the Entrance to the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant.JPG|thumb|left|Ford C-Max Hybrid on display at the entrance to Ford's [[Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly]] plant]]
The front-wheel drive hybrid has a 2-liter four-cylinder [[Atkinson cycle]] engine mated to an electric motor and a 1.4 [[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] for total power output of 188&amp;nbsp;hp (140&amp;nbsp;kW). The top speed in [[all-electric mode]] of {{convert|62|mph|abbr=on}} and the car's top speed in hybrid mode is {{convert|115|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=SFC101212/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC070812/&gt;&lt;ref name=Specs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/specifications/engine/ |title=2013 C-MAX Specifications - Engine |author=Ford Motor Co. |publisher=Ford |accessdate=2012-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929044650/http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/specifications/engine/ |archive-date=2012-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid has a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|52.6|cuft|L|abbr=on}} with rear seats folded flat, and {{convert|24.5|cuft|L|abbr=on}} in the cargo area behind the rear seats, providing more room than the regular Prius liftback, but less cargo room than the [[Prius v]], which provides {{convert|67.3|cuft|L|abbr=on}} with the rear seats folded.&lt;ref name=SFC101212/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/specifications/capacities/|title=2013 C-MAX Specifications - Capacities|author=Ford Motor Co.|publisher=Ford|accessdate=2012-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123024831/http://www.ford.com/cars/cmax/specifications/capacities/|archive-date=2014-01-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hybrid''' is offered in two trims:

The '''SE''' features [[eco-friendly]] cloth seating surfaces, [[Ford SYNC]] system with A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player, [[USB]] and [[Jack (connector)|auxiliary]] input jacks, six speakers, a multi-informational gauge cluster and color display screen, keyless entry, alloy wheels, and split-folding rear bench seat, plus a security alarm.

The '''SEL''' adds leather seating surfaces, [[MyFord Touch]] with AM/FM [[HD Radio]] stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and [[USB]] and [[Jack (connector)|auxiliary]] input jacks, a [[Sony]] premium [[surround sound]] system, [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]], power dual front seats, keyless access, push-button start system, and other luxury features. For the 2017 model year, the SEL trim level on both the C-Max Hybrid and Energi will be renamed to the Titanium trim level and also all the 2017 Ford C-Max Hybrids and plug-in Energis are expected to have restyled headlights and taillights.

The '''Energi Plug-In Hybrid''' is only available in '''SEL''' trim. But for the 2017 model year the C-Max Energi is also available on the SE trim level.

==== EPA ratings ====

* Increasing the maximum pure electric speed from {{convert|62|to|85|mph|abbr=on}}, allowing increased use of electric-only mode on the highway
* Optimizing the use of Active Grille Shutters to reduce aerodynamic drag under more driving and temperature conditions including cold weather, during air conditioner use and when the engine coolant temperature is higher
* Reducing the electric fan speed as a function of coolant temperature to minimize the fan’s energy consumption
* Shortening engine warm-up time by up to 50% to enable electric-only driving and engine shutdown at stops sooner after cold starts
* Optimizing the climate control system to minimize use of the air conditioning compressor and reduce the energy used in cold weather operation.

====Fuel economy controversies====
{{update|section|date=June 2014|The section is missing the fuel economy downgrade that took place in June 2014}}

In December 2012, [[Motor Trend]] reported that [[Consumer Reports]] and Green Car Reports have found that the 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid and [[Ford Fusion Hybrid#Second generation|2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid]], which share the same powertrain, do not deliver their triple {{convert|47|mpgus|abbr=on}} EPA ratings in real-world use.&lt;ref name=MT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/we-hear-2013-ford-fusion-hybrid-2013-ford-c-max-hybrid-dont-achieve-epa-fuel-economy-ratings-300391.html#axzz2FqEZN68f|title=We Hear: 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid, C-Max Hybrid Don’t Achieve EPA Fuel-Economy Ratings |author= Jake Holmes|work=[[Motor Trend]]|date=2012-12-04|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CR1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2012/12/video-tests-show-2013-ford-fusion-c-max-hybrids-dont-live-up-to-47-mpg-claims.html|title=Tests show Ford Fusion, C-Max hybrids don't live up to 47-mpg claims |author=Consumer Reports |publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=2012-12-06|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCR1112&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1080580_ford-hybrids-fuel-economy-failing-to-live-up-to-epa-ratings|title=Ford Hybrids' Fuel Economy Failing To Live Up To EPA Ratings? |author=John Voelcker|publisher=Green Car Reports|date=2012-11-20|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After running both vehicles through Consumer Reports real-world tests, the magazine found that C-Max hybrid achieved a combined fuel economy average of {{convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|35|mpgus|abbr=on}} and {{convert|38|mpgus|abbr=on}} for city and highway.&lt;ref name=CR1212/&gt; Green Car Reports found that the C-Max delivered {{convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}} over {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}} of mixed freeway and urban driving, and {{convert|40|mpgus|abbr=on}} over {{convert|240|mi|abbr=on}} mostly at freeway speeds.&lt;ref name=GCR1112/&gt;

Consumer Reports concluded that the overall fuel economy for the C-Max Hybrid is off by 10 mpg, representing a deviation of about 20%. The consumer magazine said that their overall fuel economy results are usually close to the EPA's combined-mpg estimate, and among current models tested, more than 80% fall within 2 mpg margin. The largest discrepancy the magazine has previously found was 7 and 6 mpg for the [[Toyota Prius C]] and the [[Toyota Prius (XW30)|Prius hatchback]], respectively.&lt;ref name=CR1212/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT1212/&gt; Ford responded in a statement, saying that, "''Early C-MAX Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid customers praise the vehicles and report a range of fuel economy figures, including some reports above 47 mpg. This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary''."&lt;ref name=LAT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-inflated-fuel-economy-20121206,0,1964927.story|title=Consumer Reports says Ford Fusion, C-Max don't achieve MPG claims |author=Jerry Hirsch|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2012-12-06|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DT1212/&gt;

A few days later the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) said it would review claims that two new Ford hybrid vehicles were not delivering the advertised 47 mpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] commented that hybrids had far more variability in miles per gallon than conventional vehicles. All vehicles are run through the same EPA fuel-efficiency test but the test is not administered by the EPA; instead the automakers conduct the test and EPA often conducts reviews. Most vehicles's real-world gas mileage is less than the EPA sticker number, and can often be 20% less than depending on speed, temperature and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids the gap was much wider, as high as 30%.&lt;ref name=DT1212&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121208/AUTO0102/212080368#ixzz2FwSbbWeI|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122141818/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121208/AUTO0102/212080368%23ixzz2FwSbbWeI#ixzz2FwSbbWeI|dead-url=yes|title=EPA will review Ford C-Max, Fusion 47 mpg claims|author=David Shepardson and Karl Henkel|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2012-12-08|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem lay with EPA's rules that allowed automakers to group similar vehicles and apply the same ratings, which Ford did with the Fusion hybrid and C-Max hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodyard|first=Chris|title=Ford lowers C-Max hybrid's mpg rating, offers rebates|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/08/15/ford-cmax-mp/2660371/|work=USA Today|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford Motor Co. officials said the real-world fuel-efficiency in the C-Max Hybrid depended on driving style and other factors, and t rt he company did not expect the car's fuel efficiency numbers to change, as they followed EPA's test guidelines. Ford said they we re working closely with the EPA to determine if changes were needed for the industry relative to hybrid vehicle testing. They  explained that several factors could affect hybrid fuel economy more than that of regular gasoline engines, including speed (as the difference between 75&amp;nbsp;mph and 65&amp;nbsp;mph could produce a 7-mpg difference in fuel economy); outside temperature (the difference between 40&amp;nbsp;°F and 70&amp;nbsp;°F could result in a 5 mpg difference); and vehicle break-in (a 5 mpg difference could occur from the difference 0 miles to 6,0 miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121214/AUTO0102/212140426#ixzz2FwWJSPE7|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121123808/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121214/AUTO0102/212140426%23ixzz2FwWJSPE7#ixzz2FwWJSPE7|dead-url=yes|title=Ford stands behind fuel efficiency numbers for C-Max Hybrid|author=KARL HENKEL|work=[[The Detroit News]]|date=2012-12-14|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/12/cmax-20121215.html|title=Ford's math on hybrid fuel economy; standing by the C-MAX EPA ratings, acknowledging large real-world variance|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2012-12-15|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the criticism and lawsuits, in July 2013 Ford announced it would boost the on-road fuel efficiency of the C-Max and its other two 2013 hybrids through changes in the vehicle control software, in an effort to improve customer satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Upgrade/&gt; In August 2013, the carmaker voluntarily reduced the official EPA ratings in August 2013.&lt;ref name=NewEPArating/&gt; They also announced they would issue rebates to some 32,000 C-Max owners who would be notified by mail. The payment would be {{USD|550}} to U.S. customers who purchased C-Maxes, and {{USD|325}} to customers who had leased them.&lt;ref name=NewEPArating/&gt;

After the Ford announcement, the EPA stated that it will update the test procedures used to assign fuel economy ratings to cars "''to ensure that the requirements keep pace with industry trends and innovations in advanced high-efficiency vehicles''." Ford used the Fusion Hybrid test to generate the fuel economy label for the C-Max Hybrid following EPA's rules. These, which date to the 1970s, specify that automakers can use the same fuel economy numbers for similar-size vehicles equipped with the same engines and transmissions. The EPA requires automakers to test the fuel economy of the biggest-selling model in a specific category. In its midsize hybrid class, Ford tested the Fusion sedan version because it was the top seller, and Ford was allowed to apply the {{convert|47|mpgus|abbr=on}} achieved with the Fusion Hybrid in combined, city and highway driving to the C-Max hybrid. Ford has no plans to change the fuel economy ratings on the 2013 Fusion hybrid.&lt;ref name=NewEPArating/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/business/us-to-bring-gas-mileage-rules-to-era-of-hybrids.html?ref=automobiles&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=U.S. to Bring Gas Mileage Rules to Era of Hybrids |author=Bill Vlasic|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-08-15|accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plug-in Energi Hybrid family is currently either in or will soon be facing a class action suit due to the massive wear out rate on the battery storage capacity. https://www.girardgibbs.com/ford-mpg/

This is similar to the issues that affected early Nissan Leaf class action. https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1099200_nissan-leaf-battery-capacity-lawsuit-court-approves-settlement

The reason why they are similar is that similar language was used in the initial battery warranty by Nissan as is currently used by Ford.. that battery capacity loss is not warrantied whatsoever. In fact, this was not found to be acceptable for Nissan and a 20% limit was imposed, so only a matter of time before Ford is called to pay to repair, replace or otherwise make whole the many C-Max and Fusion Energi customers (the two cars shared the Energi battery system) who have massively reduced electric range.  What is typically seen is that in hot areas the ability to hold charge goes from "new" of about 5.8 kwh to less than 4.0 kwh, over a 30% drop in electric range, and in some instances that happens in 30,000 miles or less.

==== Specifications ====
The C-Max Energi was designed with total 188&amp;nbsp;hp (140&amp;nbsp;kW) in hybrid mode delivered by a 2.0-liter [[Atkinson cycle]] four-cylinder gasoline engine plus an electric motor powered by a 7.6 [[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, which is smaller and lighter than [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride batteries]] used in previous Ford generation hybrids.&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC1012/&gt; The electric drivetrain can produce a peak power of 68&amp;nbsp;kW, limited by the size of the electric motor and the power delivery capability of the battery pack, and delivers a total system power of 195&amp;nbsp;hp (150&amp;nbsp;kW) in [[charge-depleting]] mode (EV mode).&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt; The C-Max Energi is capable of reaching a top electric-only speed of {{convert|85|mph|abbr=on}}, exceeding the [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] by more than {{convert|20|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GCC070812/&gt; The top speed in hybrid mode is {{convert|115|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt;

The C-Max Energi uses a [[regenerative braking]] system capable of capturing and reusing more than 95% of the braking energy normally lost during the braking process. The charging time for the C-Max Energi is 7 hours with a 120 volt charger, and 2.5 hours with a 240 volt charger. The charge port has a LED light ring like the [[Ford Focus Electric]] and is located on the driver’s side and near the front of the car. The light ring illuminates to indicate charge status. The battery is covered by an eight years or {{convert|100000|mi|abbr=on}} component warranty.&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC1012/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0712&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/07/cmaxenergi-20120720.html|title=Ford expects 95 MPGe combined fuel economy, 20-mile all electric range from C-MAX Energi plug-in hybrid|author=Ford media (press release)|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2012-07-20|accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford equipped the C-Max Energi with a button mounted in the center stack that enables drivers to choose an electric-only driving mode, and allows the driver to switch vehicle operation between three modes: electric-only driving without gasoline engine power ("EV Now" setting); normal hybrid mode where the powertrain blends electric and gasoline engine power as appropriate ("EV Auto" setting); or a battery-saving mode that reserves the battery power for later use ("EV Later" setting).&lt;ref name=GCC070812/&gt; Like the [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]], the C-Max Energi comes with a SmartGauge with EcoGuide that provides in-vehicle customizable displays, including instantaneous fuel economy readings and coaching functions to help drivers understand and optimize their fuel efficiency. The plug-in hybrid also features ECO Cruise which saves energy by relaxing acceleration compared to standard [[cruise control]].&lt;ref name=Specs/&gt;&lt;ref name=HC1012/&gt;

      <comment>Authority for the danger of using the forward curve as a forecast</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5290">The '''forward curve''' is a [[Graph_of_a_function|function graph]] in [[finance]] that defines the prices at which a contract for future delivery or payment can be concluded today. For example, a futures contract forward curve is prices being plotted as a function of the amount of time between now and the expiry date of the futures contract (with the [[spot price]] being the price at time zero). The forward curve represents a term structure of prices.&lt;ref name=HandbuchEnergieHandel&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=von Schwintowski|editor1-first=Hans-Peter|editor2-last=Berlinghof|editor2-first=Britta|title=Handbuch Energiehandel|date=2010|publisher=Erich Schmidt Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3503154388|page=751|edition=2|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forward interest rate ==
A '''forward interest rate''' is a type of [[interest rate]] that is specified for a loan that will occur at a specified future date. As with current interest rates, forward interest rates include a term structure which shows the different forward rates offered to loans of different maturities. According to the unbiased expectations hypothesis, forward interest rates predict spot interest rates at the time the loan is actually made, but many analysts dispute whether this is true, as it ignore durational risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Together Now: The Forward Curve is Not a Forecast|url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2011/02/28/500181/all-together-now-the-forward-curve-is-not-a-forecast/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This figure is part of the lending &amp; credit industry and is related as well to the "[[expectations theory]]" which states that forward interest rates can be used as forecasts for future interest rates. Investors expecting higher short-term interest rates are more likely to buy [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s maturing in the short term. If they were to park money into a long term debt they might not be able to make as much interest.

Finance analysts can refer to a graph of forward interest rate values over different time periods, the forward curve, to evaluate the [[time value of money]].

== Price forward curve ==
A '''Price forward curves''' (short ''PFC'') reflects specialties of the [[commodity market]] such as:
* Transporting commodities is costly and time-consuming.
* It is costly to store commodities - [[electricity|power]] storage is often prohibitively expensive.
* Many commodities show a strong [[seasonality]], e.g. there is more [[natural gas]] demanded (for heating) in winter than in summer. 
In order to fairly value and manage the profitability of energy products it is thus necessary to capture these seasonal price dynamics in a forward curve term-structure.

The contract duration of a [[futures contract]] is limited by definition and [[investor]]s have to change their contract during the contract term. Price forward curves help to determine when to do that, two scenarios are possible:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Was sind Forward Curves?|url=http://www.finanzen.net/rohstoffe/forward-curve/|website=finanzen.net|publisher=Axel Springer|accessdate=13 January 2016|location=Karlsruhe, Germany|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# If the PFC is ascending, i.e. future commodity-contracts will be more expensive than at the moment, this is called [[contango]]. The investor will have additional costs as she has to sell her futures to a lower price than what she has to invest for her new futures.
# If the PFC is descending, it is a so-called [[backwardation]] and investors will make money by exchanging (''rolling'') their old [[futures contract]]s to new ones.

=== Hourly price forward curve ===
An hourly price forward curve (HPFC) is the construction of a forward curve at a resolution exceeding that known to the market and is as such able to capture the seasonalities of the electricity spot prices. The construction of an HPFC can be based on the combination of two approaches. A statistical approach examines how spot prices have moved in the past. A fundamental model suggests that the price is set purely by supply and demand (respectively, fuel prices on the merit order curve, and load).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hildman|first=Marcus |author2=Jeroen Cornel |author3=Florian Herzog |author4=Dejan Stokic |author5=Göran Andersson|title=Robust Calculation and Parameter Estimation of the Hourly Price Forward Curve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to specify exactly what makes a good HPFC, it should (1) be arbitrage-free for products traded on an exchange, (2) reflect the seasonality of spot prices, and (3) handle renewable energies correctly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hildman|first=Marcus |author2=Göran Andersson |author3=Grégoire Caro |author4=Donnacha Daly |author5=Sebastiano Rossi|title=What makes a good Hourly Price Forward Curve?|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such storms are not uncommon within the [[turbulence|turbulent]] atmospheres of [[gas giant]]s.

==Observation history==
[[Image:Pioneer 10 jup.jpg|thumb|left|209px|Image of Jupiter by ''Pioneer 10'' in 1974, showing a more solid-looking spot than when shown by ''Voyager 1'' in 1979]]

The Great Red Spot may have existed since before 1665, but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879.  The storm people had seen in the 1600s may have been a different storm than the one we see today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/jupiter-s-great-red-spot-a-swirling-mystery|author=Karl Hille|date=August 4, 2015|title=Jupiter's Great Red Spot: A Swirling Mystery|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from its seventeenth-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded, or even if the observational record was simply poor, are all unknown.&lt;ref name="Beebe1" /&gt;

For example, its first sighting is often credited to [[Robert Hooke]], who described a spot on the planet in May 1664; however, it is likely that Hooke's spot was in another belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, versus the current Great Red Spot's location in the South Equatorial Belt). Much more convincing is [[Giovanni Cassini]]'s description of a "permanent spot" the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1995), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; however, the 118-year observational gap makes the identity of the two spots inconclusive, and the older spot's shorter observational history and slower motion than the modern spot make their identity unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1995), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

A minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted in a 1711 canvas by [[Donato Creti]], which is exhibited in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On February 25, 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Smith ''et al'' (1979), 951-972.&lt;/ref&gt; when the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft was 9.2 million kilometres (5.7 million miles) from Jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot back to Earth. Cloud details as small as 160 kilometres (100 miles) across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the left (west) of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion.

At the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it reached a size of 40,000 kilometres. At the present rate of reduction it would become circular by 2040. It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of normal fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The oval object rotates counter-clockwise, with a period of about six Earth days&lt;ref&gt;Smith ''et al'' (1979), 954.&lt;/ref&gt; or fourteen Jovian days. Measuring 10,159 miles (16,350 kilometers) in width (as of April 3, 2017) Jupiter's Great Red Spot is 1.3 times as wide as Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-juno-spacecraft-spots-jupiter-s-great-red-spot|title=NASA’s Juno Spacecraft Spots Jupiter’s Great Red Spot|last=Perez|first=Martin|date=2017-07-12|work=NASA|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cloud]]-tops of this storm are about eight kilometres above the surrounding cloud-tops.

[[Infrared]] data have long indicated that the Great Red Spot is colder (and thus, higher in altitude) than most of the other clouds on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1995), 191.&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent infrared measurements of the upper atmosphere show far more heat above the Great Red Spot than the rest of the planet; "acoustic waves" rising from the storm have been proposed as an explanation for Jupiter's temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Careful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the spot's counter-clockwise circulation as far back as 1966, observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the ''Voyager'' fly-bys.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1995), 194-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The spot is confined by a modest eastward [[jet stream]] to its south and a very strong westward one to its north.&lt;ref&gt;Beebe (1997), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at ~120 metres per second (432 kilometres per hour), currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1995), 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The rotation period of the spot has decreased with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Great Red Spot's [[latitude]] has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its [[longitude]], however, is subject to constant variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reese, Elmer J.|author2=Solberg, H. Gordon|year=1966|title=Recent measures of the latitude and longitude of Jupiter's red spot|journal=Icarus|volume=5|issue=1–6|pages=266–273|bibcode=1966Icar....5..266R|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(66)90036-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2007-06-20 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1995), 192-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
Because Jupiter does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined
three different systems for defining the longitude. System II is used for latitudes of more than 10°, and was originally based on the average rotational period of the Great Red Spot of 9h&amp;nbsp;55m&amp;nbsp;42s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt, and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1995), 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known exactly what causes the Great Red Spot's reddish color. Theories supported by laboratory experiments suppose that the color may be caused by complex organic molecules, red phosphorus, or a compound containing sulphur, but a consensus has yet to be reached.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The Great Red Spot varies greatly in hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon, or even white. In fact, the spot occasionally "disappears", becoming evident only through the Red Spot Hollow, which is its {{clarify span|niche|what does niche mean in the context of planets? Does it fill a function here or is it just a location?|date=February 2018}} in the [[Cloud pattern on Jupiter|South Equatorial Belt]] (SEB). Its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB; when the belt is bright white, the spot tends to be dark, and when it is dark, the spot is usually light. These periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals; as of 1997, during the preceding 50 years, the spot was darkest in the periods 1961–1966, 1968–1975, 1989–1990, and 1992–1993.&lt;ref name="Beebe1"&gt;Beebe (1997), 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical dynamics==
There is no definitive theory as to what causes the formation or color of the Great Red Spot. Laboratory studies are examining the effects that [[cosmic ray]]s or [[UV radiation|UV Light]] from the Sun have on the chemical composition of the clouds of Jupiter. One question is whether the Sun's radiation reacts with [[ammonium hydrosulfide]] in the planet's outer atmosphere to create the deep red color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/jupiter-s-great-red-spot-a-swirling-mystery|title=Jupiter's Great Red Spot: A Swirling Mystery|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the storm produces extreme amounts of heat because it simultaneously generates [[gravity wave]]s and [[acoustic wave]]s. When these turbulent energy waves collide {{convert|500|mi|abbr=on}} above the red spot, they create extremely high temperatures in the planet's upper atmosphere. The effect is described as being like "crashing [..] ocean waves on a beach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jupiter-s-great-red-spot-likely-a-massive-heat-source|title=Jupiter's Great Red Spot Likely a Massive Heat Source|publisher=NASA|date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason the storm has continued to exist for centuries is that there is no planetary surface to provide friction (only a liquid core of [[hydrogen]]); circulating gas eddies persist for a very long time in the atmosphere because there is nothing to oppose their angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/JupiterGreatRedSpot.html|title=Jupiter's Atmosphere and Great Red Spot|publisher=www.astrophysicsspectator.com|date=November 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the video game ''[[Halo 3]]'', 2007.]]
The '''Halo Array''' is a group of fictional [[megastructure]]s and [[superweapon]]s in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' science fiction franchise, consisting of ring-shaped worlds known as Halos and a control station called the Ark. They are referred to as "Installations" by their AI monitors, and were created by an ancient race known as the [[Forerunners (Halo)|Forerunners]]. The series' alien antagonists, the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], refer to the Halos as the "Sacred Rings", believing them to form part of a greater religious prophecy known as "The Great Journey". According to ''Halo''{{'}}s fiction, the Forerunners built the Halo Array to contain and study the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], an infectious alien parasite. The rings act together as a weapon of last resort; when fired, they kill any sentient life capable of falling prey to the Flood, starving the parasite of its food. The installations are at the crux of the plot progression for the ''Halo'' series.

Each Halo features their own wildlife and weather. The constructs resemble [[Iain M. Banks]]' [[Orbital (The Culture)|Orbital]] concept in shape and design.&lt;ref name="cuddy"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure that ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' takes place on was initially to be a hollowed-out planet, but was changed to its ring design later in development; a staff member provided "Halo" as the name for both the ring and the video game after names such as ''Red Shift'' were suggested.

==Overview==
===Design and development===
The term "megastructure" refers to artificial structures where one of three dimensions is {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} or larger. The first use of a ring-shaped megastructure in fiction was [[Larry Niven]]'s novel ''[[Ringworld]]'' (1970). Niven described his design as an intermediate step between [[Dyson sphere]]s and planets - a ring with a radius of more than {{convert|93000000|mi|km|sp=us}} and a width of {{convert|1000000|mi|km|sp=us}}; these are dimensions far exceeding the ringworlds found in the ''Halo'' series, which feature radii of {{convert|6213.712|mi|km|sp=us}}&lt;ref name="grazier-39"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Halos are closer in proportion to a [[Bishop Ring (habitat)|Bishop Ring]], an actual proposed space habitat first explained by Forrest Bishop, though the proportions of the Halos do not exactly match up with Bishop's idea or more accurately the bigger [[Orbital (The Culture)|Orbital]]. As seen in the games, Halo installations feature a metallic exterior, with the interior of the ring filled with an atmosphere, water, plant life, and animal life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#hiatt|Hiatt (1999)]], 94–96.&lt;/ref&gt; What appear to be docking ports and windows dot the exterior surface, suggesting that a fraction of the ring structure itself is hollow and used for maintenance, living, and power generation.&lt;ref name="grazier-41"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the title for game developer [[Bungie]]'s next project was announced and development of the game that would become ''Halo'' was in its early stages, the megastructure that ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' took place on was a massive, hollowed-out planet called "Solipsis". The planet became a Dyson Sphere, and then a Dyson Ring.&lt;ref name="ign-history of halo"&gt;[[#history of halo|McLaughlin (2007)]], 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bungie staffers felt the change to a ringworld was "ripping off Larry Niven", according to Bungie artist Paul Russel.&lt;ref name="podcast-russell"&gt;[[#russel-podcast|Jarrard, et al (2008)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Bungie employee Frank O'Connor wrote in a post on Bungie that "the specific accusation that we swiped the idea of a ring-shaped planet wholesale is not accurate", explaining that Bungie used a ringworld because "it's cool and therefore the type of thing a Forerunner civilization would build."&lt;ref&gt;[[#literature and myth|Perry (2006)]], 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the game was known as ''Blam!'', but Bungie had always expected to replace the working title with something better. ''Blam!'' was used after studio co-founder [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] could not bring himself to tell his mother their next project was dubbed ''Monkey Nuts''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann (2004)]], ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Titles such as ''The Crystal Palace'', ''Hard Vacuum'', ''Star Maker'', ''Star Shield'', and ''The Santa Machine'' were suggested.&lt;ref name="ign-history of halo"/&gt; Russel suggested calling it ''Project: Halo'' because of the ring. Despite concerns that the title seemed too religious or lacked action, the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann (2004)]], 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, "Halo" became the ring's name as well.&lt;ref name="podcast-russell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#toyama|Toyama (2001)]], 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Combat Evolved''{{'}}s Halo was intended to be populated with large animal life,&lt;ref&gt;[[#PC Gamer 08/2000|Preston (2000)]], 19.&lt;/ref&gt; collectively known as Fauna. The Fauna included "pseudo-dinosaurs" and mammals,&lt;ref name="bungie-1mil years"/&gt; as well as a [[Chocobo]]-like creature—the "Blind Wolf"—that players could ride.&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;[[#evolution of halo|Lehto, et al (2002)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The animals were removed for technical and conceptual reasons; there were difficulties in getting herd and behavior action to work, and under pressure to complete the game's more central aspects, the animals were dropped. Bungie also felt that the desolate ring heightened the sense of Halo's mystery, and made the appearance of the parasitic [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] more terrifying and unexpected.&lt;ref name="bungie-1mil years"&gt;[[#1mil years|Bungie]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific analysis===
[[File:Lagrange very massive.svg|thumb|right|The five Lagrangian points in a two-body system. For ''Halo'', the gas giant is the yellow circle, the lone moon is the blue circle, and the ringworld is positioned at {{L1}}.]]
Physicist [[Kevin Grazier]] posited in a 2006 essay the composition and problems associated with a Halo installation. The complete Halos seen in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and ''Halo 2'' orbit [[gas giant]]s similar to [[Jupiter]], though much larger; the bodies exhibit characteristics of both a jovian planet and a small star.&lt;ref name="grazier-44"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In each system, there are five points where a body of negligible mass would remain stationary to the two much larger bodies in the system, the gas giant and its moon. These areas, known as [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]], are classified by stability; while bodies at 60° angles to the gas giant would remain in the same location relative to the other objects in the system, the other three Lagrange points are meta-stable, having the tendency to be unstable in one direction. As the Halos are located at point {{L1}}, the installations must actively correct its orbit.&lt;ref name="grazier-46"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent gravity of the Halo installations is close to Earth normal. A Halo would have to spin with a tangental speed of {{convert|7|km|mi|sp=us}} per second to match Earth's gravity, translating to 19.25 rotations in a day.&lt;ref name="grazier-49"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from its unstable position, Halos would have to contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence.&lt;ref name="grazier-44"/&gt; Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation.&lt;ref name="grazier-47"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.&lt;ref name="grazier-48"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the games, [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic analysis]] of the ring's composition proved "inconclusive", implying that the Halos are constructed of an unknown material ([[unobtainium]]). Were a Halo to be constructed using conventional materials a light steel alloy would be most feasible. Assuming that the ring structure is 50% empty space, a 5000&amp;nbsp;km ring composed of steel alloy at an average density of {{convert|7.7|g|oz}} per {{convert|1|cc|cuin|sp=us}} would result in a total mass of 1.7x10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref name="grazier-41"/&gt; The amount of material required to build such a ring would be akin to the total material available in the [[asteroid belt]].&lt;ref name="grazier-42"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installations==
===Installation 03===
{{see also|Halo 4}}
'''Installation 03''', also referred to as '''Gamma Halo''', appears in ''[[Halo 4]]''. It is monitored by 049 Abject Testament and is located in the Khaphrae system, orbiting a damaged planet. Whilst no gameplay takes place on the installation, an extremely dense asteroid field surrounding the installation is the site of the UNSC scientific research base ''Ivanoff''. It is here that UNSC scientists are conducting experiments on the Forerunner artifact called the Composer, which has the ability to convert biological forms, specifically humans, into AIs. After the game's antagonist, the Didact, activates the device, the UNSC base is left uninhabited. In ''Halo: Escalation'', a series of comics which follows many events after ''Halo 4'', establishes that 049 Abject Testament has long disappeared from the ring, leading a monitor to arrive at the Installation, just to be ambushed by a still living Didact, using the Installation to use the Composer.

===Installation 04===
{{see also|Halo: Combat Evolved}}
'''Installation 04''', also referred to as '''Alpha Halo''', appears in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''. The majority of gameplay takes place in areas on this installation, and its exploration drives the story.&lt;ref name="trautmann-77"/&gt; The ring was managed by an artificial intelligence known as [[Characters of Halo#343 Guilty Spark|343 Guilty Spark]], and is located in the Soell system, dominated by a gas giant known as Threshold.&lt;ref name="grazier-43"&gt;[[#halo science 101|Grazier (2006)]], 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Halo orbits Threshold's only satellite, an extremely large moon known as Basis.&lt;ref name="grazier-44"/&gt; A group of humans aboard the ship ''Pillar of Autumn'' crash-land on the ring after being pursued by the alien Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann (2004)]], viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The ring holds religious significance to the aliens, while the humans believe it is a weapon that could turn the tide of the war against the Covenant in their favor.&lt;ref name="trautmann-77"&gt;[[#art of halo|Trautmann (2004)]], 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the ring is home to a virulent parasite called the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], which is accidentally released by the Covenant and threatens to infest the galaxy. The human soldier [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] eventually detonates the ''Pillar of Autumn''{{'}}s reactors in order to destabilize the ring and cause it to break up, preventing the spread of the Flood and the activation of the Halo network, which would kill all sentient life as a fail-safe to starve the Flood.&lt;ref name="barrat-2"&gt;[[#the story so far|Barrat (2007)]], 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ark was alerted to its destruction and proceeded to create another ring, which, too, was destroyed by Master Chief. During the game's events, Guilty Spark alludes to a previous firing of the network, which Bungie's director of cinematics [[Joseph Staten]] said occurred around 100,000 years previous to the events of the game in the year [[2552]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#HBO interview|McLees, et al (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt; After Installation 04 was destroyed, a shard of the ring was sent through slipspace to orbit a [[red giant]]. The supernova-like detonation of the ''Pillar of Autumn'' creates a new element on the ring shard which is fatal to humans. Appearing in ''Halo: Nightfall'', the shard is visited by a team of ONI operatives and colonial militia following a terrorist attack with the new element. With only a limited time before the shard's sunrise kills them, the team struggles to destroy the deposits and capture the smugglers mining it. Only two of the team manage to escape while Colonel Randall Aiken, a former Spartan supersoldier, sacrifices himself to destroy the deposits with a nuclear weapon.

===Installation 05===
{{see also|Halo 2}}
During the events of ''[[Halo 2]]'', the Covenant and humans discover a second ringworld, '''Installation 05''', or '''Delta Halo'''. It was monitored by 2401 Penitent Tangent, who completely ignored Flood warnings and was captured by their leader, the [[Gravemind]]. The Covenant leadership wants to activate the installation, believing it is the key to their salvation.&lt;ref&gt;"'''Cortana''': That's what I thought he said. The Prophet of Regret is planning to activate Halo! / '''Master Chief''': Are you sure? / '''Prophet of Regret''': I shall light this sacred ring, release its cleansing flame, and burn a path into the divine beyond! / '''Cortana''': Pretty much."—{{cite video game|title=Halo 2|date=2004|developer=Bungie|publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|level=Regret}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Flood, led by an intelligence known as the Gravemind, lay siege to the Covenant's city-ship, ''High Charity''. After 343 Guilty Spark informs Halo's true purpose to the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]], a Covenant holy warrior, of the danger that the Halos truly represent, a group of humans and Covenant Elites prevent the firing of the ring.&lt;ref name="barrat-3"&gt;[[#the story so far|Barrat (2007)]], 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected shutdown activates a fail-safe protocol, priming the remaining Halo installations for remote activation from a location known as The Ark.&lt;ref&gt;"'''343 Guilty Spark:''' Fail-safe protocol: in the event of unexpected shut-down, the entire system will move to standby status. All installations are now ready for remote activation. / '''Keyes:''' Remote activation? From here? / '''343 Guilty Spark:''' Don't be ridiculous. [...] the Ark, of course."—{{cite video game|title=Halo 2 |developer=Bungie |publisher=Microsoft |date=2004|level=The Great Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Halo 4'', it is revealed that the UNSC has created an oversight base on the Installation (or around it), as they did with Installation 03.

===The Ark===
{{see also|Halo 3}}
'''The Ark''', also referred to as '''Installation 00''', is located outside the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and serves as the construction and control station for the Halo weapon system. It does not share the ringworld geometry of the other installations. During ''[[Halo 3]]'', the Covenant discover a portal on Earth that leads to the Ark and are pursued by the humans and a breakaway faction of Covenant opposed to activating the rings. Gravemind, having hijacked ''High Charity'', crash-lands on the installation. The remote firing of the rings is halted by Master Chief and the Arbiter. In order to end the threat of the Flood, Master Chief decides to activate Installation 08 under construction in The Ark, the replacement for the Halo that he destroyed in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. Unknown to everyone but 343 Guilty Spark, a premature firing would destroy the installation; the monitor attempted to defend 'his' ring but was destroyed by Master Chief, who proceeded to fire the weapon. The firing tears apart the incomplete Halo and severely damages The Ark as Master Chief, [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]], and the Arbiter try to escape through the Portal, which closes as they enter, leaving Master Chief and Cortana drifting in space while the Arbiter returns to Earth successfully. The Ark appears in other ''Halo'' novels and the video game ''[[Halo Wars 2]]''.

===Installation 08===
{{see also|Halo 3}}
A replacement for Installation 04 that is constructed by the Ark upon the original's destruction in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. Identical to the original ring, the replacement is mostly complete when the Ark is found a few months after the destruction of Installation 04, but is unfinished enough that parts of its superstructure are visible. [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]] describes it as "so new, unfinished." After the death of the Prophet of Truth, the new ring rises from the Ark's Foundry in front of the Master Chief and the Arbiter who realize that the ring, disconnected from the rest of the network and safely outside the Milky Way galaxy, can be fired to destroy the local infestation on the Ark without harming anything else. After rescuing Cortana from ''High Charity'', the Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson attempt to fire the ring, angering 343 Guilty Spark who knows that doing so will destroy the installation in its present state and heavily damage the Ark. Spark kills Johnson, but is destroyed by the Master Chief before Cortana fires the installation. The Master Chief and the Arbiter manage to escape aboard the ''Forward Unto Dawn'', but the ring's firing causes the Portal to close, severing the ship in half and stranding the Master Chief in space. Firing Installation 08 ends the Flood infestation upon the Ark and destroys the [[Gravemind]] and itself. However, in ''Halo Wars 2: Awakening the Nightmare'', Flood infection forms are revealed to have survived in the ruins of ''High Charity'' and are accidentally unleashed again by the Banished before the Flood are contained once more.

===Installation 09===
{{see also|Halo Wars 2}}
In ''Halo Wars 2'', a second replacement for Installation 04 is found nearly complete on the Ark by the crew of the UNSC ''Spirit of Fire''. With no way back to human space, the crew decides to launch the replacement ring with a distress beacon aboard to Installation 04's original position, thereby signaling for help. A conflict with the Banished occurs on the installation, but Professor Ellen Anders, after disarming the ring's superweapon, is able to take control of the installation's gravity anchors and launch part of its landmass into space, killing the Banished forces. The ring and Anders enter slipspace, but are pulled out prematurely by a construct known as a Guardian.

'''Heavy water''' ('''deuterium oxide''', '''{{Chem|2|H|2|O}}''', '''{{Chem|D|2|O}}''') is a form of [[water (molecule)|water]] that contains a larger than normal amount of the [[hydrogen isotope]] [[deuterium]] ({{Chem|2|H}} or D, also known as ''heavy hydrogen''), rather than the common [[hydrogen-1]] isotope ({{Chem|1|H}} or H, also called [[Diprotium|protium]]) that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=heavy water|file=H02758}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal "light water".

==Explanation==
Deuterium is a hydrogen isotope with a nucleus containing a [[neutron]] and a [[proton]]; the nucleus of a protium (normal hydrogen) atom consists of just a proton. The additional neutron makes a deuterium atom roughly twice as heavy as a protium atom.

A molecule of heavy water has two deuterium atoms in place of the two protium atoms of ordinary "light" water. The weight of a heavy water molecule, however, is not substantially different from that of a normal water molecule, because about 89% of the molecular weight of water comes from the single [[oxygen]] atom rather than the two hydrogen atoms. The colloquial term ''heavy water'' refers to a highly enriched water mixture that contains mostly deuterium oxide {{chem|D|2|O}}, but also some hydrogen-deuterium oxide (HDO) and a smaller number of ordinary hydrogen oxide {{chem|H|2|O}} molecules. For instance, the heavy water used in [[CANDU reactor]]s is 99.75% enriched by hydrogen atom-fraction—meaning that 99.75% of the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy type. For comparison, [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|ordinary water]] (the "ordinary water" used for a deuterium standard) contains only about 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms, meaning that 0.0156% of the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy type.

Heavy water is not [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. In its pure form, it has a density about 11% greater than water, but is otherwise physically and chemically similar. Nevertheless, the various differences in deuterium-containing water (especially affecting the biological properties) are larger than in any other commonly occurring [[isotopologue|isotope-substituted compound]] because deuterium is unique among heavy [[stable isotope]]s in being twice as heavy as the lightest isotope. This difference increases the [[bond energy|strength]] of water's hydrogen-oxygen bonds, and this in turn is enough to cause differences that are important to some biochemical reactions. The human body naturally contains deuterium equivalent to about five grams of heavy water, which is harmless. When a large fraction of water (&gt; 50%) in higher organisms is replaced by heavy water, the result is [[Cell (biology)|cell]] dysfunction and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=10535697 |title=Pharmacological uses and perspectives of heavy water and deuterated compounds |author1=D. J. Kushner |author2=Alison Baker |author3=T. G. Dunstall |journal=Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=79–88 |date=1999 |doi=10.1139/cjpp-77-2-79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy water was first produced in 1932, a few months after the discovery of deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/fac-bios/brus/group/pages/urey.html| title = Harold Clayton Urey (1893–1981)|website = [[Columbia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] in late 1938, and the need for a [[neutron moderator]] that captured few neutrons, heavy water became a component of early [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] research. Since then, heavy water has been an essential component in some types of reactors, both those that generate power and those designed to produce isotopes for nuclear weapons.

Most modern reactors use [[enriched uranium]] with ordinary water as the moderator.

==Other heavy forms of water==
===Semiheavy water===
'''Semiheavy water''', HDO, exists whenever there is water with light hydrogen (protium, {{chem|1|H}}) and deuterium (D or {{chem|2|H}}) in the mix. This is because hydrogen atoms (hydrogen-1 and deuterium) are rapidly exchanged between water molecules. Water containing 50% H and 50% D in its hydrogen actually contains about 50% HDO and 25% each of {{chem|H|2|O}} and {{chem|D|2|O}}, in [[dynamic equilibrium]].
In normal water, about 1 molecule in 3,200 is HDO (one hydrogen in 6,400 is in the form of D), and heavy water molecules ({{chem|D|2|O}}) only occur in a proportion of about 1 molecule in 41 million (i.e. one in 6,400&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus [[semiheavy water]] molecules are far more common than "pure" (homoisotopic) heavy water molecules.

===Heavy-oxygen water===
Water enriched in the heavier oxygen isotopes [[oxygen-17|{{chem|17|O}}]] and [[oxygen-18|{{chem|18|O}}]] is also commercially available, e.g., for [[doubly labeled water|use as a non-radioactive isotopic tracer]]. It is "heavy water" as it is denser than normal water ({{chem|H|2}}{{chem|18|O}} is approximately as dense as {{chem|D|2|O}}, {{chem|H|2}}{{chem|17|O}} is about halfway between {{chem|H|2|O}} and {{chem|D|2|O}})—but is rarely called heavy water, since it does not contain the deuterium that gives D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O its unusual nuclear and biological properties. It is more expensive than D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O due to the more difficult separation of &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.&lt;ref&gt;Mosin, O. V, Ignatov, I. (2011) Separation of Heavy Isotopes Deuterium (D) and Tritium (T) and Oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) in Water Treatment, Clean Water: Problems and Decisions, Moscow, No. 3–4, pp. 69–78.&lt;/ref&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O is also used for production of [[fluorine-18]] for [[radiopharmaceutical]]s and [[radiotracer]]s and for [[positron emission tomography]].

===Tritiated water===
[[Tritiated water]] contains [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H) in place of protium (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) or deuterium (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H), and therefore it is radioactive.

The physical properties of water and heavy water differ in several respects. Heavy water is less dissociated than light water at given temperature, and the true concentration of D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is less than {{H+}} ions would be for a light water sample at the same temperature. The same is true of OD&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; vs. {{OH-}} ions. For heavy water Kw D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (25.0&amp;nbsp;°C) = 1.35 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;, and [D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;{{hsp}}] must equal [OD&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;{{hsp}}] for neutral water. Thus pKw D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = p[OD&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] + p[D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 7.44 + 7.44 = 14.87 (25.0&amp;nbsp;°C), and the p[D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] of neutral heavy water at 25.0&amp;nbsp;°C is 7.44.

The pD of heavy water is generally measured using pH electrodes giving a pH (apparent) value, or pHa, and at various temperatures a true acidic pD can be estimated from the directly pH meter measured pHa, such that pD+ = pHa (apparent reading from pH meter) + 0.41.  The electrode correction for alkaline conditions is 0.456 for heavy water. The alkaline correction is then pD+ = pH&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(apparent reading from pH meter) + 0.456. These corrections are slightly different from the differences in p[D+] and p[OD-] of 0.44 from the corresponding ones in heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuceng.ca/candu/pdf/15%20-%20Chemistry%20in%20CANDU%20Process%20Systems.pdf discussion of pD+],&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy water is 10.6% denser than ordinary water, and heavy water's physically different properties can be seen without equipment if a frozen sample is dropped into normal water, as it will sink. If the water is ice-cold the higher melting temperature of heavy ice can also be observed: it melts at 3.7&amp;nbsp;°C, and thus does not melt in ice-cold normal water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/a07160a72252c010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |title=How 2.0 |accessdate=21 January 2008 |last=Gray |first=Theodore |date=2007 |website= |publisher=Popular Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216010940/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/a07160a72252c010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |archivedate=16 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early experiment reported not the "slightest difference" in taste between ordinary and heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/81/2098/273-a |title= CONCERNING THE TASTE OF HEAVY WATER|doi=10.1126/science.81.2098.273-a  |date=15 March 1935 |accessdate=14 August 2010 |volume=81 |issue= 2098|journal=Science |page=273|bibcode = 1935Sci....81..273U |pmid=17811065 | last1 = Urey | first1 = HC | last2 = Failla | first2 = G}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rats given a choice between distilled normal water and heavy water were able to avoid the heavy water based on smell, and it may have a different taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0031-9384(79)90124-0 |title= Taste responses to deuterium oxide | volume=23 |journal=Physiology |pages=69–74 |year=1979 | last1 = Miller | first1 = Inglis J. | last2 = Mooser | first2 = Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No physical properties are listed for "pure" semi-heavy water, because it is unstable as a bulk liquid. In the liquid state, a few water molecules are always in an [[Self-ionisation of water|ionised state]], which means the hydrogen atoms can exchange among different oxygen atoms. Semi-heavy water could, in theory, be created via a chemical method, but it would rapidly transform into a dynamic mixture of 25% light water, 25% heavy water, and 50% semi-heavy water.  However, if it were made in the gas phase and directly [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] into a solid, semi heavy water in the form of ice could be stable. This is due to collisions between water vapour molecules being almost completely negligible in the gas phase at standard temperatures, and once crystallized, collisions between the molecules cease altogether due to the rigid lattice structure of solid ice.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Effect on biological systems==
Different [[isotopes]] of chemical elements have slightly different chemical behaviors, but for most elements the differences are far too small to use, or even detect. For hydrogen, however, this is not true. The larger chemical isotope-effects seen between protium (light hydrogen) versus deuterium and [[tritium]] manifest because bond energies in chemistry are determined in quantum mechanics by equations in which the quantity of [[reduced mass]] of the nucleus and electrons appears. This quantity is altered in heavy-hydrogen compounds (of which deuterium oxide is the most common) more than for heavy-isotope substitution in other chemical elements.&lt;ref name=deuteriumeffects /&gt; This isotope effect of heavy hydrogen is magnified further in biological systems, which are very sensitive to small changes in the solvent properties of water.

Heavy water is the only known chemical substance that affects the period of [[circadian rhythm|circadian oscillations]], consistently increasing the length of each cycle. The effect is seen in unicellular organisms, green plants, isopods, insects, birds, mice, and hamsters. The mechanism is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A Differential Effect of Heavy Water on Temperature-Dependent and Temperature-Compensated Aspects of the Circadian System of Drosophila pseudoobscura |author1=Pittendrigh, C.

To perform their tasks, [[enzyme]]s rely on their finely tuned networks of [[hydrogen bond]]s, both in the active center with their substrates, and outside the active center, to stabilize their [[tertiary structure]]s.

Particularly hard-hit by heavy water are the delicate assemblies of [[mitotic spindle]] formation necessary for [[mitosis|cell division]] in [[eukaryote]]s.

It is more toxic to malignant cells than normal cells but the concentrations needed are too high for regular use.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt; As in chemotherapy, deuterium-poisoned mammals die of a failure of bone marrow (bleeding and infection) and intestinal-barrier functions ([[diarrhea]] and fluid loss).

Despite the problems of plants and animals in living with too much deuterium, [[prokaryotic]] organisms such as bacteria, which do not have the mitotic problems induced by deuterium, may be grown and propagated in fully deuterated conditions, resulting in replacement of all hydrogen atoms in the bacterial proteins and DNA with the deuterium isotope.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trotsenko, Y.

Full replacement with heavy atom isotopes can be accomplished in higher organisms with other non-radioactive heavy isotopes (such as carbon-13, nitrogen-15, and oxygen-18), but this cannot be done for the stable heavy isotope of hydrogen. This is a consequence of the relative difference in nuclear mass between the isotopes of hydrogen that is the greatest in all elements.&lt;ref name=isotopegeochem&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoefs|first=J.|year=1997|publisher=Springer|title=Stable Isotope Geochemistry|isbn=3-540-61126-6|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deuteriumeffects&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosin|first=O.|last2=Ignatov|first2=I.|date=2015|title=The Isotopic Effects of Deuterium on Biological Objects|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1031.2239&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Journal of Medicine, Physiology and Biophysics|volume=10|pages=46-70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This isotopic effect alters physical properties of heavy water to a greater extent than other isotopes, and consequently induces toxicity at high concentration due to slowing down of essential biochemical reactions.&lt;ref name=deuteriumeffects /&gt;

Deuterium oxide is used to enhance [[boron neutron capture therapy]], but this effect does not rely on the biological effects of deuterium per se, but instead on deuterium's ability to moderate (slow) neutrons without capturing them.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt;

===Toxicity in humans===
Because it would take a very large amount of heavy water to replace 25% to 50% of a human being's body water (water being in turn 50–75% of body weight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = P. E. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1980 | title = Total body water volumes for adult males and females estimated from simple anthropometric measurements | url = | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 27–39 | pmid = 6986753 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/33.1.27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) with heavy water, accidental or intentional [[poison]]ing with heavy water is unlikely to the point of practical disregard. Poisoning would require that the victim ingest large amounts of heavy water without significant normal water intake for many days to produce any noticeable toxic effects.

Oral doses of heavy water in the range of several grams, as well as [[Oxygen-18|heavy oxygen]] &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, are routinely used in human metabolic experiments. See [[doubly labeled water]] testing. Since one in about every 6,400 hydrogen atoms is deuterium, a 50&amp;nbsp;kg human containing 32&amp;nbsp;kg of body water would normally contain enough deuterium (about 1.1&amp;nbsp;g) to make 5.5&amp;nbsp;g of pure heavy water, so roughly this dose is required to double the amount of deuterium in the body.&lt;!--- atomic mass of water, taking into account the three isotopes of hydrogen and the three of oxygen, is 18.01527; 32 kg of water is thus 1776.27 mol. Figuring in the abundances, we get 1.114014 g of deuterium (0.553258 mol); if we mix this with half as many moles of mean oxygen (0.138359 mol × 15.99930457 mol/g), we get 5.54 g of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ---&gt;

A loss of blood pressure may partially explain the reported incidence of dizziness upon ingestion of heavy water. However, it is more likely that this symptom can be attributed to altered [[vestibular system|vestibular function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Money|author2=Myles|title=Heavy water nystagmus and effects of alcohol|journal=Nature|date=February 1974|volume=247|pages=404–405|doi=10.1038/247404a0|pmid=4544739|bibcode = 1974Natur.247..404M|first1=K. E.|issue=5440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy water radiation contamination confusion===
Although many people associate heavy water primarily with its use in nuclear reactors, pure heavy water is not radioactive. Commercial-grade heavy water is slightly radioactive due to the presence of minute traces of natural tritium, but the same is true of ordinary water. Heavy water that has been used as a coolant in nuclear power plants contains substantially more tritium as a result of neutron bombardment of the deuterium in the heavy water ([[Tritium#Health risks|tritium is a health risk]] when ingested in large quantities).

In 1990, a disgruntled employee at the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]] in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a "half cup") of heavy water from the primary heat transport loop of the [[nuclear reactor]], and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving [[bioassay]] urine samples with elevated [[tritium]] levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.at/nni/site.php?site=Point++Lepreau |title=Point Lepreau in Canada |publisher=NNI (No Nukes Inforesource) |accessdate=10 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070710224724/http://www.ecology.at/nni/site.php?site=Point++Lepreau &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water. Some news services were not careful to distinguish these points, and some of the public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in the water cooler indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected to get much more than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.&lt;ref&gt;

==Production==
On [[Earth]], deuterated water, HDO, occurs naturally in normal water at a proportion of about 1 molecule in 3,200. This means that 1 in 6,400 hydrogen atoms is deuterium, which is 1 part in 3,200 by weight (hydrogen weight). The HDO may be separated from normal water by [[distillation]] or [[electrolysis]] and also by various chemical exchange processes, all of which exploit a [[kinetic isotope effect]]. With the partial enrichment also occurring in natural bodies of water under particular evaporation conditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ068i017p05079 Isotopic exchange effects in the evaporation of water: 1. Low‐temperature experimental results H. Craig&lt;/ref&gt;   (For more information about the isotopic distribution of deuterium in water, see [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]].) 
In theory, deuterium for heavy water could be created in a nuclear reactor, but separation from ordinary water is the cheapest bulk production process.

The difference in mass between the two hydrogen isotopes translates into a difference in the [[zero-point energy]] and thus into a slight difference in the speed of the reaction. Once HDO becomes a significant fraction of the water, heavy water becomes more prevalent as water molecules trade hydrogen atoms very frequently. Production of pure heavy water by distillation or electrolysis requires a large cascade of stills or electrolysis chambers and consumes large amounts of power, so the chemical methods are generally preferred.

The most cost-effective process for producing heavy water is the dual temperature exchange sulfide process (known as the [[Girdler sulfide process]]) developed in parallel by [[Karl-Hermann Geib]] and [[Jerome S. Spevack]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=HW&gt;{{Cite report |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0206076.pdf |title=An Early History of Heavy Water |last=Waltham |first=Chris |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |date=August 1998 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=4620909 |title=Method for isotope replenishment in an exchange liquid used in a laser |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; patented by Graham M. Keyser, uses [[lasers]] to selectively dissociate deuterated [[hydrofluorocarbons]] to form deuterium [[fluoride]], which can then be separated by physical means. Although the energy consumption for this process is much less than for the Girdler sulfide process, this method is currently uneconomical due to the expense of procuring the necessary hydrofluorocarbons.

As noted, modern commercial heavy water is almost universally referred to, and sold as, '''deuterium oxide'''. It is most often sold in various grades of purity, from 98% enrichment to 99.75–99.98% deuterium enrichment (nuclear reactor grade) and occasionally even higher isotopic purity.

===Argentina===
[[Argentina]] is the main producer of heavy water, using an ammonia/hydrogen exchange based plant supplied by Switzerland's [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] company. It is also a major exporter to Canada, Germany, the US and other countries. The heavy water production facility located in [[Arroyito, Neuquén|Arroyito]] is the world's largest heavy water production facility. Argentina produces {{convert|200|ST|t|abbr=off}} of heavy water per year{{Clarify timeframe|date=October 2018}} using, not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S bithermal method, but ''monothermal ammonia-hydrogen isotopic exchange''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trimodbesta.com/ru/references/references-plant-engineering.html?getFile=ApplicationInformation_BAG_201510/500_plant/AI_BAG_Arroyito_HeavyWater_LTG501EN1510_English_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Trimod Besta : Arroyito Heavy Water Production Plant, Argentina |website=Trimodbesta.com |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ecabert, R. |url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:16017940 |title=The heavy water production plant at Arroyito, Arge..&amp;#124;INIS |issue=3 |pages=21–24 |journal=Sulzer Technical Review |volume=66 |accessdate=2017-01-11|year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Garcia, E.E. |url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:16038740 |title=The projects for heavy water production of the Arg..&amp;#124;INIS |pages=50–64 |journal=Energia Nuclear (Buenos Aires) |accessdate=2017-01-11|year=1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Conde Bidabehere, Luis F. |url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:33064784 |title=Heavy water.

===Soviet Union===
In October 1939, [[Soviet]] [[physicists]] [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] and  [[Yulii Borisovich Khariton]] concluded that heavy water and carbon were the only feasible moderators for a natural uranium reactor, and in August 1940, along with [[Georgy Flyorov]], submitted a plan to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] calculating that 15 tons of heavy water were needed for a reactor.  With the [[Soviet Union]] having no uranium mines at the time, young Academy workers were sent to Leningrad photographic shops to buy uranium nitrate, but the entire heavy water project was halted in 1941 when German forces invaded during [[Operation Barbarossa]].

By 1943, Soviet scientists had discovered that all scientific literature relating to heavy water had disappeared from the West, which Flyorov in a letter warned Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] about,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Events/1942-1945/espionage.htm | title=Manhattan Project: Espionage and the Manhattan Project, 1940-1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at which time there was only 2–3&amp;nbsp;kg of heavy water in the entire country.  In late 1943, the Soviet purchasing commission in the U.S. obtained 1&amp;nbsp;kg of heavy water and a further 100&amp;nbsp;kg in February 1945, and upon [[World War II]] ending, the [[NKVD]] took over the project.

In October 1946, as part of the [[Russian Alsos]], the [[NKVD]] deported to the [[Soviet Union]] from [[Germany]] the German scientists who had worked on heavy water production during the war, including [[Karl-Hermann Geib]], the inventor of the [[Girdler sulfide process]].&lt;ref name=KG&gt;{{Cite report | url=http://sworld.com.ua/e-journal/j11505.pdf#page=3 | title=Heavywater.

===United States===
During the [[Manhattan Project]] the United States constructed three heavy water production plants as part of the [[P-9 Project]] at Morgantown Ordnance Works, near [[Morgantown, West Virginia]]; at the Wabash River Ordnance Works, near Dana and [[Newport, Indiana]]; and at the Alabama Ordnance Works, near Childersburg and [[Sylacauga, Alabama]]. Heavy water was also acquired from the Cominco plant in [[Trail, British Columbia]], Canada. The [[Chicago Pile-3]] experimental reactor used heavy water as a moderator and went critical in 1944. The three domestic production plants were shut down in 1945 after producing around 20 metric tons of product{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} (around 20,000 litres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://convert-to.com/conversion/water-weight-volume/convert-metric-tonne-t-water-weight-to-liter-l-of-water-volume.html |title=Convert metric tonnes of water to liters of water &amp;#124; water volume vs. weight conversion |website=Convert-to.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wabash plant was reopened and began resumption of heavy water production in 1952.

In 1953, the United States began using heavy water in [[plutonium]] production reactors at the [[Savannah River Site]]. The first of the five heavy water reactors came online in 1953, and the last was placed in cold shutdown in 1996. The SRS reactors were heavy water reactors so that they could produce both plutonium and [[tritium]] for the US nuclear weapons program.

The U.S. developed the [[Girdler sulfide process|Girdler sulfide]] chemical exchange production process—which was first demonstrated on a large scale at the [[Dana, Indiana]] plant in 1945 and at the Savannah River Plant, South Carolina in 1952. [[DuPont]] operated the SRP for the USDOE until 1 April 1989, when [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] took it over.

===India===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
India is one of the world's largest producers of heavy water through its [[Heavy Water Board]] and also exports to countries like Republic of Korea and the US. Development of heavy water process in India happened in three phases: The first phase (late 1950s to mid-1980s) was a period of technology development, the second phase was of deployment of technology and process stabilisation (mid-1980s to early 1990s) and third phase saw consolidation and a shift towards improvement in production and energy conservation.

===Empire of Japan===
In the 1930s, it was suspected by the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] that Austrian chemist [[Fritz Johann Hansgirg]] built a pilot plant for the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese ruled northern Korea]] to produce heavy water by using a new process he had invented.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{Cite report |url=https://www.academia.edu/7850196/1945_When_Korea_Faced_Its_Post-Colonial_Future |title=1945: When Korea Faced Its Post-Colonial Future |last=Streifer |first=Bill |publisher=[[Academia.edu]] |date= |accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{Main|Norwegian heavy water sabotage}}
[[File:Deuterium oxide Norsk.jpg|thumb|left|"Heavy water" made by [[Norsk Hydro]]]]
In 1934, [[Norsk Hydro]] built the first commercial heavy water plant at [[Vemork]], [[Tinn]], with a capacity of 12 tonnes per year.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Norsk Hydro Rjukan]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940 and throughout [[World War II]], the plant was under [[Nazi Germany|German]] control and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] decided to destroy the plant and its heavy water to inhibit German development of nuclear weapons. In late 1942, a planned raid by British airborne troops failed, both gliders crashing. The raiders were killed in the crash or subsequently executed by the Germans. On the night of 27 February 1943 [[Operation Gunnerside]] succeeded. Norwegian commandos and local resistance managed to demolish small, but key parts of the electrolytic cells, dumping the accumulated heavy water down the factory drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Thomas|title=Assault In Norway: Sabotaging the Nazi Nuclear Program|publisher=The Lyons Press|year=2002|location=Guilford, Connecticut|isbn=978-1585747504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 1943, the Allied air forces dropped more than 400 bombs on the site. The Allied air raid prompted the Nazi government to move all available heavy water to Germany for safekeeping. On 20 February 1944, a Norwegian partisan sank the ferry [[SF Hydro|M/F&amp;nbsp;''Hydro'']] carrying heavy water across [[Lake Tinn]], at the cost of 14 Norwegian civilian lives, and most of the heavy water was presumably lost. A few of the barrels were only half full, and therefore could float, and may have been salvaged and transported to Germany.

Recent investigation of production records at Norsk Hydro and analysis of an intact barrel that was salvaged in 2004&lt;!--reference: documentary on PBS/Discovery Channel--&gt; revealed that although the barrels in this shipment contained water of [[pH]]&amp;nbsp;14—indicative of the alkaline electrolytic refinement process—they did not contain high concentrations of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=NOVA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3216_hydro.html |title=Hitler's Sunken Secret (transcript) |publisher=NOVA Web site |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |author=[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent size of the shipment, the total quantity of pure heavy water was quite small, most barrels only containing 0.5–1% pure heavy water. The Germans would have needed a total of about 5 tons of heavy water to get a nuclear reactor running.&lt;!--reference: documentary on Nova / Hitler's Sunken Treasure--&gt; The manifest clearly indicated that there was only half a ton of heavy water being transported to Germany. ''Hydro'' was carrying far too little heavy water for one reactor, let alone the 10 or more tons needed to make enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon.&lt;ref name="NOVA"/&gt;

Israel admitted running the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center|Dimona reactor]] with Norwegian heavy water sold to it in 1959. Through re-export using Romania and Germany, India probably also used Norwegian heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinproject.org/pubs/editorials/1988/3scandals.htm "3 Scandals Oslo Must Put to Rest"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423220548/http://www.wisconsinproject.org/pubs/editorials/1988/3scandals.htm |date=23 April 2012 }}.

===Canada===
As part of its contribution to the [[Manhattan Project]], Canada built and operated a 6-tonnes-per-year electrolytic heavy water plant at [[Trail, British Columbia]], which started operation in 1943.

The [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) design of power reactor requires large quantities of heavy water to act as a [[neutron moderator]] and coolant. AECL ordered two heavy water plants, which were built and operated in [[Atlantic Canada]] at [[Glace Bay]], [[Nova Scotia]] (by Deuterium of Canada Limited) and [[Port Hawkesbury]], Nova Scotia (by General Electric Canada). These plants proved to have significant design, construction and production problems. Consequently, AECL built the Bruce Heavy Water Plant ({{Coord|44.1854|-81.3618|type:landmark_region:CA|name=Bruce Heavy Water Plant|display=inline}}),&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt; which it later sold to [[Ontario Hydro]], to ensure a reliable supply of heavy water for future power plants. The two Nova Scotia plants were shut down in 1985 when their production proved unnecessary.

The [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station|Bruce Heavy Water Plant]] (BHWP) in [[Ontario]] was the world's largest heavy water production plant with a capacity of 1600 tonnes per year at its peak (800 tonnes per year per full plant, two fully operational plants at its peak). It used the [[Girdler sulfide process]] to produce heavy water, and required 340,000 tonnes of feed water to produce one tonne of heavy water. It was part of a complex that included eight [[CANDU reactor]]s, which provided heat and power for the heavy water plant. The site was located at [[Douglas Point]]/[[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] near Tiverton, Ontario on [[Lake Huron]] where it had access to the waters of the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]].&lt;ref name="CSR on BHWP decommissioning"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/EADDB84F-docs/report_e.pdf|publisher=Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission|accessdate=21 February 2018|date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AECL issued the construction contract in 1969 for the first BHWP unit (BHWP A). Commissioning of BHWP A was done by Ontario Hydro from 1971 through 1973, with the plant entering service on June 28, 1973 and design production capacity being achieved in April 1974. Due to the success of BHWP A and the large amount of heavy water that would be required for the large numbers of upcoming planned CANDU nuclear power plant construction projects, Ontario Hydro commissioned three additional heavy water production plants for the [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station|Bruce site]] (BHWP B, C, and D). BHWP B was placed into service in 1979. These first two plants were significantly more efficient than planned, and the number of CANDU construction projects ended up being significantly lower than originally planned, which led to the cancellation of construction on BHWP C &amp; D. In 1984 BHWP A was shut down. By 1993 Ontario Hydro had produced enough heavy water to meet all of its anticipated domestic needs (which were lower than expected due to improved efficiency in the use and recycling of heavy water), so they shut down and demolished half of the capacity of BHWP B. The remaining capacity continued to operate in order to fulfill demand for heavy water exports until it was permanently shut down in 1997, after which the plant was gradually dismantled and the site cleared.&lt;ref name="BHWP performance"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DAVIDSON|first1=G.

AECL is currently researching other more efficient and environmentally benign processes for creating heavy water. This is essential for the future of the CANDU reactors since heavy water represents about 15&amp;ndash;20% of the total capital cost of each CANDU plant.&lt;ref name="CHWP 1970–1980" /&gt;

===Iran===
Since 1996 [[IR-40|a plant]] for production of heavy water was being constructed at Khondab near [[Arak, Iran|Arak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/arak-hwpp.htm|title=Arak – Heavy Water Production Plant |publisher=globalsecurity.org |date=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 2006, Iranian President [[Ahmadinejad]] inaugurated the expansion of the country's heavy-water plant. Iran has indicated that the heavy-water production facility will operate in tandem with a 40 MW research reactor that had a scheduled completion date in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/08/26/uiran.xml |title=Iran's president launches a new nuclear project |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=27 August 2006 |accessdate=10 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713013652/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F08%2F26%2Fuiran.xml |archivedate=13 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/arak.htm |title=Arak – Iran Special Weapons Facilities |publisher=globalsecurity.org |date=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
The 50 MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; heavy water and natural uranium research reactor at Khushab, in Punjab province, is a central element of Pakistan's program for production of plutonium, deuterium and tritium for advanced compact warheads (i.e. [[thermonuclear weapons]]). Pakistan succeeded in acquiring a tritium purification and storage plant and deuterium and tritium precursor materials from two German firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/pakistan/facility/khushab.htm |title=Khushab Heavy Water Plant |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Romania produces heavy water at the [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Drobeta]] Girdler sulfide plant for domestic and export purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peopletales.blogspot.com/2015/04/heavy-water-candu-reactors-and-living.html |title=History or Utopia: 45) Heavy water, nuclear reactors and... the living water |website=Peopletales.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France operated a small plant during the 1950s and 1960s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Heavy water exists in elevated concentration in the [[hypolimnion]] of [[Lake Tanganyika]] in [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001085/108584eb.pdf |title=Limnology and hydrology of Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi; Studies and reports in hydrology; Vol.:54; 1997 |website=Unesdoc.unesco.org |format=PDF |page=39|date= |accessdate=2017-01-11}} H Craig 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  It is likely that similar elevated concentrations exist in lakes with similar [[limnology]], but this is only 4% enrichment (24 vs 28)&lt;ref&gt;H Craig 1974 http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4ct114wz#page-55&lt;/ref&gt; and surface waters are usually enriched in {{chem|D|2|O}} by evaporation to even greater extend by faster {{chem|H|2|O}} evaporation.  &lt;!--This lake Tanganyika entry do not warrant a special case worth mentioning. It is still minimal enrichment. What is only unusual that the heavy water lie on the bottom, what is explained by paleo-lalake-history from colder dry past times --&gt;

==Applications==
===Nuclear magnetic resonance===
Deuterium oxide is used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] when using water as solvent if the [[nuclide]] of interest is hydrogen. This is because the signal from light-water (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) solvent molecules interfere with observing the signal from the molecule of interest dissolved in it. Deuterium has a different [[magnetic moment]] and therefore does not contribute to the [[H-1 NMR|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR]] signal at the hydrogen-1 resonance frequency.

For some experiments, it may be desirable to identify the labile hydrogens on a compound, that is hydrogens that can easily exchange away as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions on some positions in a molecule.  With addition of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, sometimes referred to as a ''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O shake'', labile hydrogens exchange away and are substituted by deuterium (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) atoms. These positions in the molecule then do not appear in the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectrum.

===Organic chemistry===
Deuterium oxide is often used as the source of deuterium for preparing specifically labelled [[isotopologue]]s of organic compounds. For example, C-H bonds adjacent to ketonic carbonyl groups can be replaced by C-D bonds, using acid or base catalysis. [[Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide]], made from [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] and [[methyl iodide]] can be recrystallized from deuterium oxide, and then dissociated to regenerate methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, both deuterium labelled. In cases where specific double labelling by deuterium and tritium is contemplated, the researcher must be aware that deuterium oxide, depending upon age and origin, can contain some tritium.

===Infrared spectroscopy===
Deuterium oxide is often used instead of water when collecting [[Fourier transform spectroscopy|FTIR]] spectra of proteins in solution. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O creates a strong band that overlaps with the [[amide]] I region of proteins. The band from D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is shifted away from the amide I region.

===Neutron moderator===
Heavy water is used in certain types of [[nuclear reactors]], where it acts as a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down neutrons so that they are more likely to react with the [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] than with [[uranium-238]], which captures neutrons without fissioning.
The CANDU reactor uses this design. Light water also acts as a moderator,  but because light water absorbs more [[neutron]]s than heavy water, reactors using light water for a reactor moderator must use [[enriched uranium]] rather than natural uranium, otherwise [[Critical mass|criticality]] is impossible. A significant fraction of outdated power reactors, such as the [[RBMK]] reactors in the USSR, were constructed using normal water for cooling but [[graphite-moderated reactor|graphite as a moderator]]. However, the danger of graphite in power reactors (graphite fires in part led to the [[Chernobyl disaster]]) has led to the discontinuation of graphite in standard reactor designs.

Because they do not require [[uranium enrichment]], [[heavy water reactor]]s are more of a concern in regards to [[nuclear proliferation]]. The breeding and extraction of plutonium can be a relatively rapid and cheap route to building a [[nuclear weapon]], as chemical separation of plutonium from fuel is easier than [[isotopic separation]] of U-235 from natural uranium.
Among current and past [[nuclear weapons states]], Israel, India, and North Korea&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/TRS407_scr/D407_scr1.pdf|title=HEAVY WATER REACTORS: STATUS AND PROJECTED DEVELOPMENT|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; first used plutonium from heavy water moderated reactors burning [[natural uranium]], while China, South Africa and Pakistan first built weapons using [[highly enriched uranium]].

In the U.S., however, the first experimental atomic reactor (1942), as well as the [[Manhattan Project]] Hanford production reactors that produced the plutonium for the [[Trinity test]] and [[Fat Man]] bombs, all used pure carbon (graphite) neutron moderators combined with normal water cooling pipes. They functioned with neither enriched uranium nor heavy water. Russian and British plutonium production also used graphite-moderated reactors.

There is no evidence that civilian heavy water power reactors—such as the CANDU or [[Atucha I nuclear power plant|Atucha]] designs—have been used to produce military fissile materials. In nations that do not already possess nuclear weapons, nuclear material at these facilities is under [[IAEA]] safeguards to discourage any diversion.

Due to its potential for use in [[nuclear weapon]]s programs, the possession or import/export of large industrial quantities of heavy water are subject to government control in several countries. Suppliers of heavy water and heavy water production technology typically apply [[IAEA]] (International Atomic Energy Agency) administered safeguards and material accounting to heavy water. (In Australia, the ''Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987''.) In the U.S. and Canada, non-industrial quantities of heavy water (i.e., in the gram to kg range) are routinely available without special license through chemical supply dealers and commercial companies such as the world's former major producer [[Ontario Hydro]].

===Neutrino detector===
The [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]] uses 1,000 tonnes of heavy water on loan from [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]]. The [[neutrino detector]] is {{convert|6800|ft|m}} underground in a mine, to shield it from [[muon]]s produced by [[cosmic ray]]s. SNO was built to answer the question of whether or not electron-type [[neutrino]]s produced by fusion in the [[Sun]] (the only type the Sun should be producing directly, according to theory) might be able to turn into other types of neutrinos on the way to Earth. SNO detects the [[Cherenkov radiation]] in the water from high-energy electrons produced from electron-type [[neutrino]]s as they undergo charged current (CC) interactions with [[neutron]]s in [[deuterium]], turning them into protons and electrons (however, only the electrons are fast enough to produce Cherenkov radiation for detection). SNO also detects neutrino↔electron scattering (ES) events, where the neutrino transfers energy to the electron, which then proceeds to generate Cherenkov radiation distinguishable from that produced by CC events. The first of these two reactions is produced only by electron-type neutrinos, while the second can be caused by all of the neutrino flavors. The use of deuterium is critical to the SNO function, because all three "flavours" (types) of neutrinos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/sno/sno2.html |title=The SNO Detector |publisher=The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Institute, Queen's University at Kingston |accessdate=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be detected in a third type of reaction as well, neutrino-disintegration, in which a neutrino of any type (electron, muon, or tau) scatters from a deuterium nucleus ([[deuteron]]), transferring enough energy to break up the loosely bound deuteron into a free [[neutron]] and [[proton]] via a neutral current (NC) interaction. This event is detected when the free neutron is absorbed by &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; present from NaCl deliberately dissolved in the heavy water, causing emission of characteristic capture gamma rays. Thus, in this experiment, heavy water not only provides the transparent medium necessary to produce and visualize Cherenkov radiation, but it also provides deuterium to detect exotic mu type (μ) and tau (τ) neutrinos, as well as a non-absorbent moderator medium to preserve free neutrons from this reaction, until they can be absorbed by an easily detected neutron-activated isotope.

===Metabolic rate testing in physiology and biology===
{{main article|Doubly labeled water test}}
Heavy water is employed as part of a mixture with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O for a common and safe test of mean metabolic rate in humans and animals undergoing their normal activities.

===Tritium production===
{{See also|Tritium#Deuterium}}
[[Tritium]] is the active substance in [[tritium illumination|self-powered lighting]] and controlled nuclear fusion, its other uses including [[autoradiography]] and [[radioactive label]]ing. It is also used in [[nuclear weapon design]] for [[boosted fission weapon]]s and [[tritium#Neutron initiator|initiators]]. Some tritium is created in [[heavy water moderated reactor]]s when deuterium captures a neutron. This reaction has a small [[Neutron cross-section|cross-section]] (probability of a single neutron-capture event) and produces only small amounts of tritium, although enough to justify cleaning tritium from the moderator every few years to reduce the environmental risk of tritium escape.

Producing a lot of tritium in this way would require reactors with very high neutron fluxes, or with a very high proportion of heavy water to [[nuclear fuel]] and very low [[neutron absorption]] by other reactor material. The tritium would then have to be recovered by [[isotope separation]] from a much larger quantity of deuterium, unlike production from [[lithium-6]] (the present method), where only chemical separation is needed.

Deuterium's absorption cross section for [[thermal neutron]]s is 0.52 milli[[barn (unit)|barns]] (5.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 1 barn = 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while those of [[oxygen-16]] and [[oxygen-17]] are 0.19 and 0.24 millibarns, respectively. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O makes up 0.038% of natural [[oxygen]], making the overall cross section 0.28 millibarns. Therefore, in D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with natural oxygen, 21% of [[neutron capture]]s are on oxygen, rising higher as &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O builds up from neutron capture on &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O. Also, &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O may emit an [[alpha particle]] on neutron capture, producing radioactive [[carbon-14]].

'''Ion Reactor''', is an invention by a British scientist.

==History==
In 2011, Dr Christopher Strevens (an inventor from London) began posting a website with instructions of how to build his "fusion reactor", which he says: "Creates helium from hydrogen. It also captures the power given off during the reaction as electrical power." He also posted several videos to YouTube showing his prototype in operation, and showing the different color of gas from before versus after; as well as showing spectral analysis that indicates that the hydrogen that he puts into the system has transmuted to helium—a nuclear phenomenon.

He said: "I found that when I increased the exciter power to 800 Watts, the output rose to 2,000 Watts [2.5-times overunity], and when I isolated the reactor from the exciter, this power remained. The spark gap regulator became active, keeping the power at this level. I only allowed this for a short time before reconnecting the exciter and turning the power down and the reaction ceased."

Because of the experiment being dangerous it would require a special paramagnetic ceramic bottle glazed inside to contain hydrogen ions and use the magnetic field of the coils and induction of ion fields to make a magnetic bottle to confine the ion reactions.

A brief description of the device, being a hydrogen tube wrapped with high voltage coils and a sort of energizing coil being similar to a high voltage [[tesla coil]] for the ionizer. The device having been made in a clear glass tube in early experiments uses induction to ionize the gases and the field made by ionized gases to energize ion tube coils.

The effect is similar to pyroelectric fusion but instead of pyroelectric crystals stripping the electrons from hydrogen atoms it is a high voltage induced electromagnetic field of coils and electrostatic induction of the ionized gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Christopher_Strevens_Nuclear_Reactor|title=Directory:Christopher Strevens Nuclear Reactor|work=peswiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Wykeham Professor]] of physics at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bleaney | first1 = B. | authorlink1 = Brebis Bleaney| title = Two Oxford science professors, F. Soddy and J. S. E. Townsend | doi = 10.1098/rsnr.2002.0168 | journal = Notes and Records of the Royal Society | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–88 | year = 2002 | pmid =  15773039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of the electron avalanche was discovered by him, and is known as the [[Townsend discharge]].

==Career==
John Townsend was born in [[Galway]], [[County Galway]], Ireland, son of Edward Townsend, a Professor of Civil Engineering at [[Queen's College, Galway]] and Judith Townsend. In 1885, he entered [[Trinity College Dublin]], was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] of the College in 1888, and came top of the class in mathematics with a BA in 1890. He became a [[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]] Scholar and entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=TWNT895JS|name=Townshend, John Sealy Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he became a research student at the same time as [[Ernest Rutherford]]. At the [[Cavendish laboratory]], he studied under [[J. J. Thomson]]. He developed the "''Townsend's collision theory''". Townsend supplied important work to the electrical conductivity of gases ("[[Townsend discharge]]" circa 1897). This work determined the [[elementary charge|elementary electrical charge]] with the droplet method. This method was improved later by [[Robert Andrews Millikan]].

In 1900, Townsend became a [[Wykeham Professor]] of Physics at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. In 1901, he discovered the ionization of molecules by ion impact and the dependence of the mean free path on [[electron]]s (in gases) of the energy (and his independent studies concerning the collisions between atoms and low-energy electrons in the 1920s would later be called the [[Ramsauer–Townsend effect]]). On 11 June 1903, he was elected to [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf | title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660–2007 | publisher=[[The Royal Society]] | accessdate=28 August 2015 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Hughes Medal]] in 1914. During [[World War I]], he researched, at [[Woolwich]], [[wireless]] methods for the [[Royal Naval Air Service]].

Townsend was a laboratory demonstrator when [[Brebis Bleaney]] was an undergraduate. Bleaney recounts an occasion when Townsend gathered together all the demonstrators and proceeded to refute both quantum mechanics and relativity.

Between the two world wars, Townsend led an effective small group of researchers, often [[Rhodes scholar]]s, of whom some became distinguished physicists. However, by the 1930s he had become less effective. He was seen as a boring lecturer, a dogmatic supervisor, and out of touch with the wider world of physics. As the 1930s went on, no German refugees sought refuge in his laboratory, while [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Lindemann]], Dr Lee's professor of Physics, gained eight refugee physicists, some of whom gave his department an international reputation in the world of [[low temperature physics]]. In the late 1930s, the University decided to build a new [[Clarendon Laboratory]] Building and looked closely at the relations between Oxford's two physics laboratories. There was a suggestion to convert the Wykeham chair into one for [[theoretical physics]]. In 1941, Townsend's career came to an unhappy end. He had refused to support the [[WOrld War II|war]] effort by teaching service-men, and the university appointed a visitorial board. This found Townsend guilty of misconduct and advised him that he would be dismissed unless he agreed to resign. Townsend, knighted in January 1941, resigned in September, subject to confidentiality.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite book| author-link=Jack Morrell (historian of science) | last=Morell | first=Jack | chapter=Townsend, Sir John Sealy Edward | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/36541 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
John Townsend spent his retirement in [[Oxford]], where he died in 1957 in the [[Acland Nursing Home]].&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

Townsend married May Georgina, also from County Galway, and they had two sons. His wife took an interest in politics, became a city councillor, and was twice [[Mayor of Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[File:Matador-Holzbaukasten-1767.jpg|thumb|The same kit; top left, the special tool to extract sticks from blocks]]

'''Matador''' is a wooden toy set. The bricks are held together using special wooden sticks.

The blocks are precision cut to a single size and shape and are held together with sticks, which assists in the stability of larger constructions. The standard distance between brick holes is 20mm. The blocks are not varnished or treated.

The set has been invented by the Austrian engineer [[Johann Korbuly]].

'''Mount Wai{{okina}}ale{{okina}}ale''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|w|aɪ|ˌ|ɑː|l|eɪ|ˈ|ɑː|l|eɪ}} is a [[shield volcano]] and the second highest point on the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] in the [[Hawaiian Islands]].

The mountain, at an elevation of {{convert|5148|ft|m}}, averages more than {{convert|373|in|mm|lk=on}} of rain a year since 1912, with a record {{convert|683|in|mm}} in 1982; its summit is one of the rainiest spots on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Wall of Tears - Wai'ale'ale.jpg|thumb|The "Wall of Tears" in the crater of Mount Waialeale]]
The summit of Wai{{okina}}ale{{okina}}ale features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af''), with substantial rainfall throughout the course of the year. {{Harvcol|Bodin|1978|p=&amp;nbsp;272}} quotes {{convert|11684|mm|in|disp=flip}} per year figure as being the 1912–45 average, an average that quite possibly will have changed since then, while The [[National Climatic Data Center]] quotes this figure as a 30-year average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html#highpre|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|date=August 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Weather Network]] and ''The Guinness Book of Weather Records'' {{Harvcol|Holford|1977|p=&amp;nbsp;240}} quotes {{convert|11455|mm|in|disp=flip}} rain per year, while {{Harvcol|Ahrens|2000|p=&amp;nbsp;528}} quotes {{convert|11680|mm|in|0|disp=flip}} as the average annual rainfall at Mount Waialeale and {{Harvcol|Kroll|1995|p=&amp;nbsp;188}} claims {{convert|13,000|mm|in|disp=flip}} falls here. Similarly, [[The Weather Network]] and the ''Guinness Book of Weather Records'' quote 335 days with rain here while {{Harvcol|Simons|1996|p=&amp;nbsp;303}} suggests that rain falls on 360 days per year.

The local tourist industry of Kauai has promoted it as the wettest spot, although the 38-year average at [[Mawsynram]], [[Meghalaya]], [[India]] is higher at {{convert|467.4|in|mm}}. Both [[Mawsynram]] and [[Cherrapunji]] in Meghalaya are recognized by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as having higher average rainfall. Mawsynram's rainfall is concentrated in the [[monsoon]] season, while the rain at Waiʻaleʻale is more evenly distributed through the year.

===Causes===
Several factors give the summit of Wai{{okina}}ale{{okina}}ale more potential to create precipitation than the rest of the island chain:
# Its northern position relative to the main Hawaiian Islands provides more exposure to frontal systems that bring rain during the winter.
# It has a relatively round and regular conical shape, exposing all sides of its peak to winds and the moisture that they carry.
# Its peak lies just below the so-called [[trade wind]] inversion layer of {{convert|6000|ft|m}}, above which trade-wind-produced clouds cannot rise.
# And most importantly, the steep cliffs cause the moisture-laden air to rise rapidly – over {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in less than {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} – and drop a large portion of its rain in one spot, as opposed to spreading the rain out over a larger area if the slope were more gradual.

==Ecology==
The great rainfall in the area produces the [[Alakai Wilderness Preserve|Alaka{{okina}}i Wilderness Preserve]], a large [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests#Bogs|boggy]] area that is home to many rare plants.  The ground is so wet that although trails exist, access by foot to the Waiʻaleʻale area is extremely difficult.

A number of rare local plant species are named for this mountain, including ''[[Astelia waialealae]]'', ''[[Melicope waialealae]]'', and the [[Endemism|endemic]] ''[[Dubautia waialealae]]''.&lt;ref name=fws&gt;USFWS.

[[File:Mies van der Rohe gas station.jpeg|thumb|The filling station, in 2007.]]
[[File:Station essence Ile des Soeurs - Mies.jpg|thumb|The filling station, closed, in April 2010.]]
The '''Nun's Island gas station''' was a [[modern architecture|modernist-style]] [[filling station]] designed by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] in 1969, one of four buildings by Mies in [[Nuns' Island]], an island in the city of [[Montreal]]. It is no longer a working gas station after being converted to a [[community centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=2480,2899876&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |title=In Your Neighbourhood: The Mies Van Der Rohe Buildings |accessdate=2008-03-24 |work=City of Montreal Web site }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090127.wstation27/BNStory/National/|title=The Ritz of gas stations looks for a new life|last=Perreaux|first=Les|date=2009-01-27|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first gas station on the island, and the first designed by Mies, who had worked in collaboration with local architect [[Paul H. Lapointe]] on the project. The station was commissioned by [[Imperial Oil]].&lt;ref name="Mies gas"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9aUtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5J8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2948,4865305&amp;dq=montreal+architect&amp;hl=en|title=Master architect designs unique station|date="Both pavilions use geothermal energy for heating and air conditioning,"  20, 1968|work=Montreal Gazette|pages=90|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community centre==
[[File:La station.png|thumbnail|"La Station" lighting at night]]
The borough of [[Verdun, Quebec|Verdun]] transformed the building into a [[community arts]] centre, '''La Station'''.&lt;ref name="LEJTENYI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/031909/news2.html|title=Nuns saves Mies|last=Lejtenyi|first=Patrick|work=[[Montreal Mirror]]|publisher=Communications Gratte-Ciel Ltée|accessdate=26 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606092531/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/031909/news2.html#|archive-date=2011-06-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Gauthier (architect)|Eric Gauthier]] was the lead architect on the project, which saw the two glass pavilions rebuilt to their original 3,000- and {{convert|1,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} sizes.&lt;ref name=Leblanc&gt;{{cite news|last=Leblanc|first=Dave|title=Mies's Montreal gas station gets new lease on life|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/architecture/dave-leblanc/miess-montreal-gas-station-gets-new-lease-on-life/article2089835/|accessdate=8 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Station''' is a community centre for teens and people over 50 years of age. The two main buildings are called  the ''salle blanche'' (English: white room) and ''salle noire'' (English: black room), after their floor colours. The original glass-enclosed attendant's booth serves as a display case of Mies' and the building's history, with the former [[fuel dispenser]]s marked by ventilation shafts. The centre uses [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref name=Woolfrey&gt;{{cite news|last=Woolfrey|first=John|title=LA STATION: THE JEWEL IN THE NUNS' ISLAND CROWN|url=http://montreal.openfile.ca/montreal/text/la-station-jewel-nuns%E2%80%99-island-crown-0|accessdate=26 February 2012|newspaper=Openfile Montreal|date=24 February 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On the Line''''' is a 2011 Canadian documentary by [[Frank Wolf (filmmaker)|Frank Wolf]] that investigates the risks and consequences associated with the proposed [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines]] project. The film is set in the context of a 2,400&amp;nbsp;km biking, hiking, rafting and kayaking journey that two friends embark on from the Alberta oil sands to the British Columbia coast.  As the pair travel the proposed pipeline route,  they encounter a broad cross-section of people who voice their perspective on the issues associated with the project. It won the 'Spirit of Action Prize' at the 2012 Santa Cruz Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On The Line at SCFF|url=http://santacruz.festivalgenius.com/2012/films/ontheline_frankwolf_santacruz2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was chosen for the VIFF Selects section at the 2011 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]].  It airs on CBC's [[documentary (TV channel)]] in Canada multiple times through 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On The Line on CBC's documentary channel|url=http://www.cbc.ca/programguide/program/on_the_line/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features music by Peirson Ross,  [[Terry Jacks]], [[Chilliwack (band)|Chilliwack]], Kola Collective, Phontaine,Tessa Amy, and Eric Stanger.

'''Outdoor heating''' allows people to stay in substantially unenclosed spaces, when it would otherwise be too cold to do so. To this end, various outdoor heating appliances are available, including gas [[patio heater]]s, quartz or ceramic electric lamps, and wood burning [[chimenea]] and fire pits.

In an outdoor environment, [[convection]] would quickly carry away heat in the form of hot air, so all these methods emit various amounts of their total output as [[Radiant heating|radiant heat]]. Radiant heat is emitted from the appliance, and is absorbed by objects and people, raising their temperature.

This process is one route to a "[[hydrogen economy]]", in which hydrogen fuel is produced efficiently and inexpensively from natural sources without using [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1878333 | title = The Hydrogen Economy | year = 2004 | last1 = Crabtree | first1 = G.

Photoelectrolysis is sometimes known colloquially as the ''hydrogen [[Holy Grail#Casual metaphor|holy grail]]'' for its potential to yield a viable alternative to [[petroleum]] as a source of [[energy]]; such an energy source would supposedly come without the [[sociopolitical]]ly undesirable effects of extracting and using petroleum.

Some researchers have practiced photoelectrolysis by means of a [[nanoscale]] process. Nanoscale photoelectrolysis of water could someday reach greater efficiency than that of "traditional" photoelectrolysis. Semiconductors with bandgaps smaller than 1.7 [[electronvolt|eV]] would ostensibly be required{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} for efficient nanoscale photoelectrolysis using light from the [[Sun]].

Devices based on [[hydrogenase]] have also been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[physics]], '''Planck energy''', denoted by {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the unit of [[energy]] in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]].&lt;ref name="Cosmos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/P/Planck+Energy|title=Planck Energy|publisher=Cosmos, The SAO Encyclopedia, Swinburne University of Technology|access-date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a ''derived'', as opposed to ''basic'', Planck unit. It is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{P} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, {{math|&lt;var&gt;ћ&lt;/var&gt;}} is the reduced [[Planck's constant]], and {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]].

Substituting values for the various components in this definition gives the approximate equivalent value of this unit in terms of other units of energy:

:&lt;math&gt;1 \ E_\mathrm{P} \approx 1.956 \times 10^9\ \mathrm{J} \approx 1.2209 \times 10^{19}\ \mathrm{GeV} \approx 0.54336\ \mathrm{MWh}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?plkmc2gev|title=CODATA Value: Planck mass energy equivalent in GeV|website=physics.nist.gov|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An equivalent definition is:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{P} = {\frac{\hbar} {t_\mathrm{P}}},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Planck time]].

Also:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{P} = {m_\mathrm{P}} {c^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Planck mass]].

The [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]] [[Oh-My-God particle|observed in 1991]] had a measured energy of about 50 [[joule]]s, equivalent to about 2.5&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmic-ray.org/reading/flyseye.html#SEC10|title=HiRes - The High Resolution Fly's Eye Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray Observatory|website=www.cosmic-ray.org|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Planck units are fantastically small and thus are unrelated to "macroscopic" phenomena (or fantastically large, as in the case of [[Planck temperature]] and [[Planck acceleration]]). Energy of 1 {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;}}, on the other hand, is definitely macroscopic, approximately equaling the energy stored in an automobile gas tank (57.2 L of gasoline at 34.2 MJ/L of chemical energy).

Planck units are designed to normalize the [[physical constant]]s {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}}, {{math|&lt;var&gt;ћ&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;}} to 1. Hence given Planck units, the [[mass-energy equivalence]] {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;²}} simplifies to {{math|1=&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;}}, so that the Planck energy and mass are numerically identical. In the equations of [[general relativity]], {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}} is often multiplied by 4π. Hence writings in [[particle physics]] and [[physical cosmology]] often normalize {{math|4π&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}} to 1. This [[Normalisable wave function|normalization]] results in the '''reduced Planck energy''', defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{\hbar{}c^5}{4\pi G}} \approx 7.80 \times 10^8\ \mathrm{J} \approx 4.86 \times 10^{18} \ \mathrm{GeV} \approx 0.21628 \mathrm{MWh}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''regional snowfall index (RSI)''' is a system used by the [[NOAA]] to assess the societal impact of winter storms in the six easternmost regions of the [[United States]]. The system is a replacement for the [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]] (NESIS) system which the [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NCDC) began using in 2005. The NCDC has retroactively assigned RSI values to over 500 historical storms since 1900.

The index makes use of population and regional differences to assess the impact of snowfall.  For example, areas which receive very little snowfall on average may be more adversely affected than other regions, and so the index will grant storms in those regions higher severity.

==Overview==
[[File:Map of Regional Snowfall Index regions.jpg|thumb|The map shows the six easternmost weather regions of the United States for which the Regional Snowfall Index is calculated.]]
In each region, four "thresholds" are set based on climatological records:
* one quarter of the amount of snow typically occurring once every 10 years
* one half of the amount of snow typically occurring once every 25 years
* the amount of snow typically occurring once every 25 years
* one and a half times the amount of snow typically occurring once every 25 years
For example, in the Northeast, a typical location will get 16 inches of snow about once every 10 years and 20 inches about once every 25, so the thresholds are 2.5, 10, 20, and 30 inches.

For each threshold and each region, a baseline area and population are determined; for a given storm, the area that exceeds a particular threshold will be normalized by the baseline value.  For example, for a storm in the northeast, the area receiving at least 4 inches of snow is divided by 149,228 square miles, and the population affected is divided by 51,553,600 (using 2010 census data).  This gives eight different numbers representing how widespread the storm is compared to notable snow storms in that region.  The baseline area and population represent the average area and population for large storms, so that each of these eight different measures will average 1 among storms considered notable (for the calibration sample).  The RSI is simply the total of these eight numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2752">'''''Reifendrehen''''' is a unique type of toy manufacture using [[wood turning]] techniques that was developed in the [[Ore Mountains]] in the vicinity of the town of [[Seiffen/Erzgeb.|Seiffen]] and continues there to the present day. The process produces small animals and other figures or even little wooden houses in outline, that are used as toys or to decorate [[Christmas pyramids]] or [[Nativity scene]]s. The animals and figures (''Reifentiere'' and ''Reifenfiguren'') so produced are an inherent part of [[Ore Mountain folk art]].

== Production ==
In the process known as ''Reifendrehen'' (literally "tyre turning") a suitable piece of wood, as far as possible free of splits, is worked on a special [[wood lathe]] to produce a wooden ring with a diameter of about 30 to 50 centimetres, the cross-section of which forms the outline of the desired figure. Small slices are then sawn off the ring. These are used as the raw material from which the finished figures are made by [[carving]] and painting.

The technique of ''Reifendrehen'', which demands great experience and skill, emerged around 1800. It enabled, during the 19th century, the efficient mass production of wooden figures, because it was faster and cheaper than pure woodcarving by hand. Today part of the exhibition at the [[Ore Mountain Toy Museum, Seiffen|Ore Mountain Toy Museum in Seiffen]] is dedicated to the craft of the turners - the ''Reifendreher'' - who make these toys. In addition, there are several visitor workshops in the region around Seiffen.

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables, was higher in developing countries, with $156 billion invested, mainly in China, India, and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;FS-UNEP Collaborating Centre, [http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf Global trends in renewable energy investment], 2016 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developing countries have abundant [[renewable energy]] resources, including [[solar energy]], [[wind power]], [[geothermal energy]], and [[biomass]], as well as the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these. By developing such energy sources developing countries can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas, creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. In many circumstances, these investments can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.&lt;ref name=mdg&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, [[electricity grid]] extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the [[diesel generator]]s that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as [[kerosene lamp]]s and [[biomass|traditional biomass]].&lt;ref name=reeee/&gt;

[[Kenya]] is the world leader in the number of [[solar power]] systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small [[solar panel]]s, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"&gt;http://en.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=38323&amp;TId=97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for renewable energy==
In 2009, about 1.4 billion of people in the world lived without electricity, and 2.7 billion relied on wood, charcoal, and dung for home energy requirements. This lack of access to modern energy technology limits income generation, blunts efforts to escape poverty, affects people's health, and contributes to global deforestation and climate change. Small-scale renewable energy technologies and [[distributed energy]] options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households
modern energy services.&lt;ref name=verlaw&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2198045 |title=Deploying Off-Grid Technology to Eradicate Energy Poverty |author=Sovacool, Benjamin K., |date=5 October 2012 |work=Science (vol. 338, 47-48)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from [[fossil fuels]] can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120425/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf |date=2012-03-30 }} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy doesn't always have to come from a developing country. The Developing Areas Study Group session is a group of speakers from all over the energy businesses discusses the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing synthetic fuel alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country but the world as a whole in providing an alternative fuel source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor= 20001554 |title= Energy in Developing Countries |last= McDonald |first= Paul |date= 1980 |journal= Area |accessdate= |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concern about [[global warming]] and [[air pollution]], reduced costs of the technologies themselves, and improved efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; In recent years, supportive programs from governments, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and community cooperatives have expanded access to these off-grid technologies and the energy services they provide. Program planners should select “low-hanging fruit” first, aiming for maximum access to modern energy services with the least effort.&lt;ref name=verlaw/&gt;

==Use of renewables==
Collectively, developing countries have more than half of global renewable power capacity. China and India are rapidly expanding markets for renewable energy. Brazil produces most of the world’s sugar-derived ethanol and has been adding new biomass and wind power plants. Many renewable markets are growing at rapid rates in countries such as Argentina, Costa Rica, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=ren9&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, electricity grid extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the diesel generators that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass.&lt;ref name="reeee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Renew_Policies.pdf |title=Renewable Energy |author=IEA |year=2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author= Kevin Bullis |date= January 27, 2012 |work= Technology Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.&lt;ref name=re10&gt;REN21 (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf |title=The Rise of Renewable Energy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-hydro systems configured into village-scale or county-scale mini-grids serve many areas. More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household-scale systems. These stoves are being manufactured in factories and workshops worldwide, and more than 160 million households now use them.&lt;ref name = re10/&gt;

===Poverty alleviation===
{{See also|Energy poverty}}
Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty alleviation]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

===Education===
Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children spend out of school collecting fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/grameen08 |title=Grameen Shakti installs efficient stoves as well as solar home systems |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
2.4 billion people use only traditional biomass, such as wood, residues and dung, for cooking and heating. The constant use of these types of energy sources exposes them to indoor particulate and carbon monoxide concentrations many times higher than [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) standards. "Traditional stoves using dung and charcoal emit large amounts of carbon monoxide and other noxious gases. Women and children suffer most, because they are exposed for the longest periods of time. Acute respiratory illnesses affect as much as 6% of the world population. The WHO estimates that 2.5 million women and young children in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing the fumes from indoor biomass stoves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull442/44204002429.pdf|title=IAEA BULLETIN, 44/2/2002|pages=28, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Renewable energy can improve this situation by reducing exposure to indoor pollutants.

Furthermore, renewable can also provide energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment in rural areas where the access to electricity is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/kxn |title=PV-powered vaccine fridges |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also provide power to supply the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

==Government policies==
{{Further|Renewable energy policy}}
More developing countries are implementing the public policies needed for the widespread development of renewable energy technologies and markets, which have traditionally been dominated by Europe, Japan, and North America. The exceptions include countries like Brazil, which has built the world’s leading [[biofuel]]s industry, [[Renewable energy in China|China]], India, which are leaders in developing decentralized renewable sources such as [[small hydro]], small wind, biogas, and solar water heating.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;
However, policies like [[feed-in tariff]] are applied. Besides, with the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the program called the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) that allows for industrialized nations to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/adaptation_fund/items/3659.php Adaptation Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing-country Governments need to steer resources mobilized for large-scale investments into new production sectors and new technologies. Some argue that policies should base on active industrial policies, combining large scale investments and active policy interventions. There is a need of subsidizing these type of energy services to make them affordable to the major part of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/desalert/2009/WESS_overview_en.pdf|title=World Economic and Social Survey 2009 Promoting Development, Saving, 2009, the Planet|pages=4, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Renewable Energy in the Philippines}}
[[File:Bangui Wind Mills.JPG|thumb|[[Bangui Wind Farm]] in [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]]]] The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government sees the growth of the renewable energy sector essential for national energy security. The Philippines' fossil fuel sector is unsustainable, being dependent on the import of nonrenewable fuel, including petroleum, but has significant potential in the renewable energy sector. Based on a report of an Australian consulting firm, International Energy Consultants, the Philippines has the highest electricity rate in Asia, followed by [[Japan]]. Transmitting power and transporting fuel throughout the Philippine archipelago is problematic due to very high cost.&lt;ref name=manila.b&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/325264/the-right-mix-the-philippines-achieving-its-renewable-energy-goals&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines could be considered a world leader in renewable energy, with its 30 percent of its power generation being powered by the renewable energy sector. the Philippines is the world's second largest generator of geothermal energy and was the first [[Southeast Asia]]n nation to invest in large-scale solar and wind technologies.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;

Promotion and support of renewable energy in the country was intensified with the passing of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 which made a feed-in-tariff and a renewable portfolio standard. The Philippines aims to triple renewable energy supply by 2030.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/06/14/11/philippines-lifts-2030-renewable-energy-target&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the government has concluded agreements with private developers for extensive projects in Oriental Mindoro with an eventual output of 48 MW, with plans for even larger development in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://samueldalsanto.com/2012/04/14/samuel-helps-philippines-wind-power-project-get-presidential-approval/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite government efforts, some investors have criticized the government's lack of firmness in its feed-in-tariff policy, and the solar industry accused the government for hampering its progress in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbiz.asia/story/policy-problems-hamper-philippine-renewables-growth&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2011, Algeria launched the National Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article937] Adoption of the Algerian program of renewable energy and energy conservation policy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?rubrique44] Algerian Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which spans the period from 2011 to 2013, aims to produce 22,000 MW of electricity from solar and wind power which 10,000 MW for export.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1155] Algerian Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency (List of projects)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Kenya}}
In [[Kenya]], the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum&lt;ref&gt;The Ministry of Energy http://www.energy.go.ke/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt; is in charge of renewable energy policies. In March 2008, the country adopted the [[feed-in tariff]] policy. In January 2010, the policy was revised to urge private sectors to invest in electricity generation from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/feed%20in%20tarriffs2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"/&gt; The only other country in Africa utilising geothermal power is [[Ethiopia]].

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans are turning to solar power every year rather than making connections to the country’s electric grid. This is due to the high connectivity costs and the fact that there is an abundance of solar power in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf The Rise of Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Renewable energy in Brazil}}
[[Renewable energy]] accounted for more than 85.4% of the domestically produced electricity used in Brazil, according to preliminary data from the 2009 National Energy Balance, conducted by the Energy Research Corporation (EPE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2009/12/brazils-wind-power-auction-spurs-more-clean-energy-development.html Renewable energy in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt; After the oil shocks of the 1970s, Brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy, mainly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|sugarcane ethanol]]. Its large sugarcane farms helped. In 1985, 91% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol. The success of [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, introduced in 2003, together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country, have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by February 2008.&lt;ref name="ANP07_2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|title=ANP: consumo de álcool combustível é 50% maior em 2007|author=Agência Brasil|date=2008-07-15|publisher=Invertia|accessdate=2008-08-09|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226014527/http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|archivedate=2008-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redebrasilatual.com.br/temas/economia/gabrielli-etanol-reduzira-mercado-de-gasolina-a-17-ate-2020 90% of cars produced in Brazil are Flexfuel]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sendust''' is a magnetic metal powder that was invented by [[Hakaru Masumoto]] at [[Tohoku Imperial University]] in [[Sendai]], [[Japan]], about 1936 as an alternative to [[permalloy]] in [[inductor]] applications for telephone networks.  Sendust composition is typically 85% [[iron]], 9% [[silicon]] and 6% [[aluminum]]. The powder is [[sintered]] into cores to manufacture inductors. Sendust cores have high [[magnetic permeability]] (up to 140&amp;nbsp;000), low loss, low coercivity (5 A/m) good temperature stability and saturation flux density up to 1 T.

Due to its chemical composition and crystallographic structure Sendust exhibits simultaneously zero [[magnetostriction]] and zero [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]] constant K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Sendust is harder than permalloy, and is thus useful in abrasive wear applications such as magnetic [[recording head]]s.

'''Silvan Dam''' is an embankment [[concrete-face rock-fill]] currently under construction on the [[Batman River]] in the district of [[Silvan, Turkey|Silvan]], [[Diyarbakır Province]] in southeastern [[Turkey]]. It is part of the [[Southeastern Anatolia Project]] and located upstream of the [[Batman Dam]]. Construction began on 26 July 2011 and is expected to be complete in 2017. The purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power production and irrigation. It is designed to irrigate an area of {{Convert|245000|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. The power station will have an installed capacity of 160 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Initiated the construction of the dam is SİLVAN|url=http://www.gap.gov.tr/gap-tan/haberler/silvan-barajinin-yapimina-baslandi|accessdate=21 May 2013|language=Turkish|publisher=GAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silvan Dam Due Date Moved Up|url=http://www.ilkehaberajansi.com.tr/haber/silvan-barajinin-bitis-tarihi-one-alindi.html|publisher=Ilke Haber Ajansi|accessdate=21 May 2013|language=Turkish|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the dam, as well as other in southeast Turkey such as the [[Ilisu Dam]], became a prime target of [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) militants after peace talks collapsed with the government. Attacks on the dam, supporting structures and workers are part of the PKK's efforts to stop construction. Construction of the dam was suspended temporarily late in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey's Biggest Dam Project Victim of Faltering Peace|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-12/turkey-s-biggest-dam-project-victim-of-faltering-peace|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=Bloomberg Business|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4861">A '''solar cable''' is the interconnection [[electrical cable|cable]] used in [[photovoltaic]] power generation. Solar cables interconnect [[solar panels]] and other electrical components of a [[photovoltaic system]]. Solar cables are designed to be [[UV]] resistant and [[weather]] resistant.  They can be used within a large temperature range and are generally laid outside.

== Features ==
One common factor for most of the photovoltaic power systems is outdoor use, characterized by high temperatures and high UV radiation. Single-core cables with a maximum permissible DC voltage of 1.8 kV Umax. The phase to ground DC voltage rating must be Uo1.5kVDC and a temperature range from -40&amp;nbsp;°C to +90&amp;nbsp;°C ambient, 120&amp;nbsp;°C on the conductor for 25 year service life against thermal ageing. Ambient temperature and conductor temperature is derived from the Arrhenius law for ageing of polymers - ageing of polymers doubles for every 10&amp;nbsp;°C rise.

DC string cables must be class II double insulated to protect against short circuits and ground faults.

=== Small scale systems with string inverters ===
A three-core AC cable is used for connection to the grid if a single-phase inverter is used, and a five-core cable is used for three-phase feed-in.&lt;ref name=pv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pv-system-tech.com/index.php?id=410|title=Inverter and PV System Technology - Cables and Connectors|publisher=pv-system-tech.com|accessdate=2011-06-20|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large scale system wiring with central inverters ===
Referred to as the Main DC, larger power collector cables are used to interconnect from the Generator box also referred to as the DC combiner to the central inverter. [[IEC 62548]] states that these cables must be shielded when over 50m in length.
Central inverters are large frequency converters and unshielded cables would cause EMC issues throughout the whole solar farm which can behave like a capacitor.

=== Insulation ===
The cable's insulation must be able to withstand thermal and mechanical loads. As a consequence, plastics which have been [[Cross-linked polyethylene|cross-linked]] are increasingly used today. The insulation and jacket materials are extremely resistant to weathering, UV-radiation and abrasion . Additionally, it is salt water resistant and resistant to acids and alkaline solutions. It is suitable for fixed installation as well as for moving applications without tensile load. It is especially designed for outdoor use, which means direct sun radiation and air humidity, but due to the halogen free flame retardant cross-linked jacket material the cable can also be installed in dry and humid conditions indoors.&lt;ref name=iwcs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwcs.omnibooksonline.com/data/papers/2009/6_3.pdf|title=Cables for Photovoltaic Applications|publisher=iwcs.omnibooksonline.com|accessdate=2011-06-20|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DC connection ==
[[File:Ring wire end connector.jpg|thumb|Ring wire end connectors are used for input in some inverters.]]
Individual modules are connected using cables to form the PV generator (usually employing [[MC4 connector]]s. The module cables are connected into a string (i.e. using a MC4 Y connectors) which leads into the generator [[junction box]], and a main DC cable connects the generator junction box to the [[inverter]]. The inverter output can connect to the grid using AC cables.

In order to eliminate the risk of [[ground fault]]s and [[short circuit]]s, the positive and negative cables, each with double insulation, are laid separately.

== Loss minimization ==
The cross-section of the cables should be proportioned such that losses incurred in nominal operation do not exceed 1%. String cables usually have a cross-section of 4 to 10 mm².

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">[[Solar hot water]] in [[New Zealand]] is increasingly used on both new and existing buildings.

Solar thermal technologies had a sizable initial uptake in the pioneering days of the 1970s. By 2001 more than 40GWhr was produced from solar hot water technologies, equating to 0.1% of the total electricity consumption in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="eeca"&gt;{{cite web|url= |title=Solar energy use and potential in New Zealand |last=Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority |date=May 2001|publisher=Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006 the government announced an investment of $15.5 million over the first three and a half years of a five-year Solar Water Heating program to increase the number of solar hot water heating installations. As of 2006 there were about 35,000 solar hot water installations on domestic and commercial buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ministry for the Environment|title=Environment New Zealand 2007|location=Wellington, New Zealand|date=December 2007|series=ME847|pages=111|isbn=978-0-478-30191-5|url=http://mfe.govt.nz/publications/ser/enz07-dec07/chapter-5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now eleven manufacturers and importers in the industry with most of the collector system being locally made.&lt;ref name="eeca"/&gt;

{{TOC right}}

==Barriers to adoption==
The main barrier for the installation of solar hot water systems is the initial capital investment. Other barriers are the conservatism of the building industry, lack of influence on increasing the sale price of houses, conflicting interest between housing investors and home-owners, and a lack of adequate information about solar hot water heating.&lt;ref name="eeca"/&gt;

In lossless power transmission, a '''supergrid''' with hydrogen is an idea for combining very long distance [[electric power transmission]] with [[liquid hydrogen]] distribution, to achieve superconductivity in the power lines. The hydrogen is both a distributed fuel and a [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] coolant for the power lines, rendering them [[superconducting]]. The concept's advocates describe it as being in a "visionary" stage, for which no new scientific breakthrough is required but which requires major technological innovations before it could progress to a practical system.&lt;ref name="FinalReport"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://supergrid.uiuc.edu/sg2/PDF/SG2_FinalReport.pdf | title=National Energy Supergrid Workshop 2:Final Report

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system for the United States is projected to require "several decades" before it could be fully implemented.&lt;ref name="FinalReport" /&gt;

One proposed design for a superconducting cable includes a superconducting bipolar DC line operating at ±50&amp;nbsp;kV, and 50&amp;nbsp;kA, transmitting about 2.5&amp;nbsp;GW for several hundred kilometers at zero resistance and nearly no line loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-power-grid-for-the-hydr-2006-07 | title=A Power Grid for the Hydrogen Economy | author=Paul M. Grant, Chauncey Starr and Thomas J. Overbye | work= Scientific American | date=June 2006
 | accessdate=2008-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) lines have the capability of transmitting similar wattages, for example a 5 gigawatt HVDC system is being constructed along the [[Southern China|southern provinces of China]] without the use of superconducting cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://tdworld.com/overhead_transmission/siemens-hvdc-transmission-china/ | title=China to Construct High-Voltage Transmission System Between Yunnan, Guangdong | author=Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution | work= Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=2006-06-11 | accessdate=2008-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Energy in the United States|United States]], a Continental SuperGrid 4,000 kilometers long might carry 40,000 to 80,000&amp;nbsp;MW in a tunnel shared with long distance high speed [[maglev]] trains, which at low pressure could allow cross continental journeys of one hour. The liquid hydrogen pipeline would both store and deliver hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-10/iss-5/p20.html Big green energy machines]&lt;/ref&gt;

1.5% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.elexon.co.uk/documents/publications/publications_-_information_sheets/transmission_losses.pdf | title=Elexon paper on losses on the British Supergrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the energy transmitted on the British AC Supergrid is lost (transformer, heating and capacitive losses), of which a little under two-thirds, or 1% on the British supergrid, represents "DC", resistive, heating type losses. With the use of superconductors, the capacitive and transformer losses, in the unlikely event the transmission lines were still overhead, AC lines, would remain the same. Overhead lines do not lend themselves at all well physically to the incorporation of cryogenic [[hydrogen piping]], due to the likely weight of the transmission medium and the considerable brittleness of supercooled materials. It would probably be necessary for a supercooled hydrogen-carrying transmission line to be subterranean, and this in turn means that for such a cable, if it were of any distance (e.g. over 60&amp;nbsp;km), the power would have to be converted to DC and transmitted as such, since otherwise the capacitive losses would be too high. The power electronic losses in the AC/DC converter substations to convert the AC power at either end of the cryogenic cable to and from DC, if the transmission line(s) itself were DC, would also remain exactly the same as they would have been without the use of a superconducting transmission line - but the DC type resistive losses in the transmission lines would be rendered even smaller than at present.

Even before comprehensive continental and (in the case of the proposed [[European Super Grid]]) intercontinental backbones of electrical transmission may be realized, such cables could be used to efficiently interconnect regional power grids of conventional design.

'''The Salisbury Museum''' (previously '''The Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum''') is a museum in [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]], England.  It houses one of the best collections relating to [[Stonehenge]] and local [[archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The museum is housed in [[The King's House, Salisbury|The King's House]], a Grade I [[listed building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1355814|desc=The King's House (College of Sarum St Michael)|access-date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[King James I of England]] was entertained in 1610 and 1613. Set in the surroundings of the [[Cathedral Close]], the museum faces the west front of [[Salisbury Cathedral]]. Previously based at No 40-42, St Ann Street, where it had been founded in 1860 by Dr [[Richard Fowler (physician)|Richard Fowler]], FRS, it transferred to its current location in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jac314159.webspace.virginmedia.com/SCS/093.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The original three-storey building with [[mullion]]ed and [[transom (architectural)|transom]]ed windows, ornate plaster ceilings and a fine [[baluster|oak-balustraded]] staircase, houses the main temporary exhibition gallery, with the ceramics gallery above. The arms of James I's eldest son, [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], can be seen in a window in the [[Wedgwood]] gallery upstairs.

The Director of the museum is [[Adrian Green (curator)|Adrian Green]].

==Temporary exhibitions==
Summer exhibitions since 2011 have featured artists who share a close connection with the locality.

* In 2011, the temporary exhibition was 'Constable and Salisbury'. Timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of [[John Constable|Constable’s]] first visit to Salisbury, the exhibition contained over forty original oil paintings, watercolours and drawings, including the famous 'Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows'.
* In the summer of 2012, Salisbury Museum presented 'Circles And Tangents' featuring the work of artists connected with [[Cranborne Chase]], including [[Augustus John]], [[Henry Lamb]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[John Craxton]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Stanley Spencer]], [[Elisabeth Frink]], [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicholson]] and over 25 others.
* From May to September 2013, [[Rex Whistler]]: 'A Talent Cut Short' was the temporary exhibition.
* The summer exhibition for 2015 was 'Turner's Wessex: Architecture and Ambition'. It featured a collection of brilliant watercolours made by [[JMW Turner]] as a young man in the Salisbury area, and was curated by Ian Warrell.
*In 2017 the summer exhibition was 'Ancient Landscapes', showcasing works from such artists as William Blake, Barbara Hepworth and Paul Nash. The works had the subject of Stonehenge and the surrounding Salisbury Plain. On three days in August, there was a theatre production in the gardens of the museum by Stage '65, [[Salisbury Playhouse]]'s youth theatre.

== Notable objects ==

===Lake House meteorite===
On 10 September 2012, a {{convert|90|kg}} meteorite, possibly the biggest to have ever fallen on the British Isles, went on display at the museum. For at least 80 years it sat near the front door of [[Lake House]] at [[Wilsford cum Lake|Wilsford-cum-Lake]] near Salisbury. When the house was sold, the stone was confirmed as a meteorite by the [[Natural History Museum]] where it remained in storage for many years. Professor [[Colin Pillinger]], known for his work on the [[Beagle 2]] Mars spacecraft, had been studying a smaller meteorite from the [[Danebury|Danebury Hill Fort]] in Hampshire and felt that there could be a connection between the two. The meteorite from Lake House was retrieved from storage and although the two objects were found to be unrelated, Professor Pillinger continued with his study of the larger meteorite.

The meteorite landed on earth some 30,000 years ago and was apparently preserved by the frozen conditions during the last ice age. In normal circumstances the meteorite would have disintegrated, but the cold and ice helped preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of years later, in the Stone or Bronze Age, it is thought that the meteorite was built into a burial mound close to Lake House. The local chalk environment would again have helped to preserve it. The meteorite may have been unearthed in the 19th century by Edward Duke, a previous owner of Lake House who was an antiquarian who excavated burial mounds nearby and had his own private museum. Photographic evidence shows it on the doorstep of Lake House at the time the property was owned by the brewer [[Joseph Williams Lovibond|Joseph Lovibond]], Mayor of Salisbury in 1878–79 and 1890–91.

===Prehistoric hoards===
In November 2011 the Museum displayed the Wardour Hoard of over 100 copper alloy objects, over 2,700 years old, from the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age. It was found near [[Wardour, Wiltshire|Wardour]] by a metal detectorist, and consists of tools such as axe heads, chisels, sickles and gouges, as well as spearheads, daggers, knives, swords and scabbard fittings. It was the most important hoard to have been found in Wiltshire since the discovery of the Salisbury Hoard in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In around 2014, the museum acquired the [[Wylye Hoard]].&lt;ref name="Wylye"&gt;{{cite web|title=Record ID: WILT-038191 – Bronze Age Hoard|url=https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/538672|website=The Portable Antiquities Scheme|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Wessex Gallery of Archaeology==
[[File:The Amesbury Archer.JPG|thumb|250|The Amesbury Archer]]
In June 2012, the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] (HLF) awarded Salisbury Museum a grant of £1,794,600 towards the development of a new Archaeology of Wessex gallery. The new gallery opened in the summer of 2014 and is of international importance, telling the story of Salisbury and the surrounding area from prehistoric times to the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], and showing why Salisbury has a unique place in history. The museum's collections include some of the most important archaeological finds in Britain, including artefacts from the [[Stonehenge World Heritage Site]], the [[Augustus Pitt Rivers|Pitt Rivers]] Wessex Collection and the [[Amesbury Archer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Other collections==
A £350,000 grant from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]] was awarded in August 2013, to help save the personal archive of [[Rex Whistler]]. The Salisbury Museum hopes to purchase the archive, which contains over 1,000 items and is the only substantial collection of material relating to the artist.

The Museum has an art collection of over 4,000 paintings, prints and drawings, representing local personalities, topographical scenes, special events and everyday life, or created by local artists of note. An outstanding Costume Collection includes clothes relating to the people in and around Salisbury over the past 250 years, including wedding dresses, uniforms, formal wear and lace samples produced by Downton Lace. The Museum also has an outstanding collection of ceramics. Local [[Verwood]] and Wiltshire Brown ware is represented alongside the celebrated Wedgwood, Bow and Chelsea potteries.

On December 19, 2016, the NRC issued two Combined Licenses authorizing Duke to build and operate two AP1000 reactors at the site.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2016/16-075.pdf|title=NRC Issues New Reactor Licenses to Duke Energy for William States Lee III Site in South Carolina|last=|first=|date=December 21, 2016|work=NRC News|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=www.nrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Duke decided to seek permission from the North Carolina Utility Commission to cancel the project due to the bankruptcy of Westinghouse and "other market activity", although they will retain the option of restarting the project at some point in the future if circumstances change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duke Seeks To Cancel William States Lee Nuclear Power Project - News - Nuclear Power News - Nuclear Street - Nuclear Power Plant News, Jobs, and Careers|url=https://nuclearstreet.com/nuclear_power_industry_news/b/nuclear_power_news/archive/2017/08/25/duke-seeks-to-cancel-william-states-lee-nuclear-power-project-082502|accessdate=27 August 2017|work=nuclearstreet.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant was named for [[William States Lee III]] (1929–1996), former [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of Duke Energy (1982–94). 
This site would have been be adjacent to the [[Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant]] site, which was also never completed and abandoned in the early 1980s, then later used by [[James Cameron]] as a film set for the 1989 movie ''[[The Abyss]]''.

==Costs and economics==
In December 2007, Duke Power announced that it would spend $160&amp;nbsp;million in 2008 on the plant and that total costs could range 5–6 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

December 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, Duke estimated the overnight cost of the plant at $11&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="wnn-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Duke_raises_cost_estimate_for_Lee_plant-0711084.html|title=Duke raises cost estimate for Lee plant|date=7 November 2008|work=World Nuclear News|publisher=|accessdate= 2008-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing and construction==
Duke submitted the Lee application to the NRC on Dec. 12, 2007. The NRC's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards independently reviewed aspects of the application that concern safety, as well as the staff's final safety evaluation report. The committee provided the results of its review to the Commission on Dec. 14, 2015. The NRC completed its environmental review and issued the final impact statement for the proposed William States Lee reactors in December 2013.

The Commission authorized the agency's Office of New Reactors to issue the licenses, having found the staff's review of Duke's application adequate to make the necessary regulatory safety and environmental findings. The licenses were issued Dec. 19. The licenses contain conditions, including:
* Specific actions associated with the agency's post-Fukushima requirements for Mitigation Strategies and Spent Fuel Pool Instrumentation
* A pre-startup schedule for post-Fukushima aspects of the new reactor's emergency preparedness plans and procedures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
