'''Advanced Placement Human Geography''' (also known as '''AP Human Geo''', '''AP Geography''', '''APHG''', '''AP HuGe''', '''HGAP''', '''AP HuGs''', '''APHUG''', '''AP HUMAN''', or '''High School Ap Human''') is an [[Advanced Placement]] [[social studies]] course that studies [[human geography]]. The test is administered by [[College Board]].

This college-level course introduces students to the systematic study of patterns and processes that have shaped human understanding, use, and alteration of [[Earth]]'s surface. Students employ spatial concepts and landscape analyses to analyze human social organization and its environmental consequences. They also learn about the methods and tools geographers use in their science and practice.

== Exam ==
The AP Human Geography Exam consists of two sections. The first section consists of 75 [[multiple choice]] questions and the second section consists of 3 free-response questions. The sections are 60 and 75 minutes long, respectively. It is not necessary to answer the free-response questions in essay form; instead, points are awarded on certain key words, examples, and other vital aspects.

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-human-geography-course-description.pdf AP Human Geography:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Human Geography==
The curriculum consists of informational book-related homework, which often requires students to strive to learn information independently. The curriculum teaches about diffusion, human traits, religion, and population clusters.

The '''Argentine University Federation''' (in [[Spanish language|Castilian]]: ''Federación Universitaria Argentina (FUA)'') is the most important student organization in [[Argentina]]

The FUA was created on April 11, 1918 within the [[University reform in Argentina|University Reform]] student movement originated in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], which later spread though [[Latin America]], that demanded an autonomous system in which teachers, graduates, and students would participate in the government of the universities.

The FUA gathers the university federations of every local university, which are at the same time composed of student centres of each faculty, totalling a million and a half students throughout the country. The biggest and most important of such federations is the [[Federación de la Universidad de Buenos Aires|FUBA]] of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] with over 300,000 students (as of 2005). Other important federations include the FULP ([[Universidad Nacional de La Plata|La Plata]]), FUR ([[Universidad Nacional de Rosario|Rosario]]), FUC ([[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|Córdoba]]), FUT ([[Universidad Nacional de Tucumán|Tucumán]]) and FUL ([[Universidad Nacional del Litoral|Litoral]]).

In 1894 was founded in the Faculty of Engineering of the UBA the first student centre in Argentina, under the name "La Línea Recta".
Medicine and Law had their own in 1940 and 1905 respectively. The most powerful student centre nowadays is that of the Economic Sciences of the UBA, with 50,000 students, followed by UBA's Law school (35,000) and Medicine (29,000).

==Latin America==
Since its beginnings the FUA supported a politic of Latin American unity and international solidarity. In 1920 Gabriel del Mazo signed, on behalf of the FUA, an exchange and coordination agreement with the [[Peru]]vian ''Federación de Estudiantes del Perú'''s president Raúl Haya de la Torre.

In 1921 the FUA participated of the organization of the First International Students Congress at [[Mexico City]], from which the International Students Federation was born. In 1925 it participated of the organization of the First [[Ibero-America]]n Students Congress also in Mexico city. In that congress [[Alfredo Palacios]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[José Ingenieros]], [[José Martí]] and [[José Vasconcelos]] are declared "teachers of the youth".

In 1937 took place in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]] the First Latin American Students Congress. In 1957 the FUA organised the Second Latin American Students Congress, in [[La Plata]].

Recruits at the [[Army Foundation College]], Yorkshire, UK.
]]
'''The [[Army Foundation College]] recruit abuse investigation 2014–18''' was a response to allegations from a group of 17-year-old [[British Army|British army]] recruits that 17 instructors had maltreated them during their [[Recruit training|training]] over nine days in June 2014.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/13/army-instructors-punched-kicked-teenage-recruits/|title=Army instructors 'punched and kicked teenage recruits'|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=2017-08-13|work=Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/13/17-army-instructors-charged-with-assaulting-teenage-recruits|title=17 army instructors charged with assaulting teenage recruits|last=Perraudin|first=Frances|date=2017-08-13|website=Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-40916510|title=Army instructors face assault charges|date=2017-08-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported as the British army's largest ever investigation of abuse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/army-instructors-face-court-marshall-trial-assaults-teenage-trainees/|title=British Army's 'largest ever abuse case' begins|date=2018-02-12|work=iNews|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the allegations were that the instructors assaulted recruits, smeared cattle dung into their mouths, and held their heads under water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The accused were initially charged with 40 counts of [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]], and other offences;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; all denied the charges made against them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4785252/SEVENTEEN-Army-instructors-charged-attacking-recruits.html|title=Seventeen army instructors charged with attacking recruits|last=Nicol|first=Mark|date=2017-08-12|work=Mail on Sunday|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charges against seven of the accused were dropped by the time of the preliminary hearing on 21 September 2017.

== Background ==
The [[British Army|British army]] enlists new recruits from age 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apply.army.mod.uk/how-to-join/can-i-join|title=Can I Join|last=British army|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruits aged between 16 and 17.5 years, known as Junior Soldiers (JS), undergo 12 months of [[Recruit training|initial training]] based at the [[Army Foundation College]] in [[Harrogate]], Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/our-schools-and-colleges/afc-harrogate/|title=AFC Harrogate|last=British army|date=2018|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of this period, recruits destined for the [[infantry]] travel to battle camp in [[Kirkcudbright]], Dumfries and Galloway, which includes [[bayonet]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=083ffcdc-726d-4068-83fb-f06c259073ec|title=Information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, ref.

Allegations of abuse at the Army Foundation College have been common. Between 2014 and 2017, recruits made 50 formal complaints of assault or ill-treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/teenage-army-recruits-make-50-allegations-of-ill-treatment-at-college|title=Teenage army recruits make 50 allegations of ill-treatment at college|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=2018-03-23|website=Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations and charges ==
Among the initial allegations reported in the [[The Mail on Sunday|''Mail on Sunday'']] on 12 August 2017 were that seventeen instructors from the [[Army Foundation College]], having taken their trainees to battle camp in [[Kirkcudbright]], had pushed cow dung into the recruits' mouths, held their heads under water, and kicked and punched them repeatedly during bayonet training.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The recruits concerned were aged 17;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the instructors were all corporals or sergeants,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and included veterans of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]] and [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The instructors faced 40 charges of [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and other ill-treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; All the accused denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Court martial ==
By the time of the preliminary hearing of 21 September 2017, charges against seven of the accused had been dropped, leaving ten defendants to face 25 counts of ill-treatment and six of battery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4907346/Army-instructors-face-trial-alleged-abuse-recruits.html|title=Ten army instructors face trial over alleged abuse of recruits|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All defendants entered not-guilty pleas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The trial began on 12 February 2018 at [[Bulford Camp|Bulford]] Military Court Centre with Assistant Judge Advocate General Alan Large presiding.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; After the opening prosecution arguments, the defence applied to have the proceedings stayed as an [[abuse of process]],&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; meaning that the allegations were not investigated and brought to court in proper order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://insidetime.org/abuse-of-process-14/|title=Abuse of Process|last=Lennon|first=Jonathan|last2=Rahman|first2=Aziz|date=2014-12-17|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge agreed and, describing the investigation as 'seriously flawed' and 'totally blinkered', criticised the military police for failing to interview key witnesses and taking too long to bring the case to trial.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; On grounds that the defendants could no longer be fairly tried, the judge stayed the case and all defendants were released.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Timeline ==
The following chronology is summarised from the legal judgement.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
* June 2014: A cohort of infantry recruits aged 17 from the Army Foundation College travel to battle camp, where the incidents allegedly took place. The recruits concerned did not make a complaint at the time.
* September 2014: The recruits concerned, now based at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick, are overheard by staff as they discuss the alleged incidents at Battle Camp. Their accounts are recorded informally and passed to the [[Command hierarchy|chain of command]] for action. The [[Royal Military Police]] are contacted.
* October 2014: The military police take formal witness statements from the recruits concerned, some of whom allege abusive treatment by instructors at battle camp during bayonet practice between 6 and 15 June. A statement is also taken from the Staff Sergeant responsible for delivering bayonet training at battle camp that June, who declares that he did not witness any ill treatment at the time. Other instructors were also present, including some of the accused, but statements were not taken from them. The reason for this, as explained later to the Court Martial by the officer in charge of the investigation, was that collecting these additional witness statements would have caused delay and 'the permanent staff [i.e. the instructors] were unlikely to corroborate any allegations of assaults or manhandling of the JS [i.e. the Junior Soldiers or trainees]'. In giving evidence to the court martial, the officer said of the Battle Camp instructors: 'It was unlikely they would say they had witnessed anything—they were likely to say they had not seen anything... If they said they had witnessed it and done nothing they would have incriminated themselves.'
* December 2014: By December 2014, approximately 40 junior soldiers have made allegations against approximately 30 members of staff.
* September 2016: Two years after the alleged incidents, the accused are arrested and questioned under caution.
* July 2017: The Service Prosecution Authority, which prosecutes on behalf of the armed forces, decides to send the case for trial at court martial.
* September 2017: At the preliminary hearing of the court martial on 21 September, all defendants plead not guilty pending a full hearing from 12 February 2018.
* February 2018: After the prosecution arguments, defence counsel argue that the failure to interview potential key witnesses, as well as the long delay between the alleged incidents and trial amount to an abuse of process and they apply for the proceedings to be stayed. The judge agrees and the five defendants are released on the grounds that a fair trial is no longer possible.

Lewis Cherry, a defence lawyer at the court martial interviewed for the BBC said he was 'appalled' by the failure of the military police to conduct its investigation in proper order, and said his clients would be 'relieved that the nightmare of these false allegations hanging over them for many years is over'.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Human rights campaigners argued that the 'multiple failures' that led to the case collapsing showed that the military should not be entrusted to administer its own justice.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The campaign group ForcesWatch said that the case's collapse meant that 'serious allegations of abuse against some of the army's youngest recruits have gone untested'.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] announced an internal review.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''Arthur Gostick Shorrock''' (1861–1945), a pioneer [[Baptist]] missionary in [[China]] for 40 years. Arthur was born in 1861 in [[Blackburn]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]]. He entered [[Spurgeon's College]] and as a student preacher took services at the [[Wraysbury#Non-Conformists in Wraysbury|Baptist Chapel in Wraysbury]]. There he met his future wife, Maud Doulton, a relative of both [[Henry Doulton]] the pottery manufacturer and [[William Thomas Buckland]] the Wraysbury [[auctioneers|auctioneer]]. Arthur then left to become a missionary in China before returning to live in Wraysbury after his retirement.

==Missionary work in China==
Arthur joined the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] and went to [[China]] in 1887,&lt;ref name="Shorrock1887"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shorrock | first = Arthur Gostick| title = Journal Kept During a Voyage to China, from October 21, 1887 to December 26, 1887 | year = 1887 | page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; firstly to [[Shantung]].&lt;ref name="WhosWho1906"&gt;{{cite book  | title = Who's who in the Far East |date=June 1906 | publisher = [[The China Mail]] | location = Hong Kong | page = 291 | url = https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinfareast00hongrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1897 he journeyed to India with one of China's most influential Baptist missionaries, [[Timothy Richard]].  Richard hoped to see the conditions of mission work in India and was pleased to have the "able and earnest" young missionary as a traveling companion.&lt;ref name="Richard1916"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Richard  | first = Timothy | author-link =Timothy Richard | title = Forty-five Years in China: Reminiscences | publisher = [[Frederick A.

===Shaanxi Baptist Mission===
In 1892 Arthur Shorrock and Moir Duncan&lt;ref name="DuncanPapers"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Duncan Papers (Mundus Gateway to missionary collections in the United Kingdom) | location = Angus Library, Regents Park College | url =http://www.mundus.ac.uk/cats/10/1004.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded the ''Sianfu Mission'', in present-day [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]] Province.&lt;ref name="Burt1925"&gt;{{cite book | last =  Burt  | first =  Ernest Whitby | title = Fifty Years in China: The Story of the Baptist Mission in Shantung, [[Shanxi|Shansi]], and [[Shaanxi|Shensi]], 1875–1925 | publisher = The Carey Press | year = 1925 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glover1914"&gt;{{Cite book | year = 1914 | title = Herbert Stanley Jenkins, medical missionary, Shensi, China: with some notices of the work of the Baptist Missionary Society in that country (1914) | location = London | publisher= Carey Press | pages=155 | url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924023085982 | author= Glover, Richard | isbn = 0-524-07100-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duncan1900"&gt;{{Cite book  | year=1900 | title = The missionary mail to faithful friends and candid critics (the substance of letters written from Shên His) | location = London | publisher= Elliot Stock | url=https://archive.org/details/pts_missionarymailto_3721-1233 | author= Duncan, Moir Black }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur was responsible for the Baptist mission work in Shaanxi and became the Principal of the ''Shaanxi Bible College''. In 1898 Moir Duncan and his wife returned to England on a furlough. Maud Doulton, who was attending the ''[[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]]'' before graduating in 1890, was then engaged to Arthur. She left England in January 1900 accompanied by the Duncans. Arthur and Maud were married soon after arriving in [[Shanghai]] and they and the Duncans arrived back in Xi'an on 24 May 1900.&lt;ref name="Glover1914"/&gt; Seven weeks later, on 6 July they were forced to leave the city secretly to escape the [[Taiyuan Massacre]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].

Two years later they returned and Maud then took responsibility for 'Women's Work', and in 1914 became principal of the church's ''Girls' High School'' in [[Xi'an]]. Up until shortly before Arthur Shorrock left China, the following missionaries had worked with him:&lt;ref name="Shorrock1926"/&gt;

===War against opium===
Arthur was horrified by the impact of the [[opium]] trade. In 1890 he was a founding member of the ''Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-[[Opium]] Societies''. Fellow committee members included the prominent missionaries [[John Glasgow Kerr]] MD, [[American Presbyterian Mission]] in [[Guangzhou|Canton]]; [[Boudinot Currie Atterbury|B.C. Atterbury MD]], [[American Presbyterian Mission]] in [[Peking]]; Archdeacon [[Arthur Evans Moule]], [[Church Missionary Society]] in [[Shanghai]]; Henry Whitney MD, [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions|American Board of Commissioners for foreign Missions]] in [[Foochow]]; the Rev Samuel Clarke, [[China Inland Mission]] in [[Kweiyang]] and the Rev [[Griffith John]], [[London Missionary Society]] in [[Hankou District|Hankow]].&lt;ref name="Lodwick1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lodwick | first = Kathleen L. | title = Crusaders Against Opium: Protestant Missionaries in China, 1874–1917 | publisher = University Press of Kentucky | location = Lexington | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-8131-1924-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They resolved to continue their opposition to the opium traffic, urging Christians in China to arouse public opinion against it.  The desire of the missionaries that their ideas be carried out caused them to form "continuation committees" that were assigned tasks to assure that action would be taken on whatever matters had been approved by the conferences. 
He continued working with other missionaries opposed to the [[opium]] trade, including writing to Alexander Hosie about poppy cultivation and corruption associated with attempts to end the cultivation.&lt;ref name="Lodwick1996"/&gt;

=== Xinhai Revolution ===
Once the [[Xinhai Revolution]] reached Shaanxi, resulting in the death of eight foreigners, an evacuation of all missionaries and other foreigners in the region was planned.  The Rev [[J C Keyte]] and the explorer [[Arthur de Carle Sowerby]] planned the relief expedition, and all but a handful of the mission was successfully evacuated due to their efforts.  However, Arthur, Maud and their daughter Mary remained in Shaanxi.  Arthur gave the following reason for remaining: -

::{{cquote|''It would be un-Christian, as well as most unwise, for the doctors to leave at this stage. Their help has been earnestly sought, and the appreciation shown by soldiers and leaders has been most unmistakable. If we desert the people here in their extremity, they are not likely to give us much consideration in the days to come&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref name="BorstSmith1912"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Borst-Smith  | first = Ernest F.   | title = Caught in the Chinese Revolution: A record of risks and rescue | publisher = T Fisher Unwin | location = London | year = 1912 | url = https://archive.org/details/caughtinchineser00borsrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Anti-Christian movement===

Arthur's contributions to China were rewarded with the awarding of the ''Order of the Excellent Crop, Third Class,'' conferred upon him by the President of the Republic of China in 1917.&lt;ref name="Time1917"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Court and Social | newspaper = [[The Times]] | pages = 9 | date = 7 March 1917 | issue=41420 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular sentiment in the 1920s in China was directed against missionaries, foreign merchants, Christian schools, churches and hospitals which were viewed as 'imperialistic'.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto1953"&gt;
{{cite journal  | last = [http://cip.cornell.edu/DPubS?service=Repository&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Disseminate&amp;view=body&amp;content-type=pdf_1&amp;handle=seap.indo/1107010225 Yamamoto]  | first = Tatsuro   | author2 = Sumiko Yamamoto  | title = The Anti-Christian Movement in China, 1922–1927  | journal = The Far Eastern Quarterly  | volume = 12  | issue = 2  | pages = 133–147  | year = 1953  | doi = 10.2307/2941975  | jstor = 2941975  | publisher = Association for Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Shorrock helped organise the 1925 ''Shensi Baptist Conference'', writing a book that argued that missionaries were not imperialist.&lt;ref name="Shorrock1926"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Shorrock  | first = Arthur Gostick | title = [[Shaanxi|Shensi]] in Sunshine and Shade  | publisher = Presbyterian Mission Press | year = 1926  | location = Shanghai}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he wrote:

::{{cquote|''And so when the anti-Christian movement was at its height during the Christmas week, our reply to it was an effort in 'good deeds' visiting the prisoner in his prison, the orphan and the widow, and leaving with each a small gift in bread or cloth or some other useful gift. This is being repeated at the [[Chinese New Year]], and so advantage is taken to show that Christianity is really the witness of a life touched with the feeling of brotherliness, rather than a force to bind the letters of [[Imperialism]], or any other 'ism' It is encouraging to know that 21 have been baptized this year-not so many as we would have hoped, but considering the year, and all its opposition and [[propaganda]], the result is good.''&lt;ref name="Shorrock1926"/&gt;}}

Many missionaries were forced to leave China in the following years. For the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] such experiences resulted in them becoming more sensitive to the political situation of different mission fields.&lt;ref name="Stanley1992"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Stanley  | first = Brian   | title = The History of the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] 1792–1992  | publisher = T&amp;T Clark  | year = 1992  | location = Edinburgh | page=564  | isbn = 0-567-09614-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical methods===
The [[Approaches to evangelism|evangelical methods]] used at the time in [[Shaanxi]] were described as follows:&lt;ref name="Shorrock1926"/&gt;
 
::{{cquote|''Our Lord Jesus Himself, set us the example of ''preaching, teaching, and healing'' to spread the knowledge of His Kingdom, and many and varied were the methods He used to carry out these three principles of action.&amp;nbsp;... To accomplish this end we find Him adopting the following methods, at least, to win men.''
* ''Itinerating through the villages''
* ''Preaching in the synagogues''
* ''Preaching to city crowds''
* ''Talking to an individual''
* ''Visiting homes''
* ''Attending feasts''
* ''Teaching by allegories and parables''
* ''Teaching in retreats''
* ''Teaching continually a group''
* ''Healing by prayer alone''
* ''Healing by prayer and material means''
* ''Healing instantaneously''
* ''Healing by degrees''
* ''Sending out Evangelists''
''In all these ways we are engaged to-day, with the additional method of literary propaganda, which we are assured our Lord sanctions, for how often did He ask His hearers 'Have your never read?'''}}

A '''business–education partnership''' is involvement between schools and business-industry, [[Trade union|unions]], governments and community organizations. These partnerships are established by agreement between two or more parties to establish goals, and to construct a plan of action for achievement of those goals.

Business-education partnerships may involve entire school boards and hundreds of students. Others pair private partners with a single class or individual students. Business-education partnerships serve business and industry by providing activities such as in-service training to employees, use of facilities, student directed projects, software development or marketing research. They also serve to strengthen instruction in academic skills and to enrich the educational process through the talents and ideas of the personnel of participating businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The Canadian Chamber of Commerce|year=1992|title=Focus 2000 Business-Education Partnerships: Your Planning Process Guide|pages=13 |publisher=CCH Canadian Limited|isbn=0-88796-831-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of business-education partnerships==
Frank and Smith (1997), have suggested four classifications for business-education partnerships based on the process the partnership employs.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Flo, and Anne Smith. The Partnership Handbook. Ottawa: Human Resources Development Canada, 2000. PDF accessed February 2007 {{ISBN|0-662-28881-5}}. [http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/MP43-373-1-2000E.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; They found that most business-education partnerships could be categorized into one of the four classifications.

*'''Consultative partnerships''' are for the purpose of receiving public input around change or to gather ideas for policies.
*'''Contributory partnerships''' are formed to benefit an organization or the community.
*'''Operational partnerships''' are work-sharing arrangements in which the components of a given task are delegated to specific parties.
*'''[[Collaborative partnerships]]''' are set up to share resources, risks and decision-making.

==Examples of business-education partnership activities==
There are hundreds of activities in which businesses and schools can engage.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Douglas. Partnerships Survey Report: Findings from the 1st Global Business-Education-Community Partnerships Issues and Trends Survey, The Conference Board of Canada, May 2003 p.10.{{cite web |url=http://www.conferenceboard.ca/topics/education/survey.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831070609/http://www.conferenceboard.ca/topics/education/survey.aspx |archivedate=2012-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include:
*Workshops, conferences, tours, exchange programs, classroom visits, assemblies, workplace visits, science fairs, guest speakers; seminars; presentations;
*Work experience programs, internships, tutoring, skills training, career development activities;
*Mentoring, job–shadowing, apprenticeship, and on–the job training;
*Recruiting, training, school to career information, guidance;
*Curriculum support, teacher development, teacher placements;
*Grants, scholarships, equipment, money, fund-raising; starting an education foundation;

==Achievements of a business-education partnership==
Partnerships with schools may: 
* improve the quality of the workplace, 
* provide employees with learning experiences and a new understanding of the educational system,
* provide opportunities for student's career exploration, 
* bring resources to enrich the curriculum, 
* ensure that school teaching is relevant to the skills required of industry,
* improve the education setting through upgrading facilities or equipment,
* integrate young people into the labour market by involving them in cooperative education experiences,
* connect schools with local businesses,
* assist with curriculum development, new learning opportunities and skill development,
* meet the labour market needs of business and industry.

==Building a business-education partnership==
It may involve:&lt;ref&gt;NCREL North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, Chapter 1: Building Collaborative Partnerships - How does a collaborative partnership plan for action?, U.S. Department of Education, April 1996 [http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/envrnmnt/css/ppt/chap1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* recognizing opportunities for change
* mobilizing people and resources to create changes
* developing a vision of long-term change
* seeking support and involvement from partners
* choosing an effective group of involved participants
* building trust among collaborators, and
* developing learning opportunities and benefits for all partners.

==Lessons learned: assessing the long-term impact of short-term results==
Donald M. Clark of The American Association for Career Education (AACE), concurs with the report to Congress on the implementation of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 that "more must be done to involve employers." He states that studies of "business-education partnerships" since the White House announcement in 1983 urging this type of connection between the two sectors, have consistently pointed out that they have had little, if any, impact on producing fundamental change in the educational system. More specifically, they rarely encompass attempts to affect the curriculum, the overall educational process, or the acquisition of basic skills. Nor have they significantly affected the dropout rate of participating students (Clark, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Donald M. (1996). Making a Difference in Industry-Education Cooperation. NAIEC Newsletter, XXXII:5, November–December 1996. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/14/d4/1f.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The evidence of this growing disenchantment by business and industry was seen in the nationwide surveys of employers conducted by the National Center on the Education quality of the Workforce (EQW). The surveys revealed that most partnerships have diffuse and unquantifiable goals and most of the partnership activities are brief and episodic and involve low levels of investment; they seldom run long enough to make a long-term difference.

[[HRDC]]’s evaluation of programs for in-school youth, taken from its June 1997 final report on the Effectiveness of Employment-Related Programs for Youth: Lessons Learned from Past Experience sheds more light on the long-term impact of limited short-term results. This study found that the most effective programs for young people provide sustained adult contact. Results indicate that the most effective strategies for keeping young people in school are those that build bridges to the world of work while young people are still in school. The most effective strategies were found to combine a training component with strong links to the employer community, more formal training linked to on-the-job training and work experience, and job search assistance and transitional wage subsidies (HRDC June 1997).&lt;ref&gt;HRDC, 1997. ''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110610071740/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/cs/sp/hrsdc/edd/reports/1997-000341/eerpy.pdf Effectiveness of Employment-Related Programs for Youth: Lessons Learned from Past Experience]'', SP-AH027E-06-97&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that co-operative education programs lead to improved employment outcomes in post-secondary school although the number of work experience placements offered by employers is quite limited. 
There are a number of concerns regarding the presence of corporations in the school. There is a fear that the active involvement of business will encourage governments to retreat from their role as the primary funders of education (Torjman, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Torjman, Sherri. (1998). ''[http://www.caledoninst.org/Publications/PDF/partners.pdf Partnerships: The Good, The Bad and The Uncertain]'', {{ISBN|9781894159081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues of corporate involvement in schools reveal disquieting implications of a corporate ideology and ethos entering the learning experience of our young people (Hill and McGowan, 1996).&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;Hill, Philip G., and McGowan, Brian. ''[http://www.oecta.on.ca/pdfs/corpinvolve.pdf Corporate Involvement in Ontario’s Catholic Schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114042231/http://www.oecta.on.ca/pdfs/corpinvolve.pdf |date=January 14, 2006 }}''. Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association, Institute for Catholic Education, {{ISBN|0-9699178-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers are concerned that partnerships with corporations involved in military research and development send a clear message to students. The presence of military contractors in classrooms suggests that schools are not concerned with violence and oppression in the world (Hill and McGowan, 1996).&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; 
Some school boards have developed business-education guidelines which are intended to act as a code that partners can apply to regulate themselves throughout the duration of the partnership but according to the Conference Board of Canada, guidelines and codes of conduct differ significantly (Hill and McGowan, 1996).&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; A code of conduct serves as a screening process to ensure that only socially-responsible businesses are granted access to schools and the partnerships activities would be monitored by an external evaluation committee of parents, community members, teachers and business representatives.

Thus, collaborative learning is commonly illustrated when groups of students work together to search for understanding, meaning, or solutions or to create an artifact or product of their learning. Further, collaborative learning redefines traditional student-teacher relationship in the classroom which results in controversy over whether this paradigm is more beneficial than harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Chiu, M. M. (2004). [http://www.gse.buffalo.edu/fas/chiu/pdf/Adapting_Teacher_Interventions.pdf Adapting teacher interventions to student needs during cooperative learning]. American Educational Research Journal, 41, 365-399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding-Smith, T. (1993). Learning together: An introduction to collaborative learning. New York, NY: HarperCollins College Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative learning activities can include collaborative writing, group projects, joint problem solving, debates, study teams, and other activities. The approach is closely related to [[Introduction to Cooperative Learning|cooperative learning]].

== Theoretical background ==
Collaborative learning is rooted in [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s concept of learning called [[zone of proximal development]]. Typically there are tasks that learners can and cannot accomplish. Between these two areas is the zone of proximal development, which is a category of things that a learner can learn but with the help of guidance. The zone of proximal development gives guidance as to what set of skills a learner has that are in the process of maturation. In Vygotsky's definition of zone of proximal development, he highlighted the importance of learning through communication and interactions with others rather than just through independent work.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, Lev. (1997). [http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/vygotsky78.pdf "Interaction between Learning and Development"]. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This has made way for the ideas of group learning, one of which being collaborative learning.

Collaborative learning is very important in achieving critical thinking. According to Gokhale (1995), individuals are able to achieve higher levels of learning and retain more information when they work in a group rather than individually, this applies to both the facilitators of knowledge, the instructors, and the receivers of knowledge, the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative learning enhances critical thinking|last = Gokhale|first = A.A.|date = 1995|journal = Journal of Technology Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Indigenous communities of the Americas illustrate that collaborative learning occurs because individual participation in learning occurs on a horizontal plane where children and adults are equal.&lt;ref&gt;Paradise, R. (1985). Un análisis psicosocial de la motivación y participación emocional en un caso de aprendizaje individual. Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Educativos, XV, 1, 83-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from cooperative learning ==
There has been a split regarding to the differences between collaborative and cooperative learning. Some believe that collaborative learning is similar, yet distinct from cooperative learning. While both models use a division of labor, collaborative learning requires the mutual engagement of all participants and a coordinated effort to solve the problem whereas cooperative learning requires individuals to take responsibility for a specific section and then coordinate their respective parts together.&lt;ref&gt;Dillenbourgh, P., Baker, M., Blaye, A. &amp; O'Malley, C. (1995). The evolution of research on Collaborative Learning. Retrieved February 19, 2008, from CSCL-A brief overview&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposed differentiation is that cooperative learning is typically used for children because it is used to understand the foundations of knowledge while collaborative learning applies to college and university students because it is used to teach non-foundations of learning. Another believed difference is that cooperative learning is a philosophy of interaction where collaborative learning is a structure of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Kyndt, E., Raes, E., Lismont, B., Timmers, F., Cascallar, E., Dochy, F. (2013). A meta-analysis of the effects of face-to-face cooperative learning. Do recent studies falsify or verify earlier findings? Educational Research Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many psychologists have defined cooperative learning and collaborative learning similarly. Both are group learning mechanisms for learners to obtain a set of skills or knowledge. Some notable psychologists that use this definition for both collaborative and cooperative learning are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Slavin, Cooper and more.

==Classroom==
Often, collaborative learning is used as an umbrella term for a variety of approaches in [[education]] that involve joint intellectual effort by students or students and teachers by engaging individuals in interdependent learning activities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B. L., &amp; MacGregor, J. T. (1992). "What Is Collaborative Learning?". National Center on Postsecondary Teaching, Learning, and Assessment at Pennsylvania State University&lt;/ref&gt; Many have found this to be beneficial in helping students learn effectively and efficiently than if the students were to learn independently. Some positive results from collaborative learning activities are students are able to learn more material by engaging with one another and making sure everyone understands, students retain more information from thoughtful discussion, and students have a more positive attitude about learning and each other by working together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/cal/pdf/guiding-principles4.pdf "Wisconsin's Guiding Principles for Teaching and Learning".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraging collaborative learning may also help improve the learning environment in higher education as well. Kenneth Bruffee performed a theoretical analysis on the state of higher education in America. Bruffee aimed to redefine collaborative learning in academia. Simply including more interdependent activities will help the students become more engaged and thoughtful learners, but teaching them that obtaining knowledge is a communal activity itself.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kelly, J. (2002). [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&amp;context=nchcjournal "Collaborative Learning: Higher Education, Interdependence, and the Authority of Knowledge by Kenneth Bruffee: A Critical Study"] Journal of the National Collegiate Honors Council --Online Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared to more traditional methods where students non-interactively receive information from a teacher, cooperative, problem-based learning demonstrated improvement of [[student engagement]] and retention of classroom material.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, M. (2004).[http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/Prince_AL.pdf "Does Active Learning Work? A Review of Research".] J. Engr. Education, 93(3), 223-231.&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis comparing small-group work to individual work in K-12 and college classrooms also found that students working in small groups achieved significantly more than students working individually, and optimal groups for learning tended to be three- to four-member teams with lower-ability students working best in mixed groups and medium-ability students doing best in homogeneous groups. For higher-ability students, group ability levels made no difference.&lt;ref&gt;Lou, Y., Others. (1996).[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ542075&amp;searchtype=keyword&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;accno=EJ542075&amp;_nfls=false&amp;source=ae "Within-Class Grouping: A eta-Analysis".] Review of Educational Research. 66(4), 423-58.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In more than 40 studies of elementary, middle, and high school English classrooms, discussion-based practices improved comprehension of the text and critical-thinking skills for students across ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, J. (2009)[http://www.quality-talk.org/pdf/Murphy_et_al_2009.pdf "Examining the Effects of classroom Discussion on Students' Comprehension of Text: A Meta-Analysis".] Journal of Educational Psychology. 101(3). 760-764.&lt;/ref&gt; Even discussions lasting as briefly as ten minutes with three participants improved perceived understanding of key story events and characters.&lt;ref&gt;Fall, R., Webb, N., Chudowsky, N. (1997).[https://web.archive.org/web/20100703184836/http://www.cse.ucla.edu/products/Reports/TECH445.pdf "Group Discussion and Large-Scale Language Arts Assessment: Effects on Students' Comprehension"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workplace ==
The popularity of collaborative learning in the workplace&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Learning in the Workplace: Practical Issues and Concerns|last = Lee|first = H.||last2 = Bonk|first2 = C.J.|date = 2014|journal = International Journal of Advanced Corporate Learning|doi = 10.3991/ijac.v7i2.3850|pmid = |access-date =|volume=7|issue=2|page=10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has increased over the last decade. With the emergence of many new collaborative tools, as well as the cost benefit of being able to reinforce learning in workers and in trainees during collaborative training, many work environments are now looking toward methods that involve collaborating with older employees and giving trainees more of a hands-on approach. Most companies are transitioning from traditional training programs that include instructor-led training sessions or online guided tutorials. Collaborative learning is extremely helpful because it uses past experiences from prior employees to help new trainees get over different challenges.

There are many facets to collaboration in the workplace. It is critical to helping worker's share information with each other and creating strategic planning documents that require multiple inputs. It also allows for forms of vertical integration to find effective ways to synchronize business operations with vendors without being forced to acquire additional businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The nature and effectiveness of collaboration between firms, their customers and suppliers: a supply chain perspective.|last = Singh|first = P.J.|date = 2009|journal = Supply Chain Management: An international Journal|doi = 10.1108/13598540910954539|pmid = |access-date =|volume=14|pages=189–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses still work on the traditional instructor and trainee model and as they transition from one model to another there are many issues that still need to be debugged in the conversation process:
*Need to understand actual interests and concerns regarding collaborating processes, activities and tools
*Reigning leaders and managers must better understand the collaborative tools and processes that can boost productivity
*Become better equipped to design, implement and evaluate collaborative learning environment

Web technologies have been accelerating learner-centered personalized learning environments. This helps knowledge be constructed and shared, instead of just passed down by authorities and passively consumed or ignored. Technologies such as discussion threads, email or electronic bulletin boards by sharing personal knowledge and ideas do not let others refine individual ideas so we need more collaborative tools. Now these tools on Web 2.0 have been able to enhance collaborative learning like no other because it allows individuals to work together to generate, discuss and evaluate evolving ideas. These tools allow for them to find people that are like minded and collaborate with them effortlessly.

According to a collaborative learning study conducted by Lee &amp; Bonk (2014), there are still many issues that are still being resolved when dealing with collaborative learning in a workplace. The goal was to examine corporate personnel, including learning managers and instructors, plus the tools that they use for collaboration. The researchers conducted an online survey to see what aspects of collaborative learning should be investigated, followed by an open discussion forum with 30 corporate personnel. The results showed that collaboration is becoming very necessary in workplaces and tools such as wikis are very commonly used. There is implication for a lot of future work, in order to have collaborative learning be highly effective in the workplace. Some of the unsolved problems they identified:
# Cultural diversity, and accordingly a lack of awareness of cultural norms
# Geographical distance and time zone differences
# Member isolation in virtual teams
# Generation gaps and age differences in the acceptance of collaboration tools
# Lack of technology support for learners
# Lack of learners' awareness about effective collaboration processes and strategies
# Lack of learners' technological skills and knowledge about collaboration tools &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
It is crucial to consider the interactive processes among people, but the most critical point is the construction of new knowledge brought about through joint work.

== Technology ==
Technology has become an important factor in collaborative learning. Over the past ten years, the Internet has allowed for a shared space for groups to communicate. Virtual environments have been critical to allowing people to communicate long-distances but still feel like they are part of the group. Research has been conducted on how technology has helped increase the potential of collaborative learning.One study in particular conducted by Elizabeth Stacey looked at how technology affected the communication of postgraduate students studying a Master of Business Administration (MBA) using computer-mediated communication (CMC). Many of these students were able to still remotely learn even when they were not present on their university campus. The results of the study helped build an online learning environment model but since this research was conducted the Internet has grown extensively and thus new software is changing these means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment|last = Stacy|first = Elizabeth|date = 1999|journal = Journal of Distance Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a development of new technology that support collaborative learning in higher education and the workplace. These tools allow for a strong more power and engaging learning environment. Chickering identified seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education developed by Chickering.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Implementing the Seven Principles: Technology as Lever|last = Chickering &amp; Ehrmann|first = |date = 1996|journal = AAHE Bulletin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these principles are especially important in developing technology for collaboration.
# "Good practice develops reciprocity and cooperation among students,"
# Good practice uses active learning techniques.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Some examples of how technology is being increasingly integrated with technology are as follows:

Collaborative networked learning: according to Findley (1987) "Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL) is that learning which occurs via electronic dialogue between self-directed co-learners and learners and experts. Learners share a common purpose, depend upon each other and are accountable to each other for their success. CNL occurs in interactive groups in which participants actively communicate and negotiate learning with one another within a contextual framework which may be facilitated by an online coach, mentor or group leader.

Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is a relatively new educational paradigm within collaborative learning which uses technology in a learning environment to help mediate and support group interactions in a collaborative learning context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Robotic Instruction: A Graph Teaching Experience|last = Mitnik|first = R.|date = 2009|journal = Computers &amp; Education|doi = 10.1016/j.compedu.2009.02.010|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Recabbaren|first2 = M.|first3 = M.|first4 = A.|last3 = Nussubaum|last4 = Soto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Online discussion processes|last = Chen|first = G.|date = 2008|journal = Computers and Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Chiu|first2 = M.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSCL systems use technology to control and monitor interactions, to regulate tasks, rules, and roles, and to mediate the acquisition of new knowledge.

Collaborative learning using [[Wikipedia]]: Wikipedia is an example of how collaborative learning tools have been extremely beneficial in both the classroom and workplace setting. They are able to change based on how groups think and are able to form into a coherent idea based on the needs of the Wikipedia user.

Collaborative learning in virtual worlds by their nature provide an excellent opportunity for collaborative learning. At first learning in virtual worlds was restricted to classroom meetings and lectures, similar to their counterparts in real life. Now collaborative learning is evolving as companies starting to take advantage of unique features offered by virtual world spaces - such as ability to record and map the flow of ideas,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; use 3D models and virtual worlds mind mapping tools.

==Cultural variations==
There also exists cultural variations in ways of collaborative learning. Research in this area has mainly focused on children in indigenous Mayan communities of the Americas or in San Pedro, Guatemala and European American middle-class communities.

Generally, researchers have found that children in indigenous Mayan communities such as San Pedro typically learn through keenly observing and actively contributing to the mature activities of their community.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Roberts, A.L. (2009). Children's reflections on cultural differences in ways of working together. (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University of California, Santa Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of learning is characterized by the learner's collaborative participation through multi-modal communication [[Nonverbal communication#Culture|verbal and non-verbal]] and observations.&lt;ref name="Roberts"  /&gt; They are highly engaged within their community through focused observation.&lt;ref name="Gaskins"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaskins | first1 = S | year = 2000 | title = Children's daily activities in a mayan village: a culturally grounded description | url = | journal = Cross-Cultural Research | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 375–389 | doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayan parents believe that children learn best by observing and so an attentive child is seen as one who is trying to learn.&lt;ref name="Gaskins"  /&gt; It has also been found that these children are extremely competent and independent in self-maintenance at an early age and tend to receive little pressure from their parents.&lt;ref name="Gaskins"  /&gt;

Research has found that even when Indigenous Mayan children are in a classroom setting, the cultural orientation of indigenous learners shows that observation is a preferred strategy of learning.&lt;ref name="Paradise 91"&gt;Paradise, R. (1991). El conocimiento cultural en el aula: Niños indígenas y su orientación hacia la observación. Infancia y Aprendizaje, 55, 73-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus children and adults in a classroom setting adopt cultural practice and organize learning collaboratively.&lt;ref name="Paradise 91"  /&gt; This is in contrast to the European-American classroom model, which allocates control to teachers/adults allowing them to control classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, S. U. (1983). The invisible culture: Communication in the classroom and community on the warm springs reservation. Longman Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the European American middle-class communities, children typically do not learn through collaborative learning methods. In the classroom, these children generally learn by engaging in initiation-reply-evaluation sequences.&lt;ref name="Roberts"  /&gt; This sequence starts with the teacher initiating an exchange, usually by asking a question. The student then replies, with the teacher evaluating the student's answer.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, M. (1990). Cognitive development and formal schooling: The evidence from cross-cultural research. In L.C. Moll (Ed), Vygotsky and education: Instructional implications and applications of sociohistorical psychology. (89-110). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This way of learning fits with European-American middle-class cultural goals of autonomy and independence that are dominant in parenting styles within European-American middle-class culture.&lt;ref name="Roberts"  /&gt;

===Examples from Indigenous communities in the Americas===

Although learning happens in a variety of ways in indigenous communities, collaborative learning is one of the main methods used in [[Indigenous education|indigenous learning styles]] instead of using European-American approaches to learning. These methods include learning in a horizontal plane where children and adults equally contribute to ideas and activities.

For example, Mayan people of San Pedro use collaboration in order to build upon one another's ideas and activities. Mayan mothers do not act as teachers when completing a task with their children, but instead collaborate with children through [[Learning through play#Culture and Learning Through Play|play]] and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, B., Toma, C. (2009). "Shared thinking: Community and institutional variations. Discourse Processes". DOI: 10.1080/01638539209545000.&lt;/ref&gt; People of this Mayan community use the shared endeavors method more than European-Americans who tend to use the transmit-and-test model more often.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt; The shared endeavors model is when people go off of others ideas{{clarify|date=October 2015}} and learn from them, while the transmit-and-test model is what is used in most American schools when a teacher gives students information and then tests the students on the information.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;  The shared endeavors model is a form of collaborative learning because everyone learns from one another and are able to hear and share others' ideas.

In Nocutzepo, Mexico, indigenous heritage families form collective units where it is generally agreed that children and youth engage in adult cooperative household or community economic practices such as food preparation, child care, participating in markets, agriculture, animal herding, and construction to name a few.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urrieta Jr | first1 = L. | year = 2013 | title = Familia and comunidad-based saberes: Learning in an indigenous heritage community | url = | journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 320–335 | doi=10.1111/aeq.12028}}&lt;/ref&gt; During planting and harvesting season, entire families are out in the fields together where children usually pitch into the activity with smaller tasks alongside adults; however, are always observant when it comes to activities done by adults, such as driving a tractor or handling an axe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These children learn through imitation, observation, listening, pitching in, and doing activities in a social and cultural context.&lt;ref name=name&gt;Urrieta Jr., L. (2013). Familia and comunidad-based saberes: Learning in an indigenous heritage community. Antrhopology &amp; Education Quarterly, 44(3), 320-335. Doi:10.1111/aeq.12028&lt;/ref&gt; When children begin to participate in the daily family/community activities, they form a sense of belonging, especially when they collaborate with adults establishing a more mature integration with their family and community. 
  
Indigenous people of the Americas utilize collaborative learning through their emphasis on role sharing and responsibility sharing within their communities. The Mayan community of San Pedro, Guatemala utilizes flexible leadership that allows children to have an active role in their learning.&lt;ref name="Chavajay"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chavajay | first1 = P | year = 2008 | title = Organizational patterns in problem solving among Mayan fathers and children | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 882–888 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.3.882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children and adults work as cohesive groups when tackling new projects.&lt;ref name="Chavajay"  /&gt; Collaborative learning is prevalent in Indigenous communities due to the integration of children in the daily lives of the adults.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, B., Correa-Chavez, M., &amp; Silva, K. G. (2011). Cultural variation in children's attention and learning. In M.A. Gernsbaber, R. W. Pew, L. M. Hough &amp; J. R. Pomerantz (Eds.), Psychology and the real world: Essays illustrating fundamental contributions to society (pp. 154-163). New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Age is not a determining factor in whether or not individuals are incorporated into collaborative efforts and learning that occurs in indigenous communities.

Participation of learner is a key component to collaborative learning as it functions as the method by which the learning process occurs. Thus collaborative learning occurs when children and adults in communities switch between "knowledge performers" and "observing helpers".&lt;ref name="Paradise"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paradise | first1 = R. | last2 = De Haan | first2 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Responsibility and reciprocity: social organization of Mazahua learning practices | url = | journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 187–204 | doi=10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when parents in an indigenous [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] community where assigned the task of organizing children to build a roof over a market stand in such a way that they would learn to do it themselves, parents and children both collaborated on a horizontal structure. Switching between knowledge performer and observing helper, adults and children completed the task peacefully, without assigned roles of educator/student and illustrated that children still took initiative even when adults were still performing.&lt;ref name="Paradise"  /&gt;

Adults and children in indigenous communities of the Americas participate in a horizontal organizational structure; therefore when they work together with one another they are reciprocals of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B. | last2 = Paradise | first2 = R. | last3 = Arauz | first3 = R.

The indigenous communities of the Americas are unique in their collaborative learning because they do not discriminate upon age, instead Indigenous communities of the Americas encourage active participation and flexible leadership roles, regardless of age. Children and adults regularly interchange their roles within their community. In addition, Indigenous communities consider [[Observational learning#Observational learning across cultures|observation]] to be a part of the collaborative learning process.&lt;ref name="Paradise"  /&gt;

Collaborative learning can also be incorporated into university settings. For example, the Intercultural Maya University of [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]], has a system that incorporates elders, such as grandparents to act as tutors and as a resource for students to discuss information and knowledge regarding their own language and culture.  The elders give their recommendation at the end of a semester in the decision of passing or failing a student, based on his/her behavior in the community and how well he/she is learning [[Mayan languages|Maya]]. The system is called IKNAL, a mayan word that implies companionship in the learning and doing process that involves several members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Rosado-May, F.  J. (2012).

=== Examples from around the world ===
Collaborative learning varies across the world. The traditional model for learning is instructor based but that model is quickly changing on a global standpoint as countries fight to be at the top of the economy. A country's history, culture, religious beliefs and politics are all aspects of their national identity and these characteristics influence on citizen's view of collaboration in both a classroom and workplace setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Learning Around the World|last = Chylinski|first = Manya|date = 2011|journal = Faculty Matters- Phoenix University|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* '''Collaborative learning development''' Enables developers of learning systems to work as a network. Specifically relevant to e-learning where developers can share and build knowledge into courses in a collaborative environment. Knowledge of a single subject can be pulled together from remote locations using software systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* Collaborative learning in [[thesis circle]]s in higher education is another example of people learning together. In a thesis circle, a number of students work together with at least one professor or lecturer, to collaboratively coach and supervise individual work on final (e.g. undergraduate or MSc) projects. Students switch frequently between their role as co-supervisor of other students and their own thesis work (incl. receiving feedback from other students).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* Collaborative learning in a composition classroom can unite students when assigned open-tasks. [[Kenneth Bruffee]] introduced the learning method, Classroom Consensus Group, in which the instructor allocates groups of three to five (three being ideal) students and assigns a problem to be solved or question to be answered.  There are two directions the nonfoundational task can be presented: as an indistinct, no right answer that generates discussion or propose an answer and request questions and a process of how the answer came to be.  Once the task is assigned, the instructor backs off in order to resist the urge to intervene in students' conversation.  The goal is to remove focus of the instructor's authority.  The instructor must keep time to ensure the students are centered on analogizing, generalizing, and bridging their comprehension with others.  Following group discussion, the instructor is to evaluate, not judge, the students' work.  Ideas should be presented to the entire class thus allowing the small groups to come together as a whole. It is then that the answers can be compared, gaps can be filled, and authority is not on one individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruffee|first=Kenneth|title=Collaborative Learning|year=1993|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=28–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collaborative scripts structure collaborative learning by creating roles and mediating interactions while allowing for flexibility in dialogue and activities.&lt;ref name="Dillen2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dillenbourg | first1 = P. | last2 = Tchounikine | first2 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Flexibility in Macro-Scripts for Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning | url = | journal = Journal of Computer Assisted Learning | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 1–13 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2729.2007.00191.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kollar"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kollar | first1 = I. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = F. | last3 = Hesse | first3 = F. | year = 2006 | title = Collaboration Scripts--A Conceptual Analysis | url = | journal = [[Educational Psychology Review]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 159–185 | doi=10.1007/s10648-006-9007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative scripts are used in nearly all cases of collaborative learning some of which are more suited for face-to-face collaborative learning—usually, more flexible—and others for computer-supported collaborative learning—typically, more constraining.&lt;ref name="Dillen2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kollar"/&gt; Additionally, there are two broad types of scripts: macro-scripts and micro-scripts. Macro-scripts aim at creating situations within which desired interactions will occur. Micro-scripts emphasize activities of individual learners.&lt;ref name="Dillen2007"/&gt;
Collaborative learning is also employed in the business and government sectors. For example, within the [[federal government of the United States]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) is employing a [[collaborative project management]] approach that focuses on [[collaborating, learning and adapting]] (CLA). CLA involves three concepts:&lt;ref&gt;The CLA approach is detailed for USAID staff in the recently revised ADS 201 guidance that details the project management: USAID. [https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/201.pdf "ADS Chapter 201 Program Cycle Operational Policy"]. Retrieved April 19, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
*collaborating intentionally with stakeholders to share knowledge and reduce duplication of effort,
*learning systematically by drawing on evidence from a variety of sources and taking time to reflect on implementation, and
*adapting strategically based on applied learning.

Her students included [[Will Forte]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Joel McHale]], [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[Julia Sweeney]].&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes|title=Cynthia Szigeti, Groundlings Improv Teacher and 'Seinfeld' Actress, Dies at 66 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cynthia-szigeti-dead-groundlings-teacher-920431 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2016-08-19 |accessdate=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her professional acting credits included ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation]]'', as well as roles in ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

==Early life==

Szigeti went to [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles, California)|Fairfax High School]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; She later received her [[master's degree]] in [[acting]] from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA).&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Szigeti began her career by waitressing at the Pitchell Players improv club after graduating from UCLA.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Her work at the club inspired her to enroll in improv classes at [[The Groundlings]], the L.A. improv school, for $45 a month. Szigeti took the classes before successfully auditioning to become a full-time member of The Groundlings' main comedy troupe.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

==Acting and improv career==

Cynthia Szigeti eventually left The Groundlings for [[The Comedy Store]], a [[comedy club]] in [[West Hollywood]], where she joined The Comedy Store Players alongside [[Taylor Negron]], [[Martin Short]] and [[Robin Williams]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; In a 2009 interview, Szigeti spoke of the differences between performing within the comedy troupes of The Groundlings versus The Comedy Club, saying, "At the Groundlings it was all about [[wig]]s, [[rehearsal]]s and [[costume]]s. At the Store, it was immediate, topical and edgy."&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;&lt;ref name=hp&gt;{{cite news|first=Kris|last=Malone|title=Improv Expert 'Splains It All |url=http://www.hollywoodpassport.net/featured-slider/improv-expert-splains-it-all/ |work=[[Hollywood Passport]] |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, Szigeti returned to The Groundlings to run the school.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; She also continued to teach improv, as well as directing and overseeing the training of its acting teachers.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; In addition to her work at The Groundlings, she also co-founded the [[ACME Comedy Theatre]] in 1989, as well as taught at Keep It Real Acting.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

Szigeti's improv students at The Groundlings and the ACME Comedy Theatre included [[Adam Carolla]], [[Will Forte]], [[Joel McHale]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Cheri Oteri]] and [[Julia Sweeney]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Actress [[Lisa Kudrow]], who studied under her at The Groundlings during the 1980s, called Szigeti "the best thing that happened, on so many levels" and credited her with changing her perspective on acting.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; In a 2012 interview with the [[Archive of American Television]], Kudrow spoke of her experience studying under Szigeti, "She spoke to me in a way that no on else could have. I wasn't going to be OK with a touchy, feely, everyone sort of moan, crazy acting exercise thing. She was, 'There's no time in improv to work up to an emotion! You guys just need to have it [immediately]! It's all pretend anyway!'."&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;&lt;ref name=aatv&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Lisa Kudrow interview: Part 2 of 4 |url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/lisa-kudrow# |work=[[Archive of American Television]] |date=2012-12-22 |accessdate=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Szigeti who encouraged Kudrow to create her first "dumb" or "airhead" character, which Kudrow had initially resisted.&lt;ref name=aatv/&gt;

Outside of improv, Szigeti accumulated her own numerous film and television credits, which spanned several decades. Her film credits included ''[[I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (film)|I Never Promised You a Rose Garden]]'' (1977), ''[[You Light Up My Life (film)|You Light Up My Life]]'' (1977), ''[[The Gong Show Movie]]'' (1980), ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' (1984), ''[[The Wrong Guys]]'' (1988) and ''[[Up Close and Personal (film)|Up Close and Personal]]'' (1996).&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Her [[television sitcom]] roles included ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', ''[[Empty Nest]]'', ''[[The Norm Show]]'', ''[[The King of Queens]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

Most notably, Szigeti played [[Jerry Seinfeld]]'s former high school girlfriend in a 1991 episode of Seinfeld called "[[The Library (Seinfeld)|The Library]]". In the episode, Seinfeld tracks down Szigeti's character to use her as an [[alibi]] for a borrowed book which he never returned to the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Szigeti died from [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] at her home in Los Angeles on August 10, 2016, at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; [[Gunnar Todd Rohrbacher]], an acting coach, founder of Actors Comedy Studio, and another of Szigeti's former students wrote a tribute to Szigeti, noting, "She was definitely intimidating, unapologetic, shockingly intelligent, generous, joyful and demanding... She would tell stories that included names like [[Bruce Springsteen]], Robin Williams, Martin Short, [[Robert Redford]] and [[Helen Mirren]]. If you studied with her, your life was changed, and it was that simple."&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

[[File:Red Triangle.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Red Triangle symbol invented by Deep Tyagi indicates family planning products and services in many countries]]
'''Dharmendra Kumar Tyagi''', better known as '''Deep Tyagi''' or '''DK Tyagi''' (1928–1969), was an Assistant Commissioner for the Indian [[Family Planning]] program until 1969. An early pioneer of [[family planning]] in [[India]] and elsewhere, he was a champion of the program under the premierships of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], and the initial period of [[Indira Gandhi]]. He invented the now-pervasive (in India and some other countries) "[[Red Triangle, Family Planning|Red Triangle]]" symbol as a branding effort to familiarize and popularize the idea of family planning.&lt;ref name="ref86jeviq"&gt;{{Citation | title=Vidura, Volume 6 | author=Press Institute of India | publisher=C.

Many of the [[mass communication]] techniques he developed are now used throughout the developing world to combat disease (such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]) and poverty.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} Part of the [[mission statement]] of the present-day foundation, [[DKT International]], which was named in his honor reads - "He was 41 years old at the time of his death, but had already made a major contribution to his country’s family planning effort. It was he who was largely responsible for the design and dissemination of a massive communication program that brought awareness and knowledge of family planning to hundreds of millions of Indians. He began his work at a time (1966) when modern [[Birth control|contraceptive methods]] were virtually unknown in rural India. His success in saturating the country with simple, attractive messages and designs (including the Red Triangle, which is now in use in several other countries) overcame age-old communication barriers and greatly increased public awareness of birth control."{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}

==Life==
Deep Tyagi was born in [[Ratangarh, Bijnor|Ratangarh village]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in 1928. He died of cancer at the age of 41, in 1969. He had no children.&lt;ref name="ref86jeviq"/&gt;

The '''Deutsche Neurowissenschaften-Olympiade''' ('''DNO''' or German Neuroscience Olympiad) is a series of competitions for students in grades 9 to 13, aimed at promoting interest in [[neuroscience]]. The competition takes place at two levels: city and national. Each competition is in question and answer format and conducted in [[English language|English]]. The winner of the national German Neuroscience Olympiad will represent Germany at the [[International Brain Bee]] competition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dental.umaryland.edu/brainbee/about/|title=About - University of Maryland School of Dentistry|last=University of Maryland School of Dentistry|first=|date=|website=www.dental.umaryland.edu|publisher=|language=en-us|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Deutsche Neurowissenschaften-Olympiad" is part of the [[International Brain Bee]] program which oversees more than 150 competitions in over 45 countries each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schüler I'm Wettbewerb: Wissen Rund um das Gehirn  - Kommunikation und Marketing - Universität Heidelberg|url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news2016/pm20160411_schueler-im-wettbewerb-wissen-rund-um-das-gehirn.html|website=www.uni-heidelberg.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was founded in 1999 by Dr. Norbert Myslinski in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The  program has since expanded beyond the United States.

Dr. Julianne McCall established the "German Brain Bee" competition in 2011, the first of its kind in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neurowissenschaften-olympiade.de/about#history|title=Deutsche Neurowissenschaften Olympiade|last=|first=|date=|website=www.neurowissenschaften-olympiade.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Brain Bee takes place in [[Heidelberg]] and includes over 100 high schools across Germany.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neurowissenschaften-olympiade.de/about/|title=» About - Deutsche Neurowissenschaften Olympiade|last=Deutsche Neurowissenschaften Olympiade|first=|date=|website=www.neurowissenschaften-olympiade.de|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, "The German Brain Bee" was renamed the '''Deutsche Neurowissenschaften-Olympiad''' and is organized by the Deutsche Neurowissenschaften-Olympiad Association. 

In 2016, the board of the DNO began the process of expanding the competition throughout Germany.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Mission==
The motto of DNO is "Driving Connectivity", the organization's mission is to motivate and inspire young people to learn about the human brain, foster interest in the various fields of neurosciences and pursuit of careers in basic neuroscience research. Through local and national competitions, summer research schools, practical courses, and other outreach programs DNO would like to encourage national and international exchange among students on their way towards a scientific career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neurowissenschaften-olympiade.de/about#history|title=Deutsche Neurowissenschaften Olympiade|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of DNO is that through encouraging young students to work together to face new and exciting challenges in neuroscience research, there can be a further understanding of brain functions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Competition==
The competition, which until 2016 has only taken place in [[Heidelberg]], is open to students in grades 9 to 13 with the total number of participants limited to 40-45 students per city. Currently, the German Neuroscience Olympiad is expanding into other cities throughout Germany. In 2017, there will be local student competitions in [[Berlin]], [[Bonn]], and [[Frankfurt]] in addition to the finals competition in Heidelberg. Therefore, 135 students are anticipated to participate in the local Neuroscience Olympiads in 2017. 

The top 15 students from each local competition will be invited to the finals, the location of which is rotated each year. The DNO provides travel allowances for a student traveling long distances to participate in each consecutive level of the Olympiad. The competition is divided into 5 parts: two podium sections, where a jury of three professors will ask questions; a short written exam section; a neuroanatomy section with plastic brain models in addition to microscopy slides with real human brain samples; and a patient diagnosis section with patient videos and mock medical history data. The competition is held in English but a jury can assist in German, if necessary. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://neurowissenschaften-olympiade.de/format-rules/|title=Deutsche Neurowissenschaften Olympiade format and rules|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
The winner of the German Neuroscience Olympiad finals competition receives a trophy and the opportunity to represent Germany at the [[International Brain Bee]], for which flights and accommodation are paid for each winner and a chaperone. The 2nd and 3rd-place winners are also awarded smaller prizes. In the future, DNO aims to provide the top 3 students of each local German Neuroscience Olympiad competition with a chance to do a summer internship in a neuroscience research lab, to allow students to see what the day-to-day research is like.

The term '''digital native''' describes a person that grows up in the [[digital age]], rather than acquiring familiarity with digital systems as an adult, as a '''digital immigrant'''. Both terms were used as early as 1996 as part of the ''[[A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace|Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html "You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023143120/https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html |date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They were popularized by education consultant [[Marc Prensky]] in his 2001 article entitled ''Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants'', in which he relates the contemporary decline in American education to educators' failure to understand the needs of modern students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prensky|first1=Marc|title=Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants|journal=On the Horizon|date=October 2001|volume=9|issue=5|pages=1–6|doi=10.1108/10748120110424816}}&lt;/ref&gt; His article posited that "the arrival and rapid dissemination of digital technology in the last decade of the 20th century" had changed the way students think and process information, making it difficult for them to excel academically using the outdated teaching methods of the day. In other words, children raised in a digital, media-saturated world, require a media-rich learning environment to hold their attention, and Prensky dubbed these children "digital natives".

Globally, 30 percent of the population born between 1988 and 1998 had used the Internet for over five years as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.news.gatech.edu/2013/10/07/where-world-are-young-people-using-internet |title=Where in the World are Young People Using the Internet? |date=October 7, 2013 |website=Georgia Tech News |location=ATLANTA, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
''Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants'' [[Marc Prensky]] defines the term "digital native" and applies it to a new group of students enrolling in educational establishments referring to the young generation as "native speakers" of the digital language of computers, videos, video games, social media and other sites on the internet. Contextually, his ideas were introduced after a decade of worry over increased diagnosis of children with [[ADD]] and ADHD,&lt;ref name="add adhd epidemic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stolzer|first1=J. M.|title=The ADHD Epidemic in America|journal=Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry|date=January 1, 2007|volume=9|issue=2|pages=109–116|doi=10.1891/152315007782021204}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which itself turned out to be largely overblown.&lt;ref name="add debate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merrow|first1=John|title=Attention Deficit Disorder: A Dubious Diagnosis?|url=https://www.pbs.org/merrow/repository/Television/Past/_attn/guide.html|website=www.pbs.org|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prensky did not strictly define the digital native in his 2001 article, but it was later, arbitrarily, applied to children born after 1980, because computer [[bulletin board systems]] and [[Usenet]] were already in use at the time.

The idea became popular among educators and parents, whose children fell within Prensky's definition of a digital native, and has since been embraced as an effective marketing tool.&lt;ref name="digital native marketing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kipke|first1=David|title=A Millennial’s Digital Marketing Worldview|url=http://www.adknowledge.com/blog/millennial-view-of-digital-marketing/|website=www.adknowledge.com|accessdate=1 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423080342/http://www.adknowledge.com/blog/millennial-view-of-digital-marketing/#|archive-date=2015-04-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Prensky's original paper was not a scientific one, and that no empirical data exists to support his claims. However, the concept has been widely addressed in the academic literature since, mainly in education research,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C, Shao, B. The net generation and digital natives: implications for higher education, York: Higher Education Academy, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helsper, E, Enyon, R. Digital natives: where is the evidence? Br Educ Res J 2009; 36: 503–520&lt;/ref&gt; but also in health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{doi|10.1177/2055207618788156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prensky has since abandoned his digital native metaphor in favor "digital wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prensky|first1=Marc|title=From Digital Native to Digital Wisdom|url=http://marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky-Intro_to_From_DN_to_DW.pdf|website=marcprensky.com|publisher=Marc Prensky|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[Digital Visitor and Resident]] idea has been proposed as an alternative to understanding the various ways individuals engage with digital technology.

People who were "born digital", first appeared in a series of presentations by [[Josh Spear]] beginning in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-riD8N0Dt4 |title=Josh Spear presentation at Zeitgeist Europe 2007 |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iabuk.net/en/1/borndigitalgeneration071207.mxs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821130213/http://www.iabuk.net/en/1/borndigitalgeneration071207.mxs |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-21 |title=Wanna go to digital rehab?

==Conflicts between generations==
Due to the obvious divide set between digital natives and digital immigrants, sometimes both generations are forced to meet which commonly results in conflicting ideologies of digital technology.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The everyday regimen of work-life is becoming more technologically advanced with improved computers in offices, more complicated machinery in industry ''etc.'' With technology moving so fast, it is hard for digital immigrants to keep up.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This creates conflicts among older supervisors and managers with the increasingly younger workforce.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Similarly, parents clash with their children at home over gaming, texting, YouTube, Facebook and other Internet technology issues. Much of the world's [[Millennials]] and [[Generation Z]] members are digital natives.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Evan. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/evan-shapiro/tv-cord-cutters_b_1568919.html "TV: An Intervention."] HuffPost TV. June 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to law professor and educator [[John Palfrey]], there may be substantial differences between digital natives and non digital natives, in terms of how people see relationships and institutions and how they access information.&lt;ref name=tws313&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, the timetable for training young and old on new technology is about the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salajan | first1 = F. | last2 = Schonwetter | first2 = D. | last3 = Cleghorn | first3 = B. | year = 2010 | title = Student and faculty inter-generational digital divide: fact or fiction? | url = | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 53 | issue = 3| pages = 1393–1403 | doi = 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.06.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prensky states that education is the single largest problem facing the [[digital world]] as our digital immigrant instructors, who speak an outdated language (that of the pre-digital age), are struggling to teach a population that speaks an entirely new language. Digital natives have had an increased exposure to technology, which has changed the way they interact and respond to digital devices.&lt;ref name="Morgan, 2014"&gt;Morgan, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In order to meet the unique learning needs of digital natives, teachers need to move away from traditional teaching methods that are disconnected with the way students learn today.&lt;ref name="Morgan, 2014"/&gt; For the last 20 years, technology preparation for teachers has been at the forefront of policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lei | first1 = J | year = 2009 | title = Digital natives as preservice teachers: what technology preparation is needed? | url = | journal = Journal of Computing in Teacher Education, Spring | volume = 25 | issue = 3| page = 89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Immigrants suffer complications in teaching natives how to understand an environment which is "native" to them and foreign to Immigrants. Teachers not only struggle with proficiency levels and their abilities to integrate technology into the classroom, but also, display resistance towards the integration of digital tools.&lt;ref name="Hicks, 2011"&gt;Hicks, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since technology can be frustrating and complicated at times, some teachers worry about maintaining their level or professionalism within the classroom.&lt;ref name="Hicks, 2011"/&gt; Teachers worry about appearing "unprofessional" in front of their students.&lt;ref name="Hicks, 2011"/&gt; Although technology presents challenges in the classroom, it is still very important for teachers to understand how natural and useful these digital tools are for students.&lt;ref name="Hicks, 2011"/&gt;

To meet the unique learning needs of digital natives, Forzani and Leu suggest that digital tools are able to respond immediately to the natural, exploratory, and interactive learning style of students today. Learning how to use these digital tools not only provides unique learning opportunities for digital natives, but they also provide necessary skills that will define their future success in the digital age. One preference to this problem is to invent [[computer game]]s to teach digital natives the lessons they need to learn, no matter how serious. This ideology has already been introduced to a number of serious practicalities. For example, piloting an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) in the army consists of someone sitting in front of a computer screen issuing commands to the UAV via a hand-held controller which resembles, in detail, the model of controllers that are used to play games on an [[Xbox 360]] game console. (Jodie C Spreadbury, Army Recruiting and Training Division).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyrosoft.co.uk/blog/2007/11/04/army-fly-uav-spy-plane-with-xbox-360-controller/ Public email b November 4th, 2007 by Paul Maunder] s&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamification]] as a teaching tool has sparked interest in education, and Gee suggests this is because games have special properties that books cannot offer for digital natives.&lt;ref name = "gee"&gt;Gee, J. P. (2012). The old and the new in the new digital literacies. The Educational Forum, 76, 418-420&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, gamification provides an interactive environment for students to engage and practice 21st century skills such as collaboration, critical thinking, problem solving, and digital literacy. Gee presents four reasons why gamification provides a distinct way of learning to promote 21st century skills. First, games are based on problem solving and not on ones ability to memorize content knowledge. Second, gamification promotes creativity in digital natives where they are encouraged to think like a designer or modify to redesign games. Third, digital natives are beginning to co-author their games through the choices they make to solve problems and face challenges. Therefore, students' thinking is stimulated to promote [[metacognition]] since they have to think about their choices and how they will alter the course and outcome of the game. Lastly, through online gaming, digital natives are able to collaborate and learn in a more social environment.&lt;ref name = "gee" /&gt; Based on the literature, one can see the potential and unique benefits digital tools have. For example, online games help digital natives meet their unique learning needs. Furthermore, online gaming seems to provide an interactive and engaging environment that promotes the necessary skills digital natives will need to be successful in their future.

In its application, the concept of the digital native preferences those who grow up with technology as having a special status, ignoring the significant difference between familiarity and creative application.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The classification of people into digital natives and digital immigrants is controversial. Some digital immigrants surpass digital natives in tech savvy, but there is a belief that early exposure to technology fundamentally changes the way people learn. The term "digital immigrant" overlooks the fact that many people born before the digital age were the inventors, designers, developers and first users of digital technology and in this sense could be regarded as the original "natives". To confuse the prolific (and arguably superficial) use of digital technology by current adolescents as deep knowledge and understanding is potentially misleading and unhelpful to the discourse. The term also discounts the broader and more holistic knowledge, experience and understandings that older generations may have about digital technologies and their potential place in society. Digital immigrants are believed to be less quick to pick up new technologies than digital natives{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. This results in the equivalent of a speaking accent when it comes to the way in which they learn and adopt technology.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} A commonly used example is that a digital immigrant may prefer to print out a document to edit it by hand rather than doing onscreen editing.

The actual classification of people into immigrants and natives is tricky as the adoption of digital technology hasn't been a unified phenomenon worldwide. For North America, most people born prior to 1980 are considered digital immigrants. Those closer to the cutoff are sometimes called digital intermediates, which means they started using digital technology in their early teens and thus are closer to digital natives in terms of their understanding and abilities.

The term "digital native" is synonymous with the term "digital inclusion". Being digitally included means that you are innately able in using a smartphone or computer tablets: modern technology has enabled the non-speaking to speak, the non-hearing to hear and the non-seeing to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Nachimuthu|Vijayakumari|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, there is debate over whether there is any adequate evidence for claims made about ''digital natives'' and their implications for education. {{Harvtxt|Bennett|Maton|Kervin|2008}}, for example, critically review the research evidence and describe some accounts of digital natives as having an academic form of a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bullen, M. |author2=Morgan, T. |author3=Qayyum, A.|title=Digital Learners in Higher Education: Generation is Not the Issue|journal=Canadian Journal of Learning &amp; Technology|date=2011|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://www.cjlt.ca/index.php/cjlt/article/view/550|doi=10.21432/t2nc7b}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that generation does not explain differences in how learners use technology and that there is no empirical research to support claims made by Prensky and other proponents of the idea of the digital native. Using such a terminology is rather a sign of unfamiliarity and exoticism in relation to digital culture. Of course, nobody is "born digital"; as with any cultural technology, such as reading and writing, it is matter of access to education and experience.

It considers that all youths are digital natives in the modern age. However, this is not the case. It is primarily based on cultural differences and not by age. According to Henry Jenkins (2007), "Part of the challenge of this research is to understand the dynamics of who exactly is, and who is not, a digital native and what that means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Reconsidering Digital Immigrants|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2007/12/reconsidering_digital_immigran.html|accessdate=5 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are underlying conflicts on the definition of the term "digital natives" and it is wrong to say that all modern age youths are placed in that particular category or that all older adults can be described as digital immigrants. Some adults are more tech savvy than a lot of children, depending on socio-economic standings, personal interests, etc., but as teachers we must include the world outside with which the children are familiar and use it inside the classroom.

The formulation of ''digital native'' is also challenged by researchers looking at emerging technology landscapes. The current discourse concentrates largely on developed technology and has a particular bias towards white, middle-class youth who have the privilege of access to technology. Nishant Shah (2009) says, "It is necessary to promote research that grasps that not all Digital Natives are equal. Each context will have certain norms by which digital nativity is understood and experienced. Dismantling the universal Digital Native and considering contextualised Digital Native identities might also help us move away from speaking of the Digital Native as a necessarily elite power-user of technology and understand the identity as a point of departure from earlier technology-mediated identities within those contexts." He also suggests that one way of understanding "digital natives" is to look at how they use digital technologies to engage with their immediate environments and initiate processes of social and personal change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz4KoL3jzi0 |title=Presentation at Re:publica 2010, Berlin |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to argue that [[digitality]] is not a birth-right but instead a product of cultural capital. According to its originator, Pierre Bordieu, cultural capital is defined as "the possession of certain cultural competencies, bodies of cultural knowledge, that provide for distinguished modes of cultural consumption".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cultural capital]] see page&lt;/ref&gt; Familiarity with technology and ease of use is a form of social capital that allows those who possess it to advance in society. In fact, scholars have commented on the variability of technological literacy in different social groups. In "Communities, Cultural Capital and the Digital Divide", Viviana Rojas calls this phenomenon a person's "techno-disposition". This familiarity with technology is one of many privileges granted by cultural capital. She defines techno-disposition more explicitly as "practices, perceptions and attitudes, technical education, awareness of technology, desires for information, job requirements, social relations with community members and community organizations, and geographical location".&lt;ref&gt;Rojas, 9&lt;/ref&gt; One's techno-disposition, not simply one's access to technology, she argues, is at the root of any [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;Rojas, Viviana "Communities, Cultural Capital and the Digital Divide"&lt;/ref&gt;

As we move into the second decade of the 21st century, others are calling into question Prensky's Digital/Immigrant dichotomy on different grounds. {{Harvtxt|Jones|Shao|2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/30014/ |title=Jones and Shao (2011) The net generation and digital natives: implications for higher education. Higher Education Academy, York |publisher=Oro.open.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently conducted a literature review for the UK Higher Education Academy which found that there was no empirical evidence of a single new generation of young students. They argued that complex changes were taking place but there was no evidence of a generation gap. The nature of the [[metaphor]] itself is challenged, with White and Le Cornu (2011) drawing attention to the difficulties that a language-based analogy introduces, especially when then linked to age and place. They also highlight the rapid technological advances that have been made in the last ten years, most notably in the advent of social networking platforms. White and Le Cornu therefore propose an alternative metaphor of [[Digital Visitor and Resident|Visitors and Residents]] which they suggest more accurately represents the ways in which learners engage with technology in a social networking age.

'''Durham University Electric Motorsport''' (DUEM) is a student-run team in the United Kingdom that designs and constructs [[Solar car|solar powered cars]] to compete in [[Solar car racing|international competitions]]. DUEM is the longest running solar car team in the UK and is financed entirely by third party donations and sponsorship.

==Background==

[[Durham University]] Electric Motorsport is based in the university’s [[Durham University School of Engineering and Computing Sciences|School of Engineering]], with a team size of around 50 undergraduate students split broadly across mechanical, electrical, electronic and business sub-teams. The team is also strongly supported by graduates and academics within the department with expertise in the fields of [[Solar energy#Applications of solar technology|solar technology]], [[Automotive aerodynamics|racing car aerodynamics]], [[Wheel hub motor|direct-drive electrical machines]] and [[Hybrid electric vehicle|electrical/hybrid vehicles]]. Many concepts and features implemented in the vehicles have been developed as part of final year undergraduate projects.

The team was founded as Durham University Solar Car (DUSC) in 2002, and it built its first vehicle in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/dusc/?page_id=29|publisher=Durham University Solar Car|title=DUSC History|accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; DUSC’s first competitive event was the 2008 [[North American Solar Challenge]] in which they finished 14th out of 26 competitors, earning the “Best Rookie Team” award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Local Technology: Durham University's Solar Car|url=http://www.thebubble.org.uk/science/local-technology-durham-university-s-solar-car|accessdate=2012-02-01|newspaper=The Bubble|date=2010-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609062536/http://www.thebubble.org.uk/science/local-technology-durham-university-s-solar-car|archivedate=2013-06-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the only British team to compete. DUSC also competed in the 2011 Veolia [[World Solar Challenge]] race across [[Australia]], qualifying in the top ten &amp; then finishing 33rd out of 42 entrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/files/318_2011_veolia_world_solar_challenge_provisional_results_pending_protests.pdf|publisher=World Solar Challenge|title=2011 Veolia World Solar Challenge Provisional Results Pending Protests|accessdate=2012-02-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106012232/http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/files/318_2011_veolia_world_solar_challenge_provisional_results_pending_protests.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:DurhamUniversitySolarCarLogo.png|thumb|The Durham University Solar Car logo]]

In 2014 Durham University Solar Car combined with Durham University Formula Student to create Durham University Electric Motorsport (DUEM). DUEM developed a new solar powered vehicle called DUSC 2015, paying homage to the design work carried out while the team was still known as DUSC - DUSC 2015 competed in the 2015 [[World Solar Challenge|Bridgestone World Solar Challenge]].

In 2017, the team headed back to Australia to compete once more with a modified version of DUSC 2015, showing an improvement in performance and completing more than 1000km on solar power.

DUEM also participates in local community and awareness outreach events, including touring schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sun Powered Car Sets Off on Tour|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/3864737.stm|accessdate=2012-02-01|newspaper=The BBC|date=2004-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and museum exhibitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Solar car in Endurance Challenge|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/7252479.stm|accessdate=2012-02-01|newspaper=The BBC|date=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote science, technology and engineering. In 2010, DUEM (then DUSC) ran a successful demonstration event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfleet.net/news/1/791-arrive-n-drive-demonstrates-the-future-of-sustainable-motoring|publisher=Greenfleet|title=Arrive 'N' Drive Demonstrates the Future of Sustainable Motoring|accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Cambridge University Eco Racing]] (CUER).

===Mechanical design===

The steel [[Space frame|space frame]] chassis was designed using [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]] software. The chassis is strong enough to withstand a heavy impact, whilst also being as light as possible. The suspension consists of racing shock absorbers, with a conventional [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] arrangement at the front and a [[Trailing-arm suspension|trailing arm]] at the rear. Special brake calipers are used, which retract to ensure there are no frictional losses when the brakes are not applied. Specialist solar car tyres are employed to reduce rolling resistance.

===Electrical design===

A combination of high-efficiency silicon solar cells and [[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]] are used to extract the maximum possible power from the available solar energy and feed it into a [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|lithium iron phosphate]] battery pack. The vehicle is driven by a specially designed axial flux wheel motor via a custom controller, resulting in higher efficiency and less transmission loss than conventional electric motors.

===Electronic design===

The vehicle makes use of a telemetry system operating the [[Controller area network|CAN]] protocol to communicate real-time vehicle data over a radio link to a support vehicle. Using this data, the driver may make control adjustments to the vehicle to account for the current performance of the electrical package.

===Racing as DUSC2008===

Substantially the same car was raced both as DUSC2008 across North America and as DUSC2011 across Australia. The major changes between the two are that in 2008 a chain drive was used instead of the in wheel motor, lead acid batteries were used instead of lithium iron, and a commercial solar array was used instead of in-house custom encapsulated panels. There were also numerous other minor changes.

===Mechanical design===

DUSC 2015 is a Challenger Class solar car designed to compete in the 2015 [[World Solar Challenge|Bridgestone World Solar Challenge]]. It is the first vehicle built by DUEM to feature a [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]] [[Monocoque|monocoque]], offering significant weight savings over earlier spaceframe designs. Extensive [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]] was performed on the chassis to optimise its design and crash safety. The car uses a 4-wheeled catamaran configuration, designed to have minimal frontal area to reduce drag.

The car's front suspension is a duolever design, chosen for its favourable packaging requirements. Carbon [[Trailing-arm suspension|trailing arm]] rear suspension is used to reduce unsprung mass. Industrial hydraulic retracting brake calipers are used to minimise mechanical power losses. DUSC 2015 runs on specialist [[Schwalbe (tire manufacturer)|Schwalbe]] Energiser S tyres, featuring a solar car specific low rolling resistance compound.

===Electrical design===

DUSC 2015 has a 6&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; solar array, using high-efficiency cells from Gochermann Solar Technology. The array is capable of providing 1.4&amp;nbsp;kW at peak sunlight, which can drive the motor directly or feed excess power into the [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|lithium iron phosphate]] battery pack.

The car uses a bespoke in-hub [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless motor]] designed and manufactured in Durham University. The axial flux machine is a derivative of a concept first designed in 2011, optimised to give a peak efficiency of 98%, and develops a maximum power of 5&amp;nbsp;kW. The machine drives the rear left wheel of the vehicle only, which is made possible by the vehicle's asymmetric weight distribution.

===Electronic design===

To capture as much telemetry data as possible, custom circuitry termed 'sensor nodes' were developed. Sensor nodes are designed so they can all communicate to each other across the length of the vehicle, as well as each individual node being able to interface with over 20 different sensors each. This also allows some data to be relayed to the driver via the dashboard.

===Mechanical design===

The 2017 car from DUEM, simply called 'DUSC', is a heavily modified version of DUSC 2015. While several aspects (such as the [[Monocoque|monocoque]], powertrain, and wheels) remained unchanged from the 2015 car, changes were made both to improve performance and comply with new regulations introduced for Challenger-class vehicles in the 2017 [[World Solar Challenge|Bridgestone World Solar Challenge]].

To improve handling characteristics and stability, the car uses a new version of the duolever front suspension. While this contributes an overall increase in weight, other changes such as optimizing the [[Trailing-arm suspension|trailing arm]] shape mitigate the effects. To reduce drag, wheel covers are used on the existing rims.
===Electrical design===

In line with 2017 regulations, the solar array area of DUSC is 4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (down from 6&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) using the same cells as DUSC 2015. This feeds the motor (largely unchanged from the previous iteration), as well as a new [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] battery, which represents a significant weight saving.

===Electronics design===

The car uses a new driver dashboard, allowing the driver to obtain real-time telemetry information directly as well as improving layout and ergonomics. Changes were also made to the exterior lights to comply with regulations, increasing indicator and brakelight visibility.

Ebot ({{Lang-ar|إي بوت}}) is a [[microcontroller]] unit invented by two Kuwaiti engineers and has received many national and international prizes.

Ebot is a mini integrated digital computer that consists of a [[Processor (computing)|processor]], [[RAM]] and input/output [[peripheral device]]s. Unlike processors used in PCs, Ebot was designed for [[embedded system]]s to control operations.

== Hardware ==
[[File:Ebot8-PRO.png|280x280px|thumb|Ebot8 PRO pinout diagram]]
[[File:Ebot Pinout diagram.png|280x280px|thumb|Ebot8 pinout diagram]]
[[File:Ebot4 pinout.png|280x280px|thumb|Ebot4 pinout diagram]]



The Ebot microcontroller was built using an ([[ATMEGA1284P]]) integrated circuit from the ([[AVR 8-bit]]) family, which uses 8 bits to build the commands.

The diagram consists of two layers. The first layer has (ATMEGA1284P) pin functions, the second has the [[Arduino]]-compatible pins ([[Booting|bootloader]]), and the second layer has the names of the (Ebot) pins. The pin names and placement have been modified to suit the unit’s inputs and outputs ports, which will facilitate the programming process for the user.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=AlSaleh|first1=Ahmad|title=Ebot Booklet  beginner’s guide|publisher=CreativeBits Solutions|location=Kuwait|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==

Ebot IDE was developed by CreativeBits Co., and was designed to teach programming in a simple way. The software allows users to program using a [[command-line interface]] or a [[graphical interface]], with a Data Lab to analyze the records, a serial Monitor to view current readings, and an PC control Interface to add more advanced options.

Ebot IDE works like a [[magnet]], where the user drags one component from one of the menus on the left (Input, Output, Flow) and drops it at the top of the graphical page. When dragging the next component, it will be attached to the previous one, and so on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Robotics education in Kuwait ==
15 schools (primary and secondary) have been teaching robotics in Kuwait, and by the 2016 academic year it was planned to be taught on a wider scale in all state schools, according to the Education Minister  Bader Hamad Al-Essa. Certain errors{{such_as}} will have to be rectified after they emerged during teaching it in some schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/pdf/2015/apr/27/p03.pdf|title=Education Minister reiterates support to talented students|last=|first=|date=27 April 2015|website=Kuwait Times|publisher=Kuwait Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robotics competitions offer a chance to encourage students to build their own solutions as a team to real-world problems using science and maths. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wamda.com/2016/05/can-robots-improve-kuwait-educational-sector-nuwait|title=Can robots improve Kuwait's educational sector?|website=wamda|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development''' (EiABC) is an institute in [[Addis Ababa]].

== History ==

=== Early History ===
When founded in 1954 the initial educational scheme aimed to offer a three-year diploma program in building engineering. This was shortly upgraded to a four-year program leading to a BSc. Degree in Building Engineering. In 1969, the Building College merged with the college of engineering and formed the Faculty of Technology under [[Addis Ababa University]], and remained as such until 2009. on March 6, 2010, the institute was reformed into its current state as the Ethiopian institute of architecture building construction and city development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aau.edu.et/eiabc/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent History ===
With a nationwide effort to establish an internationally recognized curriculum in Architecture, engineering and urban planning disciplines and to start a unified bachelor and Master system in Ethiopia, in 2005, the institute went through several underlying changes. With a partnership with the [[ETH Zurich|ETH]] in [[Zürich]], Switzerland new academic structures and capacity building programs started. After the development of a strategy to establish 'Institutes of Technologies' in Ethiopia, a new scientific director was installed directly from ETHZ.

== Organization and Administration ==
As of September 14, 2014, the institute reports to a supervisory board chaired by [[Mekuria Haile]], Minister of Urban Development and Construction management (MoUDC). The board in turn reports to the Addis Ababa University board.

== Facilities ==
EiABC is located on the Jimma Road next to the Federal High Court in [[Lideta]] Sub City. It comprises classrooms, laboratories, workshops, sport facilities, design studios, cafeterias, libraries, research ground and also offices for staff and students.

== Programs ==

=== Undergraduate ===
Three different bachelor programs are offered as the institute. Namely, '''Architecture''', '''Construction Technology Management''' and '''Urban and Regional Planning'''&lt;ref&gt;http://eiabc.edu.et/index.php/academics/programs-of-study/bachelor-programs&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Masters ===
The master's program is designed to enable and prepare students both for the international and national labor market. The masters Programs at EiABC include:
* Advanced Architectural Design
* Preservation and Conservation of historical Buildings and sites
* Urban Design and Development
* Housing and sustainable development
* Landscape architecture
* Environmental Planning

The master's program have a duration of 1.5/2 years. The requirements for admission into the master's program include Qualified Bachelor with GPA above 3.0 and an Entrance Exam.&lt;ref&gt;http://eiabc.edu.et/index.php/academics/programs-of-study/master-programs&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PHD ===
The institute's first doctoral program is on "Environmental planning". It addresses a diversity of environmental issues included but not limited to quality, habitat conservation, water quality and natural resources. The second doctoral program, launched in 2014, is "Urban and Regional Planning". It deals with issues of planning, management, development, policies and strategies related to the urban and regional levels.

The '''Florida Association of Band Directors''' ('''FABD''') was an organization dedicated to provide the music schools of predominantly black colleges in Florida, United States, with a feeder system from 1941 until 1966, when the organization merged with the Florida Bandmasters Association (FBA).

==History==

Prior to 1940 and two years thereafter,{{clarification needed|date=October 2018|reason=...what?}} there were no programs in the public schools of Florida offering instrumental music to the African-American children in those schools. As a result, the schools of higher education (such as [[Florida A&amp;M College]], [[Edward Waters College]], [[Bethune-Cookman College]], and [[Florida Memorial College]]) had no feeder programs for the development of bands.

In 1941, Leander A. Kirksey (band and orchestra director) and J. Harold Brown (director of the music department at Florida A&amp;M College) called a meeting of several young graduates from the music department of Florida A&amp;M College. George Hill (employed at [[Crooms Academy]] in Sanford), Alvin Downing (employed at [[Gibbs High School (St. Petersburg, Florida)|Gibbs High School]] in St. Petersburg), Raymond Sheppard (employed at [[Booker T. Washington High School (Pensacola, Florida)|Booker T. Washington High]] in Pensacola), Michael Rodriguez (employed at Booker T. Washington Jr. High in Tampa), and Guy Glover (employed at [[Dorsey High School]] in Broward) met on April 10–12, 1941 to organize an association whose chief purpose would be to provide feeders for the instrumental program at Florida A&amp;M and other predominately black colleges in Florida. The association was named the Florida Association of Band Directors.

Its membership grew to more than thirty band directors, teaching several thousand students. It was merged with the FBA in 1966.

===Past presidents of the FABD===

* Leander Kirksey, 1941–1955
* George H. Hill, 1955–1960
* James W. Wilson, 1960–1966

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">'''Fountas &amp; Pinnell reading levels''' (commonly referred to as "Fountas &amp; Pinnell") are a system of reading levels developed by Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell to support their [[guided reading]] method.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Fountas, I.

Portsmith: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Reading text is classified according to various parameters, such as word count, number of different words, number of [[high-frequency word]]s, sentence length, sentence complexity, word repetitions, illustration support, etc. While classification is guided by these parameters, syllable type, an important consideration in beginning reading, is not considered as part of the leveling system. Small books containing a combination of text and illustrations are then provided to educators for each level.&lt;ref name="books"&gt;[http://www.heinemann.com/fountasandpinnell/ Level books at heinemann.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

While young children display a wide distribution of reading skills, each level is tentatively associated with a school grade. Some schools adopt target reading levels for their pupils. This is the grade-level equivalence chart recommended by Fountas &amp; Pinnell.&lt;ref name="chart"&gt;[http://www.heinemann.com/shared/supportingMaterials/benchmark/GradeLevelEquivalenceChart.pdf  Level equivalence chart]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fountasandpinnell.com/textlevelgradient/ F&amp;P Text Level Gradient™]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grafička škola u Zagrebu''' ('''Graphics School in Zagreb''') is a public high school in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. The school has 550 students, and 70 employees of which 54 are teachers.

== History ==
In 1886 two [[Printer (publishing)|printer]]s completed their [[apprenticeship]]. Eight years later in 1894 a group of 19 [[book printer]]s finished their education. By decision of the Teachers' Council 1894 is considered the year of establishment of the school.

By the year 1945 more than 1500 students finished school.

The first school building was located in Gundulićeva 10. Soon the school got a part of a building where [[Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb|Museum of Arts and Crafts]] is located today. The main directorate of the graphics industry donated printing machinery, devices and furniture to the school. It moved to the current location Getaldićeva 2 in 1951.

11000 students have graduated to date.

=== Names of the school ===
The school has changed its name many times:
* 1947:  '''Savezna grafička industrijska škola''' (Federal School of the Graphics Industry)
* 1951:  '''Grafička škola s praktičnom obukom''' (Graphics School with Practical Training)
* 1962:  '''Grafički školski centar''' (School Center of Graphics)
* 1972:  '''Grafički srednjoškolski centar''' (High School Center of Graphics)
* 1981:  '''Grafički obrazovni centar "Bratstvo i jedinstvo"''' (Graphical Educational Center "Brotherhood and unity")
* 1991:  '''Grafička škola u Zagrebu''' (Graphics School in Zagreb) - current name

== Curriculum ==
The school has seven educational programs:
* Graphics Technician (Grafički tehničar)
* Prepress Technician (Grafički tehničar pripreme)
* Printing Technician (Grafički tehničar tiska)
* Production Technician (Grafički tehničar dorade)

A '''grassroots''' movement is one which uses the people in a given district, region, or community as the basis for a political or economic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged|last=Gove|first=Philip Babcock|publisher=Riverside Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassroots movements and organizations use collective action from the local level to effect change at the local, regional, national, or international level. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up, rather than top-down decision making, and are sometimes considered more natural or spontaneous than more traditional power structures.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Grassroots movements, using self-organization, encourage community members to contribute by taking responsibility and action for their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=10&amp;sid=635d1f93-740e-4258-b3ff-a51235214e8d@sessionmgr103&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=117449818&amp;db=asu|title=NEIGHBORHOOD REGENERATION AT THE GRASSROOTS PARTICIPATION: INCUBATORS' CO-C...: Start Your Search!|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassroots movements utilize a variety of strategies from fundraising and registering voters, to simply encouraging political conversation. Goals of specific movements vary, but the movements are consistent in their focus on increasing mass participation in politics.&lt;ref name="Grassroots Movements"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poggi|first1=Sarah|title=Grassroots Movements|url=http://my.ilstu.edu/~skhunt2/pep/Downloads/poggi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These political movements may begin as small and at the local level, but grassroots politics as [[Cornel West]] contends are necessary in shaping progressive politics as they bring public attention to regional political concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Popular Culture|last=Wallace|first=Michele|publisher=Bay Press|year=1992|isbn=978-1-56584-459-9|location=Seattle|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of grassroots is often conflated with [[participatory democracy]]. The [[Port Huron Statement]], a manifesto seeking a more democratic society, says that to create a more equitable society, "the grass roots of American Society" need to be the basis of civil rights and economic reform movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Students for a Democratic Society|title=Port Huron Statement|url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/huron.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705062937/http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/huron.html|archivedate=July 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms can be distinguished in that grassroots often refers to a specific movement or organization, whereas participatory democracy refers to the larger system of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Direct and Participatory Democracy at Grassroots Level|url=http://cor.europa.eu/en/documentation/studies/Documents/direct-participatory-democracy.pdf|publisher=European Institute of Public Administration|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest origins of the use of "grass roots" as a political metaphor are obscure. In the [[United States]], an early use of the phrase "grassroots and boots" was thought to have been coined by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Albert J. Beveridge|Albert Jeremiah Beveridge]] of [[Indiana]], who said of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] in 1912, "This party has come from the grass roots. It has grown from the soil of people's hard necessities".&lt;ref name=Beveridge&gt;Courtesy: Eigen's Political &amp; Historical Quotations {{cite web |url=http://www.politicalquotes.org/quotedisplay.aspx?DocID=12869 |title=Beveridge, Albert J. |date=2006-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616173929/http://www.politicalquotes.org/quotedisplay.aspx?DocID=12869 |archivedate=June 16, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1907 newspaper article about Ed Perry, vice-chairman of the Oklahoma state committee, the phrase was used as follows: "In regard to his political views Mr. Perry has issued the following terse platform: 'I am for a square deal, grass root representation, for keeping close to the people, against ring rule and for fair treatment.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1907-09-09/ed-1/seq-4/;words=grass+root|title=New-York tribune. (New York [N.Y.]) 1866-1924, September 09, 1907, Page 4, Image 4|work=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1904 news article on a campaign for possible [[Theodore Roosevelt]] running mate [[Eli Torrance]] quotes a Kansas political organizer as saying: "Roosevelt and Torrance clubs will be organized in every locality. We will begin at the grass roots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058130/1903-09-25/ed-1/seq-6/;words=grass+roots|title=The Salt Lake herald. (Salt Lake City [Utah]) 1870-1909, September 25, 1903, Last Edition, Page 6, Image 6|work=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1900s, grassroots movements have been widespread both in the United States and in other countries. Major examples include parts of the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil's land equity movement of the 1970s and beyond, the Chinese rural democracy movement of the 1980s, and the German peace movement of the 1980s.

A particular instantiation of grassroots politics in the American Civil Rights Movement was the 1951 case of William Van Til working on the integration of the Nashville Public Schools. Van Til worked to create a grassroots movement focused on discussing race relations at the local level. To that end, he founded the Nashville Community Relations Conference, which brought together leaders from various communities in Nashville to discuss the possibility of integration. In response to his attempts to network with leadership in the black community, residents of Nashville responded with violence and scare tactics. However, Van Til was still able to bring blacks and whites together to discuss the potential for changing race relations, and he was ultimately instrumental in integrating the Peabody College of Education in Nashville. Furthermore, the desegregation plan proposed by Van Til's Conference was implemented by Nashville schools in 1957. This movement is characterized as grassroots because it focused on changing a norm at the local level using local power. Van Til worked with local organizations to foster political dialogue and was ultimately successful.

The Brazilian Landless Workers Movement (MST) was founded in the 1970s and has grown into an international organization. The MST focused on organizing young farmers and their children in fighting for a variety of rights, most notably the right to access land. The movement sought organic leaders and used strategies of direct action such as land occupations. It largely maintained autonomy from the Brazilian government. The MST traces its roots to discontent arising from large land inequalities in Brazil in the 1960s. Such discontent gained traction, particularly after Brazil became a democracy in 1985. The movement focused especially on occupying land that was considered unproductive, thus showing that it was seeking overall social benefit. In the 1990s the influence of the MST grew tremendously following two mass killings of protestors. Successful protests were those in which the families of those occupying properties receiving plots of land. It is worth noting that although the grassroots efforts of the MST were successful in Brazil when they were tried by the South African Landless People's Movement (LPM) in 2001 they were not nearly as successful. Land occupations in South Africa were politically contentious and did not achieve the positive results seen by the MST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baletti|first1=Brenda|last2=Wolford|first2=W|last3=Johnson|first3=Tamara|title=Late Mobilization: Transnational Peasant Networks and Grassroots Organizing in Brazil and South Africa|journal=Journal of Agrarian Change|volume=8|issue=2-3|pages=290–314|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0366.2008.00171.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2008.00171.x/full|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National People's Congress was a grassroots democratic reform movement that came out of the existing Chinese government in 1987. It encouraged grassroots elections in villages all around China with the express purpose of bringing democracy to the local level of government. Reforms took the form of self-governing village committees that were elected in a competitive, democratic process. Xu Wang from Princeton University called the Congress mutually empowering for the state and the peasantry in that the state was given a renewed level of legitimacy by the democratic reforms, and the peasantry was given far more political power. This manifested itself in increased voting rate, particularly for the poor, and increased levels of political awareness according to Wang's research. One example of the increased accountability from the new institutions was a province in which villagers gave 99,000 suggestions to the local government. Ultimately, 78,000 of these were adopted indicating a high rate of governmental responsiveness. This movement is considered grassroots because it focuses on systematically empowering the people. This focus manifested itself in the democratic institutions that focused on engaging the poor and in reform efforts that sought to make the government more responsive to the will of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Xu|title=Mutual Empowerment of State and Peasantry: Grassroots Democracy in Rural China|journal=World Development|date=1997|volume=25|issue=9|pages=1431–1442|doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(97)00047-8}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of a historical grassroots movement was the 1980s German peace movement. The movement traces its roots to the 1950s movement opposing nuclear armament, or the "Ban the Bomb" Movement. In the 1980s, the movement became far bigger. In 1981, 800 organizations pushed the government to reduce the military size. The push culminated in a protest by 300,000 people in the German capital Bonn. The movement was successful in producing a grassroots organization, the Coordination Committee, which directed the efforts of the peace movements in the following years. The committee ultimately failed to decrease the size of the German military, but it laid the groundwork for protests of the Iraq war in the 2000s. Further, the movement started public dialogue about policy directed at peace and security. Like the Civil Rights movement, the German Peace movement is considered grassroots because it focused on political change starting at the local level.

A further example of grassroots in the 1980s was the Citizens Clearinghouse for Natural Waste, an organization that united communities and various grassroots groups in America in support of more environmentally friendly methods of dealing with natural waste. The movement focused especially on African American communities and other minorities. It sought to bring awareness to those communities, and alter the focus from moving problematic waste to changing the system that produced such waste. The movement is considered grassroots because it utilized strategies that derived their power from the affected communities. For example, in North Carolina, African American communities lay down in front of dump trucks to protest their environmental impact. The success of these movements largely remains to be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Dorceta|authorlink1=Dorceta Taylor|last2=Bullard|first2=Robert|title=Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices from the Grassroots|date=1993|publisher=South End Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-89608-446-9|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies of grassroots movements ==

Grassroots movements use tactics that build power from local and community movements. Grassroots Campaigns, a non-profit organization dedicated to creating and supporting grassroots movements in America says that grassroots movements aim to raise money, build organizations, raise awareness, build name recognition, to win campaigns, and to deepen political participation. Grassroots movements work toward these and other goals via strategies focusing on local participation in either local or national politics.&lt;ref name="Grassroots Campaigns: Our History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grassroots Campaigns: Our History|url=http://grassrootscampaigns.com/our-history/|website=Grassroots Campaign|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassroots organizations derive their power from the people, thus their strategies seek to engage ordinary people in political discourse to the greatest extent possible. Below is a list of strategies considered to be grassroots because of their focus on engaging the populace.
&lt;ref name="Grassroots Movements"/&gt;
* Hosting house meetings or parties
* Having larger meetings—[[Annual general meeting|AGMs]]
* Putting up posters
* Talking with pedestrians on the street or walking door-to-door (often involving informational clipboards)
* Gathering signatures for [[petition]]s
* Mobilizing letter-writing, phone-calling, and emailing campaigns
* Setting up information tables
* Raising money from many small donors for political advertising or campaigns
* Organizing large demonstrations
* Asking individuals to submit opinions to media outlets and government officials
* Holding [[get out the vote]] activities, which include the practices of reminding people to vote and transporting them to polling places.

== Use of online social networks ==
Social media's prominence in political and social activism has skyrocketed in the last decade. Influencers on apps like [[Vine (service)|Vine]], [[Instagram]], and [[Twitter]] have all becoming hot spots for growing grassroots movements as platforms to inform, excite, and organize.

=== Hashtags ===
Another influential way media is used to organize is through the use of hashtags to group together postings from across the network under a unifying message. Some hashtags that stirred up larger media coverage include the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], started in 2017 in response to sexual assault allegations against prominent figures in the American entertainment industry. Grassroots movements also use hashtags to organize on a large scale on social media. Some examples include:

*#[[Black Lives Matter|BlackLivesMatter]], this hashtag demonstrates how what starts as a media campaign can take footing to be a form of embodying an entire movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/128008-the-most-influential-twitter-hashtags-of-2015-show-social-media-activism-are-closely-linked|title=These Were The Most Powerful Hashtags Of 2015|last=Gladu|first=Alex|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*# LoveWins.  After the Supreme Court ruled in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage, supporters used the hashtag #LoveWins.
*# Resist: This hashtag, used in cities throughout America, is the another example of the power of organization through media platforms. It was used by event planning sites like [[Meetup (website)|Meetup.com]] to bring together members of a community who wanted to get involved politically. It was used in the case of [https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Resist-Dallas/ #Resist:Dallas] for such purposes.
Grassroots activism partnered with social media may be shaping the way in which citizens organize, engage, and protest in a intensely digital age.

*# EnoughIsEnough: originating from survivors of the Parkland school shooting in Florida, U.S., this hashtag calls for political action to prevent shootings.

== Notable examples ==

=== Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016 ===
{{main article|Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016}}
The junior United States Senator and former Representative from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, formally announced his 2016 presidential campaign on May 26, 2015 on the foundation of reversing "obscene levels" of income and wealth inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/30/bernie-sanders-confirms-presidential-run-and-damns-americas-inequities|title=Bernie Sanders confirms presidential run and damns America's inequities|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2015-04-29|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2015/05/26/berniesanders/27955299/|title=VIDEO: Bernie Sanders announces run for president|newspaper=Burlington Free Press|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders stated that he would run an issue-oriented and positive campaign, focusing his efforts on getting corporate money out of politics, raising taxes on the wealthy, guaranteeing tuition-free higher education,  incorporating a single-payer healthcare system, fighting against climate change, and other key issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berniesanders.com/issues/|title=Issues - Bernie Sanders|website=Bernie Sanders|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/04/03/sanders_people_ask_me_to_go_after_hillary_clinton_for_fbi_investigation_and_foundation_money_but_i_wont.html|title=Sanders: People Ask Me To Go After Clinton For FBI Investigation And Foundation Money, But I Won't|website=www.realclearpolitics.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Sanders sparked a grassroots movement by presenting himself as honest, committed, and a genuine politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=c229c2b5-e5fc-4528-b547-10dda50e0dc4@sessionmgr103&amp;hid=111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=114806413&amp;db=a9h|title=Feeling the Bern: Start Your Search!|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders didn't have the resources to run a massive presidential campaign across the United States, so he utilized passionate volunteer organizers  across the nation to build the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=c229c2b5-e5fc-4528-b547-10dda50e0dc4@sessionmgr103&amp;hid=111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=109990228&amp;db=bth|title=Bernie versus Hillary: Start Your Search!|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions inspired by Sanders were able to elevate the campaign to challenge the Democratic front-runner, former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], before ultimately losing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=98cbe44f-ae5a-48d7-a7bb-94b308e8d8fd@sessionmgr102&amp;hid=111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#db=f5h&amp;AN=115322197|title=What Hillary Can Learn From Bernie: Start Your Search!|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders used his grassroots campaign to receive more than 7 million individual contributions averaging $27, effectively breaking [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama's]] previous individual contribution record in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-hanley/bernie-sanders-has-alread_b_9671406.html|title=Bernie Sanders Received More Individual Campaign Contributions Than Obama's Entire 2008 Campaign|last=S|first=Brian Hanley Political reporter covering the Bernie|last2=Campaign|first2=Ers|date=2016-04-12|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK grassroots aid movement ===
In 2015 the refugee crisis became front-page news across the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/10/10-truths-about-europes-refugee-crisis&lt;/ref&gt; Affected by images of the plight of refugees arriving and travelling across Europe, the grassroots aid movement (otherwise known as the people-to-people, or people solidarity movement), consisting of thousands of private individuals with no prior NGO experience, began in earnest to self-organise and form groups taking aid to areas of displaced persons.&lt;ref name="calaidipedia.co.uk"&gt;http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/the-uk-grassroots-movement&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of early responders reached camps in Calais and Dunkirk in August 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33961501&lt;/ref&gt; and joined forces with existing local charities supporting the inhabitants there.&lt;ref name="calaidipedia.co.uk"/&gt; Other volunteers journeyed to support refugees across the Balkans, Macedonia, and the Greek islands.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-volunteers-idUKKCN0QL0IJ20150816&lt;/ref&gt; Grassroots aid filled voids and saved lives by plugging gaps in the system between governments and existing charities.&lt;ref&gt;http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/11/outpouring-of-grassroots-aid-for-calais-refugees.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Axis of Justice ===
The Axis of Justice (AofJ) is a not-for-profit group co-founded by Tom Morello and Serj Tankian. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://politicalmanagementmasters.online.gwu.edu/resources/articles/3-real-life-examples-of-grassroots-campaigning/|title=Grassroots Campaigns {{!}} See 3 Real Life examples {{!}} Master's in Political Management Online|website=politicalmanagementmasters.online.gwu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's intended purpose it to promote social justice by connecting musicians and music enthusiasts to progressive grass roots ideals. The group appears at music festivals; the most prominent being [[Lollapalooza]] in 2003. The Axis of Justice most regularly appears whenever the bands System of a Down or Audioslave are performing. The group also has a podcast on XM Satellite radio and KPFK (90.7 FM), a Pacifica Radio station in Los Angeles, California. The AofJ's mission is to connect local music fans to organization, local and global, aimed at effectively working on issues like peace, human rights, and economic justice within communities.

== Criticism ==

=== Issues with horizontal movements ===
Grassroots movements are usually criticized because the recent rise in social media has resulted in leaderless and horizontal movements. Some argue that social movements without a clear hierarchy are far less effective and are more likely to die off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://berkeleyjournal.org/2014/11/bringing-the-organization-back-in-social-media-and-social-movements/|title=Bringing the Organization Back In: Social Media and Social Movements|date=2014-11-03|newspaper=Berkeley Journal of Sociology|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astroturfing ===
{{Main article|Astroturfing}}
[[Astroturfing]] refers to political action that is meant to appear to be grassroots, that is spontaneous and local, but in fact comes from an outside organization, such as a corporation or think tank.
&lt;ref name="Project MUSE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barkan|first1=Joanne|title=Hired Guns on Astroturf: How to Buy and Sell School Reform.|journal=Dissent|date=2012|volume=59|issue=2|pages=49–57|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/dissent/v059/59.2.barkan.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|doi=10.1353/dss.2012.0053}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is named after [[AstroTurf]], a brand of [[artificial lawn|artificial grass]]. Astroturfing means pretending to be a grassroots movement, when in reality the agenda and strategy are controlled by a hidden, non-grassroots organization. In this manner, a faux show is presented, consisting of robotic individuals pretending to be voicing their own opinions.&lt;ref name=astroturf&gt;{{cite news |author=Walter Truett Anderson |title=Astroturf – The Big Business of Fake Grassroots Politics |url=http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html |date=January 5, 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129034915/http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html |archivedate=January 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Dead link, apparently.--&gt;
An example of astroturfing was the [[ExxonMobil]] Corporation's push to disseminate false information about climate change. ExxonMobil was largely successful both in disseminating the information through think tanks and in disguising the true nature of the think tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Charles|title=Astroturfing Global Warming: It Isn’t Always Greener on the Other Side of the Fence|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=3 July 2011|volume=104|issue=4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0950-6/fulltext.html|accessdate=18 November 2015|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0950-6|pages=571–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversial examples of astroturfing often exhibit some characteristics of a real grassroots organization, but also characteristics of astroturf. Many of President Obama's efforts, for example, have been deemed grassroots because of their focus on involving the electorate at large. Critics of Obama have argued that some of these methods are in fact astroturfing because they believe that Obama faked the grassroots support. For example, the [[Reason Foundation]] has accused Obama of planting astroturf supporters in town hall meetings. Many movements and organizations must be placed on a continuum between grassroots and astroturf instead of labeled entirely as one or the other. For example, Australia's Convoy of No Confidence, a movement seeking to force an early election in 2011, incorporated elements of grassroots infrastructure in its reliance on the anger and discontentment of the participants. It also had elements of astroturf, namely the large extent to which it relied on support from political elites in the opposition party.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wear|first1=Rae|title=Astroturf and populism in Australia: The Convoy of No Confidence|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|date=2014|volume=49|issue=1|doi=10.1080/10361146.2013.864598|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10361146.2013.864598|accessdate=28 November 2015|pages=54–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]], a conservative force in American politics that began in 2009, is also a controversial example of astroturfing. Critics, notably including Democrats President Barack Obama and Former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], dismissed the Tea Party as Astroturf. They say that the movement purports to represent large swaths of America when in reality it comes from a select few billionaires seeking policies favorable to themselves. The Tea Party has defended itself, arguing that it comes out of broad popular support and widespread anger at the Democratic Party and disenchantment with the GOP. Defenders of the Tea Party cite polls that find substantial support, indicating that the movement has some basis in grassroots politics. Critics point to the corporate influence on the Tea Party, which they believe indicates that the movement is more top-down than the grassroots rhetoric would suggest. The Tea Party can be considered grassroots to the extent that it comes from the people, but it is considered astroturfing to the extent that it is shaped by corporations and particularly wealthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Formisano|first1=Ronald|title=The Tea Party|date=Feb 14, 2012|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-4214-0610-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRbJCFJ2L68C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Head boy''' and '''head girl''' are roles of prominent representative [[student]] responsibility. The terms are commonly used in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Education in the United Kingdom|education system]] and in [[private school]]s throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] organisations.

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
In some British schools, the pupil body elects a head boy and/or a head girl from the pupils/students. Head boys and head girls are usually responsible for representing the school at events, and therefore must be able to make public speeches. They also serve as a good [[role model]] for students, and share pupils' ideas with the school's leadership. They may also be expected to lead fellow [[Prefect#Academic|prefects]] in their duties. Deputy head boys and girls may also be appointed, taking on the day-to-day management of the prefects in some institutions, as well as looking after the school{{clarify|date=August 2018}} and creating a link between teachers and pupils. Some schools in the UK have abolished the titles of head boy and head girl entirely, and replaced them with a single role of "head pupil".

The process of selection of a head boy and/or a head girl varies according to school. At most, the student body of the school will have to vote for the heads. The votes would then inform the Heads of School's decisions.{{dubious|date=August 2018}} This is often preceded with an interview (and more currently an action plan for the academic year).

==Other Commonwealth countries==
Some schools in Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, UAE and Malaysia, and many in the Commonwealth Caribbean, as well as South Africa, New Zealand and Canada, follow the same system as that in the United Kingdom, having a head girl and head boy or head prefect, a vice-head girl/boy, prefects, [[House system|house]] captains, monitors and class representatives. The head girl and boy assist the teachers and administration of the school. Nigerian and Ghanaian schools follow a similar system although some schools appoint a head prefect or senior prefect and assistant senior prefect. Another term used is "Senior Ring" (for boys) and "Senior Pin" (for girls), which is used in some schools such as [[Aden Bowman Collegiate]] in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]].

In Australia, the system is much the same as that of the United Kingdom. Almost all public secondary schools will have a [[student council]] with each year group having elected representatives. The head boy and head girl are generally the "chair" of this council and will represent the school on a government or community level and will represent the students at the school level.

==Equivalent terms==
School president is a similar position; these are commonly found in elementary and secondary schools in the United States and Canada and may or may not necessarily be gender-specific.

'''Henri Velandia''' (sometimes styled as '''Henry Velandia''') (born July 20, 1983) is a Venezuelan dancer. He is most notable for his performance on [[Mira Quien Baila (U.S), Season 1|season 1]] of the [[Univision]] television program [[Mira Quien Baila (U.S.)|Mira Quién Baila]] ('Look Who's Dancing').  He is the founder and lead instructor of HotSalsaHot, a [[salsa (dance)|salsa]] dance school located in Princeton, NJ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotsalsahot.com/bio.htm Biography, HotSalsaHot official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mira Quién Baila==
Mira Quién Baila (MQB) debuted on Sunday, September 12, 2010 at 8 p.m. EST and was viewed by an estimated 8.8 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/09/13/stellar-debut-of-univision’s-new-reality-dance-competition-“¡mira-quien-baila”-look-who’s-dancing-reaches-8-8-million-viewers/63097 TV by the Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 8, 2010, Chevrolet, Target and AT&amp;T were announced as the lead corporate sponsors of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/national-broadcast/e3iff28983151fb56b11cb5f7118b4c2863 Media Week]&lt;/ref&gt; Henri performed with [[Jackie Guerrido]], weather anchor and journalist, and placed second overall.

==Other dance activities==
Velandia founded HotSalsaHot, a salsa school in the central New Jersey area in 2005.

Henri performed  at the Miami Salsa Congress in Miami, FL, on August 6, 2010.  HSH students performed there at the semi-professional level on August 7, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamisalsacongress.com/mcv2.asp?cat=20050216125231 Miami Salsa Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 18, 2010, Henri and his sister Claudia received second place in the open division at the College Showdown Latin Dance Competition at Drexel University in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwpinfo.com/index.php?option=com_us1more&amp;Itemid=6&amp;key=04-30-2010%20people West Windsor &amp; Plainsboro News]&lt;/ref&gt; Henri also performs and trains in modern dance. Velandia performed at Dancers in the Square in Princeton, NJ, on July 16, 2010 in a piece choreographed by Marie Alonzo Snyder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmfineliving.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=73 Packet Magazine: Fine Living in Greater Princeton]&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance was reviewed by Princeton student Joshua J. Vandiver,&lt;ref&gt;[http://princetoncomment.blogspot.com/2010/07/guest-comment-jj-vandiver-on-dance-in.html Princeton Comment]&lt;/ref&gt; who Velandia met in 2006 and [[same-sex marriage in the United States|married]] in Connecticut on 29 August 2010.&lt;ref name="princetonian"&gt;[http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2010/10/22/26689/ One Couple's Fight]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration battle==
Velandia's application for a work visa later that year was denied and he was threatened with deportation despite being the spouse of a U.S. citizen because his marriage is not recognised at a federal level due to the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA).&lt;ref name="princetonian"/&gt; This case was taken up by [[LGBT rights]] activists campaigning against DOMA and the non-recognition of state-sanctioned [[same-sex marriages]] for immigration purposes.

After a protracted battle in which Vandiver unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a green card for Velandia, Velandia's deportation was cancelled and he received formal notification of this on 29 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2011/07/02/new-hope-for-bi-national-gay-couples/ New hope for bi-national gay couples]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Max Planck Research School for [[Molecular Biology]]''', also known as '''IMPRS for Molecular Biology''', is a 1.5 years [[MSc]] program or a 4-year [[PhD]] program. The first year in both graduate tracks is the same and the students are studying together. The curriculum consists of intensive theoretical lectures covering all major fields of the molecular biosciences. Each lecture is followed by a tutorial for in-depth discussion of the topics covered. The practical education consists of 3 months of 2-day methods courses and three 2-month lab rotation projects. All practical work is done in different research laboratories in Göttingen.  After an examination at the end of the first year, based on the final grades  it is possible to continue towards a MSc or PhD, or PhD with integrated MSc degrees. There are about 20 [[student]]s accepted each year selected on a highly competitive basis from applicants from all over the world. The IMPRS for Molecular Biology was one of the founding member members (along with the [[IMPRS for Neurosciences]]) and is part of the Göttingen Graduate School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences ([[GGNB]]). Every year students from the graduate program are organizing the renowned international PhD symposium [[Horizons in Molecular Biology]].

The IMPRS's home town is [[Göttingen]] and the participating institutions in this program are:
* [[Göttingen Center for Molecular Biosciences]] (GZMB) at the [[University of Göttingen]] 
* [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] (MPI-bpc)
* [[Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine]] (MPI-em)
* [[German Primate Center]] (DPZ) - Leibniz Institute 
* [[European Neuroscience Institute - Göttingen]] (ENI-G)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33706">The '''legal recognition of sign languages''' differs widely. In some countries, the national [[sign language]] is an official state language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education.

Extending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah C. E. Batterbury. 2012. ''Language Policy'' 11:253–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sign language status by state==

===Australia===
[[Auslan]] was recognised by the Australian Government as a "community language other than English" and the preferred language of the Deaf community in policy statements in 1987 and 1991. This recognition does not ensure any provision of services in Auslan, but use of Auslan in Deaf education and provision of Auslan/English interpreters is becoming more common.

{{cquote|It is now increasingly recognised that signing deaf people constitute a group like any other non-English speaking language group in Australia, with a distinct sub-culture recognised by shared history, social life and sense of identity, united and symbolised by fluency in Auslan, the principal means of communication within the Australian Deaf Community.|||Australia's Language: The Australian Language and Literacy Policy (page 20). (Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1991)}}

===Austria===
[[Austrian Sign Language]] (Österreichische Gebärdensprache, ÖGS) was recognised by the Austrian Parliament in 2005. On 1 September 2005 the Austrian Constitution was amended to include a new article: „§8 (3) Die Österreichische Gebärdensprache ist als eigenständige Sprache anerkannt. Das Nähere bestimmen die Gesetze.“ ("Austrian Sign Language is recognised as independent language. The laws will determine the details.")

===Belgium===

====French Community====
The Parliament of [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking Belgium]] recognised LSFB ([[French-Belgian Sign Language]]) in a [[decree]] of October 2003. This recognition entails:
# a cultural (symbolical) recognition and
# the foundation of a commission that will advise the Government of the French Community in all matters related to LSFB.

In [https://web.archive.org/web/20041105050456/http://www.ffsb.be/doc/LS/decret_officiel.pdf ''Décret relatif à la reconnaissance de la langue des signes''] (Decree on the recognition of the sign language), from three possible legal interpretations of the term 'recognition',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ffsb.be/doc/LS/decret_LS.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927092446/http://www.ffsb.be/doc/LS/decret_LS.pdf#page=8 |archive-date=2006-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the following one was retained: "It concerns a symbolic recognition that goes hand in hand with a general measure, permitting every minister to take action in fields relative to his authority."&lt;ref name="walloon"&gt;"... il s'agit d'une reconnaissance cadre assortie d'une mesure d'exécution générale permettant à chaque ministre concerné de prendre les arrêtés d'application relevant de ses compétences ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flemish Community====
[[Flemish Sign Language]] was recognised on 2006-04-26 by the [[Flemish Parliament]]. This recognition entails:
# a cultural (symbolical) recognition (see excerpt below),
# the foundation of a commission that will advise the Flemish government in all matters related to VGT and
# the structural funding of research and development of VGT.
This recognition was accelerated by the most successful petition ever with the Flemish Parliament and the presence of a Deaf member of parliament, Helga Stevens, and her interpreters in the Flemish Parliament.

{{cquote|Cultural recognition entails that the Flemish Government recognises the Flemish Sign Language as the language of the Deaf Community in Flanders. This 'recognition' encompasses the following three meanings: (1) the Flemish Government acknowledges the correctness of the fact that the Flemish Sign Language is the language of the Deaf Community in Flanders, (2) the Flemish Government also accepts the existence of this language in the judicial domain and treats it accordingly and (3) the Flemish Government expresses its respect for this language.&lt;ref name="flemish"&gt;"Die 'erkenning' omvat hierbij de drie betekennissen van het woord: (1) de Vlaamse overheid bevestigt de juistheid van het feit dat de Vlaamse Gebarentaal de taal is van de Dovengemeenschap in Vlaanderen, (2) de Vlaamse overheid aanvaardt het bestaan van die taal ook op juridisch vlak en behandelt ze als dustanig en (3) de Vlaamse overheid uit haar waardering voor deze taal."&lt;/ref&gt;|||[http://jsp.vlaamsparlement.be/docs/stukken/2005-2006/g729-1.pdf Decreet houdende de erkenning van de Vlaamse Gebarentaal] (Decree on the recognition of the Flemish Sign Language)}}

The [[Brazilian Sign Language|Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)]] was legally recognized in 2002 but can't replace written [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]];&lt;ref name="Brazil 2002"&gt;[http://planalto.gov.br/CCIVIL_03/LEIS/2002/L10436.htm , April 24, 2002].&lt;/ref&gt; the law was [[regulation|regulated]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Brazil 2005"&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2004-2006/2005/decreto/d5626.htm Brazilian decree nº 5626, December 22, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; The language must be taught as a part of the [[school of education|education]] and [[speech and language pathology]] curricula, and law also mandates that LIBRAS be an elective subject as part of every other undergraduate course. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access ("[[inclusion (education)|include]]") to deaf people.

===Canada===

[[Section Fourteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] specifies that an accused person who does not understand the language in which his or her trial is carried out, or is deaf, is entitled to an interpreter.

In several of Canada's provinces ([[Manitoba]] in 1988, [[Alberta]] in 1990, [[Ontario]] in 1993), [[ASL]] is an officially recognised minority language with legally embedded rights.

Ontario recognised ASL and LSQ as a language in which the Deaf can be taught when it altered its Education Act in 1993.
Ontario formally recognised ASL in 2007 attributing to it the rights of fellow minority languages.

Question Period in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] is interpreted in both [[Quebec Sign Language]] and [[American Sign Language]].

Maritime Sign Language (MSL) is commonly used in Canada's Atlantic provinces. It is derived from British Sign Language. (It differs from ASL because ASL is derived from French Sign Language, so there is more in common between LSQ and ASL than between ASL and MSL, due to the languages' origins.)

Inuit or Inuktitut Sign Language (ISL) is used in Canada's arctic communities, and was developed locally by families and communities who found a need for their deaf families and community members. Deaf Inuit who have attended school in Canada's south have also learned ASL. ISL made its debut in Nunavut legislature in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-sign-language-makes-debut-in-nunavut-legislature-1.772092|title=Inuit sign language makes debut in Nunavut legislature - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
Chilean Sign Language (LSCh),  Chile enacted in Law No. 20,422, in 2010 in order to ensure the right to equality of opportunity for disabled people, negating any form of discrimination against them.

===Czech Republic===
[[Czech Sign Language]] gained legal recognition as a human language with the passage of the Sign Language Law 155/1998 Sb ("Zákon o znakové řeči 155/1998 Sb") - see the legislation here &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagit.cz/pages/sbirkatxt.asp?zdroj=sb98155&amp;cd=76&amp;typ=r |title=ZÁKON ze dne 11. června 1998 o znakové řeči a o změně dalších zákonů - Sbírka zákonů - Nakladatelství Sagit, a.s |publisher=Sagit.cz |date=2000-12-01 |accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in Czech language).

===Denmark===

As of May 13, 2014, [[Danish Sign Language]] gained legal recognition. The Danish Parliament established The Danish Sign Language Council "to devise principles and guidelines for the monitoring of the Danish sign language and offer advice and information on the Danish sign language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsn.dk/tegnsprog/about-the-danish-sign-language-council|title=The Danish Sign Language Council — Dansk Sprognævn|website=www.dsn.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The [[European Parliament]] unanimously approved a resolution about Deaf Sign Languages on June 17, 1988 (available online here &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policy.hu/flora/ressign2.htm |title=Published by: EUD |publisher=Policy.hu |date= |accessdate=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The resolution asks all member countries for recognition of their national sign languages as official languages of the Deaf.

===Iceland===
[[Icelandic Sign Language]] was recognised by law in education in 2004.

{{cquote|This National Curriculum Guide contains, for the first time, provisions on special Icelandic instruction for students whose mother tongue is not Icelandic.

Sign language is of basic importance for the development of language, personality and thinking of deaf children.

===Italy===
There is no official recognition of [[Italian Sign Language]] (''Lingua dei Segni Italiana'', LIS) yet. Those who oppose LIS recognition say this language is "grammarless," although, by definition, a [[Language#The properties of language|language]] cannot be, in fact, grammarless.

===Kenya===
The Constitution of Kenya recognises Kenya Sign Language and states that the state shall promote the development and use of Kenyan sign language. Sign language is recognised further in Article 120 (1) which states that the official languages of parliament are Kiswahili, English and Kenyan sign language and the business of parliament may be conducted in English, Kiswahili and Kenyan sign language.

=== Macedonia, Republic of ===

The [[Macedonian sign language]] (''Македонски знаковен јазик, Makedonski znakoven jazik'') is officially recognized as "natural way of communication between the people". The language is regulated by a law, which allows students and every individual in Macedonia to study the language. Also, the law secures the right of interpreter for the students with special needs, and every other deaf person can request an interpreter, as well.&lt;ref name="закон"&gt;''[http://www.deafmkd.org.mk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=82&amp;lang=mk Закон за употреба на  знаковниот јазик, Службен весник на Република Македонија, број 105, 21 август 2009, Скопје]''&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are more than 6.000 Macedonian citizens with deafness.

===Nepal===
Although [[Nepali Sign Language]] has not yet been officially recognized as the [[mother tongue]] of Nepal's deaf population, legislation is underway which will bring Nepali law in line with the provisions of the UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. These laws will recognize the rights of the deaf to use [[Nepali Sign Language]] have it used in education, in social life, in the legal sphere, etc., and this should thus lead to official governmental recognition of [[Nepali Sign Language]] on a par with the various spoken languages of Nepal.

===Netherlands===
The [[Sign Language of the Netherlands]] has not been recognised officially by law. There is some public funding for sign language projects.

On December 31, 2015, the "South Korean National Assembly passed legislation to recognize Korean Sign Language as one of Korea’s official languages."&lt;ref name="sil.org"/&gt;

=== Spain ===
On June 28, 2007, Spanish and Catalan Sign Languages were recognised by the Spanish Parliament to be official languages in Spain. This recent legal development has opened a door to reinforced communication in the areas of healthcare, justice, education and MCM.
So far, the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]] of [[Catalonia]], [[Andalusia]], and [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] had granted the use of sign languages to the Deaf. In the other Spanish regions no sign languages were so far recognised, and support in terms of sign language interpretation for Deaf persons has been minimal or confined by different budgets. As pointed out, there are three sign languages claimed by Deaf organisations: [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Catalan Sign Language]] (LSC) and [[Valencian Sign Language]] (LSPV), although some linguists consider these to be the same.

====Catalonia====
Although a regional law guarantees the presence of [[Catalan Sign Language]] since 1994 in all areas under the Catalan Government, such as education and media, until recently it was officially recognised the LSC in the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] of 2006.

====Andalusia====
The legal situation in Andalusia is similar to the one in Catalonia, where a regional Law guarantees the presence of the [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) in all social scopes since 1998. Recently, a recognition of it is included in the reforming of their Statute of Autonomy. At the moment, Andalusia is the unique Community where LSE is recognised with regards to the rest of Spain. In any case, in linguistic terms, the LSE used there has a strong dialectal variation.

====Valencia====
Until recently, Valencia had poor legal support for the Deaf. The approved 2006 Statute of Autonomy grants to Valencian Deaf their right to use [[Valencian Sign Language]] (LSPV or LSCV). (Though the statute refers only to "sign language" in a generic sense.)

{{cquote|Article 13,4: The Generalitat shall grant the use of the own sign language of deaf persons, which shall have to be purposed in education, protection and respect.&lt;ref name="valencian"&gt;La Generalitat garantirà l’ús de la llengua de signes pròpia de les persones sordes, que haurà de ser objecte d’ensenyament, protecció i respecte.

=== Sri Lanka ===
The recognition of [[Sri Lankan sign languages|Sri Lankan Sign Language]] was accepted by [[Sri Lanka]] on 26 September 2010.  According to the report by [[Sri Lanka]]n Newspaper at Internet on 23 September 2010[&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.colombopage.com/archive_10B/Sep23_1285222003KA.php|title = Sign language recognized in Sri Lanka|accessdate = |website = Colombo Page|publisher = |last = |first = |date = 23 September 2010|location = Colombo, Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

===Thailand===
[[Thai Sign Language]] was acknowledged as "the national language of deaf people in Thailand" on 17 August 1999, in a resolution signed by the Permanent Secretary for Education on behalf of the Royal Thai Government that affirmed the rights of deaf people to learn this distinct sign language as their first language at home and in schools. According to a  [http://pr.gallaudet.edu/otg/BackIssues.asp?ID=3810 report by Charles Reilly (1999)], "specific actions will be taken by the government, including hiring deaf people as teachers and instructors of sign language in deaf schools, and providing interpreters for deaf people in higher education."

===Turkey===
There is currently no official recognition of the [[Turkish Sign Language]], the de facto sign language in use by the Turkish deaf community.

On July 1, 2005, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] enacted an updated [[disability discrimination act|Disability Law]] (No. 5378), which for the first time in Turkish law made references to sign language. Law no. 15 says that a sign language is to be used in the deaf education system, and law no. 30 says that sign language interpreting is to be provided to deaf people. &lt;ref&gt;http://majordomo.valenciacc.edu/hypermail/slling-l/0508/0013.html{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these laws are yet to be implemented (as of 2007), and it remains to be seen what form of sign language, if any, will be supported. There has been some discussion in parliament about "developing" a standardised sign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abgs.gov.tr/tarama/tarama_files/19/SC19DET_People%20with%20disabilities.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404073157/http://www.abgs.gov.tr/tarama/tarama_files/19/SC19DET_People%20with%20disabilities.pdf |archive-date=2007-04-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey also has action plans for disability issues, such as the Employment of Disabled Persons Plan (2005–2010) and the Prevention of Discrimination Against Disabled Persons Plan (2006–2010).

===Uganda===
On October 8, 1995, [[Uganda]]'s national sign language was recognised in the country's new [[constitution]], making [[Uganda Sign Language]] one of the few constitutionally recognised sign languages in the world ([[World Federation of the Deaf|WFD]] News, April 1996). A Deaf signer (27-year-old [[Alex Ndeezi]]) was elected to [[Parliament of Uganda|parliament]] in 1996.

===United States of America===
The Federal government does not recognize any language spoken or signed as an official language. However many individual states have laws recognizing [[American Sign Language]] as a "foreign language"; some recognize ASL as a language of instruction in schools.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} A number of U.S. universities accept ASL credit to fulfill foreign language requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~wilcox/UNM/univlist.html |title=Universities That Accept ASL In Fulfillment Of Foreign Language Requirements |publisher=University of New Mexico |last=Wilcox |first=Sherman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay===

Although there are no "official" languages in Uruguay, nevertheless, Lengua de Señas Uruguaya, or "LSU" (In English: "Uruguayan Sign Language"), was "recognized" as the language of deaf persons in 2001 by the law:
 
[https://web.archive.org/web/20110704041632/http://200.40.229.134/IndexDB/Leyes/ConsultaLeyes.asp LEY No. 17.378.] ''Reconócese a todos los efectos a la Lengua de Señas Uruguaya como la lengua natural de las personas sordas y de sus comunidades en todo el territorio de la República.''  10 de Julio de 2001.

In the 2008 law 18.437 ("Ley General de Educación. 12 de Diciembre de 2008"), LSU is "considered" to be one of the mother tongues of Uruguayan citizens (along with Uruguayan Spanish and Uruguayan Portuguese. In the policy documents of the Comisión de Políticas Lingüísticas en la Educación Pública (the Public Education Language Policy Commission, which is part of the Administración Nacional de Educación Pública, ANEP) it is proposed that LSU would be the principal language of deaf education.

'''Medical education in Panama''' is principally offered and developed by accredited and government recognized [[medical school]]s in the country.  There are 5 medical schools in [[Panama]], typically offering the Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery degrees.
In Panama medical programs are divided into two types: [[undergraduate]] entry and [[Graduate student|graduate]] entry.

==Entrance==
'''Undergraduate''' entry degrees are typically 6 years in duration and commonly tend to draw students entering directly from [[high school]]; while '''graduate''' entry degrees are typically 4 years in length, and draw a [[university]] graduate with a current 4 years [[Bachelor's degree]] required for entry.  These entries provide the medical programs with a variety in the age range and academic backgrounds of the participants.

It is important to note, however, that the graduate entry program still confers a Bachelor’s degree in [[Medicine]]; that although it is a graduate entry program, it does not confer a [[postgraduate degree]] in itself.

==Requirements==
In order to practice medicine in the Republic, or enter a residency program in Panama it is required to be Panamenian citizen.

Other requirements include:
*First year rotatory [[Internship]]
Qualified medical practitioners must successfully undertake and complete one year of supervised practice, generally known as an internship. Internship is undertaken in [[hospital]] positions accredited for this purpose.
*2 year rural Internship
Upon successful conclusion of the first intern year, doctors are required to undertake and complete a second year of internship at an assigned government health institution.  Once this requirement is fulfilled the [[medical practitioner]]s qualify for a full registration in the Medical Board and are [[medical license|licensed]] to engage in independent medical practice in Panama

==Medical Universities==

Universities with '''undergraduate''' entry medical programs only:

*[[Universidad de Panama]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.up.ac.pa/PortalUp/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Columbus University (Panama)|Columbus University]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbus.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Universidad Latina de Panama]] 
*[[Universidad Latinoamericana de Ciencia y Tecnología]] ULACIT &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulacit.ac.pa/cienciasdelasalud/?p=oferta |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121221123127/http://www.ulacit.ac.pa/cienciasdelasalud/?p=oferta |archivedate=2012-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí]] UNACHI, The only one university, outside of Panama City, which offers a complete medical program.

Universities with '''graduate''' entry medical programs only:

*[[International School of Medical Sciences]] ISMS &lt;ref&gt;http://isms.edu.pa/&lt;/ref&gt;

All the graduate entry programs share a similar application process at this time and comparable to the requirements in the United States. Candidates are first required to have a Premedical Degree in an approved University. A 4 year Bachelor’s degree is required.

'''Monastic Higher Secondary English Boarding School''' ({{lang-ne|मोनस्टिक उ. मा. बी. जनकपुर}}), (usually known simply as  '''Monastic School''') is a private [[boarding school]] in [[Janakpur]]dham, [[Dhanusa District]], south-east [[Nepal]]. It was established in 1986 at a rented house at [[Bhanu Chowk]], where it remained for seven years before expanding to a second location on Dhanusha Path, in the south of the town. Founded by Dr. Mithilesh Shah, it was named ''Monastic'' after the Sanskrit word of [[Gurukul|गुरुकुल]], ''gurukul'', which is a type of school in [[India]], residential in nature, with ''[[shishya]]s'' living in proximity to the [[guru]], often within the same house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cheong Cheng | first=Cheong Cheng Yin | editors=Tung Tsui Kwok Tung Tsui, Wai Chow King Wai Chow, Magdalena Mo Ching Mok  | year=2002| title=Subject Teaching and Teacher Education in the New Century: Research and Innovation | publisher=Springer | location=| isbn =962-949-060-9 | page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not follow the  [[guru-shishya tradition]] (''[[parampara]]''), and is a "normal" residential school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monastic.edu.np | title=Official website of Monastic School. | publisher=Monastic School | accessdate=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 3000 students in the school aged 5 to 18; the lower school, the middle school and the higher school. All are co-educational and has equal numbers of girls and boys. The first headmaster was [[Doctor of Medicine|Dr.]] Mithilesh Sah, who has occupied the post since the establishment of the school, the first and only headmaster of the school.

Monastic pupils compulsorily take a district level qualification exam in [[grade eight]] and another important test, the [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|School Leaving Certificate level]] ( equivalent to GCSE) tests in [[grade ten]] (aged 15–16), which earns them a [[matriculation]] [[academic degree|degree]] and then, like all the other SLC graduates in Nepal, they have a range of choices where they choose either the state funded [[10+2|10+2 level]] to continue their education in Monastic or any other higher secondary school in Nepal, or the British [[A-level]]s in the sixth form, offered by [[UCLES]] in Nepal, or the [[International Baccalaureate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | url=http://teenz.com.np/article/magazine/after-the-iron-gate.html | title=After the Iron Gate | accessdate=July 1, 2012 | author=Basnyat, Bonita S | newsgroup=teenz.com.np}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of students go on to higher education following the completion of their SLC at the end of [[Year Thirteen]] (aged 17–18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wavemag.com.np/issue/article3495.html | title=Leveling with ‘A’ levels | work=Interview and Article | date=May 2010 | agency=Wave | accessdate=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the school was upgraded to [[10+2|higher secondary school]],&lt;ref name="HSEB Affiliation"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hseb.edu.np/content/docs/allaff068.pdf |title=Affiliation Of Higher Secondary Education Board |format=PDF |publisher=The Higher Secondary Education Board, Nepal |accessdate=1 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326081003/http://www.hseb.edu.np/content/docs/allaff068.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means it offers additional subjects related to [[science]], [[management]] and [[arts]] and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.hseb.edu.np/content/curriculum.php | title=Curicullam of HSEB | publisher=Higher Secondary Education Board, Nepal. | accessdate=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Monastic School is a full-fledged English Medium School, ultimately upgraded to [[10+2]] Science, Commerce, Arts and Education.&lt;ref name="test2"&gt;[http://www.hseb.edu.np/content/docs/allaff068.pdf HSEB Schools in Nepal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326081003/http://www.hseb.edu.np/content/docs/allaff068.pdf |date=2012-03-26 }}, HSEB,Nepal.&lt;/ref&gt; This school was founded by Dr. Mithlesh Kumar Sah in 1985. Monastic School has three branches, namely the [[Lower secondary school|lower secondary]], [[Secondary school|secondary]] and [[higher secondary]] branches, and they are under different supervisions. Most of its affairs are controlled by the founder principal. The school is renowned locally because of its regular good results at the annual [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|SLC]] examinations, and thus has managed to maintain a distinctive place among the [[Popular culture|locals]].&lt;ref name="test10"&gt;[http://www.nepalhomepage.com/yellowpages/yellowpages.php?ycatid=957&amp;page=15], Yellow Pages Nepal&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[school]] provides [[Boarding school|boarding]] facilities for its students, and runs local transportation services for the students from the outer parts of the [[Janakpur]] city.

== Academics ==
Monastic School operates two courses of study 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Monasticbody 2.jpg|thumb|Students of Class [[10+2|12]] (2003)along with the teachers]] --&gt;* [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|School Leaving Certificate level]] (a nationwide curriculum up to class 10 prescribed by the [[Department of Education (Nepal)|Department of Education]] of Nepal.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
* [[10+2|10+2 level]] (Higher Secondary Education Board of Nepal, equivalent alternative to [[A Level|A-levels]]).&lt;ref name="test2" /&gt;
The school has had 17 successful batches of [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|SLC]] graduates since 1993, but the college has not lived up to the performance levels of the [[school]].

== Extra curricular activities ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Monasticbody 3.jpg|thumb|Students playing [[Badminton]] in a school competition]] --&gt;
The school holds [[Extra curricular|extra-curricular]] activities and training sessions for [[personality development]], most of which include [[Cricket|cricket matches]], quite popular game in that part of the [[Cricket in Nepal|world]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalcricket.wordpress.com/2008/01/21/cricket-in-nepal/|title=Cricket in Nepal|date=2008-01-21|website=Global Cricket|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with some [[Indoor games and sports|indoor games.]] [[Singing]] and [[dancing]] is a common activity and most of the dances are of local [[Mithila (ancient)|mithila]]nchal origin. In the process, the local culture is also practiced.

== Affiliation with Lions Club ==
Monastic School has established a very belonging relationship with the [[Lions Clubs International|Leo Club of Nepal]]&lt;ref name="test6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leoclubnepal.org.np/member%20clubs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111083853/http://www.leoclubnepal.org.np/member%20clubs.html |archivedate=2011-11-11 |df= }}, Leo club members list&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to the involvement of  [[Sports trainer|sports teacher]] Mr. Birendra Karna and the principal. Both of them are senior regional [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club members]].&lt;ref name="test8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leoclubnepal.org.np/district%20officers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111083822/http://www.leoclubnepal.org.np/district%20officers.html |archivedate=2011-11-11 |df= }}, Leo club District officers of Nepal&lt;/ref&gt;

The students are found actively participating in the events organized by the local [[Leo clubs]], which mostly includes [[blood donation]], and [[volunteering]] camps.

== Student Quality Circle ==
Since its inception in Nepal, the [[Quality circle|SQC, Nepal]] has found an active member in Monastic School. It is an active member and the local monitoring body for the [[Quality circle|organization]] as a teacher serving as the regional officer for SQC members in Nepal the organisation QUEST, [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="test15"&gt;[http://www.stx.edu.np/sqc/Members.html stx.edu.np] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930202619/http://www.stx.edu.np/sqc/Members.html |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a focus on achieving outcomes for children through high-quality educational programs
* families’ understanding of what distinguishes a quality service.&lt;ref name=aim&gt;{{cite web|title=National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education &amp; Care|url=http://www.deewr.gov.au/Earlychildhood/Policy_Agenda/Quality/Pages/home.aspx|publisher=Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality Areas ==
The National Quality Standard (NQS) is a key aspect of the [[National Quality Framework|NQF]]. The NQS consists of seven quality areas, each containing standards and elements, that children's education and care services are assessed and rated against.

The seven quality areas covered by the National Quality Standard are:
 
* Educational program and practice
* Children’s health and safety
* Physical environment
* Staffing arrangements
* Relationships with children
* Collaborative partnerships with families and communities
* Leadership and service management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the National Quality Standard|url=http://files.acecqa.gov.au/files/National-Quality-Framework-Resources-Kit/NQF03-Guide-to-NQS-130902.pdf|website=www.acecqa.gov.au|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACECQA - NQS Quality Areas|url=http://www.acecqa.gov.au/Quality-Areas|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration''' ('''NASPAA''') is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[non-profit organization]]. It is an international association of [[public policy schools|public affairs schools]] (schools of [[public policy]] and [[public administration|administration]]) at [[University|universities]] in the [[United States]] and abroad. NASPAA is also the recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) as the accreditor of master's degree programs in public policy (MPP), public affairs (MPAff), and public administration (MPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/4DCGI/cms/review.html?Action=CMS_Document&amp;DocID=200&amp;MenuKey=main] CHAE. Retrieved 2017-12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated mission is to "ensure excellence in education and training for public service and to promote the ideal of public service."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naspaa.org/about_naspaa/naspaa.asp "NASPAA Mission Statement."] NASPAA. Retrieved 2013-7-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and mission==
Founded in 1970, NASPAA serves as a national and international resource for the promotion of excellence in education for the public service. Its institutional membership includes more than 280 university programs in the United States in public administration, policy, and management. NASPAA is also the accreditator of its member schools, seeking to promote the quality of education. It accomplishes its purposes through direct services to its member institutions and by: 
*Developing and administering appropriate standards for educational programs in public affairs through its Executive Council and its Commission on Peer Review and Accreditation; 
*Representing to governments and other institutions the objectives and needs of education for public affairs and administration; 
*Encouraging curriculum development and innovation and providing a forum for publication and discussion of education scholarship, practices, and issues; 
*Undertaking surveys that provide members and the public with information on key educational issues; 
*Meeting with employers to promote internship and employment for students and graduates; 
*Undertaking joint educational projects with practitioner professional organizations; and 
*Collaborating with institutes and schools of public administration in other countries through conferences, consortia, and joint projects.

NASPAA provides opportunities for international engagement for NASPAA members, placing a global emphasis on educational quality and quality assurance through a series of networked international initiatives, in particular the Network of Institutes and Schools of Public Administration in Central and Eastern Europe (NISPAcee), the Inter-American Network of Public Administration Education (INPAE), and the Georgian Institute of Public Affairs (GIPA). It is also involved locally, directing the Small Communities Outreach Project for Environmental Issues, which networks public affairs schools and local governments around environmental regulation policy issues, with support from the Environmental Protection Agency.

In 2013, NASPAA changed its name from the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration to the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration to reflect its "growing international membership and disciplinary breadth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naspaa.org/principals/news/name_announcement.pdf "NASPAA Announces New Name"] (Press Release).

==''Journal of Public Affairs Education''==
The '''''Journal of Public Affairs Education''''' ('''''JPAE''''') is a quarterly, [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]], [[academic journal]] of [[public administration]] education that is published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] on behalf of the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://patimes.org/protecting-and-promoting-jpaes-legacy/ "Protecting and Promoting JPAE's Legacy."] PA Times.

McDonald, III]] ([[North Carolina State University]]) and William Hatcher ([[Augusta University]]) since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDonald |first1=Bruce |last2=Hatcher |first2=William |title=From the Editors |journal=Journal of Public Affairs Education |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=2018 |pages=1–2 |doi=10.1080/15236803.2018.1431462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naspaa1"&gt;[http://naspaa.org/initiatives/jpae/jpae.asp "Journal of Public Affairs Education,"] NASPAA. Retrieved 2018-6-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Journal of Public Administration Education'' was founded in 1995 by [[H. George Frederickson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perry |first1=James |title=Reflections on the Journal of Public Affairs Education at 15: Changing NASPAA and the Field |journal=Journal of Public Affairs Education |volume=16 |issue=2 |date=2010 |pages=119–122 |doi=10.1080/15236803.2010.12001589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially published in coordination with the [[American Society for Public Administration]]'s Section on Public Administration Education (SPAE), the [[National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration]] (NASPAA) began discussions in 1996 of sponsoring the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Riccucci |first=Norma M. |date=2007 |chapter=Public Administration Pedagogy: What Is It? |pages=757-766 |editor1-last=Rabin |editor1-first=Jack |editor2-last=Hildreth |editor2-first=W. Bartley |editor3-last=Miller |editor3-first=Gerald J. |title=Handbook of Public Administration |edition=Third |publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]] |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1997, Frederickson transferred ownership of the journal to NASPAA. Under the new ownership, NASPAA elected to change the name of the journal to the ''Journal of Public Affairs Education'' to reflect the breadth of the NASPAA's mission and to increase the appeal of the journal. Despite the change in name ownership, the journal has continued to maintain a loose affiliation with SPAE.

Since taking ownership of the journal, ''JPAE'' has been self-published by NASPAA; however, in 2017 a publishing agreement was reached between NASPAA and [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. Since January 2018, Taylor &amp; Francis has overseen the production and distribution of the journal.&lt;ref name="naspaa1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12765">'''The Ohio Graduation Test (OGT)''' is the [[high school graduation examination]] given to [[Tenth grade#United_States|sophomores]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. Students must pass all five sections ([[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[social studies]]) in order to graduate. Students have multiple chances to pass these sections and can still graduate without passing each using the alternative pathway. In 2009, the [[Ohio General Assembly|Ohio legislature]] passed an education reform bill eliminating the OGT in favor of a new assessment system. The development and transition of replacement began in 2014 and will end in 2022.

{{TOC limit|limit=15}}

==Test History and Development==
===History===
Prior to the OGT, passing the [[ninth grade proficiency test]] was required for graduation beginning with the class of 1994.&lt;ref name="NGPT"&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://education.ohio.gov/GD/DocumentManagement/DocumentDownload.aspx?DocumentID=21133 |title= Analysis of Ninth-Grade Proficiency Test Score, May 2006|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had the same five subjects, apart from the social studies test was referred to as the [[Citizenship in the United States|citizenship]] test.

In 2001, the Ohio legislature directed the [[Ohio Department of Education]] (ODE) to develop the OGT based on the soon-to-be-adopted [[Ohio Academic Content Standards|academic content standards]].&lt;ref name="SB1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archives.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=124_SB_1 |title= Am. Sub. S.B. 1, 124th Ohio General Assembly|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first official OGT was given in March 2005. It replaced the ninth grade proficiency test as a graduation requirement for the class of 2006. The last administration of the ninth grade proficiency test was in 2005.

===Development===
Questions are developed by ODE staff, sent through committees, and placed on exams before official inclusion on the OGT. First, the Content Advisory Committee runs the ODE developed question past parents and educators to see if it addresses the content. Second, the Fairness Sensitivity Review Committee helps ensure that questions are fair and do not put any student at a disadvantage because of a student’s moral values, social status, or religious beliefs. Third, the question is [[Pilot experiment|field tested]]. It is placed on an exam, but does not count towards the score of the student. Finally, the committees evaluate the performance data and decide if the question is to be used.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ode.state.oh.us/GD/Templates/Pages/ODE/ODEDetail.aspx?page=3&amp;TopicRelationID=216&amp;ContentID=4904&amp;Content=72934|title= Frequently Asked Questions about Ohio Graduation Tests|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test Characteristics==
===Questions===
The OGT is made up of five tests: reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies. These sections match the core school subjects and fulfill the high school testing requirement in reading, mathematics, and science under the federal [[No Child Left Behind Act]].&lt;ref name="NCLB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/saa.html#changes
|title= No Child Left Behind – Testing Requirements|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the five sections is formatted differently, but they each contain [[multiple choice]], [[Test_(student_assessment)#Free_response_items|short answer]], and [[Test_(student_assessment)#Free_response_items|extended response]] questions:

|&lt;center&gt;2&lt;/center&gt;
|}total 38 questions

Each exam has approximately six extra questions that are being field tested for future OGT tests. Students are not penalized for incorrect answers on field tested questions. Students have up to two and a half hours to complete each section of the test.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;  Typically, the tests are split up so that there is only one per day (for five days).

===Testing Dates===
The OGT is first given to students in the spring of their sophomore year. If they do not pass all five sections, they can continue to retake the exam. The OGT is administered in the fall (October), spring (March), and summer (June) each year.&lt;ref name="Dates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ode.state.oh.us/GD/Templates/Pages/ODE/ODEPrimary.aspx?Page=2&amp;TopicID=285&amp;TopicRelationID=238|title= Testing Dates|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all schools offer the summer OGT, but students can be directed to one that does. Summer testing also requires a student to take at least 10 hours of preparatory programs beforehand.&lt;ref name="SummerOGT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/oac/3301-13-01|title=Ohio Administrative Code 3301-13-01(12)|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical student will have seven opportunities to pass the OGT before he or she is scheduled to graduate.

===Accommodations===
There are special accommodations of the OGT for students with special needs. These accommodations include tests with readers, in large print, and different languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Somali language|Somali]].&lt;ref name="Accommodations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ohio.gov/GD/Templates/Pages/ODE/ODEPrimary.aspx?Page=2&amp;TopicID=1140&amp;TopicRelationID=1139|title=Test Accommodations|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students with an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) may be exempted from the requirement to pass all sections of the OGT or may take another assessment if the plan allows.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;  For students with significant disabilities, there is an [[No_Child_Left_Behind_Act#Variability_in_student_potential_and_100.25_compliance|alternate assessment]] that requires a collection of evidence that demonstrates knowledge appropriate for the student’s disabilities.&lt;ref name="Alternative "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ohio.gov/GD/Templates/Pages/ODE/ODEDetail.aspx?page=3&amp;TopicRelationID=229&amp;ContentID=8695&amp;Content=74519|title=Alternative Testing|accessdate= 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative Pathway==
Passing all five of the OGT tests is required to earn an Ohio diploma for both public and private school students (excluding IEP issues).&lt;ref name="GradReq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3313.603|title=ORC§3313.603(F)(3)|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GradReqAlt "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3313.612|title=ORC§3313.612|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an exception for students who come very close. The alternative pathway lets student who meet seven specific requirements to graduate without passing all five tests. High school guidance counselors determine if students qualify for this option. A student qualifies for the alternative pathway if they:

# Pass all the tests but one, and earn at least a 390 on the failed test;
# Have a 97% attendance rate, not including excused absences, for each of the last four years;
# Have not been expelled in the past four years;
# Have a GPA of 2.5 out of 4.0 in the subject area of the failed test;
# Complete the high school curriculum requirements;
# Have taken “[[Test preparation|intervention programs]]” to help their performance on the tests and have a 97% attendance rate, not including excused absence, in those programs; and
# Receive a letter recommending graduation from each of the student’s high school teachers in the subject area of the failed OGT and the student's high school principal.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.ohio.gov/GD/Templates/Pages/ODE/ODEDetail.aspx?page=3&amp;TopicRelationID=1702&amp;ContentID=23705&amp;Content=78114|title=Alternative Pathway for Eligibility for a Diploma - Overview|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment Reforms==
===Ohio Reforms===
In 2009, the Ohio legislature passed an education reform bill that, among other things, called for the OGT to be replaced.&lt;ref name="HB1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=128_HB_1|title= Am. Sub. H.B. 1, 128th Ohio General Assembly|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To receive a diploma, students will have to earn a certain composite score drawn from a new three part assessment system:

*A national standardized assessment (such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]]) that assesses science, mathematics, and English language arts
* A series of [[End of Course Test|end-of-course exams]] in English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies
*A [[senior project]] by a student or a group of students

The academic content standards and the model curriculum must be finished before the new assessment system can be developed to assure alignment. Work will begin on developing this new system in 2011.&lt;ref name="HB1" /&gt;  There is no set date for the beginning of the new assessment system, but the 2013-2014 school year has been targeted.&lt;ref name="HB1Dates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.ohio.gov/GD/Templates/Pages/ODE/ODEDetail.aspx?page=3&amp;TopicRelationID=1599&amp;ContentID=62806&amp;Content=85426|title=Education Reform Plan Information|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OGT will be phased out until 2022. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio Graduation Tests {{!}} ODE |url= http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Testing/Ohio-Graduation-Test-OGT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Assessments===
Also in 2009, the federal [[Race to the Top]] $4.35 billion incentive program was announced.&lt;ref name="RTTT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop-assessment/index.html|title=Race to the Top Assessment Program|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It included up to $350 million for common assessment development.&lt;ref name="RTTTFunding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop-assessment/funding.html|title=Race to the Top Assessment Program – Funding|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various consortia of states formed to compete for this grant. Ohio signed [[Memorandum of understanding|memorandums of understanding]] with two groups: Smarter Balance&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ode.state.or.us/wma/teachlearn/diploma/smarter-consortium-overview.pdf|title= Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Achieve.&lt;ref name="Achieve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achieve.org/states-form-common-assessment-partnership|title=Achieve: States Form Common Assessment Partnership|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever assessment systems these groups design may supersede the modified [[Ohio Achievement Assessment]] (grades 3-8), the three part assessment system, and the composite score passed by the Ohio legislature.

==Criticisms==
The OGT receives many of the same [[Standardized_test#Disadvantages_and_criticism|criticisms]] as [[List of state achievement tests in the United States|other states’ standardized tests]]. Chief among them is that the assessments drive instruction, give students increased testing anxiety, and test preparations distract from classroom learning. The [[activist]], [[perennial candidate]], and former [[98 Degrees]] singer [[Justin Jeffre]] filed a formal letter of complaint asserting the OGT is "unfair" according to guidelines set forth in the Ohio Administrative Code.&lt;ref name="JJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/full/2283222?access_key=key-2aeh6dap6uf4nb7jn5ja|title=Justin Jeffre Complaint|accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He invented the Dulaine method of teaching dance. He also founded Dancing Classrooms, a Social and Emotional development program for 5th grade children that uses ballroom dancing as a vehicle to change the lives of the children and their families.

Notably, his early works with children was fictionalized in the film ''[[Take the Lead]]'', starring [[Antonio Banderas]] as Pierre Dulaine.

The documentary film ''[[Mad Hot Ballroom]]'' follows a Ballroom Dancing with Dancing Classrooms competition.

==Early life and education==

Pierre Dulaine was born in [[Jaffa]], Palestine in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierre |first=Dulaine |title=About Us |url=http://www.dancingclassrooms.org/About/OurPeople/ |publisher=Pierre Dulaine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502074945/http://dancingclassrooms.org/About/OurPeople/ |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His Irish father was serving with the [[British Army]] stationed in British Mandate Palestine; his mother is Palestinian. In 1948 his parents fled Israel. After eight months of moving several times, first in [[Cyprus]], then in [[England]] and [[Ireland]], Dulaine's family settled in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. In 1956, the [[Suez Crisis]] forced Dulaine's parents to flee the area, eventually resettling in [[Birmingham]], England.

==Career==
Dulaine began his dancing career at the age of 14, and took his [[Associate Degree]] as a professional dancer when he was 18. He took three further majors exams aged 21 and became a full member of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]].

In 1971 he worked as a solo dancer at the [[London Hippodrome]], as well as working at a [[nightclub]] called L'Hirondelle. Dulaine moved to [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] and worked for a year at the Nairobi Casino in cabaret with the Bluebell Troupe from Paris. After this, he became cruise director for a ship sailing from New York City to the Caribbean Islands. He then got a job at an [[Arthur Murray]] dance studio. 

In January 1976, Dulaine became dance partners with [[Yvonne Marceau]], who had arrived at the dance studio in 1973. The pair studied in England with [[John DelRoy]], and won several awards. In 1984, they co-founded the [[American Ballroom Theater Company]] with Otto Cappel. The Company debuted at the Dance Theatre Workshop in October 1984, and toured widely in the late 1980s. From July 1989 to 1990, the pair appeared in [[Tommy Tune]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show [[Grand Hotel (musical)|Grand Hotel]], finishing with a five-month run in the West End. 

In 1994 Dulaine founded the Dancing Classrooms program for the [[New York City Department of Education]]. He also invented the "Dulaine Method" to encourage children to dance together. He later travelled to Northern Ireland to teach the same program. In 2011 Dulaine travelled to Jaffa, the city of his birth to teach the method and make the 2013 film ''Dancing in Jaffa''.

The '''Royal Air Force Centre for Air Power Studies''' ('''RAF CAPS''') is a [[Royal Air Force]] sponsored [[think tank]] which engages in the study of [[air power]].

The centre was launched on 23 August 2007 by [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[Glenn Torpy]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/RafChiefUnveilsTheLatestWeaponInTheRafsInventory.htm Ministry of Defence | Defence News | Defence Policy and Business | RAF Chief unveils the latest weapon in the RAF's inventory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Based at the [[Royal Air Force College]], this think tank and research centre claims to bring together [[academia]] with serving members of the RAF to analyse how air power has been used in the past and how best it might be used in a modern, complex world of increasing ambiguity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It aspires to act as the RAF’s centre for [[strategy|strategic]] and conceptual thinking about air power, to "encourage and promote the study of air power, particularly within the Service and academia, but also throughout the broader intellectual community (including the media and think-tanks)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airpowerstudies.co.uk/index.htm CENTRE FOR AIR POWER STUDIES | Royal Air Force Centre for Air Power Studies (RAF CAPS)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The centre hosts a website, runs major conferences,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/sspp/defence/news/news Forthcoming research conferences :News and events :King's College London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; offers fellowships and, since 2008, publishes a journal called ''Air Power Review''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/BC18F893_1143_EC82_2E16AC19F19FE2D2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/airpowerreview.cfm RAF - Air Power Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its board is headed by the [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[No. 22 Group RAF|No. 22 (Training) Group]]. Its staff consists of key members of the Royal Air Force, the [[Air Historical Branch|Air Historical Branch (RAF)]], and academics from [[King's College London]]'s Air Power Studies Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/sspp/defence/apsd.html Air Power Studies Division :Defence Studies Department :King's College London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://airminded.org/2007/11/14/raf-cranwell-and-a-conference/ Airminded · RAF Cranwell and a conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 the RAF CAPS worked with a King's College team of air power experts under the direction of [[Joel Hayward|Dr Joel Hayward]] to develop the UK's first specialised [[master's degree]] in air power studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/E2264FCC_1143_EC82_2E9821F661F2FA58.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airpowerstudies.co.uk/newmastersdegree.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief of the Air Staff's Air Power Workshop, sometimes known merely as the CAS Workshop, is a small working group of senior scholars and other theorists convened by the [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of Air Staff]], the professional head of the [[Royal Air Force]]. Run by the successive Directors of Defence Studies (RAF), the Workshop develops and debates cutting-edge ideas on [[air power]] and sporadically produces books containing the findings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Air-Power-21-Challenges-Century/dp/0117729604&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Pasricha has investigated and participated in about 500 cases of reincarnation involving children (referred to as subjects) since 1973 who claim to remember previous lives. She became interested in working in [[parapsychology]] because she was not satisfied with the conventional explanations of certain paranormal or unusual behavior.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.pflyceum.org/49.html Satwant Pasricha], ''The Biographical Dictionary of Parapsychology''. Accessed 2009-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasricha studies not just the characteristics of reincarnation prevalent in India, but also suggests ways they are similar or different from those of people in other countries.&lt;ref name=riti/&gt; She collaborated with [[Ian Stevenson]] in reincarnation research beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Stevenson, ''[[Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect]]'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997, p. 59. {{ISBN|0-275-95189-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

She joined NIMHANS ([[Deemed University]]) as a faculty in December 1980 as a lecturer in Clinical Parapsychology; and then was promoted to Assistant professor, Associate professor and Additional Professor of Clinical Psychology. She is also involved in clinical work such as patient care and teaching and research in the areas of her interest at NIMHANS.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

'''Savonlinna Music Academy''' ({{lang-fi|Savonlinnan musiikkiakatemia}}) is an association in [[Savonlinna]] (Finland) organizing international master classes in Savonlinna and abroad. On the master classes internationally renowned musicians teach young talented singers and instrumentalists in the field of [[opera]], [[lied]] and [[chamber music]].

Savonlinna Music Academy originated from Savonlinna Music Days organized by Finnish composer [[Yrjö Kilpinen]] in the 1950s. During the Music Days, teaching for young musicians was organized. The history of Savonlinna Music Academy thus goes back to times before [[Savonlinna Opera Festival]] made the small town internationally known. Over time the organization has changed, but the main principle of providing quality teaching has remained the same.  Currently, master classes are organized within the framework Savonlinna Summer University (open university) teaching. Savonlinna Music Academy is directed by an artistic committee. The chair of the artistic committee is pianist [[Ralf Gothóni]]. The managing director of Savonlinna Music Academy Association is operationally responsible for activities.

Mainly master classes are organized in July when also Savonlinna Opera Festival takes place. For students this gives the opportunity to meet and hear many artists visiting Savonlinna for the festival. Concerts organized the Music Academy attract people coming to Savonlinna for opera and classical music. Instruction in singing comprises in addition to opera and lied also of teaching for vocalist-piano duos. In the chamber music master classes student and teachers make music together.

Similar teaching models are the Steans Institute of [[Ravinia Festival]] and the [[Mozarteum University of Salzburg|Mozarteum Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamarimusiikkia Onnelisten Ateljeessa (concert programme) 2010. Savonlinna, Savonlinnasali&lt;/ref&gt;

Instructors in lied have been [[Helmut Deutsch]], [[Irwin Cage]], [[Hartmut Höll]], [[Graham Johnson (musician)|Graham Johnson]] and [[Roger Vignoles]]. In opera [[Ilena Cotrubas]], [[Thomas Hemsley]], [[Dorothy Irving]], [[Jevgeni Nesterenko]], [[Peter Pears]], [[Mitsuko Shirai]] and [[Sarah Walker (mezzo-soprano)|Sarah Walker]] have been active. During the last years teachers mainly responsible have been [[Tom Krause]] and director [[Eija Tolpo]].

Savonlinna Music Academy has also made own productions such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[Cosi fan tutte]] and the 'Italienisches Liederbuch' of [[Hugo Wolf]] as an arrangement for chamber orchestra and two voices in 2005. In 2011 the Academy produced the comic opera [[Il matrimonio segreto]] by [[Domenico Cimarosa]]. The production also toured at Mustasaari Music Festival and in [[Detmold]]. In 2010 instruction in music technology and in 2011 in recording technology was started in cooperation with [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Hochschule für Musik Detmold]].

The international activities of the Savonlinna Music Academy have included master classes in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where courses have been organized for Egyptian students in 2009 and 2010. Participating teachers in Cairo were pianist Ralf Gothoni, violist [[Teemu Kupiainen]], cellist professor [[Arto Noras]], director [[Eija Tolpo]] and pianist [[Jari Hiekkapelto]]. Egyptian musicians have also participated in master classes in Savonlinna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12549">The establishment of the ''[[Special Assistance Program (Australian education)|Special Assistance Program]]'' in Victorian Primary Schools was the most significant development in remedial education in Australia. It was a Hamer Liberal Government initiated strategic plan designed to address falling literacy and numeracy standards. The totally new component of the ''Special Assistance Program'' was the provision of 1000 ''Special Assistance Resource Teachers'' (SARTs) for the delivery of services to children with learning needs. These designated teachers were also given an on-site school responsibility for facilitating a productive relationship between parents and pupils and teachers. The program involved the training of these primary teachers as SARTs and their placement in schools. Their role was the early detection and remediation of children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. The position was the focus of this substantial change in the delivery of special educational services to children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. The role incorporated all the elements of services previously performed by external consultants visiting schools.

==The Special Assistance Program==

The development and implementation of the ''[[Special Assistance Program (Australian education)|Special Assistance Program]]'' in Victorian Primary Schools during the period 1979 - 1982 constituted the most significant innovation in the provision of special education services to children experiencing learning difficulties and in addressing declining literacy and numeracy standards.

Up until the political directive to initiate this program was given, there had been no policy within the ''Department of Education and Early Childhood Development''[http://www.education.vic.gov.au/] (previously ''Education Department of Victoria'') directing Principals of Primary Schools to develop special programs for pupils at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, H. F. (1982) ''The Development of the Role of Special Assistance Resource Teacher in Primary Schools: the Utilisation of a Needs Assessment Technique to Identify and Assess the Requirements of Personnel in the Implementation of the Special Assistance Program in Schools'' Monash University, M.Ed Minor thesis. p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In July 1979, the Assistant Minister of Education the Hon. [[Norman Lacy]] established a ''Ministerial Committee on Special Assistance Programs''.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, The Hon. Norman MP, Minister of Educational Services (9 September 1981) ''The Special Assistance Program - A Ministerial Statement on New Directions in Literacy and Numeracy'', Legislative Assembly, Parliament of Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; The committee consisted of people drawn from school staffs, special education facilities, teacher training institutions and the Education Department administration. The committee's report was the basis upon which the ''Special Assistance Program'' was established.[https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement_912/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement#page/n0/mode/1up] The major components recommended for the program were:
:# the designation of a ''Special Assistance Resource Teacher'' (SART) at 877 Primary Schools throughout Victoria (full-time at 575 schools with more than 300 pupils; and half-time at 302 schools with between 150 and 300 pupils)
:# the development of 20-day ''Special Assistance In-Service Training Course" to be delivered to designated SARTs without formal training in Special Education at four teacher training colleges
:# the re-organisation of the existing special education support services into 50 state wide ''Special Assistance Support Centres'' to be accessed by each primary school through its SART.

The process for the establishment of the ''[[Special Assistance Program (Australian education)|Special Assistance Program]]'' in Victorian Primary Schools&lt;ref&gt;Letters to the Editor, (10 July 1980) ''The Age Newspaper'', Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; was outlined in a speech made by Mr Lacy to SARTs at a seminar on 15 December 1980.[https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech_862/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech#page/n0/mode/1up]&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, The Hon. Norman MP, Assistant Minister of Education (15 December 1980), ''The Special Assistance Program'' - a speech at the Opening of the Seminar of Special Assistance Resource Teachers at the Hawthorn State College&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Assistance Resource Teachers==

===Concept===

The concept of a school based resource teacher identifying deficits in literacy and numeracy in individual children and providing assistance and resources to classroom teachers to address those deficits through special programs had been supported by the findings of numerous major committees of inquiry. Reports such as:
:* the Report of the UK Committee of Inquiry appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science (the Bullock Report, 1975)
:* the Report of the Australian Parliament's House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties (the Cadman Report, 1976)
:* the Report of the Working Party on Provisions for Children with Special Needs (ACT, 1977)
:* the Report of the UK Committee of Inquiry into the Education of Handicapped Children and Young People (the Warnock Report, 1978)
:* the Report of Task Force 8 to the Victorian State Council for Special Education (1979)
:* the Report of the Victorian Ministerial Committee on Special Assistance Programs (1980)
   
The educational philosophy that was the foundation upon which the Special Assistance Program was built had its origins in these reports. That philosophy recognises the profound influence that a child's learning environment has on his behaviour and learning. It also acknowledges the right of children to have their learning needs met in common structural and social conditions. Arising from this philosophical perspective emerges the inescapable proposition that special assistance for children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy (over and above the normnal learning provisions available to all children) is an essential part of a school's functioning and that the designation of a specially trained resource teacher to provide that assistance to children, their classroom teachers and their parents is an integral part of a team approach to curriculum development, teaching and all other aspects of schooling. This position was strongly supported by both the Australian Schools Commission's ''Report for the Triennium 1976-78''&lt;ref&gt;Australian Schools Commission, ''Report for the Triennium 1976-78'' (p.241) "The main emphasis in ordinary schools should be on adapting the procedures in the ordinary classroom to individual differences among a wider range of children. This will often involve substantial organisational changes which ... allow specialists to assist ordinary ones in the normal learning setting."&lt;/ref&gt; and the Warnock Report, which went further to assert that if ordinary schools are to improve in their efforts for children with special needs they will require special support from within their organisation.

===Functions===

The role and functions of the SARTs were specifically prescribed by the Government after extensive consultation with the Victorian Teachers Union (VTU) and the Victorian Primary Principals Association (VPPA). They were:
:# To advise and assist classroom teachers in respect to: - the identification of children in need of special assistance, - the diagnosis of the learning problems being experienced by such children, - the prescription of appropriate programs of special assistance which may be necessary to treat such problems, - the implementation of such programs
:# To consult with and assist parents in respect to their role in the implementation of any program of special assistance which has been prescribed for their children
:# To identify and recommend for referral children in need of psychological guidance, speech therapy or other specialist services
:# To ensure that children needing special assistance continue to participate in appropriate programs throughout their primary school life.

===Appointment===

The implementation of the first stage of the ''[[Special Assistance Program (Australian education)|Special Assistance Program]]'' was only possible after further consultation and a signed agreement by the Minister of Educational Services the Hon. [[Norman Lacy]] with the VTU and the VPPA.

As a result, from the beginning of the 1981 school year SARTs were designated by their schools and appointed to the 575 primary schools with enrolments of greater than 300 pupils. They were manadated to establish the ''Special Assistance Program'' in their schools. The Education Department's Special Services Division and the Primary Division monitored the progress of the implementation and produced a number of evaluative reports that were presented to the Minister.

From the beginning of the 1982 school year, schools with an enrolment of between 150 and 300 pupils designated and appointed a SART to carry out the role on a half-time basis. This resulted in and additional 302 primary schools in Victoria having a school based resource teacher, bringing the total to 877 schools. It was not planned to designate a SART at schools with less than 150 pupils. At such schools it was planned that the Principal or an appointed staff member would access services from the Special Assistance Resource Centres for children at these schools in need of such services.

==In-Service Training Courses for SARTs==
A major component of stage one was the in-service education component for the SARTs designated by their schools for the new role. A survey of the qualifications and experience of the 575 designated SARTs was undertaken to assess their training requirements. The responses indicated that 200 of the designated teachers had already completed special education training courses. Of these 102 were also experienced in special education teaching. As well 28 of the 375 remaining designated teachers were experienced special education teachers.

Four teacher training colleges (Melbourne, Burwood, Bendigo and Warrnambool) were chosen to provide the training programs. A course planning committee was established and drew up a set of principles and a course content outline for a 20-day, one day per week special assistance training course. The course content dealt with approaches to language teaching (esprecially reading), mathematics teaching, and identification of learning problems. The focus of the course was to enable SARTs to devise and implement programs of special assistance in their own schools. An invitation to enrol in the course was sent to all designated SARTs by the Acting Director of Teacher Education on 29 January 1981. They were told that attendance at the courses was voluntary. The responses received by the colleges overwhelmed them. Very few SARTs did not enrol in the course and many teachers from schools of less than 300 pupils were voluntarily designated by their Principals as SARTS and also sought enrolment in the training course. As a result, not all requests for the in-service training course in the Special Assistance Program could be met in the first year of its availability. During 1981, 290 SARTs undertook the course.

The response from schools to the in-service training course was way beyond the Education Department's expectations and reflected the extent of expressed and latent concerns schools had for children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy. A survey of 160 teachers who had completed this course found that, despite initial concerns, there was a good deal of support from school principals and teachers for the SART concept. However, most SARTs felt they needed more in-service training or further training in special education before they felt competent to fulfil their roles.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, L. (1983). ''SART Program'', AREA Bulletin, 15 (3), 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; AREA shared a concern that teachers undertaking SART duties were not qualified in special education, but their proposals to the course committee were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, Josephine C. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1956">'''Tonkunst''', literally "The Art of Tone", is an obsolete term in the German language applied for art music of the 19th century, and often used in music history and [[Aesthetics of music|musical aesthetic]] representations.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, William, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRQMMHIW6NkC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=tonkunst+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7nQT52sEIrRhAfxgunwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tonkunst%20term&amp;f=false The Musician As Entrepreneur, 1700-1914: Managers, Charlatans, and Idealists],'' p. 87, [[Indiana University Press]] (2004), {{ISBN|0253344565}}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably originated from the need to give the music a place among the classical arts like [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[prose]] and [[poetry]], and also recognize the composer or musician as a creative individual. The term is found for example in the inscriptions of the [[Walhalla memorial]] built in 1842,&lt;ref&gt;Karnes, Kevin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dy1RLj-OjgC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=tonkunst+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7nQT52sEIrRhAfxgunwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tonkunst%20term&amp;f=false Music, Criticism, and the Challenge of History: Shaping Modern Musical Thought in Late Nineteenth-Century Vienna],'' p. 176, [[Oxford University Press]] (2008), {{ISBN|0195368665}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a good example is [[Joseph Haydn]], titled as "Doctor der Tonkunst" ("Doctor of Tone-Art"), and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as "Tondichter" ("Tone-poet"). Today the term is rarely used, but lives on, for example, in the name of the [[Tonkünstler Orchestra]].

[[File:UNB Old Arts Building.jpg|left|thumb|319x319px|The Old Arts Building on the Fredericton campus is the oldest university building in the country that is still in regular use for school operations.]]

By an 1800 provincial charter, signed by [[Jonathan Odell]], the Academy of Liberal Arts and Sciences became the College of New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="Historical Sketch of UNB"&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/history/historicalsketch.html "Historical Sketch of UNB"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414183443/http://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/history/historicalsketch.html |date=2015-04-14 }}. ''About UNB''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The College was succeeded by King's College, which was granted by royal charter in December 1827. King's College operated under the control of the [[Church of England]] until 1859, when it was made non-sectarian by an act of the provincial legislature that transformed the College into the University of New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="UNB's Heraldic Tapestries"&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/225/tapestries.html "UNB's Heraldic Tapestries"]. ''UNB Libraries''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, Mary Kingsley Tibbits became the first regularly admitted female student of UNB.

===20th/21st centuries===
In 1906, UNB established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors exercising exclusive control over financial policy and other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to provide institutional leadership. By 1867, the University of New Brunswick had two faculties: Arts and Applied Science. It awarded the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Science]]. The latter was awarded only in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[forestry]]. At this time, the university had 156 male students, 21 female students, and only eleven academic staff, who were all male.&lt;ref&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, University policies changed in response to social pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In 1964, a second, smaller campus was established in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. The growth of the UNBSJ campus is particularly notable, for the campus began with only 96 students spread throughout various buildings in Saint John's central business district. In 1968, UNBSJ moved to its new home at Tucker Park.

The [[Association of University of New Brunswick Teachers]] (AUNBT) was established in 1954; in 1979, this association became the bargaining agent for all full-time academic staff, and in 2008, it achieved certification for contract academic staff.

====Relocation of the Faculty of Law====
[[File:UNBSJ.jpg|thumb|311x311px|View from the UNB Saint John campus]]
{{Main|University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law}}
In 1959, the Faculty of Law moved from Saint John to Fredericton following a report on the status of legal education in Canada by Professor Maxwell Cohen from [[McGill University]]. In his report, Cohen stated that the Saint John Law School was only "nominally a faculty of UNB". This prompted [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], as Chancellor, and UNB President [[Colin B. Mackay]], to permanently move the Saint John Law School to the UNB Fredericton campus, despite the Dean's objections.

====Polytechnic controversy====
In the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended that UNBSJ and the [[New Brunswick Community College]] be reformed and consolidated into a new [[institute of technology|polytechnic]] post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the several organized protests. Under heavy fire from the public, the [[Shawn Graham|Graham government]] eventually announced that it would set aside the possibility of UNB Saint John losing its status as a university and would refer the report to a working group for further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2007/10/17/university-report.html | work=CBC News | title=UNB Saint John will remain a university, says minister | date=October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government would go on to announce in January that UNBSJ would retain its liberal arts program and its association with UNB&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/pre/2008e0119pr.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the working group reported back to government in May, with its findings and government's response being made public in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2008/06/13/nb-post-sec-report.html | work=CBC News | title=Post-secondary education report will be released within days: minister | date=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
Currently UNBF has approximately 9,000 students while UNBSJ has 3,000. Though UNBF has more students at the moment, UNSBT is growing at a faster rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Both campuses have undergone significant expansion over the years, and many University buildings have received funding from Lord Beaverbrook and other prominent industrialists and philanthropists. UNB's largest expansion coincided with the [[Post–World War II baby boom|baby boom]], when its Fredericton campus tripled in size.

[[File:Sir Max Aitken.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] served as Chancellor of the University of New Brunswick and became the university's greatest benefactor.]]

===Fredericton===
The UNB Fredericton campus is located on a hill overlooking the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]]. The campus is well known for its colourful fall foliage, Georgian style red-brick buildings, and a very steep hill.{{cn|date=August 2018}} UNB Fredericton has shared the "College Hill" with [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] (STU) since 1964, when the former St. Thomas College moved from Chatham, NB (now [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]]). While the universities share some infrastructure, they remain separate institutions.

====Architecture====
Architect [[G. Ernest Fairweather]] designed several of the campus buildings, including the Old Civil Engineering Building (1900) and the Gymnasium (1906).&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1283 Biographic Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800–1950 [[G. Ernest Fairweather]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several of the stained glass windows in the Convocation Hall were created by [[Robert McCausland Limited]].

UNBF's War Memorial Hall (usually referred to as Memorial Hall), originally built as a science building in 1924, honours the 35 UNB Alumni who died in [[World War I]].

UNBF's Brigadier Milton F. Gregg, V.C., Centre for the Study of War and Society (usually referred to as The Gregg Centre) was created in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8513{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Gregg Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The Richard J. Currie Center, a five-storey 139,000-square-foot building, was constructed in 2013.&lt;ref name="University of New Brunswick"/&gt;

====National Historic Sites====
Two buildings on the Fredericton campus have been designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada]]: the 1827 [[Sir Howard Douglas Hall]] (the Old Arts Building), and the 1851 [[William Brydone Jack Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|7369|Arts Building|3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|9981|William Brydone Jack Observatory|3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint John===
The UNB Saint John campus (UNBSJ) is located in Tucker Park in the [[Millidgeville, New Brunswick|Millidgeville]] neighbourhood, several kilometres north of the city's central business district, and has views of the Kennebecasis River and Grand Bay. New Brunswick's largest health care facility, [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], is located adjacent to the UNBSJ campus. Since 2010, the UNBSJ campus has been home to Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick, a medical school that operates as a partnership between the [[Government of New Brunswick]], the University of New Brunswick and [[Dalhousie University|Dalhousie]]’s Faculty of Medicine.

The Saint John campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed between the 1970s and the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students.
[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|303x303px|The Hans W. Klohn Commons at UNB Saint John]]

Notable{{cn|date=August 2018}} differences from its parent campus in Fredericton lay in the campus culture. While UNB Fredericton has a substantial number of students living in its on-campus residences, this is not the case for UNBSJ. The majority of students do not live within walking distance of the campus due to its remote location, so unlike Fredericton, Saint John is predominantly a "commuter campus".

====Architecture====
April 1, 2010, the construction on the Hans W. Klohn Commons began. This building is one of the most environmentally friendly buildings in Atlantic Canada.&lt;ref name="A smarter, greener library"&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/excellence/commons.html "A smarter, greener library"]. ''UNB Excellence''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The building features an electric elevator that produces power for the commons. The building is part of the Tucker Park enhancement project, which will include the refurbishment of the Canada Games Stadium, the new Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick facility, and the New Brunswick Community College’s Allied Health building.

===Sustainability===
The University of New Brunswick has attempted to reduce its environmental impact through installing a natural gas burning microturbine at the Central Heating Plant that produces 100&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity for the university.&lt;ref name=" Campus Sustainability Projects"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = https://www.unb.ca/sustainability/PhysicalPlantProjects.htm
  | accessdate = 2009-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heat energy, a result of this process, is used to contribute to the overall heating of the campus to increase its overall energy efficiency.  In addition, all produce and dairy products used within its dining services are obtained from local farmers and local producers; the campus offers grass-fed beef, [[fair trade coffee]], and dining locations offer biodegradable to-go containers. UNB recycles electronics in addition to traditional materials and operates a move-out materials collection program. The university adheres to a green purchasing policy and has reduced greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent since 1990; they have also decreased water consumption since 2005 through the adoption of new technologies. With these efforts to create a more sustainable campus, the University of New Brunswick received an overall "B+" grade in the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card put out by the Sustainable Endowment’s Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Report Card 2011|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/university-of-new-brunswick|publisher= Sustainable Endowments Institute|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
There are over 75 undergraduate programs, the school of Graduate Studies offers course and research-based programs in over 30 fields and UNB has a 16:1 student-to-faculty ratio.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Poets' Corner====
Because so many of UNB's students, alumni, and professors have produced celebrated poetry, the city of Fredericton has earned the nickname "Poets' Corner." Two of Canada's four [[Confederation Poets]] – [[Charles G. D. Roberts|Sir Charles G.D. Roberts]] and [[Bliss Carman]] – were educated at UNB, as was [[Francis Joseph Sherman]], along with a number of notable 20th- and 21st-century Canadian writers. In 1947, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada unveiled a "Poet's Corner" monument in honour of Carman, Roberts, and Sherman.&lt;ref name="Poets' Corner of Canada"&gt;[http://lib.unb.ca/225/poetscorner.html "Poets' Corner"].

===Institute of Biomedical Engineering===
The Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME) on the Fredericton campus is one of the research institutes in biomedical engineering in Canada. It was founded in 1965 as the Bio-Engineering Institute, making it one of the oldest research institutes to be solely dedicated to the field of biomedical engineering. The institute is also the region's prosthetic fitting centre where amputees are fitted with "intelligent" artificial limbs. The institute also carries out research in the field of myoelectric signal processing, biomedical instrumentation and human [[motion analysis]]. The IBME also developed the UNB Test of Prosthetic Function which is used by researchers all over the world. Although the institute does not offer degrees in biomedical engineering, students at UNB usually enroll in one of the other faculties of engineering such as electrical or mechanical and pursue their research in biomedical engineering at the IBME.

===Canadian Rivers Institute===
{{Main|Canadian Rivers Institute}}
The Canadian Rivers Institute was founded in 2000 and is a site of [[river]] sciences research. The mandate of the CRI is to conduct both multi-disciplinary basic and applied research focusing on rivers from their [[headwaters]] to their [[estuaries]], to promote the conservation, protection and sustainable use of water, and to educate professionals, graduate students and the public on water sciences.  Members of the CRI conduct research on regional, national and international issues related to rivers and their land-water linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unb.ca/cri/documents/CRI_Annual_Report_2005.pdf | title=CRI Annual Report | date=2007-08-01 | accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With researchers from both UNB campuses, the CRI develops the aquatic science needed to understand, protect and sustain water resources. Since 2013, the CRI and its partners have been working with NB Power to research the potential environmental impacts of the future options being considered for the Mactaquac Generating Station. The Mactaquac Dam on the Saint John River will reach the end of its lifespan by 2030, and CRI has been evaluating key environmental challenges such as river health, fish passage and flow management. In 2015, CRI was given an additional $2.8 million from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to conduct an aquatic ecosystem study on the Saint John River.

===Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Institute===
UNB created its BEd program for [[First Nations]] students in 1977 in an effort to help First Nations communities take control of their own schools. In 1981, the Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Institute opened its doors with an expanded mandate to train professionals and improve First Nations access to First Nations education. The Institute provides a variety of services, including research, curriculum development, language education, policy development, children's literacy, and more. In addition, the Institute funds the Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Resource Collection, which contains materials that are immensely valuable to knowledge of First Nations culture, history, and perspective in the region.

[[File:UNB Varsity Reds logo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Varsity Reds logo]]

UNB Fredericton is represented in [[U Sports]] by the [[UNB Varsity Reds]] while UNBSJ is represented by the [[UNBSJ Seawolves]].&lt;ref name="University of New Brunswick"/&gt; The Varsity Reds compete in the following sports: men's and women's [[basketball]], men's [[hockey]], men's and women's [[soccer]], men's and women's [[volleyball]], and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. Men's and women's track &amp; field and cross country were added as a varsity sport for 2010/2011; this is a joint Fredericton/Saint John Campus program.

In the past, UNBF used different names for each individual sport's team; for instance, the men's swim team was the Beavers, and the hockey team was the Red Devils. The university club teams, which are supported financially by the Student Union as well as by individual members of the teams, do not use the Varsity Reds name and thus continue the tradition of using different nicknames for each sport.

Traditional among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various times such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic events are "Carmina Universitatis Novi Brunsvici", "Alma Mater" (1904), and "UNB Anthem", with words by A.G. Bailey and music by D.V. Start.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/college-songs-and-songbooks-emc/ College Songbooks and Songs – University of New Brunswick].

'''Vempati Chinna Satyam''' (15 October 1929&amp;nbsp;– 29 July 2012) was an Indian dancer and a guru of the [[Kuchipudi]] dance form.

Chinna Satyam was born in [[Kuchipudi, Krishna|Kuchipudi]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]. He was taught by Vedantam Lakshmi Narayana Sastry. He then refined his art by learning from Sri Tadepally Perrayya Sastry and later was trained by his elder brother Sri [[Vempati Pedda Satyam]] in expressions. As he learnt the nuances of this style of dance, he was successful in popularising the Kuchipudi dance form all over the world. He died of old age related problems at the age of 83 on 29 July 2012.

==Dance==
Chinna Satyam sublimated and systematised Kuchipudi, giving it a more classical basis. He refined the art form, bringing it closer to the standards of ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and gave it a whole new perspective and introduced new elements, e.g. chari (leg movements) of Natya Shastra that are significantly different from the interpretations of other dance authorities, such as Padma Subrahmanyam. Previously, it had been considered a "rustic" (folk) form of dance.&lt;ref name="pinaki"/&gt;

==Kuchipudi Art Academy==

Chinna Satyam started the [[Kuchipudi Art Academy]] at [[Madras]] in 1963. The Academy has to its credit more than 180 solo items and 15 dance dramas composed and choreographed by Satyam. These solo items and dramas have been staged all over India and abroad. He composed his first dance drama ''Sri Krishna Parijatham'' in the same period followed by another hit ''Ksheera Sagara Madanam'' and played the lead role. His portrayal of Lord [[Shiva]] and his choreography was well received.

==Awards and honours==

Chinna Satyam was conferred with many titles and awards such as "Sangeet Peeth of Bombay", "Asthana Natyacharya of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam", ''T.T.K. Memorial Award'' by [[Madras Music Academy]], "Natya Kalasaagara of Waltair", "[[Sri Raja-Lakshmi Foundation|Raja-Lakshmi Award]]  of Madras", "[[Kalaprapoorna]]" from [[Andhra University]], "Natya Kala Bhushana of Guntur", "Bharatha Kalaprapoorna of Hyderabad", D. Litt. from [[Sri Venkateswara University]], "Asthana Natyacharya of Pittsburgh", and "National Award from [[Sangeet Natak Akademi|Central Sangeet Naatak Akademi]], New Delhi".

'''Wallball''' is a type of school yard game similar to [[butts up]], aces-kings-queens, [[Chinese handball]], [[Welsh handball|Pêl-Law (Welsh handball)]] and [[American handball]] (American handball is sometimes actually referred to as wallball). Kenny Mott is the founding father of wallball. The sport was played by a few schools in the Brandon Manitoba, then began gaining much popularity, resulting in a popular worldwide sport. Wallball is now played globally with the international federation, Wall Ball International, promoting the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wall Ball International Webpage|url=http://wallball.co/|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game requires the ball to be hit to the floor before hitting the wall, but in other respects is similar to squash. It can be played as a singles, doubles or elimination game.

Wallball is derived from many New York City street games played by young people, often involving the [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] hi-bounce balls created in 1949.

==Objective==
The objective of wallball is to eliminate all other players in order to be the last player standing, or to be the starter of the game continuously (if the game is endless).

== Wallball ==
The aim of the game is to hit the ball against a wall. If the person hits the wall and the ball bounces out of play the person next in line loses a life. People first decide who serves. This procedure varies, but is usually the winner of the previous game or the person who got the ball (if that would be the first game), or the new person coming in. The server first hits the ball forward and down so that it hits the ground and bounces up to hit the wall. (If the server is a good sport, an easy ball is started with to get the game going.) If it bounces on the ground more than once or if it doesn't bounce on the ground before it hits the wall, it is considered out. Then, after hitting the ball, the ball would bounce back, and the next person would do the same thing. If the ball bounces more than once before the second player hits it the second person is out, but hitting the ball before it bounces is allowed after the first person hits the ball. If the ball bounces out of bounds (the boundaries are usually determined by the orange lines surrounding the field) at any time, it is considered out, and if it hits the orange line, it is sometimes considered in, sometimes considered out, and sometimes considered a "liney" or "liner" in which the game stops and the person who made the liney serves again. The goal is to get the person behind you out by hitting it with the right force and in the right direction. There are sometimes rules called "first serves", in which the server doesn't get out until the third time the server gets out.

There are many variations to the rules, but the rules above are the classic ones. Babies, in which the ball on the second bounce is smaller than the closest interior orange line to the wall (there are two orange lines; one is about three-four feet from the wall, and the other one is about two-thirds of the court away from the wall) and sliceys (or skimmers), where the ball goes at an extremely high speed and extremely low height, are very common varying things (in or out).

There are four main types of wallball: regular, teams, line-up, and random.

* Regular is where the players line up outside of the court on a bench (which is usually present) or standing if there is no bench, and two players enter the court. They play, and the losing player goes to the end of the line, and the next person comes up.
* Teams is the same as regular, except that there are four (or more, but even) players that come up (grouped in equal teams).
* Line-up is where all the players line up in a line that is either determined by the winning person or in "random order", where the players pick the order, and they play in order (the server goes after the last person).
* Random is where all the players are scattered around the court, the server serves, and a random person (whoever wants to hit the ball) comes up and hits the ball. In random, when nobody hits the ball, players determine who is out by either considering it a re-do (the server or another person serves again), "flinching" (the person who reacts to the ball in a fashion that looks like the player is going to hit the ball), nearest person (the closest person to the ball is out), or a combination of nearest person and flinching (if somebody flinches, the flinching person is out; if nobody flinches, the nearest person is out).

In line-up or random, the winner of each game usually decides the rules and game style of the next game (usually with the classic rules, but the winner usually has the right to change them, though if enough people disagree, the idea is usually not used), and in regular or teams, the first person to beat the whole line gets to determine the rules and game style of the next game. If playing with a soccer ball/football, they have to hit it wherever it lies, if against.Players stand a few feet away from the wall. They may only get three outs (no outs if you want the game to be endless). A player serves the ball by throwing directly at the wall. The ball then should return to another player. It is not an out if you get the ball again but is considered unfair if you intended to get the ball back (however, if the ball returns to you three times, it is formally known as a "tea party", and you are out). If the ball bounces first, it is an out. If you drop the ball or the ball hits you, you will have to get to the wall before someone else throws the ball and hits the wall or you will get an out. If you get the ball that is out-of-bounds, players are permitted to shout "challenge!" During challenges, you have to throw the ball from the same place where you picked up the ball. You may only take tiny steps then throw or move backwards. If you move anywhere else, you will get an out. These alternative rules are more common in the Midwest and [[Canada]]. In Australia however the rules are slightly different where there are rules for spiking. Spiking is when the ball hits another player on the full without bouncing and the player which is hit goes on the wall. Some versions are played using two walls adjacent to each other, called "cube ball" where the same rules apply except two walls are used instead of one. Another, called "Aceball", is similar to wallball except that the ball is hit on the wall without a bounce, then allowed to bounce once before a returning hit is required from the other player. Aceball can be played by kicking it as well, though it is no where near as prominent.

==Wallball Rules==

*'''Chicken pox''':this is an an out because it is too overpowerd this happens when you make a fist with both hands.
*'''Angle''': Someone hits the ball in such a way that leads the ball out of the playing area. This is especially applied in an outdoor location.
*'''Baby''': A small, hard to get shot (ball must clear two feet from the bottom of the wall).
*'''Bad Serve''': An incorrect serve which leads to the re-serving of the ball.
*'''Black Magic''': Placing one's hands in front of the ball and maybe pretending to hit it,  once (faking the other person out or to get a reaction out of them) but not hitting it, when it is the opponent's turn
*'''Bus stop''': When the ball is returned to a player, the player yells "Bus stop!" and they bounce the ball once and then hit it.
*'''Challenge''': When a player without the ball shouts challenge, the player with the ball must throw the ball to the wall from where he/she is standing.
*'''Crossy''': Similar to an angle, a crossy is a shot played across the wall to make the opposition run for the ball (sometimes called cross country).
*'''Double Bounce''': Ball bounces more than once before hitting the wall, leading to elimination.
*'''Drop Shot''': Hitting the ball with an angle that makes the ball skim the wall (sometimes called waterfall). (Though "Waterfall" may also refer to a ball that hits so high/straight/parallel to the wall that it skims the wall twice before coming down.)
*'''High Wire''': Also known as a slam, a big hit.
*'''Holdy''': Sometimes simply referred to as a "hold", when someone holds on to the ball rather than slapping/hitting it.
*'''(Hyper) Skimmer''': a low, fast-moving ball, a hyper, or super, skimmer goes exceedingly fast and low, and can only be performed by talented players (may be known as something else, like slicey, or snake) Sometimes, "Grounder", or "Roller" may be call to force a redo.
*'''Interference''': When the ball hits an outside object or hits a player directly after being hit by another player (before hitting the wall). Usually, the judge (first person in the waiting line) serves on an interference, and calls which player to hit it. Sometimes, if the judge is hit, the judge can get you out. This term may be shortened simply as an ''inter''.
*'''Ogden''': When the ball hits the palm of the hand, and does not have enough power to reach the wall.
*'''Out of Bounds''': When the ball goes out of the intended, pre-determined playing surface.
*'''Overdog''': Jumping over the ball instead of hitting it.
*'''Pop''': "Pop" or "Poppy" (as in "no poppies"): shot where the ball hits the wall where it meets the ground, and sort of "pops" out of the corner, usually loudly if using a large red rubber ball (i.e. 4 square ball)—depends on rules agreed before the game but usually illegal (similar to babies) and thus results in the committing player being out.
*'''Rainbow''': Player can call "Rainbow" and must go under the ball without touching the ball successfully, and another player has to hit the ball (sometimes called underdogs or watermelons).
*'''Review''': In some games, players can challenge, or ask for a review that they are not out for whatever reason. If they lose the challenge, they cannot challenge anymore.
*'''Shotgun''': A hard hit that directly hits the wall, rather than bouncing once; typically followed by the elimination of the player who shot that ball (may be known as something else, such as ''bullet'', ''jet'', and ''direct'').
*'''Skid''': The ball returns in a faster pace due to wet contact or the ball's particular rotation.
*'''Slicey''': A player swipes their hand under the ball, without touching the ball, and say "Slicey!" The opponent now has to hit the ball.
*'''Steph Curry''': When the player makes a hoop with their arms and lets the ball pass through without hitting their arms. Player must call out "Steph Curry!"  {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
*'''Time Out''': Stopping the game right in the middle of it (player must call Time in to play again).
*'''Top Hat''': Player hits the ball on top and says Top Hat, making the ball bounce straight down. The other player must hit the ball before it bounces twice and the ball must hit the ground before it hits the wall.
*'''Trap bounce''': Where the ball traps after bouncing once. It typically leads to an elimination or judging.
*'''Traps''': Where the ball hits directly on the join between the wall and ground. This can be played on or replayed and is also known as ''Ace'', "Pops", "Pocket", "Gutter", "Gutter-ball", or "Poppy's".
*'''Troll time''': In the alternate rules when an opposing player throws the ball to the wall a long way away, a player deflects the ball down to the ground touches the wall, then re-throws the ball to the wall all before the opponent has the opportunity to get back to the wall.
*'''Type Writer''': Hitting the ball at the wall, then continually hitting the ball without it touching the floor until the hitter sees fit to let the ball rotate to the next player by hitting the ball against the wall one last time with force. Type Writer should not exceed 5 seconds.
