[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14080, Berlin, Hitler, Göring und Hanfstaengl.jpg|thumb|right|287px|Hitler in conversation with [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]] and [[Hermann Göring]],  21 June 1932.]]

'''Adolf Hitler's rise to power''' began in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] in September 1919 when [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] joined the political party known as the ''[[Deutsche Arbeiterpartei]]''&amp;nbsp;– DAP (German Workers' Party). The name was changed in 1920 to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''&amp;nbsp;– NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the [[Nazi Party]]). This political party was formed and developed during the post-[[World War I]] era. It was [[anti-Marxist]] and opposed to the democratic post-war government of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]; and it advocated extreme nationalism and [[Pan-Germanism]] as well as virulent [[anti-Semitism]]. Hitler's "rise" can be considered to have ended in March 1933, after the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] adopted the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] in that month. President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] had already appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues. The Enabling Act—when used ruthlessly and with authority—virtually assured that Hitler could thereafter constitutionally exercise dictatorial power without legal objection.

Adolf Hitler rose to a place of prominence in the early years of the party. Being one of the best speakers of the party, he told the other members to either make him leader of the party or he would never return. He was aided in part by his willingness to use violence in advancing his political objectives and to recruit party members who were willing to do the same. The [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in November 1923 and the later release of his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (Translation: ''My Struggle'') introduced Hitler to a wider audience. In the mid-1920s, the party engaged in electoral battles in which Hitler participated as a speaker and organizer,{{efn|name=citizenship}} as well as in street battles and violence between the ''[[Rotfrontkämpferbund]]'' and the Nazis' ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA). Through the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazis gathered enough electoral support to become the largest political party in the Reichstag, and Hitler's blend of political acuity, deceptiveness and cunning converted the party's non-[[majority]] but [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] status into effective governing power in the ailing Weimar Republic of 1933.

Once in power, the Nazis created a mythology surrounding the rise to power, and they described the period that roughly corresponds to the scope of this article as either the ''Kampfzeit'' (the time of struggle) or the ''Kampfjahre'' (years of struggle).

==Early steps (1918–1924)==
[[Adolf Hitler]] became involved with the fledgling Nazi Party after the First World War, and set the violent tone of the movement early, by forming the ''Sturmabteilung'' (SA) paramilitary.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=25}} Catholic Bavaria resented rule from Protestant Berlin, and Hitler at first saw revolution in Bavaria as a means to power – but an early attempt proved fruitless, and he was imprisoned after the 1923 Munich [[Beerhall Putsch]]. He used the time to produce ''Mein Kampf'', in which he argued that the effeminate Jewish-Christian ethic was enfeebling Europe, and that Germany needed a man of iron to restore itself and build an empire.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=27}} He decided on the tactic of pursuing power through "legal" means.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=28}}

===From Armistice (November 1918) to party membership (September 1919)===
After being granted permission from [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III of Bavaria]], 25-year-old Austrian-born Hitler enlisted in a Bavarian regiment of the German army, although he was not yet a German citizen. For over four years (August 1914&amp;nbsp;– November 1918), Germany was a principal actor in World War I,{{efn|name=promotions}} on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Soon after the fighting on the front ended in November 1918,{{efn|name=surrender}} Hitler returned{{efn|name=wounded}} to [[Munich]] after the [[Armistice]] with no job, no real civilian job skills and no friends. He remained in the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' and was given a relatively meaningless assignment during the winter of 1918–1919,{{efn|name=guard duty}} but was eventually recruited by the Army's Political Department (Press and News Bureau), possibly because of his assistance to the army in investigating the responsibility for the ill-fated [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=34}}{{efn|name=political department}} He took part in "national thinking" courses under Captain [[Karl Mayr]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=72–74}} Apparently his skills in [[Public speaking|oratory]], as well as his extreme and open [[anti-Semitism]], caught the eye of an approving army officer and he was promoted to an "education officer"—which gave him an opportunity to speak in public.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=35}}{{efn|name=public speaking 1}}{{efn|name=public speaking 2}}

In July 1919 Hitler was appointed ''Verbindungsmann'' (intelligence agent) of an ''Aufklärungskommando'' (reconnaissance commando) of the ''Reichswehr'', both to influence other soldiers and to [[Espionage|infiltrate]] the German Workers' Party (DAP). The DAP had been formed by [[Anton Drexler]], [[Karl Harrer]] and others, through amalgamation of other groups, on 5 January 1919 at a small gathering in Munich at the restaurant Fuerstenfelder Hof. While he studied the activities of the DAP, Hitler became impressed with Drexler's antisemitic, nationalist, [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and anti-Marxist ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}}
[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|Hitler's membership card for the German Workers' Party (DAP)]]
During the 12 September 1919 meeting,{{efn|name=beer hall meeting}} Hitler took umbrage with comments made by an audience member that were directed against [[Gottfried Feder]], the speaker, a crank economist with whom Hitler was acquainted due to a lecture Feder delivered in an army "education" course.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=35}}{{efn|name=Feder}} The audience member (Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' disparagingly called him the "professor") asserted that [[Bavaria]] should be wholly independent from Germany and should secede from Germany and unite with [[Austria]] to form a new South German nation.{{efn|name=South German Nation}} The volatile Hitler arose and scolded the unfortunate Professor Baumann, using his speaking skills and eventually causing Baumann to leave the meeting before its adjournment.{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=219}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} Within a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a "committee" meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the "committee" meeting held at the run-down Alte Rosenbad beer-house.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}} Later Hitler wrote that joining the fledgling party "...was the most decisive resolve of my life. From here there was and could be no turning back. ...&amp;nbsp;I registered as a member of the German Workers' Party and received a provisional membership card with the number 7".{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=224}} Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. However, in this case, Hitler had Captain Mayr's permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=76}}

===From early party membership to the Hofbräuhaus Melee (November 1921)===
{{quote box| quote = ''[[Otto Strasser]]'': What is the program of the NSDAP?&lt;br&gt;''Hitler'': The program is not the question. The only question is power.&lt;br&gt;''Strasser'': Power is only the means of accomplishing the program.&lt;br&gt;''Hitler'': These are the opinions of the intellectuals. We need power!{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=106}} }}
By early 1920 the DAP had grown to over 101 members, and Hitler received his membership card as member number 555.{{efn|name=membership number}}

Hitler's considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920 and his actions began to transform the party. He organised their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people, on 24 February 1920 in the ''Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München''.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=86}} There Hitler announced the party's 25-point program (''see'' [[National Socialist Program]]).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=85, 86}} He engineered the name change of the DAP to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''&amp;nbsp;– [[NSDAP]] (National Socialist German Workers' Party), commonly known to the rest of the world as the [[Nazi Party]].{{efn|name=Nazi}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1997|p=629}} Hitler designed the party's banner of a [[swastika]] in a white circle on a red background.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=87, 88}} Hitler was later discharged from the army in March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=93}}
In 1920, a small "hall protection" squad was organised around [[Emil Maurice]].{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=50}} The group was first named the "Order troops" (''Ordnertruppen''). Later in August 1921, Hitler redefined the group, which became known as the "Gymnastic and Sports Division" of the party (''Turn- und Sportabteilung'').{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=42}} By the autumn of 1921 the group was being called the ''Sturmabteilung'' (Storm Detachment) or SA, and in November 1921 the group was officially known by that name.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|pp=19, 20}} 

Throughout 1920, Hitler began to lecture at Munich's beer halls, particularly the [[Hofbräuhaus]], [[Sterneckerbräu]] and [[Bürgerbräukeller]]. Only Hitler was able to bring in the crowds for the party speeches and meetings.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=88, 89}} By this time, the police were already monitoring the speeches, and their own surviving records reveal that Hitler delivered lectures with titles such as ''Political Phenomenon, Jews and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]''. At the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=89}}

In June 1921, while Hitler and [[Dietrich Eckart]] were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the NSDAP in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival [[German Socialist Party]] (DSP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100, 101}} Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful: at a general membership meeting, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, with only one nay vote cast.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=83, 103}}

On 14 September 1921, Hitler and a substantial number of SA members and other Nazi Party adherents disrupted a meeting at the [[Löwenbräukeller]] of the Bavarian League. This federalist organization objected to the centralism of the Weimar Constitution, but accepted its social program. The League was led by [[Otto Ballerstedt]], an engineer whom Hitler regarded as "my most dangerous opponent." One Nazi, [[Hermann Esser]], climbed upon a chair and shouted that the Jews were to blame for the misfortunes of Bavaria, and the Nazis shouted demands that Ballerstedt yield the floor to Hitler.{{sfn|Toland|1976|pp=112–113}} The Nazis beat up Ballerstedt and shoved him off the stage into the audience. Both Hitler and Esser were arrested, and Hitler commented notoriously to the police commissioner, "It's all right. We got what we wanted. Ballerstedt did not speak."{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=113}} Hitler was eventually sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and ended up serving only a little over one month.

On 4 November 1921, the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich [[Hofbräuhaus]]. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a melee in which a small company of SA defeated the opposition.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=50}}

===From Beer Hall Melee to Beer Hall ''Coup D'État'': the abortive Beer Hall Putsch and the ensuing trial===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00344, München, nach Hitler-Ludendorff Prozess.jpg|thumb|Defendants in the Beer Hall Putsch]]
In 1922 and early 1923, Hitler and the NSDAP formed two organizations that would grow to have huge significance. The first began as the ''Jungsturm Adolf Hitler'' and the ''[[Jugendbund]] der NSDAP''; they would later become the [[Hitler Youth]].{{sfn|Lepage|2008|p=21}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1997|p=431}} The other was the ''Stabswache'' (Staff Guard), which in May 1923 was renamed the ''[[Stoßtrupp-Hitler]]'' (Shock Troop-Hitler).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=16}} This early incarnation of a bodyguard unit for Hitler would later become the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=26–29}}
Inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]] in 1922, Hitler decided that a ''coup d'état'' was the proper strategy to seize control of the country. In May 1923, elements loyal to Hitler within the army helped the SA to procure a barracks and its weaponry, but the order to march never came.

A pivotal moment came when Hitler led the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempted ''coup d'état'' on 8–9 November 1923. [[List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch|Sixteen NSDAP members]] and four police officers were killed in the failed [[coup]]. Hitler was arrested on 11 November 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} Hitler was put on trial for [[high treason]], gaining great public attention.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=75}}

The rather spectacular trial began in February 1924. Hitler endeavored to turn the tables and put democracy and the Weimar Republic on trial as traitors to the German people. Hitler was convicted and on 1 April sentenced to five years' imprisonment at [[Landsberg Prison]].{{sfn|Fulda|2009|pp=68–69}} Hitler received friendly treatment from the guards; he had a room with a view of the river, wore a tie, had regular visitors to his chambers, was allowed mail from supporters and was permitted the use of a private secretary. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=239}}

Hitler used the time in Landsberg Prison to consider his political strategy and dictate the first volume of [[Mein Kampf]] (''My Struggle''; originally entitled ''Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice''), principally to his deputy [[Rudolf Hess]].{{efn|name=Hess}} After the putsch the party was banned in [[Bavaria]], but it participated in 1924's two elections by proxy as the [[National Socialist Freedom Movement]]. In the [[German election, May 1924]] the party gained seats in the Reichstag, with 6.55% (1,918,329) voting for the Movement. In the [[German election, December 1924]] the National Socialist Freedom Movement (NSFB) (Combination of the ''Deutschvölkische Freiheitspartei'' (DVFP) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP)) lost 18 seats, only holding on to 14 seats, with 3% (907,242) of the electorate voting for Hitler's party.

The [[Barmat Scandal]] was often used later in Nazi propaganda, both as an electoral strategy and as an appeal to anti-Semitism.

Hitler had determined, after some reflection, that power was to be achieved not through revolution outside of the government, but rather through legal means, within the confines of the democratic system established by Weimar.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

For five to six years there would be no further prohibitions of the party (''see below'' [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931 - 1933)|Seizure of Control: (1931–1933)]]).

==Move towards power (1925–1930)==
In the [[German election, 1928|German election, May 1928]] the Party achieved just 12 seats in the Reichstag.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224–225}} The highest provincial gain was again in Bavaria (5.11%), though in three areas the NSDAP failed to gain even 1% of the vote. Overall the [[NSDAP]] gained 2.6% (810,100) of the vote.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224–225}} Partially due to the poor results, Hitler decided that Germans needed to know more about his goals. Despite being discouraged by his publisher, he wrote a second book that was discovered and released posthumously as the ''[[Zweites Buch]]''. At this time the SA began a period of deliberate antagonism to the Rotfront by marching into Communist strongholds and starting violent altercations.

At the end of 1928, party membership was recorded at 130,000. In March 1929, [[Erich Ludendorff]] represented the Nazi Party in the Presidential elections. He gained 280,000 votes (1.1%), and was the only candidate to poll fewer than a million votes. The battles on the streets grew increasingly violent. After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler, the SA marched into the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders. In a tit-for-tat action, the SA stormed a Rotfront meeting on 25 August and days later the Berlin headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) itself. In September [[Goebbels]] led his men into [[Neukölln]], a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire.

The [[German referendum, 1929|German referendum of 1929]] was important as it gained the Nazi Party recognition and credibility it never had before.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. J. (2000) ''Weimar and the Rise of Hitler''. London: Palgrave MacMillan. p.138 {{isbn|9780312233518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 14 January 1930, at around ten o'clock, [[Horst Wessel]] was fatally shot at point-blank range in the face by two members of the KPD in [[Friedrichshain]].{{sfn|Siemens|2013|p=3}} The attack occurred after an argument with his landlady who was a member of the KPD, and contacted one of her Rotfront friends, Albert Hochter, who shot Wessel.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|pp=118–119}} Wessel had penned a song months before which would become a Nazi anthem as the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]''. Goebbels seized upon the attack (and the weeks Wessel spent on his deathbed) to publicize the song, and the funeral was used as an anti-Communist propaganda opportunity for the Nazis.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=266–268}} In May Goebbels was convicted of "libeling" President Hindenburg and fined 800 marks. It stemmed from a 1929 article by Goebbels in his newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]''. In June, Goebbels was charged with high treason by the prosecutor in Leipzig based on statements Goebbels had made in 1927, but after a four-month investigation it came to naught.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=111–112}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-0289, München, Hitler bei Einweihung "Braunes Haus".jpg|thumb|right|275px|Hitler with Nazi Party members in December, 1930]]

Against this backdrop, Hitler's party gained a victory in the Reichstag, obtaining 107 seats (18.3%, 6,409,600 votes) in September, 1930.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224–225}} The Nazis became the second largest party in Germany. In Bavaria the party gained 17.9% of the vote, though for the first time this percentage was exceeded by most other provinces: Oldenburg (27.3%), Braunschweig (26.6%), Waldeck (26.5%), Mecklenburg-Strelitz (22.6%), Lippe (22.3%) Mecklenburg-Schwerin (20.1%), Anhalt (19.8%), Thuringen (19.5%), Baden (19.2%), Hamburg (19.2%), Prussia (18.4%), Hessen (18.4%), Sachsen (18.3%), Lubeck (18.3%) and Schaumburg-Lippe (18.1%).

An unprecedented amount of money was thrown behind the campaign. Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for use in Berlin alone. In areas where NSDAP campaigning was less rigorous, the total was as low as 9%. [[The Great Depression]] was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success. Against this legal backdrop, the SA began its first major anti-Jewish action on 13 October 1930 when groups of brownshirts smashed the windows of Jewish-owned stores at [[Potsdamer Platz]].{{sfn|Hakim|1995|p={{page needed|date=January 2014}} }}

==Weimar parties fail to halt Nazis==
The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] heralded worldwide economic disaster. The Nazis and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] made great gains at the [[German federal election, 1930|1930 Election]].{{sfn|Fulbrook|1991|p=55}} Both the Nazis and Communists between them secured almost 40% of Reichstag seats, which required the moderate parties to consider negotiations with anti-democrats.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=118}} "The Communists", wrote Bullock, "openly announced that they would prefer to see the Nazis in power rather than lift a finger to save the republic".{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=138}}

The [[Weimar political parties]] failed to stop the Nazi rise. Germany's Weimar political system made it difficult for chancellors to govern with a stable parliamentary majority, and successive chancellors instead relied on the president's emergency powers to govern.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=92–94}} From 1931 to 1933, the Nazis combined terror tactics with conventional campaigning – Hitler criss-crossed the nation by air, while SA troops paraded in the streets, beat up opponents, and broke up their meetings.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=28}}

A middle-class liberal party strong enough to block the Nazis did not exist&amp;nbsp;– the [[Deutsche Volkspartei|People's Party]] and the [[Deutsche Demokratische Partei|Democrats]] suffered severe losses to the Nazis at the polls. The Social Democrats were essentially a conservative trade union party, with ineffectual leadership. The [[Catholic Centre Party]] maintained its voting block, but was preoccupied with defending its own particular interests and, wrote Bullock: "through 1932-3&amp;nbsp;... was so far from recognizing the danger of a Nazi dictatorship that it continued to negotiate with the Nazis". The Communists meanwhile were engaging in violent clashes with Nazis on the streets, but Moscow had directed the Communist Party to prioritise destruction of the Social Democrats, seeing more danger in them as a rival for the loyalty of the working class. Nevertheless, wrote Bullock, the heaviest responsibility lay with the German right wing, who "forsook a true conservatism" and made Hitler their partner in a coalition government.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=138–139}}

[[File:PapenSchleicher0001.jpg|thumb|Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] (left) with his eventual successor, the Minister of Defence [[Kurt von Schleicher]].]]

The Centre Party's [[Heinrich Brüning]] was Chancellor from 1930 to 1932. Brüning and Hitler were unable to reach terms of co-operation, but Brüning himself increasingly governed with the support of the President and Army over that of the parliament.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=90}} The 84-year-old [[Paul von Hindenburg|President von Hindenburg]], a conservative monarchist, was reluctant to take action to suppress the Nazis, while the ambitious Major-General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], as Minister handling army and navy matters hoped to harness their support.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=92}} With Schleicher's backing, and Hitler's stated approval, Hindenburg appointed the Catholic monarchist [[Franz von Papen]] to replace Brüning as Chancellor in June 1932.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=110}}{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica}} Papen had been active in the resurgence of the [[Harzburg Front]].{{sfn|Bracher|1991|p=254}} He had fallen out with the Centre Party.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=112}} He hoped ultimately to outmaneuver Hitler.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=113–114}}

At the [[German federal election, July 1932|July 1932 Elections]], the Nazis became the largest party in the Reichstag, yet without a majority. Hitler withdrew support for Papen and demanded the Chancellorship. He was refused by Hindenburg.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=117–123}} Papen dissolved Parliament, and the Nazi vote declined at the [[German federal election, November 1932|November Election]].{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=117–124}} In the aftermath of the election, Papen proposed ruling by decree while drafting a new electoral system, with an upper house. Schleicher convinced Hindenburg to sack Papen, and Schleicher himself became Chancellor, promising to form a workable coalition.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=128}}

The aggrieved Papen opened negotiations with Hitler, proposing a Nazi-Nationalist Coalition. Having nearly outmaneuvered Hitler, only to be trounced by Schleicher, Papen turned his attentions on defeating Schleicher, and concluded an agreement with Hitler.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=132}}

==Seizure of control (1931–1933)==
On 10 March 1931, with street violence between the Rotfront and SA spiraling out of control, breaking all previous barriers and expectations, [[Prussia]] re-enacted its ban on brown shirts. Days after the ban SA-men shot dead two communists in a street fight, which led to a ban being placed on the public speaking of Goebbels, who sidestepped the prohibition by recording speeches and playing them to an audience in his absence.

When Hitler's citizenship became a matter of public discussion in 1924 he had a public declaration printed on 16 October 1924: "The loss of my Austrian citizenship is not painful to me, as I never felt as an Austrian citizen but always as a German only . . . . It was this mentality that made me draw the ultimate conclusion and do military service in the German Army."{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=402}} Under the threat of [[criminal deportation]] home to Austria, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925, and did not acquire German citizenship until almost seven years later; therefore, he was unable to run for public office.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=130}} Hitler gained German citizenship after being appointed a [[Free State of Brunswick]] government official by [[Dietrich Klagges]], after an earlier attempt by [[Wilhelm Frick]] to convey citizenship as a [[Thuringia]]n police official failed.&lt;ref name="Speer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9781842127353|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/chap16_part09.asp FRICK'S PARTICIPATION IN PROMOTING THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS' ACCESSION TO POWER.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gunther1940_28_29"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n49/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe |location=New York| publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John |authorlink=John Gunther| year=1940 | pages=28-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Röhm]], in charge of the SA, put [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorff|Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorff]], a vehement anti-Semite, in charge of the Berlin SA. The deaths mounted, with many more on the Rotfront side, and by the end of 1931 the SA had suffered 47 deaths, and the Rotfront recorded losses of approximately 80. 
Street fights and beer hall battles resulting in deaths occurred throughout February and April 1932, all against the backdrop of Adolf Hitler's competition in the [[German presidential election, 1932|presidential election]] which pitted him against the monumentally popular Hindenburg. In the first round on 13 March, Hitler had polled over 11 million votes but was still behind Hindenburg. The second and final round took place on 10 April: Hitler (36.8% 13,418,547) lost out to [[Paul von Hindenburg]] (53.0% 19,359,983) whilst KPD candidate Thälmann gained a meagre percentage of the vote (10.2% 3,706,759). At this time, the Nazi Party had just over 800,000 card-carrying members.

Three days after the presidential elections, the German government banned the NSDAP paramilitaries, the SA and the SS, on the basis of the Emergency Decree for the Preservation of State Authority.&lt;ref&gt;

After less than a month the law was repealed on 30 May by [[Franz von Papen]], [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]]. Such ambivalence about the fate of Jews was supported by the culture of anti-Semitism that pervaded the German public at the time.

In the [[German federal election, July 1932|federal election of July 1932]], the NSDAP won 37.3% of the popular vote (13,745,000 votes), an upswing by 19 percentage points, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag, holding 230 out of 608 seats.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224–225}} 
Dwarfed by Hitler's electoral gains, the KPD turned away from legal means and increasingly towards violence. One resulting battle in Silesia resulted in the army being dispatched, each shot sending Germany further into a potential all-out civil war. By this time both sides marched into each other's strongholds hoping to spark a rivalry. The attacks continued and reached fever pitch when SA leader Axel Schaffeld was assassinated on 1 August. 

As the NSDAP was now the largest party in the Reichstag, they were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag and were able to elect Göring for the post.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=297}} Energised by the success, Hitler asked to be made chancellor. Hitler was offered the job of vice-chancellor by Chancellor Papen at the behest of President Hindenburg, but he refused. Hitler saw this offer as placing him in a position of "playing second fiddle" in the government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=233, 234}}

Göring, in his position of Reichstag president, asked that decisive measures be taken by the government over the spate in murders of NSDAP members. On 9 August, amendments were made to the ''Reichstrafgesetzbuch'' statute on 'acts of political violence', increasing the penalty to 'lifetime imprisonment, 20 years hard labour or death'. Special courts were announced to try such offences. When in power less than half a year later, Hitler would use this legislation against his opponents with devastating effect.

The law was applied almost immediately but did not bring the perpetrators behind the recent massacres to trial as expected. Instead, five SA men who were alleged to have murdered a KPD member in Potempa ([[Upper Silesia]]) were tried. Hitler appeared at the trial as a defence witness, but on 22 August the five were convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, this sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in early September. They would serve just over four months before Hitler freed all imprisoned Nazis in a 1933 amnesty.

The Nazi Party lost 35 seats in the [[German federal election, November 1932|November 1932 election]], but remained the Reichstag's largest party, with 196 seats (33.09%). The Social Democrats (SPD) won 121 seats (20.43%) and the Communists (KPD) won 100 (16.86%).

The [[Communist International|Comintern]] described all moderate left-wing parties as "social fascists", and urged the Communists to devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. As a result, the KPD, following orders from Moscow, rejected overtures from the Social Democrats to form a political alliance against the NSDAP.

After Chancellor Papen left office, he secretly told Hitler that he still held considerable sway with President Hindenburg and that he would make Hitler chancellor as long as he, Papen, could be the vice chancellor. Another notable event was the publication of the ''[[Industrielleneingabe]]'', a letter signed by 22 important representatives of [[industry]], [[finance]] and [[agriculture]], asking Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor.

Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after the parliamentary elections of July and November 1932 had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). 

On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring, Minister Without Portfolio (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia).{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=184}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin.
It is this event that would become termed Hitler's ''[[:wikt:Machtergreifung|Machtergreifung]]'' ("seizure of power"). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process,{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} though Hitler, and others, used the word ''{{lang|de|Machtübernahme}}'' ("take-over of power"), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} and suggesting that the process was legal.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pages=569, 580f}}{{sfn|Frei|1983}}

Papen was to serve as Vice-Chancellor in a majority conservative Cabinet – still falsely believing that he could "tame" Hitler.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica}} Initially, Papen did [[Marburg speech|speak out]] against some Nazi excesses. However, after narrowly escaping death in the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, he no longer dared criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=33–34}}

Both within Germany and abroad initially there were few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and "tame" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was "mediocre" if not a bad copy of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]; even [[SPD]] politician [[Kurt Schumacher]] trivialized Hitler as a "Dekorationsstück" ("piece of scenery/decoration") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was "a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed" and because of the German nation being proud of "the freedom of speech and thought". Theodor Wolff of ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' wrote:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.zeit.de/2017/05/adolf-hitler-reichskanzler-ernennung-jahrestag/komplettansicht | title = Ruhig abwarten! | language = German |trans-title=Calmly wait! | publisher =[[Die Zeit]] Online | accessdate = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|It is a hopeless misjudgement to think that one could force a dictatorial regime upon the German nation. [...] The diversity of the German people calls for democracy.|Theodor Wolff in [[Frankfurter Zeitung]], Jan 1933}}

Even within the Jewish German community, in spite of Hitler not hiding his ardent antisemitism, the worries appear to have been limited. In a declaration of January 30, the steering committee of the central Jewish German organization (''Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens'') wrote that "as a matter of course" the Jewish community faces the new government "with the largest mistrust", but at the same they were convinced that "nobody would dare to touch [their] constitutional rights". The Jewish German newspaper {{ill|Jüdische Rundschau|de}} wrote on Jan 31st:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zeit.de/2017/05/adolf-hitler-reichskanzler-ernennung-jahrestag/komplettansicht | title = Ruhig abwarten! | language = German |trans-title=Calmly wait! | publisher =[[Die Zeit]] Online | accessdate = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|... that also within the German nation still the forces are active that would turn against a barbarian anti-Jewish policy.|{{ill|Jüdische Rundschau|de}}, Jan 31st, 1933}}

However a growing number of keen observers, like Sir [[Sir Horace Rumbold, 9th Baronet|Horace Rumbold]], British Ambassador in Berlin, began to revise their opinions. On 22 February 1933, he wrote, "Hitler may be no statesman but he is an uncommonly clever and audacious demagogue and fully alive to every popular instinct," and he informed the Foreign Office that he had no doubt that the Nazis had "come to stay."&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian, ''Making Friends with Hitler: Lord Londonderry and Britain's Road to War'', Penguin, 2012, {{ISBN|9780241959213}}, 512 p.&lt;/ref&gt; On receiving the dispatch [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], concluded that if Hitler eventually gained the upper hand, "then another European war [was] within measurable distance."&lt;ref&gt;Liebmann, George, ''Diplomacy Between the Wars: Five Diplomats and the Shaping of the Modern World'', I.B.Tauris, 2008, {{ISBN|9780857712110}}, 288 p., p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Germans who opposed Nazism failing to unite against it, Hitler soon moved to consolidate absolute power.

{{quotation|At the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years!&amp;nbsp;... Don't forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany.

==Chancellor to dictator==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14439, Rede Adolf Hitlers zum Ermächtigungsgesetz.jpg|thumb|275px|Adolf Hitler addressing the Reichstag on 23 March 1933. Seeking assent to the [[Enabling Act]], Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers.]]

Following the [[Reichstag fire]], the Nazis began to suspend civil liberties and eliminate political opposition. The Communists were excluded from the Reichstag. At the [[German federal election, March 1933|March 1933 elections]], again no single party secured a majority. Hitler required the vote of the Centre Party and Conservatives in the Reichstag to obtain the powers he desired. He called on Reichstag members to vote for the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] on 24 March 1933. Hitler was granted [[plenary powers]] "temporarily" by the passage of the Act.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=147–148}} The law gave him the freedom to act without parliamentary consent and even without constitutional limitations.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1977|p=7}}

Employing his characteristic mix of negotiation and intimidation, Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: "It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace".{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=147–148}} The Centre Party, having obtained promises of non-interference in religion, joined with conservatives in voting for the Act (only the Social Democrats voted against).{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=138, 148}}

The Act allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenburg remained President.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} Hitler immediately set about abolishing the powers of the [[States of Germany|states]] and the existence of non-Nazi political parties and organisations. Non-Nazi parties were formally outlawed on 14 July 1933, and the Reichstag abdicated its democratic responsibilities.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=200–201}} Hindenburg remained commander-in-chief of the military and retained the power to negotiate foreign treaties. 

The Act did not infringe upon the powers of the President, and Hitler would not fully achieve full dictatorial power until after the death of Hindenburg in August 1934.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226–227}} Journalists and diplomats wondered whether Hitler could appoint himself President, who might succeed him as Chancellor, and what the army would do. Hitler combined the two positions, so that all governmental power lay in his hands. All soldiers took the [[Hitler Oath]] on the day of Hindenburg's death, swearing "unconditional obedience" to Hitler.&lt;ref name="gunther1940_59"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n81/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During hostage crisis===
During the [[Iran hostage crisis]], he had a "prominent role" and made "tough anti-American statements". According to the hostages, after Ahmad's visit to the then taken over embassy, he greeted the students and congratulated them for their action. Emphasizing on that some of the hostages were [[CIA]] agents based on the discovered documents, he repeated his father's threat "to put some of the captives on trial for spying" if the recently toppled [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] was "not returned to Iran."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

===Letter to Ayatollah Montazeri===
On 29 April 1989, Ahmad Khomeini wrote a "more than three pages" letter addressing [[Hussein-Ali Montazeri|Ayatollah Monatzeri]] saying that he was regretful for Monatzeri's being heedless of "Imam's calls."&lt;ref name="Jamal"/&gt; Producing a list of accusations, Ahmad Khomeini tried to show that Montazeri's leadership would be harmful to the revolution. "Was it not because of your affection for Mehdi Hashemi that you created so many problems for Islam and the revolution?" said Ahmad Khomeini in a part of the letter.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menashri|first1=David|title=Post-Revolutionary Politics in Iran: Religion, Society and Power|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136333644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=di4tBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=ahmad+khomeini%27s+letter+to+montazeri&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mFdy61Jr-E&amp;sig=EusgzYU-GPGgNmG8Jvr0tucxw50&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0r57G-5jNAhVmIJoKHaSUDscQ6AEIRDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=ahmad%20khomeini's%20letter%20to%20montazeri&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Montazeri defended [[Mehdi Hashemi]], an Iranian [[Shia]] [[ulema|cleric]] who was [[defrock]]ed later, and said that he would "stay away from politics."&lt;ref name="Jamal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suwaidi|first1=Jamal S.|title=Iran and the Gulf: A Search for Stability|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781860641442|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_swDoVoYxcC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=ahmad+khomeini%27s+letter+to+montazeri&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x9a5tcTSEH&amp;sig=DaQcG-9UhV5usBwX-S9Ey3wDez0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX_ciWopjNAhVIkiwKHaCYBwEQ6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=ahmad%20khomeini's%20letter%20to%20montazeri&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
His wife was Fatemeh Soltani Tabatabai, daughter of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Bagher Soltani Tabatabai Borujerdi, niece of [[Musa al-Sadr|Imam Musa Sadr]], the Shia religious leader of Lebanon.&lt;ref name=asharq8&gt;{{cite news|title=Musa al Sadr: The Untold Story |url=http://www.aawsat.net/2008/05/article55258754 |accessdate=5 August 2013 |newspaper=Asharq Alawsat |date=31 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019131923/http://www.aawsat.net/2008/05/article55258754 |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was also the sister of Sadegh Tabatabai.

==Death==
Khomeini suffered a [[cardiac arrest]] on 12 March 1995, and went into a coma. He died five days later, on 17 March 1995, hours after being connected to [[Mechanical ventilation|life support]] machinery.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  Iran government announced two days of [[national mourning]] after Ahmad Khomeini's death.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Ahmad Khomeini is entombed next to his father in a grand shrine south of [[Tehran]], where his son, [[Hassan Khomeini]], is the superintendent.

At least one author regarded his death as suspicious, stating that "he died in his sleep", without mentioning the heart attack five days prior and subsequent coma.&lt;ref name=Ganji2002&gt;{{cite book|author=Manouchehr Ganji|title=Defying the Iranian Revolution: From a Minister to the Shah to a Leader of Resistance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NboVl-CeYs0C&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=18 February 2013|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97187-8|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Assembly of the Forces of Imam's Line]], the [[Tehran times]] reported that the rumors regarding Ahmad Khomeini's death was originally published by Alireza Nourizadeh, a British spy. His son, Hassan Khomeini confirmed this, calling the rumors "baseless" and repeated the claim that they were created by a British spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writers|title=The project of making Sayyed Ahmad's death suspicious|url=http://www.farhangnews.ir/content/67567|accessdate=7 June 2016|work=www.farhangnews.ir|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Ahmads's father, Ruhollah, described him as such: {{quote|"I bear witness that since the time my son Ahmad has entered the issues of the day, had contact with my works up to the present time I am writing these few lines, I have not experienced a single case of violation of my orders. In statements, communique and the like, he has not garbled or interfered in them without my satisfaction, nor has he attributed anything contrary to my words. In a word, I have not observed any offence from him."&lt;ref name="Tasnim News"/&gt;}}
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Current supreme leader of Iran, described him as who solved many problems and did many things throughout [[Iranian Revolution|the revolution]]. Khamenei called him capable and a unique and necessary element besides Khomeini. According to Ayatollah [[Mohammad Fazel Lankarani]], Ahmad was a strong column, a capable arm for the government, supreme leader and the officials.&lt;ref name="Tasnim News"/&gt;

'''Arthur George Negus''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (29 March 1903 – 5 April 1985) was a British television personality and [[antique]]s expert, specialising in furniture.

==Biography ==
Negus was born in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Berkshire]], England, to Amy Julia Worsley and father Arthur George Negus Sr, a cabinet maker. His family has had a long history in the antiques business. Negus was educated at [[Reading School]] and began running the family business when he was 17, following the death of his father. During [[World War II]] he was an [[Air raid warden|air-raid warden]]. He later joined the company of Bruton, Knowles &amp; Co., auctioneers of fine antiques based in [[Gloucester]]. Amongst his young team were Simon Bruton, Quincey Hobbs and [[Simon Chorley]].

For many years Negus resided in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]].

==Broadcasting career ==
His broadcasting career began at the age of 62 when he appeared on the panel of the television series ''[[Going for a Song]]'' (1965–1977), where he appraised antiques. He quickly became a household name as a result of his slow and distinctive [[West Country dialects|West Country]] speech style, which in turn also made him popular with impersonators. He returned to television with ''Arthur Negus Enjoys'' (1982) and, especially, ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' (1979–1983). He was mentioned in the 1970 ''[[Monty Python]]'' "[[Election Night Special]]" sketch, and again two episodes later in the sketch "[[Archaeology Today]]". He also appeared on other TV programmes including several editions of ''[[The Generation Game]]'' during the time it was presented by [[Bruce Forsyth]] and [[Larry Grayson]].

==Honours and legacy==
Negus was appointed to the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1982. He died in 1985 at his home in [[Cheltenham]] exactly one week after having turned 82.

In April 2013 Negus's daughter Anne appeared on [[BBC One]]'s ''Antiques Roadshow'' with the Negus [[Family Bible (book)|family Bible]], owned by her great-grandparents Charles and Harriet Negus, which had been shown in a previous edition of the show in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]. Since discovering the bible the Negus family had been able to trace its ancestors back to the 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0159jb9|title=Cheltenham Town Hall 2 (first broadcast 14 April 2013)|publisher=bbc.co.uk|year=2013|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard René Jourdan''', [[Marquess|marquis]] '''de Launay''' (1740–1789) was the French governor of the [[Bastille]], the son of a previous governor, and commander of its [[garrison]] when the prison-fortress in Paris was stormed on 14 July 1789 (''see [[Storming of the Bastille]]'').

== Early life ==

The marquis Bernard-René Jordan de Launay was born on the night of 8/9 April 1740 in the Bastille where his father, René Jourdan de Launay, was governor. At the age of eight he was appointed to an honorary position in the King's Musketeers (''mousquetaires du roi''). He subsequently entered the [[French Guards]] (''gardes-françaises''), a regiment permanently stationed in Paris except in time of war.

In 1776 de Launay succeeded M. de Jumilhac as Governor of the Bastille. As was the custom with many senior positions under the Ancien Régime, the marquis purchased the office of governor from his predecessor as a form of investment. The thirteen years that he spent in this position were uneventful, though on 19 December 1778 he reportedly made the mistake of failing to fire the cannon of the Bastille as a salute on the birth of a daughter ([[Madame Royale]]) to King [[Louis XVI]]. In August 1785 he was given responsibility for the imprisonment of two prime figures in the [[affair of the diamond necklace|royal necklace scandal]]: Cardinal [[Louis de Rohan]] and [[Jeanne de La Motte-Valois]]. He behaved correctly and considerately with both, although the latter was an extremely difficult inmate.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathn Beckman, pages 159 &amp; 205, "How to Ruin a Queen", {{ISBN|978-1848549982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1777 he was Seigneur of Bretonnière in Normandy. De Launay also owned and rented out a number of houses in the ''rue Saint-Antoine'', neighboring the Bastille.

==Role on 14 July 1789==
The permanent garrison of the Bastille, under de Launay, consisted of about 80 ''invalides'' (veteran military pensioners) no longer considered suitable for regular army service. Two days before 14 July they were reinforced by thirty Swiss grenadiers from the Salis-Samade Regiment. 
[[File:Lallemand - Arrestation du gouverneur de la Bastille - 1790.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Oil painting by [[Jean-Baptiste Lallemand]] depicting the arrest of de Launay during the [[storming of the Bastille]],&lt;br/&gt; ([[Musée de la Révolution française]]).]]
Unlike [[Charles François de Virot de Sombreuil|Sombreuil]], the governor of [[Hôtel des Invalides]], who had accepted the revolutionaries' demands earlier that day, de Launay refused to surrender the prison fortress and hand over the arms and the gunpowder stored in the cellars.&lt;ref name=hampson&gt;[[Norman Hampson|Hampson, Norman]], 1963. ''A social history of the French Revolution''. P.74-75&lt;/ref&gt; He promised that he would not fire unless attacked and tried to negotiate with two delegates from the Hôtel de Ville, but the discussions drew out. A part of the impatient crowd started to enter the outer courtyard of the fortress after a small group broke the chains securing the [[drawbridge]].&lt;ref name=LEF/&gt; After shouting warnings the garrison opened fire.&lt;ref name=hampson/&gt;&lt;ref name=LEF&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap4a.html |title=Paris and the Politics of Revolution.

With no source of water and only limited food supplies within the Bastille, de Launay decided to capitulate on the condition that nobody from within the fortress would be harmed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 403, "[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution|Citizens]]", {{ISBN|0-670-81012-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a note passed out through an opening in the drawbridge he threatened that he would blow up the entire fortress and the surrounding district if these conditions were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jurgen Lusebrink, Rolf Reichardt, Nobert Schurer. 1997. ''The Bastille: A History of a Symbol of Despotism and Freedom'', P.43&lt;/ref&gt; De Launay's conditions were rejected but he nevertheless capitulated, reportedly after members of the garrison prevented him from entering the cellars where the gunpowder was stored. At about 5pm firing from the fortress ceased and the drawbridge was suddenly lowered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 403, "[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution|Citizens]]", {{ISBN|0-670-81012-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jacques de Flesselles.jpg|right|thumb|right|1789 engraving of the beheaded Mayor of Paris Flesselles and de Launay. The caption reads "This is how we get revenge on traitors".]]
De Launay was then seized and his sword and baton of rank torn from him. He was supposed to have been taken to the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] by one of the leaders of the insurrection, soldier (future general) [[Pierre-Augustin Hulin]]. However on the way there, the furious crowd assaulted the governor, beat him and eventually killed him by stabbing him repeatedly with their knives, swords and [[bayonet]]s and shooting him once. The actual killing was reported to have taken place near the Hôtel de Ville when the struggling de Launay, desperate and abused, cried out "Enough! Let me die." and kicked an unemployed cook named Desnot in the groin. After the killing, Launay's head was sawn off by Mathieu Jouve Jourdan, a butcher. It was fixed on a pike to be carried through the streets for some hours before being thrown in the Seine the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ruth|last=Scurr|page=84|title=Fatal Purity: Robespierre and the French Revolution|ISBN=9780099458982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Three officers of the Bastille's permanent garrison and two of their veterans  were also lynched while two of the Swiss were unaccounted for. However the majority of the defenders were escorted through the mob by [[French Guards]] who had joined the attackers, and eventually released.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt;

==Character==
The history writer [[Simon Schama]] describes de Launay as a "reasonably conscientious if somewhat dour"&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 399, "[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution|Citizens]]", {{ISBN|0-670-81012-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
functionary who treated prisoners more humanely than his predecessors had done. The [[Marquis de Sade]] who had been transferred from the Bastille to another prison shortly before 14 July, commented that de Launay was "a so-called marquis whose grandfather was a servant".&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 399, "[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution|Citizens]]", {{ISBN|0-670-81012-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le Marquis de Launay.png|thumb|left|Bernard-René de Launay]]
The officer commanding the Swiss detachment sent to reinforce de Launay, Lieutenant Deflue, subsequently accused his late superior of military incompetence, inexperience and irresolution,&lt;ref&gt;"I could see clearly from his perpetual uneasiness and irresolution, that if we were attacked we should be very badly led": Deflue quoted by Ruth Scurr on page 84 of "Fatal Purity: Robespierre and the French Revolution" {{ISBN|9780099458982}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he had allegedly displayed before the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Quétel, Claude, 1989. La Bastille: Histoire Vraie D'une Prison Legendaire, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; Deflue's report, which was copied into the log book of his regiment and has survived, may not be fair to de Launay, who was put in an impossible position by the failure of the senior officers commanding the Royal troops concentrated in and around Paris to provide him with effective support. The Marshal [[Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie|de Broglie]], who as Minister of War was in overall charge of the abortive efforts to suppress the disturbances of 1789, had however written on 5 July that "there are two sources of anxiety concerning the Bastille; the person of the commandant (de Launay) and the nature of the garrison there".&lt;ref&gt;Munro Price, page 89, "The Fall of the French Monarchy", {{ISBN|0-330-48827-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Launay had three daughters by two wives. Some of de Launay's brother's descendants settled in Russia (see [[Boris Delaunay]] and [[Vadim Delaunay]] for details). His killing is described graphically in Charles Dickens' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (Book II, Chapter 21) and also in [[Hilary Mantel|Hilary Mantel's]] ''[[A Place of Greater Safety]]''.

'''William "Bill" Drayton''' (born in [[New York City]], USA), is a [[social entrepreneur]]. Drayton was named by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' as one of America's 25 Best Leaders in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31drayton.htm USNews.com: The social entrepreneur: Bill Drayton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109234311/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31drayton.htm |date=2006-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is responsible for the rise of the phrase "social entrepreneur",{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} a concept first found in print in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;see J Banks, ''The Sociology of Social Movements'', London, MacMillan, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drayton is the founder and current chair of [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public]], a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization|organization]] dedicated to finding and fostering social entrepreneurs worldwide. Drayton also chairs two other 501(c)(3) organizations, namely Youth Venture and Get America Working!

Drayton's philosophy of social entrepreneurs are individuals with innovative solutions to society's most pressing social problems. To quote Drayton, "Social entrepreneurs are not content just to give a fish or teach how to fish. They will not rest until they have revolutionized the fishing industry."

== Early years ==
Drayton's mother emigrated to the [[United States of America|United States]] from [[Australia]]. His father was an American who became an explorer. Public service and strong values run through the history of both parents' families, including several of the earliest anti-slavery abolitionist and women's leaders in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/good-magazine/good-qa-social-entrepre_b_75010.html | work=Huffington Post | title=GOOD Q&amp;A: Social Entrepreneur Bill Drayton On His White House Years | date=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drayton was born in 1943 in [[New York City]].

Drayton attended high school at [[Phillips Academy]], where he established the Asia Society, which soon became the school's most popular student organization. He attended [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1965, where he created the Ashoka Table, bringing in prominent government, union, and church leaders for [[off the record (journalism)|off-the-record]] dinners at which students could ask "how things really worked". Drayton entered [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and received a [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1967. He attended to [[Yale Law School]] where he received his [[Juris Doctor]] in 1970. At Yale Law School, Drayton founded Yale Legislative Services, which, at its peak, involved a third of the law school's student body.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/01/changing-the-world-on-a-shoestring/377042/ Changing the World on a Shoestring]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bogumilus''', in Polish '''Bogumił Piotr''', (also known as '''Bogimilus''' and '''Theophilus''')&lt;ref name=Bunson&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l-pwoTFp31kC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Saint+Bogumilus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H8ti7MXEn2&amp;sig=fXy3zCf4l48-UEOUnOdomjRNVDs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7vJCttITNAhUBej4KHd53D5w4ChDoAQglMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Saint%20Bogumilus&amp;f=false, Bunson, Matthew. "Bogumilus", ''Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints'', OSV Publishing, 2003] {{ISBN|9781931709750}}&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Archbishop of Gniezno]] and a [[hermit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5804 St. Bogumilus] Catholic Online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bogumilus and his twin brother, Boguphalus, were born into a noble family in 1135 at [[Dobrów, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Dobrów]], [[Poland]]. They studied in [[Paris]], [[France]]. Having completed his studies Bogumilus was ordained a [[priest (Catholic Church)|priest]] near [[Dobrów, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Dobrów]]. His uncle, who was the [[Archbishop of Gniezno]], made him the [[chancellor]] of [[Gniezno]]. Bogumilus succeededed his uncle as Archbishop of Gniezno in 1167. Bogumilus founded a [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] at [[Koronowo]].&lt;ref name=Bunson/&gt;

He resigned his [[Episcopal see|see]] in 1172, possibly due to opposition by his clergy to what they viewed as his excessive strictness. Bogumilus then joined the [[Camaldolese]] hermits at [[Bielany (Kraków)|Uniedow]], Poland,&lt;ref name=Bunson/&gt; where he remained until his death. While on his deathbed, it is believed that Bogumilus saw a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]] and [[Child Jesus|Child]], surrounded by a throng of [[angels]], who were inviting him to [[heaven]].

==Legacy and Veneration==
The [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] and [[veneration]] of Bogumilus began almost immediately after his death, especially in [[Poland|Eastern Poland]]. Many people prayed for his [[Intercession of saints|intercession]] for things such as [[health]], good [[livestock]] and a good catch while [[fishing]]. When they were answered, many faithful visited his tomb and it became a place for local [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]]. Yet it was not until 1625 that the formal process of [[beatification]] began under the [[Primate of Poland]], [[Archbishop]] [[Maciej Łubieński]].

The files were sent to [[Rome]] in 1651, however the process was never completed as the ''Book of Miracles'', which was in the hands of a [[Count]], by the name of Sebastian Głębocki, was burned at his [[Court (royal)|court]] in [[Głębokie, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Głębokie]], [[Kruszwica]]. [[File:Dobrów - kaplica.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of blessed Bogumił, [[Dobrów, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Dobrów]]]]In 1788 a small wooden chapel dedicated to Bogumilus was built, in the wetlands of the Rivers [[Warta]] and Teleszyny, near [[Dobrów, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Dobrów]], and still stands till this day. The process of [[beatification]] would remain dormant until 1908, when Stanislaw Zdzitowiecki, the [[Bishop of Kujawy]], reactivated the process. On 27 May 1925 [[Pope Pius XI]] proclaimed Bogumilus, as [[Beatification|Blessed]]. Later [[Pope Paul VI]] would bestow on Bogumilus the [[Patron saint|patronage]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Archdiocese of Gniezno]].

==Historical Confusion==
Some [[scholars]] believe that Bogumilus is the amalgamation of two historical figures by the names of Bogumił and Piotr, one of whom was the archbishop and the other a monk or the [[bishop of Poznań]].

There is no definitive evidence, to support this, however, and most modern [[historians]] regard Bogumił Piotr, as one historical person, who is [[venerated]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]].

In support of this view, it is possible that the archbishop had been [[baptism|christened]] as Piotr and might have taken the name Bogumił as his monastic name. The support for this theory is the fact that this name already had a place of honor in the Camaldolese Order, as the original Bogumilus was a member{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} of the first [[monastery]] of the Order outside of Italy. All the members of this 11th-century community were murdered and are considered martyrs within the Order. An account of their deaths was written by their colleague, [[Saint]] [[Bruno of Querfurt]], and the memory of these martyred monks would have been still fresh to the Polish Camaldolese monks of his day.

The '''Cooney sisters''' were three [[Irish people|Irish]] sisters, notable for their involvement in [[Irish Nationalism]] and [[Cumann na mBan]].

== Biographies ==
Anne, Lilly and Eileen were born in Dublin to Michael and Mary Cooney who lived in Usher's Quay, [[Dublin]]. Their father was an engineer.{{sfn|Census|1901}}{{sfn|Census|1911}}

The three sisters were involved with the nationalist movement in Ireland. This involvement was through the people who lived in and visited their house on a regular basis on the years leading up to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]], like Christopher Byrne and [[Con Colbert]]. They joined [[Cumann na mBan]] in 1915 and were trained as usual in all the first aid and military training which took place on Harcourt and Camden streets. Along with Byrne and Colbert, Joe McGrath and Phil Cosgrave frequently visited the house and were senior officers in their branches of the [[Irish Volunteers|Volunteers]]. The house was used to store ammunition in preparation for the Rising and used as a distribution centre in the days leading up to it. A younger brother, Thomas, was used in the Rising as a runner.{{sfn|Bureau Of Military History}}

Con Colbert was one of the leaders of the rebellion and was executed by the British for his involvement. He set out for the events of the [[Easter Rising]] from the Cooney house in Usher's Quay.{{sfn|Bureau Of Military History}}

All three women were members of the Inghinidhe branch of [[Cumann na mBan]]. The eldest girl involved was just 18 when they joined the Cumann. They all served in the Marrowbow Lane garrison during the Easter Rising with others like [[Marcella Cosgrave]]. Their father was arrested during the Rising when he tried to supply the garrison with food. He was kept in [[Kilmainham gaol]] for the duration and for some time after the Rising. He was then sent to [[Wakefield]] in Britain before eventually being sent back to Dublin. All three sisters were arrested with the other women after the Rising and sent to Richmond Barracks initially and then on to Kilmainham gaol. They were all released with the others on May 8, 1916.{{sfn|Bureau Of Military History}}{{sfn|Collins2016}}

After the Rising all three sisters were involved in the Irish National Aid Association and Volunteer Dependants' Fund, their own family being one of the dependants as a result of their father's arrest. They appear in the photo taken in the garden over the summer. They continued their involvement through the [[Irish War of Independence]] and into the [[Irish Civil War]] where they were Anti-Treaty.{{sfn|Kilmainham}}{{sfn|Medals}}

A quilt was created to remember the 77 women of Richmond Barracks and the three Cooney sisters are part of that memory, stitched with a green shamrock on their squares.{{sfn|Irish Times|2016}}

===Anne===
Anne was born about 1897. She was a seamstress and fashioned her military uniform from one that Colbert gave her. She later married Denis O’Brien, who had been one of the volunteers in the Marrowbow Lane garrison with his two brothers.{{sfn|Bureau Of Military History}}{{sfn|Census|1911}}

===Lilly===
Elizabeth or Lilly Cooney was born in 1898. She was the one of the sisters sent by bicycle to mobilise the Chapelizod section of F. Company, the main company that the sisters worked with during the lead up to the Rising. She served with her sisters in the Marrowbow Lane garrison and continued to serve through the War of Independence. She collected funds for prisoners and arms as well as transporting both arms and information around the country. She was instrumental in identifying an agent of Crown forces. She later married Curran.{{sfn|Bureau Of Military History}}{{sfn|Medals}}

===Eileen===
Eileen was born on the 26th of December 1899. She is listed as Alice on the 1901 census.{{sfn|Census|1901}} After the Rising she was involved in the First World War anti-conscription activities. As part of the Cumann she collected money for weapons and was involved in propaganda work. Her area during the War of Independence was to ensure the welfare of the interned Irish. She also worked on First aid stations and acted as a courier. She held the rank of Section Commander from November 1920. Her married name was Harbourne. She died on the 22nd of April 1982.{{sfn|Medals}}{{sfn|Bureau Of Military History}}

The '''Dahiya doctrine''' or, '''Dahya doctrine''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1198]&lt;/ref&gt; is a military strategy of [[asymmetric warfare]], outlined by [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) Chief of General Staff [[Gadi Eizenkot]], which encompasses the destruction of the civilian infrastructure of regimes deemed to be hostile as a measure calculated to deny [[combatants]] the use of that infrastructure&lt;ref name=Byman&gt;‘the threat to destroy civilian infrastructure of hostile regimes, as Israel did to the Dahiya neighborhood of Beirut, where Hizbollah was headquartered in 2006’  Daniel Byman , [https://books.google.com/books?id=mYppAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364 ''A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism''], Oxford University Press,  2011 p.364&lt;/ref&gt; and endorses the employment of "disproportionate power" to secure that end.&lt;ref name=harelEisenkot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/analysis-idf-plans-to-use-disproportionate-force-in-next-war-1.254954|title=ANALYSIS / IDF plans to use disproportionate force in next war |work=Haaretz|author=Amos Harel|date=5 Oct 2008|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FinallyRealizes"&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3605863,00.html "The Dahya Strategy: Israel finally realizes that Arabs should be accountable for their leaders’ acts"] The Dahya strategy, according to IDF Northern Command Chief Gadi Eisenkot. Interview in Yedioth Ahronoth. 10.06.08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08TELAVIV2329_a.html 'IDF REGIONAL COMMANDERS SPEAK OUT IN PRESS INTERVIEWS,' [[WikiLeaks]] 08TELAVIV2329_a]: 'Eisenkot labeled any Israeli response to resumed conflict the "Dahya doctrine" in reference to the leveled Dahya quarter in Beirut during the Second Lebanon War in 2006. He said Israel will use disproportionate force upon any village that fires upon Israel, "causing great damage and destruction." Eisenkot made very clear: this is not a recommendation, but an already approved plan -- from the Israeli perspective, these are "not civilian villages, they are military bases." Eisenkot stated that Damascus fully understands what the Israelis did in Dahya, and that the Israelis have the capability of doing the same to Syria. He suggested the possibility of harm to the population has been Hizballah leader Nasrallah's main constraint, and the reason for the quiet over the past two years.'&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine is named after the [[Dahieh]] neighborhood of Beirut, where [[Hezbollah]] was headquartered during the [[2006 Lebanon War]], which were heavily damaged by the IDF.&lt;ref name=Byman /&gt;

==History==

===2006 Lebanon War===
The first public announcement of the doctrine was made by general [[Gadi Eizenkot]], commander of the IDF's northern front, in October 2008. He said that what happened in the [[Dahieh|Dahya]] (also transliterated as Dahiyeh and Dahieh) quarter of [[Beirut]] in 2006 would, "happen in every village from which shots were fired in the direction of Israel. We will wield [[Proportionality (law)#International humanitarian law|disproportionate power]] against [them] and cause immense damage and destruction. From our perspective, these are military bases. [...] This isn't a suggestion. It's a plan that has already been authorized. [...] Harming the population is the only means of restraining [[Hassan Nasrallah|Nasrallah]]."&lt;ref name=harelEisenkot/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirst2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hirst|title=Beware of Small States: Lebanon, Battleground of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=az6ivWyQhIcC&amp;pg=PA396|date=30 March 2010|publisher=Nation Books|isbn=0-7867-4441-3|pages=401–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EisenkotInterview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel warns Hizbullah war would invite destruction|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3604893,00.html|agency=Reuters|newspaper=Yedioth Ahronoth|date=3 October 2008|accessdate=18 April 2011|quote=IDF Northern Command chief says in any future war Israel would use 'disproportionate' force on Lebanese villages from which Hizbullah will fire rockets at its cities. 'From our standpoint, these are not civilian villages, they are military bases,' Maj.-Gen. Eisenkot tells Yedioth Ahronoth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to analyst [[Gabi Siboni]] at the Israeli [[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|Institute for National Security Studies]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"With an outbreak of hostilities [with Hezbollah], the IDF will need to act immediately, decisively, and with force that is disproportionate to the enemy's actions and the threat it poses. Such a response aims at inflicting damage and meting out punishment to an extent that will demand long and expensive reconstruction processes. Israel's test will be the intensity and quality of its response to incidents on the Lebanese border or terrorist attacks involving Hezbollah in the north or Hamas in the south. In such cases, Israel again will not be able to limit its response to actions whose severity is seemingly proportionate to an isolated incident. Rather, it will have to respond disproportionately in order to make it abundantly clear that the State of Israel will accept no attempt to disrupt the calm currently prevailing along its borders. Israel must be prepared for deterioration and escalation, as well as for a full-scale confrontation. Such preparedness is obligatory in order to prevent long term attrition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siboni|first1=Gabi|title=Disproportionate Force: Israel's Concept of Response in Light of the Second Lebanon War|url=http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&amp;articleid=1964|work=INSS|date=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caverley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan D. Caverley|title=Democratic Militarism: Voting, Wealth, and War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I19zAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-91730-8|pages=296–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Noting that Dahya was the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] quarter in Beirut that was razed by the [[Israeli Air Force]] during the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli journalist [[Yaron London]] wrote in 2008 that the doctrine, "will become entrenched in our security discourse."&lt;ref name="FinallyRealizes" /&gt;

[[Naftali Bennett]] told [[Haaretz]] in an interview in March, 2017: "The Lebanese institutions, its infrastructure, airport, power stations, traffic junctions, Lebanese Army bases – they should all be legitimate targets if a war breaks out. That's what we should already be saying to them and the world now. If Hezbollah fires missiles at the Israeli home front, this will mean sending Lebanon back to the [[Middle Ages]]". He claims that this strategy would will speed up international intervention and shorten the campaign.

===Gaza War===
Some analysts have argued that Israel implemented such a strategy during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|2008–09 Gaza War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Deterrence and the Israeli-Hezbollah War-Summer 2006|editor=Cain, Anthony C.|date=September 2010|title=Deterrence in the Twenty-first Century: Proceedings (London, UK 18-19 May 2009) |location=London|page=288|isbn=1466368187}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Goldstone Report]] concluding that the Israeli strategy "designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/SpecialSession/Session9/MediaSummaryReport_en.doc |title=Media Summary: Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324223810/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/SpecialSession/Session9/MediaSummaryReport_en.doc |archivedate=24 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations{{who|date=March 2017}} have argued that economic damage was also pursued, with [[IDF Caterpillar D9|D9 armoured bulldozers]] on Palestinian farmland, wrecking 17% of it and leaving 30% of it unusable.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} A leaked U.S. embassy cable from October 2008, two months prior to the Gaza War, reports that General Gadi Eizenkot in his first interview in four years, discusses Israel's northern, central, and southern regions, and "labeled any Israeli response to resumed conflict the "Dahya doctrine" in reference to the leveled Dahya quarter in Beirut during the 2006 Lebanon War. He said Israel will use disproportionate force upon any village that fires upon Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moreno|first1=Luis G.|title=IDF REGIONAL COMMANDERS SPEAK OUT IN PRESS INTERVIEWS |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08TELAVIV2329_a.html|website=WikiLeaks |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict]] makes several references to the Dahya doctrine, calling it a concept which requires the application of "widespread destruction as a means of deterrence" and which involves "the application of disproportionate force and the causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to civilian populations." The Fact Finding Mission which submitted the Report concluded that the doctrine had been put into practice during the conflict.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;United Nations General Assembly, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict], 25 09 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 1 April 2011 op-ed, one of the lead authors of the UN Fact Finding Mission, judge [[Richard Goldstone]] stated that some of his conclusions may have been different had the Israeli government cooperated with his team during the investigation. The op-ed has been interpreted by some as a retraction of the report and its conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html|title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes|author=Richard Goldstone|date=2 April 2011|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retraction was spurned by his three co-authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/14/un-gaza-report-authors-goldstone|title=UN Gaza report co-authors round on Goldstone|publisher=The Guardian|date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine is defined in a 2009 report by the [[Public Committee Against Torture in Israel]] as follows: "The military approach expressed in the Dahiye Doctrine deals with asymmetrical combat against an enemy that is not a regular army and is embedded within civilian population; its objective is to avoid a protracted guerilla war. According to this approach Israel has to employ tremendous force disproportionate to the magnitude of the enemy’s actions." The report further argues that the doctrine was fully implemented during Operation Cast Lead.&lt;ref name="NoSecond"&gt;[http://www.stoptorture.org.il/files/no%20second%20thoughts_ENG_WEB.pdf "No Second Thoughts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215081903/http://www.stoptorture.org.il/files/no%20second%20thoughts_ENG_WEB.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }} The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Richard Falk]] wrote that under the doctrine, "the civilian infrastructure of adversaries such as Hamas or Hezbollah are treated as permissible military targets, which is not only an overt violation of the most elementary norms of the law of war and of universal morality, but an avowal of a doctrine of violence that needs to be called by its proper name: state terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richardfalk.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/israel%E2%80%99s-israeli-violence-against-separation-wall-protests-along-the-road-of-state-terrorism/ |title=Israel’s Violence Against Separation Wall Protests: Along the Road of State Terrorism |author=Richard Falk |author-link=Richard Falk |date=7 January 2011 |publisher=Citizen Pilgrimage blog &lt;!--|accessdate=7 August 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:הרב אליהו ליאון לוי זצוק"ל.jpg|thumb|Rabbi Eliyahu Leon Levi]]
 [[File:בנית הכנסת בישיבת תיקוני אליהו ומעיניי הישועה.JPG|thumb|The synagogue at the Yeshiva building]]

Rabbi '''Eliyahu Leon Levi''' (Hebrew: אליהו ליאון לוי), also called '''Baba Leon''', (1939 – July 20, 2015) was a well-known Rabbi and Kabbalist, author of the prayer "Tikun-Yesod Yeshuat-Eliyahu".

== Biography ==

Levi was born as the youngest child of Shafika &amp; Rabbi Yeshua, who was chief rabbi of Marash, now [[Kahramanmaraş]], [[Turkey]]. When he was 8 years old, his family emigrated to Israel and settled in [[Ness Ziona]], later moving to the Ezra neighborhood of [[Tel Aviv]], where his father established "Ezra and Tushia" [[Beth Midrash]] and was the Rabbi of Turkey immigrants.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

At the age of 12 he studied in "Ohel Moed" [[Yeshiva]] in Tel-Aviv, and at the age of 18 he studied at a [[Chabad]] Yeshiva in the city. When he was 21 he joined the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and served in the [[Paratroopers Brigade]], but as a child to a bereaved family who lost her son Yehuda&lt;ref&gt;http://www.izkor.gov.il/HalalView.aspx?id=4224&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], he was released a year later. He married Shoshana and studied for four years at the Beit Hillel [[Kolel]], and afterwards started his [[Kabbalah]] studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Later he moved to [[Bnei Brak]] and established the "Tikuney-Eliyahu and Maayaney-Hayeshua" Yeshiva for Kabbalah studies.

Rabbi Leon was also well known as a singer and was proficient in [[Arabic maqam|Maqam]] singing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Tikun Yesod ==

Rabbi Leon authored the "Tikun-Yesod Yeshuat-Eliyahu", a special prayer for [[Pgam Habrit]], and for decades he traveled between synagogues in Israel and abroad to bequeath this prayer. This prayer took place every Tuesday of the [[Shovavim]] days, in a night of praying, singing and crying until sunrise. The last prayer each year took place at the [[Western Wall]] and attracted thousands of followers.

== The Western Wall ==

For about 45 years, Rabbi Leon visited the Western Wall twice each week: once at the middle of the week and the second time on Saturday night with his followers, where they read the [[Plams]] book several times and Rabbi Leon gave his weekly homily. They also visited the Western Wall each [[Rosh Chodesh]] for a special Rosh Chodesh prayer.

[[File:Fred Forbat Kakelvägen Borgmästaregården Lund.jpg|thumb|350px|Kakelvägen, Borgmästaregården, Lund]]
'''Alfréd "Fred" Forbát''' (31 March 1897 – 22 May 1972) was a Hungarian-born architect with significant work in Germany and Sweden.

He was born to Jewish parents in [[Pécs]], former Austria-Hungary (today part of the [[Republic of Hungary]]). He studied architecture and art history at the [[University of Budapest]] and the [[Technical University of Munich]]. From 1920–22 Forbát worked intermittently with [[Walter Gropius]] and taught at the [[Bauhaus]] in its first incarnation, in Weimar.&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;[https://deu.archinform.net/arch/815.htm ''ArchINFORM. Fred Forbát''] (in German). (Accessed: 6 December 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1923 to 1924 he worked as a freelance architect in Weimar and with the MA Group in Vienna. Then from 1924 to 1925 he worked for the [[League of Nations]] as the technical leader for a housing development in [[Thessaloniki]], the capital city of Greek Macedonia.&lt;ref name="archinform" /&gt; 
From 1925 to 1928 he was the lead architect at Sommerfeld Co. in Berlin, and from 1928 to 1932 he worked in the architectural office of Hubert Hoffmann, developing the Berlin housing projects [[Siemensstadt]] (1930) und [[Haselhorst]] (1931).&lt;ref name="archinform" /&gt;

Between 1932 and 1933 he worked in Moscow on a town planning project for the Russian state-run planning organisation ''Standardgorprojek'', together with [[Ernst May]].&lt;ref name="archinform" /&gt;

In 1938 he briefly returned to Hungary as a freelance architect, and was responsible for a number of tenements and free-standing houses there.  Later that same year he traveled to [[Stockholm]], where he began a long-term association.  He worked for the Urban Ministry, then became a member of the city planning group "Eglers Stadsplanebyrå". He was partly responsible for master plans for [[Skövde]] (1949), [[Landskrona]] (1951), [[Upplands Väsby]] (then, Hammarby kommun, 1951), Kullabygden (1959), [[Linköping]] (1967) and [[Kristinehamn]]. In 1952 Forbát was co-organizer of the 1952 special (non-congress) meeting of [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] in Sigtuna (Sweden), and also helped organize the 1957 [[Interbau]] project in Berlin. His papers are held by the [[Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design|Swedish Museum of Architecture]] in Stockholm. He died in [[Vällingby|Vällingby, Sweden]] in 1972, aged 75.

'''Greek refugees''' is a collective term used to refer to the nearly one million [[Greek Orthodox]] natives of [[Asia Minor]], [[Thrace]] and the [[Black Sea]] areas who fled during the [[Greek genocide]] (1914-1922) and Greece's later defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]], as well as remaining Greek Orthodox inhabitants of Turkey who were required to leave their homes for Greece shortly thereafter as part of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], which formalized the population transfer and barred the return of the refugees.&lt;ref name=Gibney&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew J. Gibney, [[Randall Hansen]]. |title=Immigration and Asylum: from 1900 to the Present, Volume 3 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location= |year=2005 |page=377 |isbn=1-57607-796-9 |quote=The total number of Christians who fled to Greece was probably in the region of I.2 million with the main wave occurring in 1922 before the signing of the convention. According to the official records of the Mixed Commission set up to monitor the movements, the "Greeks' who were transferred after 1923 numbered 189,916 and the number of Muslims expelled to Turkey was 355,635.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]] was signed in [[Lausanne, Switzerland|Lausanne]], on January 30, 1923 as part of the peace treaty between Greece and Turkey and required all remaining Orthodox Christians in Turkey, regardless of what language they spoke, be relocated to Greece with the exception of those in Istanbul and two nearby islands. Although the term has been used in various times to refer to fleeing populations of Greek descent (primarily after the [[Ionian Revolt]], the [[Fall of Constantinople]] or the [[Greek Civil War]]), the population strength and the influence of the Asia Minor Greeks in Greece itself, has attached the term to the Anatolian Greek population of the early 20th century. At least 300,000 Greek refugees were from [[Eastern Thrace]], whereas at least 900,000 were from [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/Dateien/CouncilMSD/C-524-M-187-1924-II_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hellenicresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Fate-of-Greek-Majority-Psomiades.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At least 150,000 were from [[Istanbul]], who left the city in three years before 1928.&lt;ref&gt;books.google.com/books?id=j42kCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT208&amp;dq=greeks+istanbul+expulsed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=greeks%20istanbul%20expulsed&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term==
The Orthodox Christian refugees from Asia Minor are usually called in [[Greek language|Greek]] simply '''Οι Πρόσφυγες''' (''Oi Prosfyges'', ''The Refugees''). Alternative terms used are '''Οι Μικρασιάτες πρόσφυγες''' (''Oi Mikrasiates prosfyges'', ''The Asia Minor refugees'') or '''Οι πρόσφυγες του '22''' (''Oi prosfyges tou '22'', ''The refugees of 1922''). Further distinctions are made to denote the refugees from various historic regions of [[Anatolia]]: ''Πόντιοι πρόσφυγες'' (''Pontioi prosfyges'', ''[[Pontic Greeks|Pontic refugees]]'') from the Black Sea coast, ''Καππαδόκες πρόσφυγες'' (''Kappadokes prosfyges'', ''[[Cappadocian Greeks|Cappadocian refugees]]'') from central Turkey, '' Μικρασιάτες πρόσφυγες'' (''Mikrasiates prosfyges'', ''The refugees from Asia Minor''), to refer to the Greeks from the geographic area of the peninsula; special reference is made for the ''Refugees from Smyrna'' (''Oi prosfyges tis Smyrnis'', ''Πρόσφυγες της Σμύρνης''), since [[Smyrna]] was then the second largest Turkish city, and many of the affected Greeks lived there. The refugees from [[Eastern Thrace]] are also included.

==Historical background==

===Antiquity===
The eastern coast of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] was inhabited by Greeks as early as the 9th century BC. [[Aeolians|Aeolian]], [[Ionians|Ionian]] and [[Dorians|Dorian]] colonies were established from the [[Dardanelles]] to [[Caria]], with the most important being [[Miletus]], [[Phocaea]], [[Ephesus]] and [[Smyrna]]. The prominence of the Ionians gave to the region the name [[Ionia]]. The Greeks of Asia Minor contributed significantly in the [[History of Ancient Greece|ancient Greek history]], from the [[Ionian Revolt]], the [[Ionian League]] and the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], to the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] kingdoms of [[Pergamos]] and [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]]. The Ionians were the first Greek-speaking people that the Persians encountered, and the  [[Persian language|Persian]] name for Greece became ''Younan'' or ''Yunan'' (یونان), derived from the word "Ionia." The name spread throughout the Near East and Central Asia.

Following the spread of the [[Hellenistic civilization]] in the 3rd century BC, Greek became the [[lingua franca]] of Asia Minor, and by the fifth century AD, when the last of the Indo-European [[Anatolian languages|native languages of Anatolia]] ceased to be spoken, Greek became the sole spoken language of the natives of Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swain|first1=Simon|last2=Adams|first2=J. Maxwell|last3=Janse|first3=Mark|title=Bilingualism in Ancient Society: Language Contact and the Written Word|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|year=2002 |pages=246–266|isbn=0-19-924506-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine Empire===
After the founding of [[Constantinople]] by the first Christian Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] in 330, Asia Minor, the major part of the [[Greek East]], became the most important region of the [[Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]]. For the centuries to follow, the area was the main manpower and wheat source of the state. Numerous invasions and [[epidemics]] (especially the [[Plague of Justinian]]) devastated the area in various times. However, Asia Minor remained [[Population of the Byzantine Empire|densely populated]], compared to the rest of the [[Medieval period|Medieval]] world and held the bulk of the empire's Greek speaking orthodox Christian population. Thus, many renowned Greek-speaking figures who lived during this time were Asia Minor Greeks, including [[Saint Nicholas]] (270-343), [[John Chrysostomos]] (349-407), [[Isidore of Miletus]] (6th century), and [[Basilios Bessarion]] (1403-1472). The Greek speaking Christian population began to decline with the invasions of the Muslim [[Seljuq Turks]] in the 11th century. The establishment of the [[Seljuk Empire]] deprived the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] of a large part of Asia Minor. The [[Fall of Constantinople]] on May 29, 1453, and the subsequent fall in 1461 of the Greek [[Empire of Trebizond]], located along the eastern Black Sea coast, marked the end of Greek sovereignty in Asia Minor.

===Ottoman Empire===
The first centuries of the Ottoman rule were named ''The Dark centuries'' by the Greeks. The custom of the [[Janissaries]] and the various restrictions on the religious, economic and social lives of the non-Muslim inhabitants of the Empire constituted an imminent danger for the continuation of the Greek inhabitation of Asia Minor. Conditions were improved over the following centuries, but the Greeks remained in the lower caste status of [[Dhimmi]]. [[Islamization]] and gradual [[Turkification]] continued. The ideas of [[The Enlightenment]] and the subsequent [[Greek War of Independence]], raised the hopes of the Asia Minor Greeks for sovereignty. Many Greeks from Anatolia fought as revolutionaries and faced the retaliations of the [[Sultan]].

===20th Century===
The [[persecution]]s, [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], [[Population transfer|expulsion]]s, and [[death marches]] of the Asia Minor Greeks were renewed during the early 20th century by the [[Young Turk]] administration of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and during the subsequent revolution of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. The [[Ottoman Greeks|Ottoman Greek]] population was severely affected; its misfortunes became known as the [[Greek genocide|Greek Genocide]]. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during World War I, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] granted Greece, with the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], the administration of [[Eastern Thrace]] (apart from [[Constantinople]]) and the city of [[Smyrna]] and its environs. The Pontic Greeks attempted to establish their own republic, the [[Republic of Pontus]]. The defeat of the Greek army during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] led to what became known in Greece as the '''Asia Minor Catastrophe'''. A series of events, with the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] been their peak, ended the 3,000-year-old Greek presence in Asia Minor. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]], which was signed in 1923, anticipated the compulsory exchange of populations. The remaining [[Greek Orthodox]] population of Asia Minor and Eastern Thrace, as well as the Muslim population of Greece (the Greeks of Constantinople, [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]] and the Muslims of [[Western Thrace]] were excluded) were denaturalized from homelands of centuries or millennia.

==Population strength==
[[File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|thumb|200px|The archive document of 1914 Census of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Total population (sum of all [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]) was 20,975,345 and the Greek population before the [[Balkan wars]] were 2,833,370 (1909 census) was dropped to 1,792,206 (due to loss of lands to Greece) in 1914 census; published also by [[Stanford J. Shaw]].&lt;ref name="OttomanCencus1914"&gt;[[Stanford Jay Shaw]], Ezel Kural Shaw "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey" Cambridge University page 239-241&lt;/ref&gt;]]
1914 Ottoman census, which followed the 1909 census, showed a steep decrease of the Greek population by almost 1&amp;nbsp;million between these years due to lost of lands (with their population) to Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]]. The argument that Greeks constituted the majority of the population of Anatolia claimed by Greece during [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]] has been contested by a number of historians. In their book about the British foreign policy of World War I and post war years, Cedric James Lowe and Michael L. Dockrill argued that: ''Greek claims were at best debatable, [they were] perhaps a bare majority, more likely a large minority in the [[Smyrna Vilayet]], which lay in an overwhelmingly Turkish Anatolia.'' &lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Foreign Policies of the Great Powers|date=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415265973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DEYNKvzs14IC|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimations of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]], the Greek state and various Western sources, place their number much higher. The number of Greeks excluded from the population exchange was about 300,000 (270,000 living in [[Istanbul]]&lt;ref name="hri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/bilateral/minority.htm |title=The Greek minority of Turkey|publisher=hri.org|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;). There are not exact figures of the refugee population in Greece.

The first national Greek census after 1923, conducted in 1928, showed the number of the Greeks of Asia Minor origin to be 1,164,267 (probably over 3&amp;nbsp;million).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Some refugees had moved to [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and the Middle East in previous years. Approximately 250,000 [[Greek American]]s of Asia Minor descent had emigrated to the United States between 1866 and 1917, had [[American citizenship]], and thereby would not become refugees; they would, however, be deprived from their property rights in their ancestral homeland, as well as from their right to return. It is usually estimated that the refugees in Greece numbered approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people. Descendants of the refugees took part in the great Greek migrations of the [[Interwar]] period, as well as the large immigrations to the United States, Australia and Germany in the 1960s-1970s. Today, about 40% of the population of Greece claims full or partial descent from the Asia Minor refugees; as does an almost equal percentage of [[Greek diaspora|diasporan Greeks]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The core of the refugee population settled in [[Attica]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. The official refugee population per [[Administrative regions of Greece|region]] in 1928 was as follows (number of refugees and percent of the refugee population):&lt;ref name="greek-language"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/corpora/pi/content.html?c=9&amp;t=3,3997 |title=Διδακτικά Βιβλία του Παιδαγωγικού Ινστιτούτου (Educational Institute of Greece)|language=Greek |publisher=greek-language.gr|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous suburbs, towns and villages were established to house the additional population of Greece, which rose by about 1/3 in just a few months. These areas are often named Nea (New) followed by the name of the Greek-speaking town or city in Asia Minor that its residents came from. In addition, to this day every town in Greece has a quarter named ''Προσφυγικά'', ''The Refugees' (quarter)''. These new settlements were usually named after the place of origin of their inhabitants:

==Positive effects==
The arrival of the Asia Minor Greeks resulted in the rise of the agricultural production of the state by 400%. The arable land increased by 55%. The [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] Government decided on February 14, 1923 to further divide the arable land of Greece, in order for the refugees and their descendants to be the owners of their own land. The income tax of the Greek state rose by about 400% within 4 years, mainly thanks to the refugees (from 319&amp;nbsp;million [[drachma]]s in 1923, to 1&amp;nbsp;billion and 173&amp;nbsp;million in 1927&lt;ref name="gnosi"&gt;[http://www.gnosi.gr/Project2001/DRIVA.htm Οι Πρόσφυγες] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205202434/http://www.gnosi.gr/Project2001/DRIVA.htm |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Greece managed to increase the homogeneity of the population, especially in [[Northern Greece]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]]). The urban population increased by far, resulting in the creation of the modern Greek metropolises of [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. New liberal ideas arrived along with the refugees, especially those coming from the cosmopolitan city of [[Smyrna]]. The influence of the refugees was particularly important in the [[Culture of Greece|cultural field]].

The Greek trade and the exchange rates pushed the Greek economy into a new era of industrialization and development, partly due to the arrival of thousands of ''cheap hands'', manpower of low cost. New industries were established in short time by the skilled refugee population (e.g. [[carpet]] industries). In addition, many of them became later successful ship-owners (e.g. [[Aristotle Onassis]]).

The Asia Minor Greeks became an inspiration for the native Greek population during the [[Interwar]] period, and fought along with their compatriots in World War II, as well, as they had an active role in the [[Greek Resistance]].

==Negative effects==
The Asia Minor Greeks constituted one of the wealthiest groups of the [[Greeks|ethnic Greeks]] anywhere. They held much of the economic life and the trade of Anatolia in their hands. Their expulsion led to the abandonment of thousands of factories and shops in the hands of the newly established [[Republic of Turkey]]. According to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], both states had the obligation to make reparations of the properties of the exchanged populations, an obligation that was never fulfilled, on the expense of mostly the Greek refugees (whose number was three times larger and were wealthier than the agricultural Muslim population of Greece). Unlike the Muslims of Greece, the Asia Minor Greeks were forced to leave without any of their possessions{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

Rather severe were the demographic changes of the Anatolian Greek population, as well as the changes in the [[demography]] of Greece herself. The [[Young Turks]] revolution, the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Asia Minor Expedition]] and subsequent Catastrophe, had as a result, apart from the 1.5&amp;nbsp;million refugees, the death of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;million ethnic Greek civilians (the most notable case being the [[Greek genocide]]) and the hostage of hundreds of thousands of Greek men, who were not allowed to leave Anatolia, but were sent to ''labor battalions'' after the war (it is estimated that as many as 150,000 Greek men from Smyrna were not allowed to go to Greece&lt;ref name="gnosi"/&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=January 2018}}). The demographic bleeding of the refugee population continued in Greece, where thousands of people (especially women and children) died of diseases. The diseases had also an impact on the native population of the country. Apart from malaria, which caused the death of tens of thousands, diseases that had not appeared in Greece for years ([[cholera]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]]) increased the already high mortality rates.

The problem of the housing of the refugees was the most imminent. Within the first ten days of October 1922, 50,000 Greeks mainly from [[Aivali]] arrived in [[Lesbos]], creating a huge humanitarian problem. During the years 1923–1928, the Greek state built 25,000 houses for the refugees. The ''[[Institute for the relief of the Refugees]]'' (ΕΑΠ, EAP) built another 27,000 houses (11,000 only in Attica). The same institute spent an  estimated 2,422,961 English pounds in order to house 165,000 refugees in Athens and Thessaloniki.

==Impact on the Greek psyche==
The Asia Minor Expedition and Catastrophe, as well as the uprooting of the ethnic Greek population from Anatolia after three thousand years of presence, had an enormous impact on the Greek psyche. The [[Great Fire of Smyrna|Smyrna Catastrophe]] has been considered as the worst incident of modern Greek history, and as an incident of the same magnitude as the [[Fall of Constantinople]] for the Greeks. The matters related to the refugees halted the Greco-Turkish relations for many decades. The issues concerning the missing Greeks were soon raised in the [[International Red Cross]], without any success and cooperation from the Turkish side. To this day, the Greek citizens who were born in Asia Minor have to apply for a visa in order to enter Turkey (something that does not apply to Greek citizens born in Greece).

The descendants of the refugees have found hundreds of organizations and institutes in Greece and in the diaspora to promote their civilization and to keep in touch with their roots. Various museums in Greece (such as the [[Benaki Museum]]) display artifacts from Asia Minor, Pontus, Cappadocia and Eastern Thrace to denote the Greek presence and emphasize the origins of about 40% of the population of modern Greece.

==Nobel Peace Prize nominations==
For its efforts concerning the relief of the refugees The [[Greek Red Cross]] (Croix-Rouge Hellénique) was nominated a total of 19 times from 1923 to 1930 for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]; 16 times in 1923, 2 in 1924 and 1 in 1930.&lt;ref name="nobelprize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?action=advsearch&amp;start=1&amp;key1=candcountry&amp;log1==&amp;string1=GR&amp;log10=&amp;log11=&amp;order1=year&amp;order2=nomname&amp;order3=cand1name|title=Nomination Database - Peace|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded in 1923 and 1924.&lt;ref name="nobelprize2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/|title=All Nobel Peace Prizes|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The Greek refugees and their tragedy was depicted in the [[Athens 2004#Closing Ceremony|Closing ceremony]] of the 2004 [[Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]].
*Various successful Greek singers have sung songs about the refugees and the Asia Minor Catastrophe (mainly [[Haris Alexiou]], [[George Dalaras]], [[Eleftheria Arvanitaki]], [[Nikos Xilouris]], [[Glykeria]]).
*The refugees have been the main theme of many Greek movies, since the 1920s, and especially during the ''Golden Age'' of the [[Greek cinema]] in the 1960s and 1970s.
*The film [[America, America]] by the renowned [[Cappadocian Greek]]-American director [[Elia Kazan]] presents the harsh situation and the uprooting of Asia Minor Greeks in the years preceding World War I.

'''Guy Stuart Ritchie''' (born 10 September 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 December 2000 |title=Madonna gets her Guy in Scotland |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1059145.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |access-date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b" /&gt; is an English filmmaker, businessman and occasional actor, known for his crime films. He left secondary school and got entry-level jobs in the film industry in the mid-1990s. Ritchie eventually went on to direct commercials. In 1995, he directed his first film, ''[[The Hard Case]]'', a 20-minute short that impressed investors who backed his first feature film, the crime comedy ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998). He then directed another crime comedy, ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' (2000). Ritchie's other films include ''[[Revolver (2005 film)|Revolver]]'' (2005), ''[[RocknRolla]]'' (2008), ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2009), and its sequel ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'' (2011).

==Early life==
Ritchie was born in [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]],&lt;ref name="b" /&gt; the second of two children of Amber (''[[née]]'' Parkinson) and Captain John Vivian Ritchie (b. 1928), former [[Seaforth Highlanders]] serviceman and advertising executive. John's father was Major Stewart Ritchie, who died in France, in 1940, during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hero in two world wars|url=http://www.harrymclaughlin.com/Flipbook/Album4Feb2013.html#p=54|accessdate=13 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113023648/http://www.harrymclaughlin.com/Flipbook/Album4Feb2013.html#p=54|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John's mother was Doris Margaretta McLaughlin (b. 1896), daughter of Vivian Guy McLaughlin (b. 1865) and Edith Martineau (b. 1866), the latter by whom she shares close common ancestors with [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/03/30/kate.middleton.ancestors/ Kate Middleton is related to Madonna's ex-husband] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209163141/http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/03/30/kate.middleton.ancestors/ |date=9 December 2015 }} by Jim Boulden, [[CNN]], edition.cnn.com. 30 March 2011.

In addition to his elder sister Tabitha, a dance instructor, Ritchie has a half-brother, Kevin Baynton, who was born to Amber Parkinson when she was a teenager and given up for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adoption-net.co.uk/news/2001/jan/010105guy.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420122526/http://www.adoption-net.co.uk/news/2001/jan/010105guy.htm |archivedate=20 April 2001 |date=5 January 2001 |title='My brother is Guy Ritchie'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directing career==
In 1998, Ritchie and his father contacted their friend [[Peter Morton]], of the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] chain, wondering if he had any potential investors for a debut film. Morton's nephew, [[Matthew Vaughn]], had been studying film production in Los Angeles. Peter informed Vaughn of Ritchie's new film idea, and Vaughn agreed to produce. Matthew, John, Guy and Peter asked their mutual acquaintance, [[Trudie Styler]], to invest in the production of Ritchie's second film production following his 1995 short ''[[The Hard Case]]'', which Styler had seen and decided that co-funding the project would be a worthwhile opportunity. The production of the film, ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'', was completed in about eight months. Released in Great Britain in 1998 to positive reviews, it became an international success. It starred [[Nick Moran]] and also introduced actors [[Jason Statham]], [[Jason Flemyng]] and [[Dexter Fletcher]] to worldwide audiences, while launching a new acting career for former footballer [[Vinnie Jones]]. Ritchie was introduced to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], whom he would later wed, when the soundtrack for the film was issued on her [[Maverick Records]] label. In 2000 Ritchie won an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Ritchie created and produced a spin-off television series called ''[[Lock, Stock...]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|243714|Lock, Stock... (2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritchie's second feature film, ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'', was released in 2000. Originally known as ''Diamonds'', it was another [[Caper film|caper]] comedy, this time backed by a major studio with a cast featuring such major Hollywood names as [[Brad Pitt]], [[Benicio del Toro]] and [[Dennis Farina]], along with the returning Statham and Vinnie Jones. Similar to ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' in featuring a complex and inventive storyline in which the characters weave in and out of each other's lives, the film also plays with time as Ritchie had employed to humorous effect in his first feature by depicting particular events from different characters' perspectives: a device which became something of a trademark through many of the director's subsequent films. It currently{{When|date=September 2018}} has a rating of 73% on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/snatch/ Snatch (2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311011619/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/snatch |date=11 March 2015}}.

Following his marriage to Madonna, Ritchie began focusing his filmmaking on his wife, directing her in both a music video (for the song "[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]", a controversial video that showed Madonna engaging in violent behaviour, directed at men, including [[side collision|T-boning a car]] with three men in it, tasering and robbing a man at an [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]], scratching a police car and shooting two officers with a water gun, driving her car through a group of men playing street hockey and incinerating a man by throwing a lighter into a pool of gasoline) and a short film, ''Star'', for the [[BMW films]] series. Ritchie's next film, also featuring Madonna, was a remake of the 1974 [[Lina Wertmüller]] hit ''[[Swept Away (1974 film)|Swept Away]]'' (also entitled ''[[Swept Away (2002 film)|Swept Away]]''). Ritchie cast Madonna as a rich, rude socialite who, after a shipwreck, is trapped on a deserted island with a slovenly Communist sailor who humiliates her. Ritchie renamed the woman Amber Leighton after his mother. This film was both a critical and commercial disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1116774-swept_away/ Swept Away (2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106155106/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1116774-swept_away/ |date=6 November 2015}}.

In 2002, Ritchie conceived a hidden camera show called ''[[Swag (TV series)|Swag]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 11 Guy Ritchie Moments |url=http://www.ugo.com/movies/guy-ritchie-cameraman-stabbed |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=18 August 2012 |date=13 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113024615/http://www.ugo.com/movies/guy-ritchie-cameraman-stabbed |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel Five]] in the UK, which turned the table on criminals and opportunists by using stunts to trap them in the act.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8488">'''Ibrahim Muhawi''' (born 1937, {{lang-ar|إبراهيم مهوي}}) is a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] academic and writer, specializing in Palestinian and Arabic literature, folklore and translation. He is a member of the [[Palestinian diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Diaspora" &gt;Ibrahim Muhawi,’Translation and the Palestinian Diaspora,’ in [[Abbas Shiblak]] (ed.), [http://www.ur105.ird.fr/IMG/pdf/Shiblak.pdf  ''Translation and the Palestinian Diaspora:Challenges of  Dual Identity and Adaptation,''] Institute of Jerusalem Studies, Refugee and Diaspora Studies, No.2, 6 May 2000 pp. 117-121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Muhawi was born in [[Ramallah]] in 1937 to a [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian Christian Arab family]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naher-osten.uni-muenchen.de/personen/ehemalige/muhawi/index.html Prof. Dr. Ibrahim Muhawi] Institut für den Nahen und Mittleren Osten 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and, after graduating from the [[Ramallah Friends Schools|Friends Boys' School]] in that city, he transferred to the United States in 1959, settling in  [[San Francisco]].where he gained a degree in [[electrical engineering]] at [[Heald College|Heald Engineering College]]. Drawn to literature in the meantime, he took out a B.A. in English (1964: [[magna cum laude]]) from [[California State University, East Bay|California State University]] at [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] , and went on to obtain an  M.A. (1966) and a Ph.D. (1969), in the same subject from the [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref name="Dundes" /&gt;

After a stint as English lecturer at [[Brock University]]. in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]] (1969-1975),   Muhawi took up a post at the [[University of Jordan]] in [[Amman]] (1975-1977), and then went to the [[West Bank]] to serve as chair of the department of English at [[Birzeit University]] (1978 to 1980).&lt;ref name="Dundes" &gt;[[Alan Dundes]],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfknLreIfkkC&amp;pg=PR11  Ibrahim Muhawi,Sharif Kanaana, [[Speak, Bird, Speak Again]] University of California Press,  1989 p.xi].&lt;/ref&gt; Courtesy Professor in the Comparative Literature
Program at the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1250%26context%3Dmarvels 'Fairy Tales, Printed Texts, and Oral Tellings,'] Marvels and Tales:Journal of Fairy-Tale Folklore, Vol.21,Wayne State University 1 Apr 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhawi is a world authority on the Palestinian poet [[Mahmoud Darwish]], and has translated both his memoir of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the poet's experience of house arrest, detentions in prison and interrogations by Israeli soldiers interrogators.&lt;ref name="Muhawi" &gt;Ibrahim Muhawi, [http://www.pen.org/dialogues-imaginary-partners 'Dialogues with Imaginary Partners,'] [[PEN American Center]] 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Palestinian diaspora (''shatat'')==
Muhawi notes that the [[Balfour Declaration]], with its outline of a policy of establishing a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine, referred to the actual historic majority of the population in purely negative terms: indigenous Palestinians were 'non-Jews', as the phrasing in the document, 'the existing non-Jewish population', shows.&lt;ref name="Diaspora" /&gt; The paradoxical consequence of this distinction was to transform the native inhabitants into a diaspora people in their own country. [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]] himself duplicated as an historical event what a tribal god, [[Yahweh]] had done for the mythical figure of [[Moses]]: on both occasions, real and imagined, an external authority, speaking in a tongue unknown to the autochthonous people, promised their land to another people.&lt;ref name="Diaspora" /&gt;  In addressing the [[Peel Commission]] in 1937, [[Winston Churchill]] was later to  dismissively liken Palestinian claims to their country as equal to those of a [[The Dog in the Manger|dog in a manger]]: though it might have resided there a long time, 'a higher grade of race' takes over the place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman G. Finkelstein]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vNb5VkyxDlYC&amp;pg=PA241 ''Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict,''] [[Verso Books]]  2003 pp-24-242 n.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill, Muhawi argues, was following a long line of earlier writers in dumbing down Palestinians to a bestial level,&lt;ref&gt;Ermete Pierotti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o342AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2 ''Customs and Traditions of Palestine Illustrating the Manners of the Ancient Hebrews,''] Cambridge: Deighton, Bell, 1864. p.2:’If any one, disposed to attribute to animals the possession of reason rather than instinct, were to travel through the length and breadth of Palestine, he would certainly find many arguments in favour of his theory, and perhaps would even come to the conclusion (not far from the truth) that the brutes were more intelligent than the men. I at least could not contradict him, as I have formd nearly the same opinion, after an intimate acquaintance with both the one and the other, during several years.’&lt;/ref&gt; and the tradition was still alive, with [[Menachem Begin]] likening Palestinians to cockroaches, and [[Golda Meir]] denying them out of existence.&lt;ref name="Diaspora" /&gt; The tradition of foreign narratives about Palestine is one wherein the actual realities, especially that of the Palestinian people, are wholly erased by a prior sacred tale, that of the Bible whose language becomes the only significant, and signifying reality, replacing reality itself. Palestine, as experienced by Palestinians, is no longer a place but rather:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a tablet; or rather it is a place only to the extent that it is a tablet upon which holy characters are scribbled. We, the people of Palestine, our customs and manners, are nothing more than representative scribbles on the
surface of this tablet.&lt;ref name="Diaspora" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Awards==
Muhawi's translation of Mahmoud Darwish's ''Journal of an Ordinary Grief.'' won the 2011 [[PEN Translation Prize]].

'''Iman Darweesh Al Hams''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic:]] {{lang|ar|ايمان درويش الهمص}}, also 'Iyman') (1991 – 5 October 2004) was a 13-year-old [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] girl killed by [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) fire near a military observation post in a "no-man's" zone near the [[Philadelphi Route]] on 5 October 2004, in [[Rafah]] in the [[Gaza Strip]].

The IDF commander of the soldiers who shot her was accused by his comrades and Palestinian witnesses of using automatic fire to deliberately shoot her repeatedly, a subject which was brought into investigation.&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli soldier indicted in girl's death: Officer repeatedly shot the wounded teenager|author=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=2007-11-30|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6556766/}}&lt;/ref&gt; During trial, he expressed no regret over his actions and said he would have done the same even if the girl was a 3-year-old.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/16/israel2|title=Not guilty.

==Overview of the incident==
Soldiers said they opened fire on the girl because they initially thought she was planting a bomb,&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; although the tape recording of the radio conversation between soldiers at the scene reveals that, from the beginning, she was identified as a child and at no point was a bomb spoken about nor was she described as a threat.&lt;ref name=Guardian2&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli officer: I was right to shoot 13-year old child|author=Chris McGreal|date=22 November 2004|accessdate=17 September 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1358173,00.html|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she was hit, soldiers claimed the unit's commanding officer went up to her and kept on shooting her,&lt;ref name=CTV&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel ends deadly Gaza offensive|author=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]]|date=15 October 2004|accessdate=29 November 2007|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20041015/palestinian_gaza_20041015/20041015/?hub=World&amp;subhub=PrintStory}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite their pleas to stop.&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli Suspended After Girl Shot|date=13 October 2004|accessdate=29 November 2007|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/14/world/main649340.shtml|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; No explosives or weapons were found on the girl's body.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaza girl death officer acquitted|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=15 November 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4440490.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A search of her bag revealed that it was filled with textbooks.&lt;ref name=Ynet&gt;{{cite web|title=Confirmed kill' case: Full acquittal|author=Hanan Greenberg|publisher=Ynetnews.com|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=17 September 2015|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3169693,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian witnesses===
According to Umar Abu Khalifa, 25, "Israeli soldiers stormed the area, the girl left the bag and tried to run. Bullets hit the (girl's) bag and then soldiers opened fire on the girl."&lt;ref name=Jazeera&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli troops probed for killing child|publisher=[[Al-Jazeera]]|date=13 October 2004|accessdate=2007-12-02|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=7032|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605042653/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=7032|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian witnesses reported that it was more than an hour before Israeli troops would allow medics to evacuate the body in an ambulance.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli probe Gaza girl shooting|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=2007-12-02|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3733638.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least fifteen bullets were found in the girl's body by Palestinian hospital officials.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli officer charged over slain Gaza girl|date=22 November 2004|accessdate=29 November 2007|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2004/11/22/israel-girl-shot041122.html|work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Mohammed al-Hams, who inspected the child's body told [[The Guardian]] newspaper that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"She has at least 17 bullets in several parts of the body, all along the chest, hands, arms, legs ... The bullets were large and shot from a close distance. The most serious injuries were to her head. She had three bullets in the head.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ehab Hams, an older brother of the slain girl, expressed his distrust of [[Israel]]i military justice: "We demand the prosecution of Iman's killer (but) we do not trust the Israeli judicial system."&lt;ref name=Jazeera/&gt; He added, "My sister was an innocent little girl."&lt;ref name=Jazeera/&gt;

===Israeli documentary and audio recording of internal communications===
A documentary screened nationwide on [[Ilana Dayan]]'s ''Uvda'' ("Fact") investigative program on Israel's [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] aired an audio recording of the internal communications between soldiers at the post at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name=carmel&gt;{{Cite news|last=Carmel|first=Asaf|title=Journalist Ilana Dayan, Channel 2 submit defense in Cpt. R. libel suit|work=Haaretz|accessdate=17 September 2015|date=2 July 2006|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=733743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Army Under Fire After Killing Girl|author=Ben Lynfield|publisher=''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''|date=26 November 2004|accessdate=2 December 2007|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1126/p07s01-wome.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the audio recording, the soldiers of the Givati Brigade identified the victim as "a girl, about 10 years old", describing her as looking "scared to death".&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt; Another soldier is heard saying, "Our forces are attacking her", and a lookout says "One of the positions has taken her down."&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt; The Givati Brigade company commander, Captain R., is then heard saying "We operated on her. Yes, it seems she has been hit." He later states that he "verified" the killing,&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt; and clarifies his actions by stating that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is commander. Anything that's mobile, that moves in the zone, even if it's a three-year-old, needs to be killed. Over."&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Israeli soldiers interviewed in the documentary, and whose anonymity was maintained, submitted that their commander had knowingly shot the girl in the head at close range and then emptied his magazine of bullets into her body to "confirm the kill."&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; One of the soldiers said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We saw her from a distance of 70 meters. She was fired at ... from the outpost. She fled and was wounded."&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The soldiers then explained how while Iman was lying wounded about 70 m from the Israeli guard post, the commander fired two bullets at her head from close range. They added that the commander returned to her body again, put his weapon on the automatic setting, and emptied his entire magazine into her body, disregarding their objections over the walkie-talkie.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt;

One of the soldiers said:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We couldn't believe what he had done. Our hearts ached for her. Just a 13-year-old girl ... How do you spray a girl from close range? He was hot for a long time to take out terrorists and shot the girl to relieve pressure."&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Investigations==

===First internal investigation===
On 11 October 2004, the [[BBC]] reported that Israel's top military prosecutor was investigating the army commander for repeatedly firing at the lifeless body of the young girl.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; The report stated that according to [[Haaretz]] newspaper, "confirming the kill" (i.e. shooting combatants at close range to make sure they are dead) goes against Israeli military regulations governing the rules of engagement.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/486981.html ''IDF probing if officer fired at already-wounded Gaza girl'']. Haaretz, 11 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October 2004, [[CBS]] reported that the army had suspended the officer during the investigation.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; On 15 October 2004, it was reported that the officer was cleared of responsibility in the shooting.&lt;ref name=CTV/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt;

The BBC reported that army officials had accepted the commander's claim that "he fired into the ground near the girl after coming under fire in a dangerous area," but that they did not explain why the officer shot into the ground rather than at the source of the fire.&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaza girl death officer cleared|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=15 October 2004|accessdate=2007-12-02|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3748054.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excerpts from the army statement read:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The investigation did not find that the company or the company commander had acted unethically ... The investigation concluded that the behaviour of the company commander from an ethical point of view does not warrant his removal from his position."&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The officer was nevertheless temporarily suspended due to his poor relations with the soldiers under his command and operational failures.&lt;ref name=CTV/&gt; It was further noted that a decision on his career in the army would be given by the end of the week.&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt;

Lt. Gen. [[Moshe Yaalon]], the army chief of staff, said repeatedly that the officer had acted properly under the circumstances.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt; The [[Israeli military police]] launched a separate investigation.&lt;ref name=Guardian4&gt;{{cite news|title=A schoolgirl riddled with bullets. And no one is to blame|author=Chris McGreal|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=2 December 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1332219,00.html|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second internal investigation===
On 18 November 2004, the Israeli army requested the family's permission to exhume Hams' body.&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news|title=Army wants to exhume body of Palestinian girl|author=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 November 2004|accessdate=29 November 2007|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/18/1100748148068.html?from=storylhs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier accusations made by the soldiers against their commanding officer of engaging in the outlawed practice of "verifying the kill" had regained currency.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that it was not known whether the girl was already dead or had merely been wounded before being repeatedly shot again.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; That same month, the army formally charged the officer with two counts of illegally using his weapon, and one count each of [[obstruction of justice]], conduct unbecoming an officer and improper use of authority.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;

Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon conceded that the first military investigation had been "a grave failure".&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|title=A Girl's Chilling Death in Gaza|author=Molly Moore|date=29 November 2004|accessdate=2 December 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16886-2004Nov27?language=printer|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment against the officer alleged that the first investigation was the subject of an attempted coverup.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;

===Military tribunal===
After the commencement of the [[military tribunal]], the al-Hams family and the [[Public Committee Against Torture in Israel]] (PCATI) petitioned the [[Israeli High Court of Justice]] in January 2005 to request that the investigation be turned over to civilian authorities.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Impunity: The Israeli Military's Failure to Investigate Wrongdoing|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=June 2005|volume=17|issue=7|accessdate=2 December 2007|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/iopt0605/1.htm#_ftnref7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court declined the request in February 2005.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Referred to in public only as Lieutenant R., (or Captain R.),&lt;ref name=PTR&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli officer released after witness recants|author=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=Pittsburg-Tribune Review|date=7 February 2005|accessdate=29 November 2007|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_301046.html}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the officer maintained that when he reached the girl's body, he came under fire from [[Palestinian militant]]s at least {{convert|300|yd}} away and shot at the ground to deter the fire.&lt;ref name=PTR/&gt; In an interview with the [[Associated Press]], an Israeli military official stated that a soldier in the observation tower claimed the officer's fire was aimed at the girl's body and could offer no explanation as to why the officer shot into the ground rather than at the source of the fire.&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt;

Lieutenant R. was released from custody in February 2005 after a key prosecution witness, another IDF lieutenant, who had told the military police investigation that he saw R. fire two individual bullets, followed by a volley, into Al-Hams' body, recanted his testimony under intensive cross examination. Earlier, another lookout also retracted parts of his initial testimony against R, attributed by human rights groups to heavy behind-the-scenes military pressure.
&lt;ref name=PTR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Harel]], [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=536795 ''Key witness: I lied in `confirm kill' case''], [[Haaretz]], 7 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Though Lieutenant R. had admitted firing two shots into the girl's body from close range to "verify the kill", he denied shooting subsequently.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; His lawyers, Yoav Meni and Elad Eisenberg, said the practice of "verifying the kill" was used regularly by the IDF to eliminate immediate threats.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

===Acquittal===
On 15 November 2005, a military tribunal acquitted Captain R., clearing him of all the charges against him.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Not guilty. The Israeli captain who emptied his rifle into a Palestinain schoolgirl|author=Chris McGreal|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=2 December 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1643504,00.html|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing the verdict, Captain R., burst into tears and turned to the public benches and said: "I told you I was innocent."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

Iman's father, Samir al-Hams, responded to the verdict by saying that from the outset there was no intention to hold the officer accountable:&lt;blockquote&gt;"They did not charge him with Iman's murder, only with small offences, and now they say he is innocent of those even though he shot my daughter so many times ... This was the cold-blooded murder of a girl. The soldier murdered her once and the court has murdered her again. What is the message? They are telling their soldiers to kill Palestinian children."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Palestinian National Authority]] condemned the verdict.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

===Military police investigation into first investigation===
In February 2006, Ha'aretz newspaper reported that a military police internal investigation found that there were major failures in the October 2004 investigation into the killing of al-Hams.&lt;ref name=DCIPAL&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquiry faults probe of Gaza girl's killing|author=Amos Harel|publisher=Defence for Children International-Palestine section|date=18 February 2006|accessdate=2007-12-02|url=http://www.dci-pal.org/english/display.cfm?DocId=462&amp;CategoryId=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704154542/http://www.dci-pal.org/english/display.cfm?DocId=462&amp;CategoryId=3|archivedate=4 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haar&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquiry faults probe of Gaza girl's killing|author=Amos Harel|publisher=Haaretz|date=17 February 2006|accessdate=20 September 2011|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/inquiry-faults-probe-of-gaza-girl-s-killing-1.180458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two reservist officers appointed by Military Police Commander Brigadier General [[Roni Benny]] to examine the military police's conduct during the investigation determined that investigators acted unprofessionally and with negligence.&lt;ref name=DCIPAL/&gt; The two officers criticized the decision not to appoint a special investigation team led by higher-ranking, more experienced officials and also noted that the incident was not appropriately documented by the investigation. The military police officer in charge of the investigation was reprimanded and the head of the investigation team was censured.&lt;ref name=DCIPAL/&gt;

===Compensation and promotion to rank of major===
Subsequent to his acquittal, Captain R. was promoted to the rank of major.&lt;ref name="DCIPAL"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't worry - it's just another Palestinian child's death|author=Leigh Brady|date=31 March 2006|publisher=Electronic Intifada|accessdate=2 December 2007|url=http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article4607.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, he received 82,000 [[New Israel Shekel]]s (roughly $17,000) to compensate him for the cost of his defense and time spent in jail.&lt;ref name=Zino&gt;{{Cite web|title=Court: Iman al-Hams death may have been prevented|author=Aviram Zino|date=July 1, 2007|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3349472,00.html|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain R. also filed a [[libel]] suit against Ilana Dayan and the Telad production company.
The district court accepted the suit and awarded him 300,000 shekels in damages. The decision was overturned in part by the Supreme Court, which ruled that Telad should pay only 100,000. The court ruled Dayan did not know that Captain R. was unaware that he was pursuing a child, and so should not be held liable for the news report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-202582510.html Details of incident and aftermath], highbeam.com; accessed 17 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further legal actions ==
In 2010 a Jerusalem district court found the claim that "Captain R." had shot Al Hams multiple times to "verify" her death, made by [[Ilana Dayan]] in her ''Uvda'' (Fact) TV show on [[Telad]], to be libelous, and required them to air a correction and for Telad to pay NIS 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143877.html|title=Does it pay to sue for libel in Israel?|date=January 21, 2010|publisher=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 decision by the Israeli Supreme Court acquitted Dayan and reduced the damages to NIS 100,000, finding that the statements were "correct at the time of their broadcast", based on honest belief, verified facts and credible sources. The court found that "Captain R" had been unaware that the death he was running out to verify had been that of a 13-year-old girl, but that Ilana Dayan was unaware of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Ilana-Dayan-acquitted-of-libeling-Captain-R|title=Ilana Dayan acquitted of libeling 'Captain R'|author=Joanna Paraszczuk|date=2012-02-08|publisher=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(TV series)|V.I.P.]]'' Under the [[Pseudonym|assumed name]] ''J.D. Athens'', he wrote and directed ''[[Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death]]'' and ''[[Pizza Man]]''.&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/profiles/people/main/30931/J.F.+Lawton.html?dataSet=1&amp;query=j+f+lawton|title=J. F. Lawton|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lawton was born in [[Riverside, California]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; He is the son of author and novelist [[Harry Lawton]] and Georgeann Leona Lawton (née Honegger), a pianist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tcm.com:80/tcmdb/participant.jsp?participantId=110043%7C0&amp;afiPersonalNameId=null|title=Biography for J. F. Lawton|publisher=TCMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple met in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] while attending the [[University of California]]. They later moved to [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], where Harry was hired as a reporter for [[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Press-Enterprise]].

As a child, he suffered from severe [[dyslexia]] making school life very difficult. It took him many years of practice and hard work to control his learning disabilities.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/deorllewin/safle/abertawe/pages/j_f_lawton.shtml|title=J. F. Lawton|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the challenge, he decided to become a writer like his father. [[Harry Lawton]] made sure to give him as much incentive as possible. To this day Lawton credits his father for always being supportive of him, and his mother for going the extra mile to help him overcome his obstacles.

When Lawton was still in elementary school, his father's novel, ''Willie Boy: A Desert Manhunt'',&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; was made into a film starring [[Robert Redford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173EA22CAA494CC2B779958D6896|author=Roger Greenspan  |date=December 19, 1969|title=Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the making of ''[[Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here]]'', [[Harry Lawton]] would take J.F. to the set, exposing him to the process of filmmaking. From that moment on, fascinated, he determined that he would become a screenwriter. Always curious, Lawton would observe his surroundings and write about them, although due to his dyslexia, it would take him double the time to put his stories down on paper.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

In high school, he continued to write short stories, plays, and scripts. After graduating from [[John W. North High School]] in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], he enrolled at [[California State University]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] to study filmmaking.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; There he wrote, directed and edited two short films, ''The Artist'' and ''Renaissance''.&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; The first was a futuristic thriller placed in which the main character kills his victims, takes their pictures and puts them in his art exhibitions. The second, ''Renaissance'', was a short horror film in which a sadistic sexual predator, dominates and kills his victim every night, but revives her the next morning only to start the cycle all over again. Both shorts won awards on the college circuit.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

==Career==
===1980s===
After college, the California native moved to Los Angeles, settling near [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]], one of the toughest areas of Los Angeles at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-04-28/news/pirates-pimps-artists-and-anarchy|author=Dan Kapelovitz  |date=April 28, 2005|title=Pirates, Pimps, Artists and Anarchy|publisher=LA Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living among prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, junkies and the homeless, the setting gave Lawton a wide range of inspiration for his stories.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/inside_pretty_woman_prHGec6DQgeak4vAIY8RVO|author=Larry Getlen  |date=March 23, 2010|title=Inside Pretty Woman|newspaper=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a number of screenplays while working at several post-production companies.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair Hollywood"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/pretty-woman-original-ending|author=Kate Erbland|date=March 23, 2015|title=The True Story of Pretty Woman's Original Dark Ending|publisher=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that time he met producer [[Charles Band]], for whom he would direct his first feature film. ''[[Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death]]'' is a take-off of both [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s feature ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''.&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; Shot in less than two weeks in his hometown of Riverside, the film starred his longtime friend, comedian [[Bill Maher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hbo.com/billmaher/|title=Real Time with Bill Maher|publisher=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rollingstone.com/politics/story/11128590/bill_maher_a_man_for_our_time/2 |author=Mark Binelli  |date=October 8, 2006|title=A Man for Our Time|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playboy Playmate [[Shannon Tweed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hollywood.com/celebrity/Shannon_Tweed/197396#fullBio|title=Shannon Tweed|publisher=Hollywood.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and horror actoress [[Adrienne Barbeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allmovie.com/artist/adrienne-barbeau-3815|title=Adrianne Barbeau|publisher=Allmovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a cult favorite and late-night cable staple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://film.com/celebrities/j-f-lawton/14645502|title=J. F. Lawton Bio|publisher=Film.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''[[Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death]]'', Lawton also wrote and directed ''[[Pizza Man]]'', a political satire about a delivery man investigating a comical government conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/profiles/Film/main/126414/Pizza+Man.html?dataSet=1&amp;query=j+f+lawton|title=Pizza Man|publisher=Variety Magazine|accessdate=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talk show host Bill Maher also stars in ''[[Pizza Man]]'', along with comedian [[Annabelle Gurwitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/119268/Pizza-Man/overview|title=Pizza Man (1992)|publisher=The New York Times | first=Robin | last=Pogrebin | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both movies, he used the pseudonym J.D.

Lawton was given an executive producer credit for his next original screenplay, ''[[Under Siege]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cinemax.com/apps/schedule/ScheduleServlet|title=Under Siege|publisher=Cinemax}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his million-dollar spec script ''Dreadnought''.&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/51719/Under-Siege/details|title=Under Siege|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came when Lawton, who had served time in the [[Coast Guard Reserve]], read that the Navy was retiring the {{USS|Missouri|BB-63}}. The film stars [[Steven Seagal]] as a disgraced Navy Seal working as a cook on a battleship. Seagal's character must face off against a psychopathic ex-[[CIA]] agent ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), who leads a group of mercenaries on a takeover of the battleship on its final voyage, so he can steal its arsenal of nuclear [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] Cruise Missiles. A successful sequel followed: ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]''.

With [[Barry Primus]], Lawton co-wrote  ''[[Mistress (1992 film)|Mistress]]'',&lt;ref name="Hollywood"/&gt; a comedy starring [[Robert De Niro]], [[Danny Aiello]], [[Christopher Walken]] and [[Martin Landau]].&lt;ref name=Mistress1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/07/movies/reviews-film-merrily-dealing-and-double-dealing-in-hollywood.html|author=Stephen Holden  |date=August 7, 1992|title=Mistress, Merrily Dealing and Double-Dealing in Hollywood|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is about a Hollywood screenwriter, Marvin Landisman, whose career is going downhill until he meets a has been hustler-producer who tries to help him get his career back.&lt;ref name="Mistress1"/&gt; Starring an all-star cast, ''[[Mistress (1992 film)|Mistress]]'' was one of the first films produced by [[Tribeca Productions]], [[Robert De Niro]]'s production company,&lt;ref name="Mistress1"/&gt; and it was released in the summer of 1992.

Lawton worked with radio host and media personality [[Howard Stern]] on the script for ''The Adventures of Fartman'', a fictional superhero character created by Stern for ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.&lt;ref name=HSS&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sirius.com/howard100|title=The Howard Stern Show|publisher=Sirius Satellite Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; With two major studios willing to produce, the movie was put into hold due to a [[MPAA Film Rating System]] dispute, as  Lawton and Stern felt the content of the film was better suited for a mature audience, and wanted an R-rating for the film instead of a PG-13 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978768-4,00.html|author=Richard Corliss; Jeffrey Ressner  |date=June 28, 1993|title=Hollywood's Summer: Just Kidding|newspaper=Time}} (Requires subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; The film was put on hold, and [[Howard Stern]] included a five-page Fartman story in comics form in his 1995 book, ''[[Miss America (book)|Miss America]]'', which was based on Lawton's script.

}}'''James Carr''' (September 9, 1777 – August 24, 1818), son of U.S. Congressman [[Francis Carr (District of Maine politician)|Francis Carr]], was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Maine]], then a District of [[Massachusetts]].

Carr was born in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] on September 9, 1777.  He attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy|Phillips Exeter]] and [[Byfield Academy|Byfield]] Academies, and then went to sea as clerk on the U.S.S. Crescent. He served two years as secretary to the United States Consul at [[Algiers]]. He then joined his parents (who had migrated to [[Bangor, Maine]]), engaging in mercantile pursuits and serving as a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] (1806–1811) for the District of Maine.

Carr was elected as a Federalist to the [[Fourteenth United States Congress]] (1815–1817), the second person from Bangor to occupy that office (following his father).

Carr was drowned in the [[Ohio River]] on August 24, 1818.  While traveling with his family on a steamboat, his 9-year-old daughter Mary fell overboard just below [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and Carr entered the water in a failed attempt to save her.  Neither of their bodies were ever recovered, though a memorial to Carr was erected at Bangor's [[Mount Hope Cemetery, Bangor|Mount Hope Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Park Shutz, ''The Park Story: Some Descendants of Richard Park of Newton, Mass.'' (2001), pp. 161-164, 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr was married to Betsey Stelle Jarvis, who migrated to [[Illinois]] along with two brothers following the tragedy on the river. The Carrs remained a prominent mercantile and political family in Bangor despite James' death (see [[Francis Carr (District of Maine politician)|Francis Carr]]).

Acquaintances say that Loughner's personality had changed markedly in the years prior to the shooting, a period during which he was also abusing alcohol and drugs. He had been suspended from [[Pima Community College]] in September 2010 because of his bizarre behavior and disruptions in classes and the library. After his arrest, two medical evaluations diagnosed Loughner with [[paranoid]] [[schizophrenia]] and ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He was placed on medication while in jail, as part of his treatment. He was again judged incompetent in May 2012.

In August 2012, Loughner was judged competent to stand trial, and at the hearing, he pleaded guilty to 19 counts. In November 2012, he was sentenced to life plus 140 years in federal prison.

==Personal background==
Jared Lee Loughner is the only child of Randy and Amy (née Totman) Loughner.&lt;ref name="Quinones20110110" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berger2011-01-10-a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cizmar2011-01-10" /&gt; They were described by a neighbor as a very private family.&lt;ref name="Quinones20110110" /&gt; Amy Loughner worked for the City Parks Department. Randy Loughner was a retired gasoline truck driver, but journalists did not determine if he worked outside the house at the time of the shooting. While Loughner had friends in high school, neighbors noted that in the following years, he kept more to himself and rarely spoke to others.&lt;ref name="Berger2011-01-10-b" /&gt;

===Behavior change===
Loughner attended [[Mountain View High School (Pima County, Arizona)|Mountain View High School]], and [[High school dropouts in the United States|dropped out]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="Berger2011-01-10-a"/&gt; Around this time, when he was about eighteen years old, those who knew him noted a change in his personality. Kelsey Hawkes, who dated Loughner for several months in high school, later said she was shocked after hearing of his arrest. "I've always known him as the sweet, caring Jared," said Hawkes, 21, then a student at the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref name="USA-Today2011-01-10"/&gt;

At some point, Loughner was fired from his job at a [[Quiznos]] restaurant, with his manager saying he had undergone a personality transformation. After this, Loughner briefly volunteered at a local [[animal shelter]], walking dogs, but he was eventually asked not to return. The shelter manager later said, "He was walking dogs in an area we didn't want dogs walked...he didn't understand or comprehend what the supervisor was trying to tell him. He was just resistant to that information."&lt;ref name="Strauss2011-01-10" /&gt;

Loughner's former classmate and friend Tong Shan stated that her last encounter with Loughner was in October 2010, after he was suspended and dropped out of college and just before he purchased the semi-automatic handgun used in the massacre. She said that while Loughner was "anti-government," he never appeared violent, nor did he mention his plans to buy a gun.&lt;ref name="Abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/jared-lee-loughner-suspected-gabrielle-giffords-shooter-school/story?id=12575278 |title=Jared Loughner Radically Changed Before Alleged Shooting, Friend Says – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=January 9, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to court records, Loughner had two previous offenses:&lt;ref name="Swaine2011-01-08" /&gt; in October 2007, he was cited in Pima County for possession of [[drug paraphernalia]] and on October 13, 2008, he was charged after defacing a street sign in [[Marana, Arizona|Marana]], near Tucson (a charge that was dismissed following the completion of a diversion program in March 2009).&lt;ref name="Strauss2011-01-10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSNews2011-01-11" /&gt; The police report noted that he drew a stylized CX, which Laughner said were Christian symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasilogambros |first=Matt |url=http://www.thewire.com/politics/2011/01/what-we-know-about-jared-lee-loughner/21572/ |title=What We Know About Jared Lee Loughner |publisher=The Wire |date=2011-01-10 |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Substance use====
Zach Osler, a high-school classmate of Loughner's and his closest friend, indicated that Loughner's life began to unravel after his high-school girlfriend broke up with him. He began to [[alcoholism|abuse alcohol]] and other [[drug abuse|drugs]], including [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (marijuana), [[cocaine]], [[Psilocybin mushroom|psychedelic mushrooms]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' (a [[hallucinogen]] legal in Arizona).&lt;ref name="Banfield2011-01-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time-20110111-schools"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Thompson | first=Mark | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2041878,00.html | title=How Jared Loughner Changed: The View from His Schools | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=January 11, 2011 | accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After struggling with drugs for more than two years, Loughner gave up alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs in late 2008 and has not used since, according to one of his longtime friends.&lt;ref name="Baumann2011-01-10" /&gt; The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] confirmed that Loughner had been rejected as "unqualified" for service in 2008.&lt;ref name="MSNBC-20110108" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USArmyStatement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Steller20110108" /&gt; According to military sources, Loughner admitted to marijuana use on numerous occasions during the application process.&lt;ref name="Berger2011-01-10-a" /&gt;

Former classmate Caitie Parker remembers Loughner as a "pot head".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Glynnis MacNicol |url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-01-08/entertainment/30068235_1_giffords-sign-language-class-jared-loughner |title=Alleged Shooter Jared Loughner May Have Met Rep.

"I'm looking back at this [as] a 14–19 year old...who knows if any of us knew what for sure we were yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therelive.com/2011/01/who-is-jared-lee-loughner-caitie.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112080818/http://www.therelive.com/2011/01/who-is-jared-lee-loughner-caitie.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 12, 2011 |title=Who is Jared Lee Loughner?

In the months leading up to the shooting, Loughner's parents became increasingly alarmed at their son's behavior, at one point resorting to disabling his car every night in order to keep him at home. On one occasion, his father confiscated his shotgun and both parents urged him to get help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/27/justice/arizona-loughner-details/index.html?hpt=hp_c3|title=New details: Loughner's parents took gun, disabled car to keep him home|publisher=CNN| first1=Michael| last1=Martinez| first2=Chelsea| last2=Carter|date=March 27, 2013 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loughner also became obsessed with controlling what he perceived to be [[lucid dream]]s.&lt;ref name="Wright2011-01-11" /&gt;

====Suspension from college====
[[File:PimaCommunityCollege-WC.jpg|right|thumb|Loughner withdrew from [[Pima Community College]] after he was asked to obtain a [[mental health]] clearance.&lt;ref name="Anglen2010-10-07"/&gt;]]
From February to September 2010, while a student at Pima Community College, Loughner had five contacts with college police for classroom and library disruptions. Some of his teachers complained to the administration about his disruptions and bizarre behavior, as they thought it a sign of [[mental illness]] and feared what he might do. On September 29, 2010, college police also discovered a [[YouTube]] video shot by Loughner, in which his spoken commentary stated that the college was illegal according to the [[United States Constitution]]. He described his school as "one of the biggest scams in America".

The college decided to suspend Loughner and sent a letter to his parents, to consult with them and him together.&lt;ref name="LATimes-video" /&gt; The college told Loughner that if he wanted to return, he needed to resolve his [[code of conduct]] violations and obtain a [[mental health]] clearance (indicating, in the opinion of a mental health professional, that his presence did not constitute a danger to himself or others). On October 4, Loughner and his parents met with campus administrators and Loughner indicated he would withdraw from the college.&lt;ref name="Anglen2010-10-07" /&gt; During Loughner's time at Pima, a classmate said she worried that he might commit a [[school shooting]]. One of his teachers has claimed a similar suspicion after the Tucson shooting.&lt;ref name="dailymail2011-01-10" /&gt; He never submitted to a mental health evaluation and did not return to the college.

Several college classmates recalled an incident in which Loughner, during a class discussion, had mocked and laughed at a young woman who was describing her [[abortion]]. One classmate described Loughner's reaction as "wildly inappropriate".&lt;ref name="Abcnews.go.com"/&gt; {{nowrap|"(Loughner)}} started making comments about [[terrorism]] and laughing about killing the baby," former classmate Don Coorough recalled to [[ABC News]].&lt;ref name="Abcnews.go.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/8249293/Jared-Lee-Loughner-mentally-unstable-dropout-who-had-met-Gabrielle-Giffords-before.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Jon | last=Swaine | title=Jared Lee Loughner: 'mentally unstable dropout' who had met Gabrielle Giffords before | date=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another classmate, Lydian Ali, recalled that "a girl had written a poem about an abortion. It was very emotional and she was teary eyed and he said something about strapping a bomb to the fetus and making a baby bomb out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/11/nation/la-na-arizona-shooting-loughner-20110111 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Sam | last1=Quinones | first2=Molly | last2=Hennessy-Fiske | first3=Ashley | last3=Powers | title=A troubled mind in Tucson | date=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/12/132869053/Who-Is-Jared-Loughner |title=Jared Loughner: A Puzzle, Even Before Arizona Shooting |publisher=NPR |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/wpix-jared-loughner-mental-health,0,2480469.story?page=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728111256/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/wpix-jared-loughner-mental-health,0,2480469.story?page=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 28, 2012 |title=Jared Lee Loughner: Suspected Tucson shooter 'slowly spiraled into madness' – Page 3 |publisher=baltimoresun.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/wpix-jared-loughner-mental-health,0,1488232.story?page=3 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721182642/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/wpix-jared-loughner-mental-health,0,1488232.story?page=3 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-21 | work=Chicago Tribune | first1=Robin | last1=Abcarian | first2=Maeve | last2=Reston | first3=Molly | last3=Hennessy-Fiske | title=Suspected Tucson Shooter 'Slowly Spiraled Into Madness'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Costa|first1=Robert|title=Sebelius: Some Take Rhetoric as 'Call to Action'|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/257031/sebelius-some-take-rhetoric-call-action-robert-costa|accessdate=24 December 2015|publisher=National Review|date=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expressed views==

===Views on politics===
Records show that Loughner was registered as an [[Independent (voter)|independent]] and voted in 2006 and 2008, but not in 2010.&lt;ref name="Cillizza2011-01-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Political_Unit2011-01-10" /&gt;

Loughner's high-school friend Zach Osler said, "He did not watch TV; he disliked the news; he didn't listen to political radio; he didn't take sides; he wasn't on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]]; he wasn't on the [[Right-wing politics|Right]]."&lt;ref name="Banfield2011-01-12" /&gt;
A former classmate, Caitie Parker, who attended high school and college with Loughner, described his political views – prior to his 2007 personality transformation – as "left wing, quite liberal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09shooter.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Eric | last1=Lipton | first2=Charlie | last2=Savage | first3=Scott | last3=Shane | title=Arizona Suspect's Recent Acts Offer Hints of Alienation | date=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/10/loughners-meltdown-began-adulthood-near-say/ |title=Loughner's Meltdown Began In Adulthood, Those Near Him Say |publisher=Fox News |date=January 10, 2011 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tone of Loughner's online writings and videos from immediately before the attack were described by an [[opinion piece]] of [[The Guardian]] as "almost exclusively conservative and anti-government, with echoes of the [[populist]] campaigning of the [[Tea Party movement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/09/jared-lee-loughner-rightwing-rants |title= Jared Lee Loughner: erratic, disturbed and prone to rightwing rants  |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 9, 2011 |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Potok of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] said that Loughner's position that currency not backed by a [[gold standard|gold]] or [[silver standard]] is worthless was a "hallmark of the far right and the [[militia movement]]."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Kirk |last2=Kovaleski |first2=Serge F. |last3=Frosch |first3=Dan |last4=Lipton |first4=Eric |title=Suspect's Odd Behavior Caused Growing Alarm |newspaper=New York Times |date=2011-01-09 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/us/10shooter.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesse Walker]] of the [[American libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' expressed deep skepticism at the connections drawn by Potok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Jesse|title=Unpacking Jared Lee Loughner|url=http://reason.com/archives/2011/01/20/unpacking-jared-lee-loughner|work=Reason.com|date=20 January 2011|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the shooting, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] reviewed messages by Loughner, and concluded that there was a "disjointed theme that runs through Loughner's writings", which was a "distrust for and dislike of the government." It "manifested itself in various ways" – for instance, in the belief that the government used [[Language planning|the control of language]] and [[grammar]] to [[Newspeak|brainwash people]], the notion that the government was creating "infinite currency" without the backing of gold and silver, or the assertion that [[NASA]] was faking spaceflights.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

===Dislike for Gabrielle Giffords===
According to a former friend, Bryce Tierney, Loughner had expressed a longstanding dislike for Gabrielle Giffords. Tierney recalled that Loughner had often said that women should not hold positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/scocca/archive/2011/01/17/maybe-jared-loughner-was-a-bigot-after-all.aspx |first=Tom |last=Scocca |date=January 17, 2011 |title=Maybe Jared Loughner Was a Bigot, After All}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry2011-01-15" /&gt; He repeatedly derided Giffords as a "fake". This belief intensified after he attended her August 25, 2007 event when she did not, in his view, sufficiently answer his question: "What is government if words have no meaning?"&lt;ref name="Baumann2011-01-10" /&gt; Loughner kept Giffords' [[form letter]], which thanked him for attending the 2007 event, in the same box as an envelope which was scrawled with phrases like "die bitch" and "assassination plans have been made".&lt;ref name="CNN 01-13-11" /&gt; Zane Gutierrez, a friend, later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Loughner's anger would also "well up at the sight of [[United States President|President]] [[George W. Bush]], or in discussing what he considered to be the nefarious designs of government."&lt;ref name="Barry2011-01-15" /&gt;

===Conspiracy theories===
His friend Zach Osler noted that [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] had a profound effect on Loughner.&lt;ref name="CBSNews2011-01-11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herreras |first=Mari |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2011/10/14/occupy-tucson-starts-saturday-9-am-armory-park |title=Occupy Tucson Starts Saturday, 9 a.m., Armory Park &amp;#124; The Range: The Tucson Weekly's Daily Dispatch |publisher=Tucsonweekly.com |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[online message board|message board]] ''Above Top Secret'', which discusses conspiracy theories; members of the site did not respond warmly to posts believed to be from his account.&lt;ref name="Bosch2011-01-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fahrenthold2011-01-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Pima_County_Sheriff" /&gt; Loughner espoused [[9/11 conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks]],&lt;ref name="Barry2011-01-15" /&gt; the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], and believed in a [[2012 apocalypse]], among other controversial viewpoints. Reports appearing after the shooting noted similarities between the statements made by Loughner and those publicized by the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[conspiracy theorist]] [[David Wynn Miller]].&lt;ref name="JohnsonKirk2011-01-09"/&gt; The Anti-Defamation League's report also confirmed Loughner's longstanding interest in conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt;

===Views on religion===
Journalists had speculated that Loughner was [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] due to his attack on Rep. Giffords, who is Jewish, but the [[Anti-Defamation League]]'s analysis of the messages by Loughner found that he had a more generalized dislike of religion, and of government. A police report noted that he had previously been caught making graffiti associated with Christian anti-abortion groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hendley |first=Matthew |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/fbi-agent-said-jared-loughner-made-graffiti-used-by-christian-anti-abortion-groups-6645853 |title=FBI Agent Said Jared Loughner Made Graffiti Used by "Christian Anti-Abortion Groups" |newspaper=[[Phoenix New Times]] |date=2013-03-28 |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loughner has been described as an [[anti-theist]] by those who knew him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-jared-loughner-friends-reveal-alienation/ |title=Who is Jared Loughner?

In his "Final Thoughts" video, Loughner stated, "No, I don't trust in God!", in reference to the [[United States national motto]] printed on coins and paper currency, "[[In God We Trust]]". He expressed a dislike for all religions, and he was particularly critical of Christians.&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mozgovaya |first=Natasha |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/adl-analysis-claims-suspected-arizona-shooter-not-anti-semitic-1.336622 |title=ADL analysis claims suspected Arizona shooter not anti-Semitic – Israel News &amp;#124; Haaretz Daily Newspaper |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADL3"&gt;The Mindset of Jared Lee Loughner: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110114232701/http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/jared_lee_loughner.htm?Multi_page_sections=sHeading_4 Loughner and Religion], Retrieved August 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Range"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson |first=Dan |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2011/01/08/the-crazed-internet-rantings-of-jared-loughner |title=The Crazed Internet Rantings of Jared Loughner |publisher=tucsonweekly.com |date=January 8, 2011 |accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tucson shooting==
{{main|2011 Tucson shooting}}
[[File:Gabrielle Giffords shooting scene 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Roadside sign at the scene the day of the shooting.]]

===Preparation===
Loughner allegedly purchased the 9mm [[Glock pistol]] used in the shooting from a [[Sportsman's Warehouse]] in Tucson on November 30, 2010.&lt;ref name="Anglen2010-10-07" /&gt; The night before the shooting, at 2:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. he left a message on a friend's [[voicemail]] saying, "Hey man, it's Jared. Me and you had good times. Peace out. Later."&lt;ref name="Baumann2011-01-10" /&gt; In a [[MySpace]] post the morning of the shooting at 4:12&amp;nbsp;am, he wrote, "Goodbye friends. Please don't be mad at me. The literacy rate is below 5%. I haven't talked to one person who is literate. I want to make it out alive. The longest war in the history of the United States. Goodbye. I'm saddened with the current currency and job employment. I had a bully at school. Thank you. P.S. --[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|plead the fifth]]!"&lt;ref name="KGUN9" /&gt;

The MySpace page showed a close-up photo of a handgun sitting atop a document titled "United States History."&lt;ref name="Anglen2010-10-07" /&gt;

===Attack===
On January 8, 2011, at 7:04&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Mountain Time Zone|MST]], Loughner went to a [[Walmart]] store near the [[Foothills Mall (Arizona)|Foothills Mall]] to purchase ammunition, but left that store and completed his purchase at Walmart on North Cortaro Road at 7:28&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="Barry2011-01-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="msn-msnbc" /&gt; He was stopped by [[Arizona Game and Fish Department]] officer Alen Edward Forney at 7:34&amp;nbsp;a.m. for running a red light, but once the officer determined there were no outstanding warrants for Loughner, he was allowed to proceed to his destination with a warning to drive carefully.&lt;ref name="Banfield2011-01-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry2011-01-15" /&gt; Loughner took a taxi to a [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] supermarket location in [[Casas Adobes, Arizona|Casas Adobes]], where Rep. Giffords was holding a constituents meeting.&lt;ref name="Barry2011-01-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonKirk2011-01-10" /&gt; The shooting occurred at 10:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. MST.&lt;ref name="msnbclink" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winter20110109" /&gt;

Loughner opened fire on Giffords from close range, hitting her as well as numerous bystanders,&lt;ref name="msnbclink" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winter20110109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charges" /&gt; and killing six people.

==Arrest and legal proceedings==

===Arrest===
[[File:Jared Loughner sheriff's office.jpg|thumb|upright|This photo of a smiling Loughner, taken by the Pima County Sheriff's Office's forensic unit, saw widespread distribution via media outlets]]
Loughner was stopped by bystanders and was arrested by police, saying, "I plead [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Fifth]]," as he was taken into custody.&lt;ref name="Barry2011-01-15" /&gt; A photograph taken by the Pima County Sheriff's Office's forensic unit was released to the media on January 10, 2011&lt;ref name="TucsonSentinel-20110110-photo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Dylan |url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/011011_loughner_photo |title=Photo of accused gunman Jared Loughner released |newspaper=Tucson Sentinel |date=January 10, 2011 |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published on front pages nationwide. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described Loughner's expression in the photo as "smirking and creepy, with hollow eyes ablaze," while the art director for ''The New York Times'' said the photo was featured on the front page because it "was the picture of the day [...] it was intense and arresting. It invited you to look and study, and wonder."&lt;ref name="Farhi2011-01-12" /&gt;

===Charges and imprisonment===
Loughner was charged in federal court with one count of attempted [[assassination]] of a member of Congress, two counts of murder of a federal employee (Giffords' aide and Judge Roll), and two counts of attempting to murder a federal employee, based on his injury of two of Giffords' aides.&lt;ref name="FBI-Taylor-complaint2011-01-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charges" /&gt; He was [[indictment|indicted]] on three of the charges on January 19, 2011.&lt;ref name="MSNBC-20110119-indicts"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41155912/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |title=Grand jury indicts Arizona shooting suspect |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loughner was held without [[bail]] in the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Phoenix|Federal Correctional Institution at Phoenix]],&lt;ref name="ABC15-2011-01-09" /&gt; kept isolated from other inmates 23 hours a day and allowed out of his cell for  one hour a day to shower and exercise.&lt;ref name="WP-20110117-trial"&gt;{{cite news |last=Markon |first=Jerry |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/16/AR2011011604721.html |title=Federal court authorities plan to move trial of Tucson shooting suspect |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 2011, he was transferred to the [[United States Penitentiary Tucson|United States Penitentiary in Tucson]].&lt;ref name="BOP-locator" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prisontransfer"/&gt;

Attorney [[Judy Clarke]], a former federal [[public defender]] who in the past had represented suspects in several high-profile murder and terrorism cases, was appointed to represent Loughner in federal court.&lt;ref name="Hoffer20110111" /&gt; The entire federal judiciary of Arizona recused themselves from hearing the case because of their ties to fellow judge John Roll, who was killed.&lt;ref name="JohnsonKevin2011-01-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-20110112-lawyer" /&gt; Federal prosecutors opposed motions to move the case outside of Arizona because of pre-trial publicity.&lt;ref name="WP-20110117-trial" /&gt; At the direction of [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Appeals court]] [[Alex Kozinski|Chief Judge Kozinski]], the federal case was assigned to [[Larry Alan Burns]], a [[San Diego]]-based judge from the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|Southern District of California]].&lt;ref name="Reilly2011-01-12" /&gt;

Prosecutors representing [[Government of Arizona|the State of Arizona]], which has [[concurrent jurisdiction]] in the matter, announced they intended to file murder and attempted murder charges on behalf of the other victims, those who were not members of Congress or federal employees (although they could legally file charges on behalf of all the victims).  Arizona state prosecutors normally have ten days from the time a suspect is brought into custody to file charges, but time spent in federal custody does not count towards this limitation. Arizona law does not permit a verdict of "[[not guilty by reason of insanity]]", but does allow for a verdict of "guilty but insane."&lt;ref name="Sherman2011-01-11" /&gt;

===Initial pleading and additional charges===
On January 24, 2011, Loughner appeared at the [[Sandra Day O'Connor United States Courthouse|Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], before Judge Larry Alan Burns from San Diego.&lt;ref name="NPR-20110124"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bryan|first=Wright |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/01/25/133188453/loughner-pleads-not-guilty |title=Loughner Pleads 'Not Guilty' |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loughner, whose hair had partially regrown since his arrest, smiled while presented with the charges related to the shooting, including the attempted killing of Giffords and two of her aides. Loughner's attorney, [[Judy Clarke]], requested that Judge Burns select a plea on her client's behalf, to which a plea of not guilty was recorded. When Burns asked Clarke if Loughner understood the charges against him, she replied that they were "not raising that issue" at the time. She did not object to a request by prosecutors to have future hearings moved back to Tucson.&lt;ref name="LATimes-20110125-plea"&gt;{{cite news |last=Riccardi |first=Nicholas |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/25/nation/la-na-jared-loughner-20110125 |title=Not guilty plea is entered for Jared Loughner in Tucson attacks |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 25, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 2011, a federal grand jury indicted Loughner on additional charges of murder and attempted murder for a total of 49 counts.&lt;ref name="CNN-20110304-indicted"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Cratty | first=Carol | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/03/04/arizona.loughner/ | title=Alleged Tucson gunman indicted on 49 charges in shooting | publisher=CNN | date=March 4, 2011 | accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 9, 2011, Loughner pleaded not guilty to all 49 charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/jared-loughner-suspected-tucson-arizona-shooter-pleads-not-guilty/story?id=13097807|title=Jared Loughner Pleads Not Guilty to 49 Charges, Including Murder|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with lawyers===
On May 25, 2011, Judge Burns stated, "I got some letters declaring some conflict with his counsel...I intend to table them at this time. At such a point that his competency is restored, if he wants to bring up the matter of counsel, he can renew it then."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=court transcript, 2011-May-25|page=52|url=https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B5ZYXb_HdIQhdzhGQVVLQWhXRk0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge suppressed the letters from the court record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=docket report|url=https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B5ZYXb_HdIQhWDkwbEg0X0tHM1k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medico-legal proceedings===
On May 25, 2011, Judge Burns ruled Loughner was then incompetent to stand trial, based on two medical evaluations. Court proceedings were suspended while Loughner, who had been [[Diagnosis|diagnosed]] with [[paranoid]] [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref name="NYT25/05/11"/&gt; received [[psychiatric]] treatment at the psychiatric wing of the [[U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. He was scheduled to appear in court on September 21, 2011, but that hearing was delayed until September 28, 2011, when the judge reviewed whether he could understand the charges against him and could assist in his own defense. (Loughner's lawyers unsuccessfully objected to him appearing at the hearing.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iK2uRKzZF2itfdaFMkAolesKopSA?docId=83bdfd5def024c6f8bb511b99811dc16|title=APNewsbreak: Loughner wants to be at hearing|agency=Associated Press|date=September 21, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922201104/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iK2uRKzZF2itfdaFMkAolesKopSA?docId=83bdfd5def024c6f8bb511b99811dc16|archivedate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loughner disrupted the court hearing with an outburst, and was carried from the court room. According to ''The New York Times'', Loughner believed he succeeded in killing Giffords, and clashed with his lawyer when she informed him that the congresswoman had survived.&lt;ref name="NYT25/05/11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/us/26loughner.html|title=Suspect in Shooting of Giffords Ruled Unfit for Trial|first=Marc|last=Lacey|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was judged still incompetent to stand trial following medical evaluations and a hearing in May 2011.

====Forced medication rulings====
On June 26, 2011, Judge Burns ruled that prison doctors could [[Involuntary treatment|forcibly medicate]] Loughner with [[antipsychotic]] drugs in order to treat him to restore him to competency for trial.&lt;ref name="mgraham2011"&gt;Graham, Marty (June 29, 2011).

But, on July 12, 2011, a three-judge federal appeals panel from the Ninth Circuit ruled that Loughner could refuse anti-psychotic medication, since he "has not been convicted of a crime, is presumptively innocent and is therefore entitled to greater constitutional protections than a convicted inmate."&lt;ref name="order1"&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/07/12/11-10339_order.pdf USA v Jared Lee Loughner – Order July 12, 2011] – US Court of Appeals for the Ninth District {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125105321/http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/07/12/11-10339_order.pdf |date=January 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thompsons2011"&gt;Thompson, Scott (July 13, 2011).

A week after the ruling, prison medical authorities resumed forcible treatment of Loughner with the antipsychotic [[risperidone]], this time citing ''[[Washington v. Harper]]'' and stating the purpose of treatment was the need to control the danger he posed to himself and others in prison, rather than rendering him fit for trial.&lt;ref name="emergency2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111105171637/http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/07/21/11-10339_second_emergency_motion.pdf USA vs Loughner – Defence: Second Emergency Motion July 21, 2011 (p7)] – US Courts for the Ninth District&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44319262/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/doctors-ariz-shooting-suspect-still-not-competent-trial|title=Doctors: Ariz. shooting suspect still not competent for trial|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loughner's defense team submitted an emergency motion to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, claiming that this treatment was in violation of their ruling and seeking an immediate injunction to halt treatment.&lt;ref name=emergency2 /&gt; The request for an injunction was denied by the court, allowing treatment to continue pending a full hearing into the matter.&lt;ref name="order2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111105173950/http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/07/22/11-10339_order_dnyng_emrgnc_mtn.pdf ''USA v Loughner'': Order denying emergency motion for injunctive relief.

===Guilty plea and sentencing===
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2017}}
On August 7, 2012, Judge Burns found Loughner competent to stand trial based on medical evaluations. Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 counts at the hearing, which spared him the death penalty. The hearing began with Loughner listening calmly to testimony from Christina Pietz, Loughner's [[forensic psychologist]], who testified that he had displayed depressive symptoms in 2006 and was formally diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2011. Pietz said that she believed that, after having been forcibly medicated for more than a year, Loughner had expressed remorse and was a changed individual. She said that he was competent to stand trial and agree to a plea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/accused-tucson-shooter-mentally-fit-pleads-guilty/|title=Accused Tucson shooter mentally fit, pleads guilty|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing was set for November 15, 2012 at 10 a.m. local time. The sentence could not include the [[death penalty]], because the guilty plea bargain was made with an assurance that it would not be sought; Loughner under the law faced a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/gabrielle-giffords-confronts-shooter-jared-lee-loughner-in-court/2012/11/08/09968fe2-29c7-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html|title=Loughner faces victims in being sentenced to life in prison without parole|last=Ball|first=James|date=2012-11-08|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, retired [[NASA]] astronaut [[Mark Kelly]], U.S. Representative [[Ron Barber]], a former aide to Mrs. Giffords who was shot in the attack, [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]], and the [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|U.S. Attorney for Arizona]], [[John S.

By pleading guilty in the deal, Loughner automatically waived his right to any further appeals and [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure|cannot later alter his plea to an insanity plea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rule 11. Pleas {{!}} Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_11|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loughner must pay a [[restitution]] of $19 million, $1 million for each of the victims. He [[Civil asset forfeiture|forfeited the weapons he used in the incident]], and [[Son of Sam law#Lawsuits|any money earned from efforts to sell his story.]] Loughner calmly answered that he understood each charge, and signed his initials after each page of the agreement and shakily signed his name to it, dated August 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jared Loughner is found competent to stand trial|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/20120807tucson-shooting-loughner-court-hearing.html#ixzz22tHjm9PP|work=Arizona Republic|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/07/13163448-jared-loughner-pleads-guilty-to-tucson-shootings-avoids-death-penalty?lite|title=Jared Loughner pleads guilty to Tucson shootings, avoids death penalty – U.S. News|publisher=NBC News|date=August 7, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2012, Loughner appeared in front of [[U.S. District Court]] Judge [[Larry Alan Burns]] in a court in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. He was sentenced to serve seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years in prison [[Sentencing Act of 1987|without parole.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loughner sentenced to life in prison without parole|date=November 8, 2012|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/08/victims-enter-court-for-giffords-shooter-sentencing/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=Jared Lee Loughner sentenced to life in prison|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/gabrielle-giffords-confronts-shooter-jared-lee-loughner-in-court/2012/11/08/09968fe2-29c7-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Loughner sentenced to life for Arizona shootings|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/08/justice/arizona-loughner-sentencing/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 14, 2012|date=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santos|first=Fernanda|title=Gunman in Giffords Shooting Sentenced to 7 Life Terms|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/us/gunman-who-shot-giffords-to-be-sentenced.html?ref=jaredleeloughner&amp;_r=0|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he was convicted and sentenced in federal court, there was still a possibility that Loughner could be tried for murder and other crimes in [[Arizona]] court. Pima County Attorney Barbara LaWall declared later that afternoon that she would not prosecute Jared Loughner on behalf of the State of Arizona. LaWall explained that her decision would afford the victims and their families, as well as the community in Tucson and Pima County, an opportunity to move forward with their lives. She said that, after speaking and consulting personally with each of the surviving victims and with the family members of those killed, it was clear that they would not be benefitted by a State prosecution. Surviving victims and family members told LaWall that they are "completely satisfied with the federal prosecution", that "justice has been served", and that the federal sentence is "suitably severe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tucsonlocalmedia.com/news/article_f396fab0-29f3-11e2-9ec5-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Pima County Attorney won't prosecute Loughner - The Explorer: News |work=The Explorer |accessdate=September 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZpFstUz6?url=http://www.tucsonlocalmedia.com/news/article_f396fab0-29f3-11e2-9ec5-001a4bcf887a.html |archivedate=July 6, 2015 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--http://explorernews.com/news/article_f396fab0-29f3-11e2-9ec5-001a4bcf887a.html--&gt;

'''Jaroslav Hutka''' (born 21 April 1947 in [[Olomouc]]) is a Czech musician, composer, songwriter, and [[democracy]] and [[human rights]] activist. He was a signatory of [[Charter 77]] and the 2008 [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.praguedeclaration.org/ |title= Prague Declaration - Declaration Text |author= |date= 3 June 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Institute for Information on the Crimes of Communism]] |accessdate=28 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929021343/http://www.praguedeclaration.org/|archivedate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutka left [[Czechoslovakia]] in October 1978 due to persecution from the Communist authorities, and lived in exile in the [[Netherlands]]. After the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of communism in Czechoslovakia]] on 26 November 1989, he returned to his native country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://czechfolks.com/plus/2011/11/07/vladimir-cicha-starikovy-zapisky-15/ Vladimír Cícha: Staříkovy zápisky … (15)] 07.11.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Hutka was born on 21 April 1947 in Olomouc, Czechoslovakia. His family was forced into exile in 1952 due to their opposition to the communist regime,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memoryofnations.eu/witness/index/id/3589/page/10|title=Jaroslav Hutka (1947) - Biography|website=Memory of Nations|language=en|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were eventually ordered to return.

== Music career ==
In 1962, he began to study painting in Prague. He dropped out of school in 1966, and began performing music. Hutka and his friend Petr Kalandra were among the first to perform on [[Charles Bridge]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hutka co-founded the music group Saffrán, which was together until 1977.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The StB pressured Hutka and his wife Daniela to emigrate to the Netherlands.

After the Velvet Revolution, Hutka returned to the new Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zivotopis.osobnosti.cz/jaroslav-hutka.php|title=Jaroslav Hutka životopis|website=OSOBNOSTI.cz|language=cs|access-date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutka is still performing as a musician. He was interviewed by oral history organisation [[Post Bellum]] for their ''Stories of Our Neighbors'' project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24540">'''Joe Schriner''' (born March 3, 1955) is an [[Americans|American]] [[political activist]] and journalist. Schriner has run for [[President of the United States|the United States presidency]] in five consecutive election cycles spanning from 2000 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.starbeacon.com/archives/in-the-presidential-campaign-it-was-joe-the-plumber-in/article_83ec78a2-367c-54b6-852b-4c1e6bd8d3c2.html|title = In the 2008 presidential campaign it was Joe the Plumber.

Before becoming a [[perennial candidate]], Schriner spent a significant amount of time travelling across the United States and conducting ad hoc interviews with individuals he met. Schriner purports that these subjective experiences leave him better-informed about national social, political, and economic issues than experienced policymakers. He has been interviewed by numerous media outlets over the years and has spoken at various colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="College Talks"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/college-talks|title = College Talks|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schriner has been billed as "average Joe" in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nptelegraph.com/average-joe-runs-for-president/article_d217148f-d741-5f12-8363-e967d20b698b.html|title = "Average Joe" Runs for President |date = May 25, 2004|accessdate = September 12, 2015|publisher = The North Platte Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also sometimes referred to as "Joe the Painter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Joseph-Schriner/840536|title = Joe the painter running for president |date = March 5, 2010|accessdate = September 12, 2015|publisher = LaGrange Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently self-employed as a [[House painter and decorator|house painter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/#!making-a-living/c17zs|title = Making a Living |date = September 12, 2015|accessdate = September 12, 2015|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he is a [[Freelancer|free-lance writer]] for his hometown newspaper, ''The Bluffton News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.blufftonnews.com/node?page=1|title = Bluffton News (pen name: "Average Joe") multiple stories|date = September 17, 2005|accessdate = September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Joe Schriner was born on March 3, 1955, in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enc.slider.com/Enc/Joe_Schriner |title=Slider on Joseph Charles Schriner |date=2008 |accessdate=September 20, 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028170300/http://enc.slider.com/Enc/Joe_Schriner |archivedate=October 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he graduated from Bay Village High School, where he was the starting quarterback on the [[Football team|junior varsity football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/#!joe-the-qb/c1stc|title = Joe the Quarterback|date = September 12, 2015|accessdate = September 20, 2015|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schriner spent his freshman year at [[Bluffton University|Bluffton College]] in [[Ohio]]. After taking a year off from school to work, he transferred to [[Bowling Green State University]]. He majored in journalism, wrote for the [[Student newspaper|college newspaper]], and completed an [[internship]] as a [[Journalist|reporter]] on Ohio’s ''[[Troy Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/on-the-street|title = Troy Daily News article, 1977|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schriner earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[journalism]] from Bowling Green State University in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bgfalconmedia.com/university-alumnus-runs-for-united-states-president/article_e4fae654-4368-523e-bbf3-a4859a70ab51.html|title = University alumnus runs for United States President |date = September 23, 2003|accessdate = October 14, 2016|publisher = BG News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Schriner began his career as a [[Journalism|journalist]] after college for the ''[[Sandusky Register]]''. He was assigned as a bureau [[Journalist|reporter]] to cover [[Huron, Ohio]]. He wrote about the town government and issues facing the local school division, in addition to various human interest features. Schriner left the ''Register'' after two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/local-gov|title = Sandusky Register (Huron Bureau) article, 1978|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schriner then became a reporter for a new publication in [[Lorain, Ohio]] called ''The Metropolitan''. However, the publication was dissolved after eight months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/black-issues|title = The Metropolitan News (Toni Morrison article), 1982|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Schriner began working at a halfway house in [[Lorain, Ohio|Lorain]] as a [[mental health counselor|drug and alcoholism counselor]]. The halfway house was a 90-day treatment program run operated by the Lorain County Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (LCCADA). During the next two years, Schriner pursued seminar studies to become a certified drug and alcoholism counselor.&lt;ref name=counselor&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/joe-the-counselor|title = Lorain County Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse newsletter article, addendum note, 1985|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving this certification, he became an [[outpatient]] counselor (also with LCCADA), specializing in both individual and group counseling. Schriner eventually developed one of the first outpatient treatment models in the Midwest for "[[adult children of alcoholics]]".&lt;ref name=counselor /&gt; He later went into private practice in [[Cleveland]], specializing in [[Addiction|drug addiction]], [[alcoholism]], and [[Family therapy|addictive family system dynamics]] in the late 1980s.

== Cross country research ==
In 1990, Schriner phased out his private [[Counseling psychology|counseling]] practice and took to the roads of [[United States|America]] to begin extensive cross country research that would eventually lead to him running for president. He traveled some 100,000 miles from 1990 to 1998 interviewing people about a wide variety of issues.  Information from these interviews would then be plugged into extensive position papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/joes-cross-country-research|title = Cross Country Travels audio and text|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, he also became a "lay [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] speaker" talking in numerous churches throughout the country about such topics as: [[abortion]]; [[euthanasia]]; the [[Poverty|poor]]; [[environmental stewardship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/joe-as-a-lay-catholic-speaker|title = Joe as a Lay Catholic Speaker|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He believes in a [[Consistent life ethic|Consistent Life Ethic]] and a good deal of his political platform revolves around the  precepts of [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic Social Teaching]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholic.org/news/politics/story.php?id=28528|title = Catholic Online, Editorial: Not your Average Joe.

== Presidential campaigns ==
===2000===
Schriner declared to run for [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] the first time with a speech at the [[Liberty Bell]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, PA]], on April 30, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/e98/bios/president/main2.htm|title = Campaign 2000 candidate Party listings|accessdate = September 20, 2015|publisher = ''USA Today''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially declared as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, but then switched to [[Independent politician|independent]] after [[George W. Bush]] won the [[Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican Primaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Independent Presidential Candidate Supports Radical Change (The Digital Universe / Brigham Young University) |date = October 12, 2000 |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During that campaign, Schriner and his family were on the road 19 continuous months and traveled 20,000 campaign miles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/2000|title = Campaign Tours 2000|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family did a number of what they referred to as Americana Tour Routes: [[U.S. Route 66 in New Mexico|Old Route 66]]; the [[Old National Pike Milestones|Old National Pike]]; the [[Lewis and Clark Trail|Lewis &amp; Clark Trail]], to name a few.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For this campaign, they also did a 2,000-mile Back-to-Basics Tour through the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] on bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&amp;dat=20000719&amp;id=pDZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3FUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6938,1777490&amp;hl=en|title = Average Joe rides for president (The Luddington News)|date = July 19, 2000|accessdate = September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His travels for this campaign are chronicled in the book: ''Back Road to the White House''.

===2004===
Schriner ran again in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cadillacnews.com/news_story/?story_id=6840&amp;year=2003&amp;issue=20030616|title = Average Joe makes White House Bid |date = June 16, 2003|accessdate = September 20, 2015|publisher = Cadillac News}}&lt;/ref&gt; with him and his family logging some 40,000 campaign miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/2004|title = Tours of 2004 |accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They, again, did tours with Americana themes: the Country Music Highway; the "Black Belt Region" Tour; a "Coast-to-Coast" Tour. In addition, the Schriners campaigned heavily in [[Ohio]] this election, including a 1,300-mile [[Buckeye State|Buckeye]] Trail Tour.&lt;ref name=tour&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/tour-maps-cgl0|title = Joe’s Campaign Tour Overview|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hallmark of the campaign is doing regular, and impromptu, "back road stumping" on small town street corners, in diners and in village parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/stumping|title = Stumping |accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during this time he talked at the [[University of Dayton]], the [[University of Toledo]], and [[Greenville College]].&lt;ref name="College Talks"/&gt;

===2008 and 2012===
During these two campaigns, the Schriner family accumulatively traveled some 50,000 miles.&lt;ref name=tour /&gt; Besides the small town stumping, during this time Schriner also talked at [[Holy Cross College (Indiana)|Holy Cross College]], the [[University of Notre Dame]], [[LaGrange College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=University of Notre Dame Center for Social Concerns Talk Archive, this talk on: January 27, 2010 |url= http://www3.nd.edu/~socconcn//about/Archives.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925121642/http://www3.nd.edu/~socconcn//about/Archives.shtml |archivedate=September 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family also did an extended "[[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] [[Border]] Tour" looking at [[Immigration to the United States|Hispanic Immigration]] issues, as they traveled the [[San Joaquin Valley]] looking at [[Farmworker|farm worker]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/2006|title = Joe Tour Maps, 2006|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During part of these campaigns, the Schriners also moved to a hardscrabble area of [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] (just west of the inner city) to do outreach work with the [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Workers]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/joe-the-volunteer|title = Joe the Volunteer |accessdate = October 14, 2016 |website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between campaign tours, the Schriners lived in [[Cleveland]] for five years. Schriner wrote the book ''America’s Best Urban Neighborhood'' about the family’s experiences in Cleveland. After the Cleveland experience, the Schriners moved back to [[Bluffton, Ohio|Bluffton]] in 2011. Schriner has also written two books about Bluffton: ''America’s Best Town'' and ''America’s Best Town 2''. He writes that Bluffton has the "best quality of life" when it comes to such things as town [[Comrade|camaraderie]], [[Activism|civic activism]], [[outreach]] to the [[Poverty|poor]], [[environmental stewardship]], and downtown vibrancy. These are all qualities that he emphasizes in his [[Party platform|political platform]].&lt;ref name=positions&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/positions-ci8x|title = Joe’s positions|accessdate = October 14, 2016|website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 ===
In keeping with the [[Grassroots democracy|grassroots]] nature of Schriner’s campaign, he initially put up a campaign flier on a general store bulletin board in [[Beaverdam, Ohio]], in October 2014. Schriner subsequently declared his candidacy in a [[podcast]] on the home page of his official campaign [[website]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/declaration-speech |title = 2016 Declaration Speech by Joe Schriner |accessdate = October 14, 2016 |website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks his fifth consecutive run for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/2011/09/23/140701113/also-rans-what-drives-the-perennial-candidates |title = Also-Rans: What Drives The Perennial Candidates? |date = September 23, 2011 |accessdate = October 14, 2016 |publisher = NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schriner, a [[Journalism|journalist]], has traveled the country extensively, interviewing a wide variety of people for a comprehensive series of lengthy position papers on many topics of the day.&lt;ref name="positions"/&gt; The lynchpin of his campaign revolves around a "[[Consistent life ethic|Consistent Life Ethic]]" that sets him against [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], [[poverty]], [[global warming]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[violence]] on the streets and anything else that can end life prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.voteforjoe.com/life-issues |title = Life Issues |accessdate = October 14, 2016 |website = www.voteforjoe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schriner was one of the featured speakers at the Consistent Life 25th Anniversary Conference in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]] (March 9–11, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.consistent-life.org/confschedule.pdf |title = Consistent Life 25th Anniversary syllabus |accessdate = October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schriner has also repeatedly said that he and his wife Liz are running as "concerned parents" from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.myplainview.com/news/article_f3bcbd9a-6b8c-11df-87d6-001cc4c002e0.html |title = Presidential Candidate Makes Stop in Plainview |date = May 29, 2010 |accessdate = October 14, 2016 |publisher = Plainview Daily Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the 2016 election Schriner and his family moved to Steubenville, Ohio.&lt;ref name=nbcnews/&gt;

'''John the Iberian''' ({{lang-ka|იოანე}}, ''[[Ioane]]''; died {{circa|lk=no|1002}}) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[monk]], who is venerated as a [[saint]]. His name refers to the [[Caucasian Iberia]], not to the [[Iberian Peninsula|Spanish peninsula]], and he is also known as '''John the Georgian''', '''John the [[Hagiorite]]''', and '''John Iweron'''. A member of the Georgian nobility, he was married and served as a military commander.  However, he later became a monk in [[Bithynia]] and then traveled to [[Constantinople]] to rescue his son, [[Euthymius the Illuminator]] (''Euthymius Opplyseren'').  Euthymius had been held as a hostage by the emperor.

John and his son attracted many followers, so they both retired to the [[monastery]] of Saint Athanasius on [[Mount Athos]].  They founded [[Iviron monastery]] with the help of John’s brother-in-law, [[Tornikios|John Thornikos]], a retired general.  John served as the first abbot of Iviron.

'''Joseph Antonio Emidy''' (1775 – 23 April 1835) was a [[Guinea]]-born musician who was [[slavery|enslaved]] in early life, before becoming a notable and celebrated [[violin]]ist and [[composer]] in [[Cornwall]], [[South-West England]].

==Life==
Born in [[Guinea]], Emidy was sold into slavery as a child to [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Merchant|traders]] who took him to [[Brazil]] and later to [[Portugal]]. In Portugal, he became a [[virtuoso]] violinist in the Lisbon [[Opera]]. He was [[Impressment|press-ganged]] by British [[Admiral]] Sir [[Edward Pellew]] during the [[Napoleonic wars]] and spent the next four years as a ship's [[fiddler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.janeausten.co.uk/admiral-edward-pellew-the-true-history-of-this-most-novel-captain/ |title=Admiral Edward Pellew: The true history of this most novel Captain - Jane Austen Centre |first=Laura|last=Boyle |work=janeausten.co.uk |year=2013 |quote= |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Joseph Antonio Emidy.jpg|thumb|left|Early 19th-century sketch of the Truro Philharmonic Orchestra with Joseph Antonio Emidy]] 
In 1799, Emidy was abandoned in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. In Falmouth, he earned his living as a violinist and a [[teacher]]. He became the leader of the Truro [[Philharmonic Orchestra]], and went on to become one of the most celebrated and influential musical figures in early 19th-century Cornwall. He composed many works, including concertos and a symphony, but no known copies survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balh.co.uk/lhn/article.php?file=lhn-vol1iss83-6.xml Cornwall, musicians, history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111224310/http://www.balh.co.uk/lhn/article.php?file=lhn-vol1iss83-6.xml |date=11 November 2007 }} (British Association for Local History).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1802, he married Jane Hutchins, a local tradesman’s daughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5uze6D-uSugC&amp;pg=PA47 |title=Black Salt: Seafarers of African Descent on British Ships |first=Ray|last=Costello |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=2012 |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had eight children. They moved to [[Truro]] around 1815.

==Death==
[[File:DSCN1660EmidyGrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Gravestone of Joseph Antonio Emidy in Kenwyn Churchyard]]
He died in [[Truro]], Cornwall, and his grave is in [[Kenwyn]] churchyard.

Transcript of his gravestone reads: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;HERE LIE DEPOSITED The mortal remains of Mr Jos:h Antonia Emidy Who departed this life, On the 23:rd of April 1835 AGED 60 YEARS&lt;br&gt;

And sacred to whose memory This tribute of affection is erected By his surviving family.

He was native of PORTUGAL Which country he quit about forty years since and pursuing the Musical Profession, resided in Cornwall until the close of his earthly career.

Devoted to thy soul-inspiring strains, Sweet Music! Thee he hail'd his chief delight And with fond zeal that shunn'd nor toil nor pain His talent sear'd, and genius mark'd its flight In harmony he liv'd, in peace with all Took his departure from this world of woe, And here his rest, till the last Trumpet's call, Shall 'wake mankind to joys that endless flow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tributes==
On 24 March 2007, during a service at Kenwyn Church to mark the 200th anniversary of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|parliamentary abolition of the slave trade]] throughout the [[British Empire]], the life of Emidy was featured and some typical pieces of music from his time were played in tribute.

Emidy is the subject of a play by Dr [[Alan M. Kent]], ''The Tin Violin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bishbashboshproductions.co.uk/work/the-tin-violin-2012/ |title=The Tin Violin 2012 &amp;#124; Bish Bash Bosh Productions |first=Alan |last=Kent |work=bishbashboshproductions.co.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718155628/http://bishbashboshproductions.co.uk/work/the-tin-violin-2012/ |archivedate=18 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a carved wooden boss was erected in [[Truro Cathedral]] in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-33211440|title=Joseph Emidy: From slave fiddler to classical violinist|author=Miles Davis|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=21 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khalid Abdul Muhammad''' (born '''Harold Moore Jr.'''; January 12, 1948 – February 17, 2001) was an American [[black nationalist]] who came to prominence as a leader in the [[Nation of Islam]] and then the [[New Black Panther Party]]. After a racially inflammatory 1993 speech at [[Kean College]], Muhammad was condemned and removed from his position in the Nation of Islam by [[Louis Farrakhan]]. He was also censured by both Houses of the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/18/nyregion/ka-muhammad-53-dies-ex-official-of-nation-of-islam.html?ref=khalidabdulmuhammad | work=The New York Times | first=Jayson | last=Blair | title=K.A. Muhammad, 53, Dies; Ex-Official of Nation of Islam | date=February 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being removed from the Nation of Islam he served as the National Chairman of the [[New Black Panther Party]] until his death in 2001 from a [[brain aneurysm]]. Despite the controversy that followed him, his strong and unapologetic denunciations of [[white supremacy]] gained him the support of some in the black community.

Harold Moore Jr. was raised by his aunt, Carrie Moore Vann, in [[Houston, Texas]], where he attended Bruce Elementary School, E.O. Smith Junior High School, and all-black Phyllis Wheatley High School. After graduating high school, Moore went to [[Dillard University]] in [[Louisiana]], where he was known as Harold Vann, to pursue a degree in theological studies, but he did not graduate. At this time, he ministered at Sloan Memorial Methodist Church. In 1967, he was initiated into [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity (Theta Sigma chapter). Later, Moore transferred to [[Pepperdine University]] and earned his [[bachelor's degree]].

==Nation of Islam==
In 1970, while attending Dillard, Moore joined the Nation of Islam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; which was then under the leadership of [[Elijah Muhammad]]. He changed his name to Harold Smith or Harold X, then to Malik Rushaddin, became Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]]'s protégé, and was active as a recruiter within the organization. In 1978, Rushaddin was appointed Western Regional Minister of the Nation of Islam and leader of Mosque #27. In 1983, Minister Farrakhan named him Khalid after the Islamic general [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], a follower of the prophet Muhammad, calling him the Sword of Allah.

By 1984, Muhammad had become one of Louis Farrakhan's most trusted advisors in the Nation of Islam. He traveled to Libya on a fund-raising trip, where he became well acquainted with that country's leader, [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]. Muhammad's dedication to Farrakhan and to the message of the NOI eventually secured him the title of national spokesman and he was named one of Louis Farrakhan's friends in 1981. He served at Nation of Islam mosques in New York and Atlanta throughout the 1980s. A federal court convicted him in 1987 of mortgage fraud and sentenced him to nine months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/113381 |title=The Itinerant Incendiary |last=Smith |first=Vern E. |author2=Sarah Van Boven |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=September 14, 1998 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220154304/http://www.newsweek.com/id/113381 |archivedate=February 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his prison term he returned to the Nation, becoming Farrakhan's national advisor in 1991.

===1993 speech===

In 1993, Muhammad gave a speech at [[Kean College]] in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union Township, New Jersey]], in which Muhammad referred to Jews as "bloodsuckers", labeled [[Pope John Paul II|the Pope]] a "no-good [[cracker (pejorative)|cracker]]", and advocated the murder of any and all white South Africans who would not leave the nation subsequent to a warning period of 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-02-18/news/0102180453_1_mr-muhammad-james-muhammad-minister-louis-farrakhan |title=Khalid Abdul Muhammad, 53, Fiery Ex-Aide for Farrakhan |first1=James |last1=Janega |first2=Noah |last2=Isackson |date=February 18, 2001 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=November 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2001/02/18/khalid-muhammad-dies-at-53/ac0d1a96-b2d0-4a80-a1af-cee4c7c5f0e0/ |title=Khalid Muhammad Dies at 53 |date=February 18, 2001 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=November 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the [[Book of John]] in the Bible to defend his statements against "so-called White Jews", saying that they crucified Jesus because he revealed them to be liars, and against "their father, the Devil".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The [[United States Senate]] voted 97–0 to censure Muhammad, and the [[United States House of Representatives]] in a special session passed a House Resolution. Farrakhan responded by publicly condemning Muhammad's speech.

==Aftermath==
Muhammad was silenced as a minister and left the NOI soon afterward. In 1994, Muhammad [http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=khallid+muhammad appeared on ''The Phil Donahue Show'']. He participated in heated arguments with Jewish audience members amid an explanation of his public statements.

Muhammad was shot by James Bess, a former NOI member, after he spoke at the [[University of California, Riverside]] on May 29, 1994. He survived the shooting. Many believed the shooting was a part of a conspiracy against Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Cokely, Steve; Muhammad, Khalid |title=Shooting of Khalid Muhammad, Tupac &amp; Biggie 6/6 |trans-title=|medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_bpxbVxGdg&amp;list=PLu3dHyvwbV6-7H1XeYhzTuNvCj6dehW2G |accessdate=April 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623071638/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_bpxbVxGdg&amp;list=PLu3dHyvwbV6-7H1XeYhzTuNvCj6dehW2G |archivedate=June 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Black Panther Party==
After being stripped of his position as NOI spokesman, Muhammad became the national chairman of the [[New Black Panther Party]]. On May 21, 1997, he delivered a heated speech at [[San Francisco State University]] in which he criticized Jews, whites, Catholics and homosexuals.

In 1998, Muhammad organized the "Million Youth March" in [[New York City]] which attracted an estimated 6,000 participants. The march was controversial from its inception as New York mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] denied the organizers a permit, calling it a hate march. A court ruled that the event could go on but scaled back its duration and size. At the conclusion of the rally, just as Muhammad appeared on the stage to speak, the demonstration was interrupted by a low-flying police helicopter. Muhammad alleges that was the signal for more than 3,000 police in riot gear, including some mounted on horseback, to come in and disperse the crowd. In response, Muhammad exhorted the rally participants to attack the oncoming police, to beat them with rails, and to shoot them with their own guns. Dozens were arrested, and 30 officers and five civilians were injured.&lt;ref name="Million Youth March Ends in Clash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samsloan.com/ap-mill.htm |title=Million Youth March Ends in Clash |accessdate=2009-05-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020429053930/http://samsloan.com/ap-mill.htm |archivedate=2002-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hunt for Khallid Abdul Muhammad|date=October 13, 1998|author=Noel, Peter|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/the-hunt-for-khallid-abdul-muhammad-6423386|work=[[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Giuliani said that the march turned out to be precisely what he predicted, "filled with hatred, horrible, awful, vicious, anti-Semitic and other anti-white rhetoric, as well as exhortations to kill people, murder people ... the speeches given today should not occur [at] any place."&lt;ref name="Million Youth March Ends in Clash"/&gt; In subsequent activism, Muhammad convened a second march in 1999.

In 2000, Muhammad's beliefs were introduced to a completely new demographic when it was revealed that one of the contestants on the [[United States|American]] version of the Dutch television show ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'', William Collins (Hiram Ashantee), was a follower of his. He also appeared in an episode of ''[[Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends]]''.

In 2001, Muhammad died suddenly of a [[brain aneurysm]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], at the age of 53. He was buried in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in [[Westchester County, New York]], near the grave of [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/khalid-buried-malcolm-x-article-1.910498 |title=Khalid Buried Near Malcolm X |first=Michael O. |last=Allen |date=February 25, 2001 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=December 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical influence ==
As a prominent [[Afrocentrist]] and speaker on African history, Muhammad attracted interest from several hip-hop artists, who sampled him in their songs. [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] quoted him in the introduction of its 1988 track "Night of the Living Baseheads," from the album ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Have you forgotten that once we were brought here, we were robbed of our name, robbed of our language. We lost our religion, our culture, our god ... and many of us, by the way we act, we even lost our minds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
[[Rage Against the Machine]] later paraphrased this quote in the lyrics of "Freedom" (''Rage Against the Machine'', 1992) with the line, "Brotha, did you forget your name?"

He also appeared on [[Ice Cube]]'s albums ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' (1991) and ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'' (1993) as a  guest rapper. On the former album, Muhammad appeared in the tracks "Death" and "The Birth". On the latter, he appeared in the song "Cave Bitch," a song ridiculing white women. On [[MC Ren]]'s 1996 album ''[[The Villain in Black]]'' Muhammad appeared in the track "Muhammad Speaks," where he spoke about the history of the rights of [[African-Americans]].

Musical references to Muhammad since his death include a quote of his "Kill the White Man" speech on [[The Used]]'s 2009 album ''[[Artwork (album)|Artwork]]'', a sample of his interview with Louis Theroux in the [[Chase &amp; Status]] song "Hocus Pocus", and excerpts from a recording of one of his speeches concerning Jesus in the [[D'Angelo]] song "1000 Deaths" on the 2014 album ''[[Black Messiah (album)|Black Messiah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering Dr. Khalid Muhammad: 5 Musical References You Probably Didn't Know|date=October 13, 1998|author=Shae Be Allah|url=http://thesource.com/2015/01/12/remembering-dr-khalid-muhammad-5-musical-references-you-probably-didnt-know/|work=The Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Muhammad had five children, including [[Farrah Gray]], who grew up in [[Chicago's South Side]] without their father present. Although Gray saw his father only during occasional visits, he credits Muhammad for inspiring him with confidence. Gray rose from poverty to become a successful business entrepreneur, but did not join his father's political activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Farrah (2012-11-11) [http://www.prlog.org/12020883-farrah-gray-talks-about-his-relationship-with-his-father-khallid-muhammad.html Press release]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Farrah (2004) ''Reallionaire''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Leonid Brezhnev series}}
The full understanding of the history of the late [[Soviet Union]] and of its successor, the [[Russian Federation]], requires the assessment of the '''legacy of Leonid Brezhnev''', the third [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) and twice [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]]. [[Leonid Brezhnev]] was the leader of the CPSU from 1964 until [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|his death]] in 1982, whose eighteen-year reign was recognised as the time of [[Era of Stagnation|social and economic stagnation in the late Soviet Union]].

Despite his failures in domestic reforms, his foreign affairs and defence policies consolidated the position of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) as a [[superpower]]. His popularity among the citizenry waned during his last years, and the Soviet people's belief in [[communism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]] slowly withered away but support still continued to be evident, even on the eve of his death. Following his death, political wrangling led to harsh criticism of both him and his family. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the last [[Soviet leader]], drew support from communists and the Soviet population by criticising Brezhnev's rule, and referred to his rule as the "[[Era of Stagnation]]".

Aside from the socio-economic stagnation Brezhnev left to the nation, there was also a heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a [[gerontocracy]], a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of [[economic stagnation|stagnation]]. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for [[Russia]].

==Immediate legacy==

{{further|Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Era of Stagnation}}
When [[Leonid Brezhnev]] died on 10 November 1982 [[Yuri Andropov]] was elected chairman of the committee in charge of managing his funeral. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of [[Soviet people|Soviet citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955057-3,00.html | title = The Soviets: Changing the Guard | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= 22 November 1982| accessdate = 23 January 2011 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[First World]] commentators saw this as proof that Andropov would become Brezhnev's successor as general secretary.{{sfn|White|2000|p=211}} The [[political corruption]] which had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure had become a major problem to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. In response Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Andropov believed that the [[Soviet economy]] would possibly recover if the [[Soviet Government]] was able to increase social discipline amongst workers.{{sfn|Service|2009|p=428}} Brezhnev's regime was also criticised for ideological laxness and self-indulgence. {{sfn|Service|2009|p=429}} The [[gerontocracy]] established by Brezhnev was slowly phased out by Andropov, and new recruits were appointed to the Party "centre", such as future Premier [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]] and Chief Ideologue [[Yegor Ligachev]].{{sfn|Service|2009|p=430}} [[Soviet foreign policy]] had also gone awry during Brezhnev's last years, and by June 1982, just before his death, [[Ronald Reagan]] classified the Soviet Union as an "[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]". This hardline diplomatic stance did not wither away before [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] initiated the "[[New Thinking]]".{{sfn|Service|2009|p=432}} Support for [[Marxism–Leninism]] continued to be evident amongst the [[Soviet people]], however, its base of support slowly withered during the Brezhnev Era. The Soviet people still remained wary of such concepts as [[liberal democracy]] and multi-party systems, and because of it, Marxism–Leninism remained the leading belief in the country.{{sfn|Kort|2010|p=357}} Due to the large military buildup of the 1960s the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a [[superpower]] during Brezhnev's rule.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=19}}

Brezhnev's family, [[Yuri Brezhnev|Yuri]], [[Galina Brezhneva|Galina]] and [[Yuri Churbanov]], were investigated and all, with the exception of Galina, were arrested on charges of political corruption during [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Geldern, James von | url = http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1980brezhnev&amp;Year=1980 | title = Our Little Father | publisher = Soviethistory.org | date =  | accessdate = 4 February 2011 | page =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722164638/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1980brezhnev&amp;Year=1980 | archivedate = 22 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law, was sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of large-scale embezzlement and corruption. By December 1988 Churbanov had been stripped of all state honours, and sent to a labour camp. Galina, along with the rest of Brezhnev's family, lost all their state privileges. The city of [[Naberezhnye Chelny|Brezhnev]] reverted to its old name Naberezhnye Chelny, and a group within the Soviet leadership wanted to rename all towns, street, factories and institutions bearing Brezhnev's name.{{sfn|White|1993|p=79}} This was actually carried through by the authorities in December 1988 when the Soviet Government issued a decree which stated all town, streets, factories, institutions and the like bearing Brezhnev's and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]'s were to revert to their former name.{{sfn|Staar|1991|p=42}} According to his grandson Andrei Brezhnev, the very name Brezhnev had become a curse for the family, and several family members had been forced out of their jobs and their friends had deserted them.{{sfn|White|1993|p=79}} Brezhnev, who had inflated his role in [[World War II]], was rescinded the [[Order of Victory]] on 21 September 1989 in a [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] convocation.{{sfn|Chaney|1996|p=263}}

During the Gorbachev Era, Brezhnev's rule was considered less successful than that of [[Joseph Stalin]]; in an opinion measurement poll only 7 percent chose the Brezhnev Era as good, while 10 percent picked the Stalin Era as good.{{sfn|White|1993|p=80}} Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s subsequent market reforms, many Russians viewed the Brezhnev era with [[nostalgia]]; they missed the stability of that era which had subsequently been lost during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras.{{sfn|Churbanov|2001|p=149}}

==Historical assessments==
Historians have expressed criticism for Brezhnev and his rule. The scholarly literature dealing with him is scarce and, with the exception of the period immediately after his death, overwhelmingly negative. Very little has been written about Brezhnev in [[English language|English]], and even [[Russian language|Russian]]. According to Mark Sandle and Edwin Bacon, the authors behind ''Brezhnev Reconsidered'', Brezhnev attracted little attention from the media due to a consensus that came shortly after his death, namely that his rule was primarily one of stagnation. When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the last [[Soviet leader]], initiated ''[[perestroika]]'' he blamed the degradation of the Soviet economic and political system on Brezhnev, and called his rule the "[[Era of Stagnation]]".{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=1}} Gorbachev claimed that Brezhnev followed "a fierce neo-Stalinist line",{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=2}} although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out to be, saying, "Brezhnev was nothing like the cartoon figure that is made of him now".{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=27}}

[[British people|British]] historian [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] wrote in his book, ''Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-First Century'', that "When he [Brezhnev] succeeded [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]], he was still a vigorous politician who expected to make the Party and government work more effectively. He had not been inactive; he had not been entirely inflexible. But his General Secretaryship had turned into a ceremonial reign that had brought communism into its deepest contempt since 1917." He added that it was "hard to feel very sorry for Brezhnev"; his socio-economic policies had sent the country into an Era of Stagnation from which his successors were never able to fully recover.{{sfn|Service|2009|p=427}} Talal Nizameddin states in his book ''Russia and the Middle East: Towards A New Foreign Policy'' that "Brezhnev's legacy, generally unaffected by his weak successors ([[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]), was entanglement in [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], tension with [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Japan]], as well as the prospect of a new dimension to the arms race with the United States in the form of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (Star Wars)."{{sfn|Nizameddin|1999|p=44}} According to historian David Dyker in his book ''The Soviet Union under Gorbachev: Prospects for Reform'' "Brezhnev left his successors a Soviet Union suffering from a host of domestic and foreign problems". The biggest obstacle, according to Dyker, was the weakness of the economy which had undermined Soviet influence outside its borders considerably during the late Brezhnev due to its relative technological backwardness.{{sfn|Dyker|1987|p=166}}

The author of ''The Soviet Paradox: External Expansion, Internal Decline'' [[Seweryn Bialer]] has a more mixed assessment of Brezhnev's reign. Bialer notes that the era was a time of "lost opportunities", but admits that the economic growth during Brezhnev's first years weakened "the rationale for radical reform". However, as Bialer notes in his book, even the gerontocracy which Brezhnev himself had created were disillusioned with Brezhnev's leadership when he died in 1982.{{sfn|Bialer|1986|pp=55–56}} In his book ''Russia's Transformation: Snapshots of a Crumbling System'' [[Robert Vincent Daniels]] argues that Brezhnev "gave the country stability, if nothing else, even though it was the stability of the [[police state]]", and that his domestic and external policies tried to ensure the "[[status quo]]".{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=46}} Daniels believes that Brezhnev's reign can be separated into two parts, the first, starting in 1964 and ending in 1975 conforms to a "status quo leadership, building the economy, pursuing [[détente]], and maintaining political equilibrium at home". The second phase, which began in 1975, was exactly the opposite; the economy stopped growing, the [[collective leadership]] ended with [[Nikolai Podgorny]]'s removal, Brezhnev developed a [[cult of personality]] and the Soviet Union itself started to stagnate.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|pp=49–50}} Historians Jiří Valenta and Frank Cibulka noted in their book ''Gorbachev's New Thinking and Third World Conflicts'' that Brezhnev's legacy was a "mixture of achievements and failures in both domestic and foreign policy". However, they argue that by the time of his death his failures had become severe chronic systematic problems. Brezhnev's main achievements, according to Valenta and Cibulka, was his foreign and defense policies, however, with the economy in decline these achievements were not durable in the long-run. They also note that the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower, which in turn increased their influence in non-communist [[Third World]] countries.{{sfn|Valenta|Cibulka|1990|pp=4–5}}

On a positive note, Ian Thatcher argues that "[r]ather than deserving a reputation as the most vilified of all Soviet leaders, Brezhnev should be praised as one of the most successful exponents of the art of Soviet politics." He argues that Brezhnev was a good politician within the framework of the Soviet political system.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=207}}  [[Dmitry Peskov]] said "Brezhnev wasn’t a minus for the history of our country, he was a huge plus, he laid a foundation for the country’s economics and agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9880373|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher= Guardian News and Media|title= Putin's spokesman praises Soviet leader Brezhnev|author=[[Staff writer]]|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=5 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archie Brown]] wrote in his book, ''The Rise &amp; Fall of Communism'', that "From the point of view of Communist rulers, the Brezhnev era was in many ways successful." Brown adds that the Soviet Union reached "rough parity with the United States" militarily by the early 1970s, and became a [[superpower]] in the military sense of the world.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=415}} According to Brown "The Brezhnev era was a time when tens of millions of Soviet citizens lived a peaceful and predictable life than hitherto" and where "Most people did not live in fear of the [[KGB]]."{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=416}}

==Opinion polls==
[[File:Brezhnev plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Brezhnev commemorative plaque donated to the Haus am [[Checkpoint Charlie]] in Berlin, Germany]]
Brezhnev has fared well in Russian opinion polls when compared to his successors and predecessors. However, in the West he is most commonly remembered for starting the economic stagnation which triggered the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=6}} A 2000 poll by [[VCIOM|VTsIOM]] asked various Russians the question "Was a given period more positive or more negative for the country?". 36 percent of the people polled viewed Brezhnev's tenure as more positive than negative. His predecessor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] trailed close behind him, earning 33 percent.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=4}} A poll by the [[Russian Public Opinion Research Center|Public Opinion Fund]] (VTsIOM) in September 1999 similarly chose the Brezhnev period as the time in the 20th century when "ordinary people lived best", having a clear majority of 51 to 10. In a similar poll done in 1994, Brezhnev garnered a majority of only 36 to 16.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=5}} According to a 2006 Public Opinion Fund poll, 61 percent of the Russian people viewed the Brezhnev era as good for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/14243/russians_satisfied_with_brezhnevs_tenure | title = Russians Satisfied with Brezhnev's Tenure | publisher = Angus-Reid.com | date =  | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | quote =  }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll by the VTsIOM in 2007 showed that the majority of Russians would choose to live during the Brezhnev era over any other period of 20th-century Russian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/2007/04/25/294470.html | script-title=ru:ВЦИОМ: Лучшие лидеры — Брежнев и Путин | publisher = Rosbalt.ru | language = Russian | date= 25 April 2007 | accessdate = 2 February 2011 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have noted a surge in Brezhnev's popularity, along with other communist rulers, during and in the aftermath of the [[Russian financial crisis of 1998]], which is well remembered by many Russians for plunging many into poverty. When comparing these two periods, Brezhnev's USSR is best remembered for stability in prices and income by the Russians and not the socio-economic stagnation for which he is remembered in the West.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=6}}

'''Nkosi Johnson''' (born '''Xolani Nkosi'''; {{birth date|df=yes|1989|2|4}}&amp;nbsp;– {{death date|df=yes|2001|6|1}}) was a [[South Africa]]n child with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], who made a powerful impact on public perceptions of the [[AIDS pandemic|pandemic]] and its effects before his death at the age of 12. He was ranked fifth amongst [[SABC3's Great South Africans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The 10 Greatest South Africans of all time | publisher = BizCommunity | date = 2004-09-27 | url = http://www.biz-community.com/Article.aspx?ai=4673&amp;c=11 | accessdate = 2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was the longest-surviving HIV-positive born child.&lt;ref name="About Nkosi"&gt;[http://www.nkosi.iafrica.com/contentPage.asp?pageID=5 About Nkosi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824034504/http://www.nkosi.iafrica.com/contentPage.asp?pageID=5 |date=24 August 2007 }} at [http://www.nkosi.iafrica.com/index.html Nkosi's Haven]. Retrieved on 2008-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkosi was born to Nonthlanthla Daphne Nkosi in a village near [[Dannhauser]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4195336 "One Boy's Heroism in the Face of Aids"] ''NPR.org'' [Retrieved 27 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; He never knew his father. Nkosi was HIV-positive from birth, and was legally [[adoption|adopted]] by Gail Johnson, a Johannesburg Public Relations practitioner, when his own mother, debilitated by the disease, was no longer able to care for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nkosi Johnson dies as he lived, a symbol of the tragedy of Aids |first=Mary|last=Braid | publisher = The Independent| date = 2001-06-02 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/nkosi-johnson-dies-as-he-lived-a-symbol-of-the-tragedy-of-aids-672533.html | accessdate = 2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Nkosi Johnson first came to public attention in 1997, when a primary school in the Johannesburg suburb of [[Melville, South Africa|Melville]] refused to accept him as a pupil because of his HIV-positive status. The incident caused a furor at the highest political level—South Africa's [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] forbids [[discrimination]] on the grounds of medical status—and the school later reversed its decision.

Nkosi's birth mother died of HIV/AIDS in the same year that he started school. His own condition steadily worsened over the years, although, with the help of medication and treatment, he was able to lead a fairly active life at school and at home.

Nkosi was the keynote speaker at the 13th [[International AIDS Conference]], where he encouraged people with HIV/AIDS to be open about the disease and to seek equal treatment. Nkosi finished his speech with the words:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkosi.iafrica.com/contentPage.asp?pageID=7 Nkosi's Speech] at [http://www.nkosi.iafrica.com/index.html Nkosi's Haven]. Retrieved on 2008-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Care for us and accept us&amp;nbsp;— we are all human beings. We are normal. We have hands. We have feet. We can walk, we can talk, we have needs just like everyone else&amp;nbsp;— don't be afraid of us&amp;nbsp;— we are all the same!"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Nelson Mandela]] referred to Nkosi as an "icon of the struggle for life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Profile: Mandela's magic touch | publisher = BBC | date = 2001-08-28 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1513244.stm | accessdate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his foster mother, Nkosi founded a refuge for HIV positive mothers and their children, [[Nkosi's Haven]], in [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name="About Nkosi"/&gt; In November 2005, Gail represented Nkosi when he posthumously received the [[International Children's Peace Prize]] from the hands of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://childrenspeaceprize.org/ICPP%202005%20Infosheet.pdf 2005 Infosheet International Children's Peace Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nkosi's Haven]] received a prize of US $100,000 from the [[KidsRights Foundation]].

Nkosi is buried at the [[Westpark Cemetery]] in Johannesburg.

He is the host of Radio Afrodicia, a radio show on [[KPFK]], a listener-sponsored radio station based in Los Angeles, California. With an audience of approximately 50,000 listeners weekly,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelstv.com/global/news_details.php?cat=Entertainment&amp;nid=24371&lt;/ref&gt; Moweta is the only African-born radio host in Los Angeles, California. In 2011, Moweta was featured on [[Reuters]] Africa Journal segment about African DJs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.since.szczytno.pl/videos/Africajournal&lt;/ref&gt;

Moweta is recognized by UCLA's ethnomusicology program as an expert in the field of African and African-influenced music—he has served as a panelist for UCLA's annual ethnomusicology conferences which attempt to educate the public about global arts and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fowler.ucla.edu/events/fowler-outspoken-panel-sonic-nigeria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/20035944/Africa-Meets-North-America&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Originally from Jos Plateau State Nigeria, Moweta grew up in Jos, Minna, Kano and Lagos. He speaks [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and Yoruba fluently and is [[Igbo people|Igbo]]. In 1978, Moweta came to the US to study film-making at the San Francisco Art Institute. He moved to Los Angeles in 1982 and established himself as a DJ, music supervisor, consultant, manager, and event promoter. In 1983, Moweta received a grant from the Department of Cultural Affairs in Los Angeles to host an eight-week segment about the origins of rap music. The program aired on KPFK that year and afterwards, Moweta was asked by KPFK to host a weekly show and subsequently, Radio Afrodicia began broadcasting on June 21, 1995.

== Career ==
=== Radio host ===
Moweta currently hosts Radio Afrodicia, which features both internationally-known and new musicians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kpfk.org/programs/41-afrodicia.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vpop.net/~kpfk/programs/program_AD.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Moweta has interviewed well-known artists such as [[Fela Kuti]], Seun Kuti, Femi Kuti, [[Baaba Maal]], [[Papa Wemba]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], Asa and Fally Ipupa. For over twenty years, Moweta has increased the US exposure of African artists such as Fela Kuti, [[King Sunny Adé]], Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe, [[Koffi Olomide]], and [[Nneka (singer)|Nneka]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/05/news/wk-out5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/26/19/culture2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Moweta said, "I've been doing this show for almost 15 years. The concept is bringing music from Africa into the Western world into the African world because music from Africa is pretty large and big. We live in a diverse city, Los Angeles; we have Cubans, you have Brazilians, you have Jamaicans you know." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelstv.com/global/news_details.php?cat=Entertainment&amp;nid=24371&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Afrodicia plays a blend of a wide range of African-influenced sounds including: [[Afro-beat]], Afro-Pop, Bachata, Soukous, Hi-Life, Rumba (Congolese and Cuban), Salsa (African and Latin American), Samba, and Soca. The show not only highlights musicians performing in all regions of Africa, but also features African musicians performing in other areas of the world and non-African musicians who draw upon African traditions for their musical inspiration.

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lacountyarts.org/temp/ford_sumseason_world.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival had a significant impact on the popularity of African music in Los Angeles, in that performers such as Papa Wemba steadily gained a U.S. following.&lt;ref&gt;http://soukous.com/Papa_Wemba/&lt;/ref&gt; International artists such as [[M'bilia Bel]], [[Kanda Bongo Man]], Papa Wemba, [[Diblo Dibala]], and Madilu System all were featured performers for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vpop.net/~kpfk/programs/program_AD.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/24/entertainment/ca-20370

'''Oliver Joseph St John Gogarty''' (17 August 1878 – 22 September 1957) was an Irish poet, author, [[otolaryngologist]], athlete, politician, and well-known conversationalist. He served as the inspiration for [[Buck Mulligan]] in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

==Life==

===Early life===
Gogarty was born 17 August 1878 in [[Parnell Square|Rutland Square]], Dublin, the eldest child of Henry Gogarty, a well-to-do Dublin physician, and Margaret Gogarty (née Oliver), the daughter of a [[Galway]] mill owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details-civil/7adc675723754|title=General Registrar's Office|last=|first=|date=|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|publisher=|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three siblings (Henry, Mary, and Richard) were born later.  Gogarty's father, himself the son of a medical doctor, had been educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] and owned two fashionable homes in Dublin, which set the Gogartys apart from other [[Irish Catholic]] families at that time and allowed them access to the same social circles as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 Gogarty's father died of a [[Appendicitis|burst appendix]], and Gogarty was sent to [[Mungret College]], a boarding school near [[Limerick]]. He was unhappy in his new school, and the following year he transferred to [[Stonyhurst College]] in Lancashire, England, which he liked little better, later referring to it as "a religious jail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= It Isn't This Time of Year at All! |last= Gogarty |first= Oliver |year= 1954 |publisher= Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. |location= New York |page= 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty returned to Ireland in 1896 and boarded at [[Clongowes Wood College]] while studying for examinations with the [[Royal University of Ireland]]. He was a talented athlete; in England he had briefly played for the [[Preston North End FC]] Reserve, and while at [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] he played for the [[Bohemian FC]].  He also played on Clongowes's soccer and [[cricket]] elevens.  His extracurricular interests, which also included cycling and drinking, prevented him from being an attentive student, and in 1898 he switched to the medical school at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], having failed eight of his ten [[examinations]] at the [[Royal University of Ireland|Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===University days===
As one of [[Dublin]]'s "[[medical student|medicos]]", Gogarty was known to be fond of public [[pranks]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; and midnight carousing in "the Kips", Dublin's red-light district.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; He had a talent for [[light poetry|humorous]] and [[ribaldry|bawdy verse]], which quickly made the rounds through the city, and sometimes composed [[mnemonic]] lyrics to aid his [[medical school|medical studies]].  He also enjoyed a highly successful cycling career before being banned from the tracks in 1901 for bad language, and between 1898 and 1901 he rescued at least four people from drowning.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 24–25, 39&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in [[Irish nationalism]] after meeting [[Arthur Griffith]] in 1899, and contributed propaganda pieces to ''[[United Irishman|The United Irishman]]'' over subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OSJGogarty1897.jpg|thumb|left|Gogarty in 1897]]

A serious interest in poetry and literature also began to manifest itself during his years at Trinity.  His witty conversation made him a favourite with the [[university don|dons]], particularly [[John Pentland Mahaffy]] (formerly the tutor of [[Oscar Wilde]]) and [[Robert Yelverton Tyrrell]], and between 1901 and 1903 he won three successive Vice-Chancellor's prizes for verse.  In 1900 he made the acquaintance of [[W. B. Yeats]] (of whom his mother highly approved) and of [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] (of whom she did not) and began to frequent [[Celtic revival|Dublin literary circles]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; He also formed close friendships with other up-and-coming young poets, such as [[Seamus O'Sullivan]] and [[James Joyce]].  In 1904 he spent two [[academic term|terms]] at [[Oxford]] to compete for the [[Newdigate Prize]], but lost to [[George Bell (bishop)|G.K.A. Bell]], the future [[Bishop of Chichester]], who became a friend and frequent correspondent over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp71-75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Joyce Martello Tower.jpg|thumb|right|The Tower in Sandycove]]

Upon returning to Dublin in the summer of 1904, Gogarty made arrangements to rent the famous [[James Joyce Tower|Martello Tower in Sandycove]].  The primary goal of this scheme, as described by Gogarty in a letter to G.K.A. Bell, was to "house the Bard" (i.e. James Joyce), who was without money and required "a year in which to finish his novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Many Lines to Thee |last= Carens |first= James |year= 1972 |publisher= Dolmen Press |location= Dublin |page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two friends quarrelled in August, however, and Joyce either failed to move in or left shortly after doing so.  Joyce briefly took up residence in the [[James Joyce Tower|Tower]] the following month, together with Gogarty and his Oxford friend Samuel Chenevix Trench (a setup which later provided inspiration for the opening chapter of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]])'' but left again suddenly after only six days.&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later in America, Gogarty would attribute Joyce's abrupt departure to his and S.C. Trench's midnight antics with a loaded [[revolver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mourning Became Mrs. Spendlove |last= Gogarty |first= Oliver |year= 1948 |publisher= Creative Age Press |location= New York |pages= 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce and Gogarty corresponded intermittently during the early years of Joyce's continental exile and occasionally planned meetings, but contemporaneous letters from Joyce to his brother reveal deep distrust of Gogarty's motives,&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 842&lt;/ref&gt; and their friendship was never fully renewed.  Gogarty made use of the Martello Tower during the following year as a writing retreat and party venue, and officially held the lease until 1925.

In 1904 and 1905 Gogarty published several short poems in the London publication ''The Venture'' and in [[William Kirkpatrick Magee|John Eglinton]]'s journal ''Dana''.&lt;ref&gt;Carens (1979) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; His name also appeared in print as the renegade priest Fr. Oliver Gogarty in George Moore's 1905 novel ''The Lake'', an occurrence which upset Gogarty's devout mother.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Gogarty became one of the founding members of [[Arthur Griffith]]'s [[Sinn Féin]], a [[nonviolent revolution|non-violent political movement]] with a plan for Irish autonomy modelled after the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical career and family===
[[File:Nollgogarty.jpg|thumb|right|Noll Gogarty, painted by [[William Orpen]]]]
In August 1906, Gogarty married Martha Duane, a girl from a landowning [[Connemara]] family.  Eager to establish himself with a profession, he passed his final medical examinations in June 1907, several months after the death of his mother.  In July 1907 his first son, Oliver Duane Odysseus Gogarty (known as "Noll") was born, and in autumn of that year Gogarty left for [[Vienna]] to finish the practical phase of his medical training.  Owing in part to the influence of his mentor, [[Robert Henry Woods|Sir Robert Woods]], Gogarty had decided to specialise in [[otolaryngology]], and in [[Vienna]] he studied under [[Ottokar Chiari]], Markus Hajek, and [[Robert Bárány]].

Returning to Dublin in 1908, Gogarty secured a post at Richmond Hospital, and shortly afterwards purchased a house in Ely Place opposite George Moore.  Three years later, he joined the staff of the [[Meath Hospital]] and remained there for the remainder of his medical career.  He became known for flamboyant theatrics in the [[operating room]], including off-the-cuff witticisms and the flinging of recently removed [[larynx]]es at the viewing gallery.  He also maintained [[otolaryngology|ENT]] consulting rooms in [[Ely Place]], attracting a number of wealthy clients and attending to less well-off patients for free.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 113–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty and his wife went on to have two more children, [[Dermot St. John Gogarty|Dermot]] (born 1908) and Brenda (born 1911), and in 1917 Gogarty purchased Renyvle House, a large [[country house]] in [[Renvyle]], [[Connemara]].  He became a keen [[motorist]] during this time, purchasing a succession of [[cars]] that culminated with a buttercup-coloured [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; During the following decade he was also interested in aviation, earning a [[pilot's licence]] and helping to found the Irish Aero Club.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free State Senator===
As a [[Sinn Féin]]er during the [[Irish War of Independence]], Gogarty participated in a variety of anti-[[Black and Tans|Black and Tan]] schemes, allowing his home to be used as a [[safe house]] and transporting disguised [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] volunteers in his car.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[ratification]] of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], Gogarty sided with the [[Irish Free State|pro-Treaty government]] (headed by his close friend [[Arthur Griffith]]) and was made a [[Seanad Éireann|Free State Senator]].&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=1922&amp;MemberID=1338&amp;ConstID=214|title=Dr. Oliver St. John Gogarty|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Griffith fell ill during the summer of 1922, Gogarty frequently attended his bedside.  His death on 12 August 1922 had a profound effect on Gogarty; W.T. Cosgrave later observed that "he was almost mortally wounded when Griffith died, he was so very, very much attached to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Irish Literary Portraits |last= Rodgers |first= William |year= 1973 |publisher= Taplinger Publishers |location= New York |page= 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty carried out Griffith's official [[autopsy]] and [[embalmment]], and went on to perform the same offices for [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], another close friend whom Gogarty had often sheltered in his Ely Place home prior to his assassination.  It was rumoured that Griffith had been planning to make Gogarty the new [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]], but in his absence the post went to [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gogarty1922.jpg|thumb|left|Gogarty in 1922]]

In November 1922, anti-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] commander [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] issued a general order to his forces to shoot [[Seanad Éireann|Free State Senators]].  Two months later, Gogarty was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a group of anti-Treaty militants, who lured him out of his house and into a waiting car under the pretext of bringing him to visit a sick patient.  Gogarty was subsequently driven to an empty house near [[Chapelizod]] and held under armed guard.  Aware that he might be in imminent danger of execution, Gogarty contrived to have himself led out into the garden (purportedly by claiming to be suffering from [[diarrhoea]]), where he broke free from his captors and flung himself into the [[River Liffey|Liffey]]; he then swam to shore and delivered himself to the protection of the police barracks in [[Phoenix Park]].  In February of that same year, [[Destruction of Irish country houses (1919-1923)|Renvyle was burnt to the ground]] by anti-Treaty forces.  Following these incidents, Gogarty relocated his family and practice to London, where he resided until February 1924.  Upon returning to Ireland, he famously released two swans into the [[River Liffey]] in gratitude for his life.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 194–199&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty remained a senator until the abolition of the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] in 1936, during which time he identified with none of the existing political parties and voted according to his own whims.  He believed that Ireland should retain its dominion status in the [[British Commonwealth]] so as to "keep with nations who understand that the first principle of freedom is a freedom that does not permit interference with the personal liberties of the citizen."  He supported rural electrification schemes, road improvement, [[reforestation]] and [[Conservation movement|conservation]], prevention of livestock cruelty, and [[educational reform]].  His views on controversial issues such as censorship and [[birth control]] were ambiguous; after expressing initial support for the Censorship Bill, he eventually went on to denounce it in scathing terms ("I think it is high time the men of this country found some other way of loving God than by hating women"), and while generally professing to oppose the sale of prophylactics, he voiced support for their usage in certain cases.  He was most passionate on the subject of sanitation in schools and in urban and rural housing, about which he spoke frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Carens (1979) pp.112–113&lt;/ref&gt; His speeches frequently contained [[pun]]s, wordplays, and extended poetic quotations, and were sometimes given in favour of facetious schemes, such as his attempt to have the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] statue in [[Phoenix Park]] included in the 1929 Wild Birds Protection Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Debates Website. Seanad Éireann Wild Birds Protection Bill, 1929—Report. Tithe an Oireachteas. 19 August 2009. {{cite web |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0013/S.0013.192912120007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607135429/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0013/S.0013.192912120007 |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was notoriously scornful of the government's attempts to reinstate the [[Irish language]] (which he referred to as "Woolworth's Irish"), proposing that funding be used instead for housing and school health services,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Debates Website.

[[Éamon de Valera|De Valera]] eventually dissolved the Seanad when it persisted in obstructing Government proposals, effectively ending Gogarty's political career.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.246–254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary endeavours===
Gogarty maintained close friendships with [[W. B. Yeats]], [[George William Russell|AE]], George Moore, [[Lord Dunsany]], [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]], [[Seamus O'Sullivan]], and other Dublin literati, and continued to write poetry in the midst of his political and professional duties.  Three small books of poetry (''Hyperthuleana'', ''Secret Springs of Dublin Song'', and ''The Ship and Other Poems'') were published between 1916 and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 31–37&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty also tried his hand at [[playwriting]], producing a slum drama (''[[Blight (play)|Blight]]'') in 1917 under the pseudonym "Alpha and Omega", and two comedies (''A Serious Thing'' and ''The Enchanted Trousers'') in 1919 under the pseudonym "[[Gideon Ouseley]]", all three of which were performed at the [[Abbey Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 42–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty devoted less energy to his medical practice and more to his writing during the twenties and thirties.  His 1924 book of poetry ''An Offering of Swans'' won the Gold Medal for poetry at the revived [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|Tailteann Games]], for which he also wrote the 1924 Olympic bronze medal-winning ''Tailteann Ode'' (which he was later to describe as "rather tripe").&lt;ref&gt;Carens, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 another book of verse, ''Wild Apples'', was published, and was followed in 1933 by ''Selected Poems''.  Gogarty was also a member of [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]]'s Irish Academy of Letters and frequently assisted in arranging its social functions.  1936 saw the publication of [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]]'s ''[[Oxford Book of Modern Verse]]'', which contained seventeen of Gogarty's poems and an introduction proclaiming him "one of the great lyric poets of our age."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The over-representation given to Gogarty outraged many poets and perplexed Gogarty himself, who remarked, "What right have I to figure so bulkily?  None from a poetical point of view... [[Sappho]] herself could not have made a more subjective anthology."&lt;ref&gt;Carens, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Gogarty published his first prose work, ''[[As I Was Going Down Sackville Street]]'' (subtitled "A Phantasy in Fact"), a semi-fictional novel-memoir that tells, in reverse chronological order, the story of Gogarty's Dublin through a series of interconnected anecdotes and lively characters sketches.  Shortly after its publication, it became the subject of a lawsuit by a Jewish [[art dealer]], Harry Sinclair, who claimed that he and his recently deceased twin brother, William Sinclair, had been [[libel]]ed by the publication.  The two men did not appear as named characters in the book, but some derogatory lines of verse beginning ''"Two Jews grew in Sackville Street"'', written by Gogarty's friend George Redding and included in a scene in the novel, were widely known to refer to the Sinclair siblings.  Harry Sinclair further recognised a reference to his grandfather, described in the text as one who "enticed little girls into his office", an offence of which his grandfather had in fact been convicted.  Gogarty responded to the charges by claiming that the unnamed Jews were parodies or composite characters rather than deliberate evocations of living persons.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.280–283&lt;/ref&gt; The case attracted a great deal of public attention, with one commentator observing that "only ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', rewritten by James Joyce, could really capture the mood of this trial."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Among the witnesses for the prosecution was William Sinclair's nephew-by-marriage, [[Samuel Beckett]], then a little-known writer, who was humiliatingly denounced as a "bawd and blasphemer" by Gogarty's counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett |last= Knowlson |first= James |year= 1996 |publisher= Bloomsbury |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty ultimately lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay £900 in damages, plus court costs.  This outcome deeply embittered Gogarty, who had already suffered financial setbacks after the [[stock market crash of 1929]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. II: The Arch-Poet 1915–1939 |last= Foster |first= Robert |year= 2003 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |page= 405}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt that the verdict had been politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the ''Sackville Street'' imbroglio, Gogarty's output over the next two years was prolific.  In 1938 he published ''I Follow St. Patrick'', a historical and geographic portrait of Ireland as told through Gogarty's rambling visits to various sites traditionally associated with [[St. Patrick]]; in 1939 he published ''Tumbling in the Hay'', a semi-autobiographical comic novel about medical students in turn-of-the-century Dublin, and ''Elbow Room'', another collection of poetry.  In 1938 he relocated to London for a second time and brought forth his own libel suit against the young poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]], whose autobiography ''The Green Fool'' said of [[Patrick Kavanagh|Kavanagh]]'s first visit to Gogarty's home: "I mistook Gogarty's white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife."  Gogarty, who had taken offence at the close coupling of the words "wife" and "mistress", was awarded £100 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Patrick Kavanagh |last= O'Brien |first= Darcy |year= 1975 |publisher= Bucknell University Press |location= Lewisburg |page= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American years===
With the onset of [[World War II]], Gogarty, who was an enthusiastic and talented amateur [[aviator]], attempted to enlist in the [[RAF]] and the [[RAMC]] as a doctor.  He was denied on grounds of age.  He then departed in September 1939 for an extended lecture tour in the United States, leaving his wife to manage Renvyle House, which had since been rebuilt as a hotel.  When his return to Ireland was delayed by the war, Gogarty applied for [[American citizenship]], and eventually decided to reside permanently in the United States.  Though he regularly sent letters, funds, and care-packages to his family and returned home for occasional holiday visits, he never again lived in Ireland for any extended length of time.  His primary American residence was in New York, where he was known to frequent bars on [[Third Avenue]]. He also spent time in [[Vermont]] and in Wyckoff, [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Renvyle Letters |last= Williams |first= Guy |year= 2000 |publisher= Daletta Press |location= Monasterevan |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling that he was too old to sit for the medical examinations that would have qualified him as a practitioner in the United States, Gogarty instead chose to support himself entirely by his writing.  In addition to various essays and short stories, his prose output included ''Going Native'', a satire on English social mores, ''Mad Grandeur'' and ''Mr. Petunia'', two period narratives composed with an eye to having them optioned as Hollywood films, and ''Rolling Down the Lea'' and ''It Isn't This Time of Year at All!'', two loosely constructed memoirs.  He also published two books of poems, ''Perennial'' and ''Unselected Poems''; a collection of bawdy verse, ''The Merry Muses of Hibernia'', was planned but never completed.  Gogarty's literary output during the forties and fifties is generally considered to be inferior to his earlier writings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty suffered from heart complaints during the last few years of his life, and in September 1957 he collapsed in the street on his way to dinner.  He died on 22 September 1957; his body was flown home to Ireland and buried in Cartron Church, Moyard, near Renvyle.

==Literary portrayal==
[[File:Revolutionary Joyce Better Contrast.jpg|thumb|right|James Joyce]]
A highly visible and distinctive [[Dublin]] character during his lifetime, Gogarty appears in a number of memoirs penned by his contemporaries, notably George Moore's ''Hail and Farewell'', where he goes both by his own name and by the pseudonym "Conan."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous literary incarnation, however, is as [[Buck Mulligan]], the irrepressible roommate of [[Stephen Dedalus]] in James Joyce's ''Ulysses''.  Mulligan quotes a number of songs and poems known to have been written by Gogarty,&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; the most famous of which, [[The Ballad of Japing Jesus|"The Song of the Cheerful (But Slightly Sarcastic) Jesus"]], was originally sent to Joyce as a belated Christmas peace offering after their quarrels of 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Other details, such as Mulligan's [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenism]], his status as a medical student, his history of saving men from drowning, his friendship with George Moore, and the metrical arrangement of his full name (Malachi Roland St. John Mulligan) parallel Gogarty's biography.   Due to his influence on Joyce (he is also sometimes cited as an inspiration for ''[[Dubliners]]'' character Ignatius Gallaher and ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'' antagonist Robert Hand), Gogarty's name often comes up in Joyce scholarship, though Gogarty's own editors and biographers have complained that these references are frequently inaccurate, owing to Gogarty-related errata in [[James Joyce (biography)|Richard Ellmann's ''James Joyce'']] and a tendency to conflate the real-life Gogarty with the fictional character of Buck Mulligan.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 10–21&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested{{who|date=November 2012}} that the speaker of W. B. Yeats's poem ''High Talk'', "Malachi Stilt-Jack", is intended to be a representation of Gogarty.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A pub in the [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] district of Dublin is named after him, and an annual Oliver St. John Gogarty Literary Festival is held in the author's family home, now the Renvyle House Hotel in [[Connemara]]. A surgical ward in the descendant hospital of his workplace, the [[Tallaght Hospital|AMNCH]], now also bears his name.

His CIA memoir, ''[http://www.patrickeddington.com/longstrangejourn.html Long Strange Journey]'', was published in 2011. In a 2011 interview with the Washington Post, Eddington accused the CIA of still withholding 1.5 million documents relevant to the Desert Storm malady known as gulf war syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/spy-talk/2011/02/ex-cia_analyst_patrcik_eddingt.html|title=SpyTalk - Ex-CIA analyst Patrick Eddington accuses agency of ‘sitting on’ Gulf War illness documents|work=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddington's opinion pieces have appeared in a number of publications, including the ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Washington Times]]'', ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', and the ''[[Army Times]]'', among others.

== Early life ==
'''Auwjong Peng Koen''' was born in [[Bukittinggi]]&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; on July 25, 1920. Since childhood, his father, Auwjong Pauw, always taught him to be disciplined, economical, and hard working. His father was a farmer in [[Quemoy]] Island (part of [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]],now under control of Taiwan). He moved to [[Sumatra]] to get a better job.

Even though eventually Auwjong Pauw became a successful tobacco lord, he never pampered his children. His teachings had really shaped Peng Koen's character. He became a serious and very straightforward person.

Peng Koen attended the [[Hollandsche Chineesche School]] (primary school for the [[Chinese language|Chinese]]).&lt;ref name="prominent"/&gt; During this time he was introduced to [[Catholic]] teachings, and finally converted to Catholicism and received the baptismal name of Andreas.

== Higher education ==
Peng Koen went to Hollandsche Chineesche Kweekschool to pursue his study. During this time, he was appointed as a leader of students organization. His task was to prepare reading material for the members. Other than that, he also planned the Chinese New Year celebration and year-end picnic.

He loved to read newspapers and magazines. Whereas other students just read the articles, Peng Koen tried to digest the writing styles and the ideas of every articles. It is said that Peng Koen was a bit 'stiff' when he faced the opposite sex. One of his ex-classmates, Oei Yin Hwa, who owned a sweets shop in [[Cianjur]], still remembers that Peng Koen was known as ''verstrooide professor'' or "forgetful professor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As of October 13, 2010, Rodriguez had raised more cash overall ($1,481,520 versus Canseco's $980,821), but Canseco had more cash on hand ($147,961 versus Rodriguez's $90,915).&lt;ref name=NYTimesProfile&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas 23rd District Profile|date=2010-10-29|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/house/texas/23|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate = 2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Martin|title=Quico Canseco only Texas challenger with more cash in bank than incumbent|date=2010-10-20|url=http://blogs.chron.com/txpotomac/2010/10/rodriguez_and_canseco_spending.html|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate = 2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Canseco continued to allege numerous irregularities, he had concluded that "a full investigation and recount would be expensive and time-consuming," considering that the 23rd District embraces all or parts of 29 counties.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Martin, "Canseco calls Gallego on Friday to concede race", ''Laredo Morning Times'', November 10, 2012, p. 5A&lt;/ref&gt;  Canseco carried the district's portion of [[Bexar County]], home to more than half the district's population.  However, it was not enough to overcome Gallego's margins in the central and western portions of the district, which were virtually coextensive with Gallego's old state House district.  Gallego also dominated the heavily Hispanic border areas.

In a bid to return to Congress, Canseco polled 10,204 votes (40.4%) in the Republican primary on March 4. He finished a close second to [[Will Hurd]], his intraparty rival from 2010. Hurd, an [[African American]], received 10,348 votes (49.9%). The remaining 4,723 votes (18.7%) went to a third candidate, Robert Lowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=218&amp;id=176|title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 5, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140305180619/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=218&amp;id=176|archivedate=March 5, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 27 [[runoff election|runoff]] Hurd handily defeated Canseco, 8,698 (59.5%) to 5,924 (40.5%). Hurd faced freshman Democratic Representative Pete Gallego in the November 4 general election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may27_173_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=1989&amp;id=844|title=2014 Republican Party Primary Runoff: Election Night Returns|publisher=[[Texas Secretary of State]]|accessdate=May 28, 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140528214950/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may27_173_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=1989&amp;id=844#|archive-date=2014-05-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately won.

When Canseco ran for Congress in 2010, he obtained two loans totaling $88,000 from his family-owned enterprises. The money was taken from a bank account of a subsidiary company with an address in Mexico. He also provided $86,000 in his own funds as a campaign loan. As Canseco runs in 2014, federal regulators are auditing his campaign funds to see if they are in violation of restrictions on corporate  contributions and a longstanding ban on political donations made by foreign nationals, corporations, partnerships, and associations.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Diaz of ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]'', "Texas's 23rd Congressional District: Feds audit Canseco's campaign finances", ''[[Laredo Morning Times'']], May 2, 2014, pp. 1, 10A&lt;/ref&gt;

;2018
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2018#District 21}}
In another bid to return to Congress, Canseco ran in the 18-way Republican primary for [[Texas's 21st congressional district]] to succeed the retiring incumbent Republican [[Lamar Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://herald-zeitung.com/article_f72d4ed0-1c1f-11e8-9ddb-d38ec48e53b4.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was ultimately unsuccessful, garnering less than 5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/texas-house-district-21-primary-election&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===

Canseco describes himself as a "limited-government conservative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cansecoforcongress.com/about Bio page on campaign site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304070259/http://cansecoforcongress.com/about |date=March 4, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He supports the [[Arizona immigration law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Stroud|title=Election result will shape immigration reform|date=2010-10-27|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/Election_result_will_shape_immigration_reform_105838338.html|work=[[San Antonio Express-News]]|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports the extension of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] tax cuts and repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. During the campaign, Canseco openly identified with the [[Tea Party movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James C.|last=McKinley, Jr.|title=In House Race in Texas, a Spotlight on the Hispanic Vote|date=2010-10-28|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/29/us/politics/29hispanics.html|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canseco was a member of the [[Republican Study Committee]], a caucus of conservative House Republicans.  During his tenure, he was one of four voting Latino members of Congress known to be a member of the RSC, the others being [[Bill Flores]] of [[Texas]], [[Raul Labrador]] of [[Idaho]] and [[Jaime Herrera Beutler]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. He was also a member of the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]]. In 2012, Canseco delivered the Spanish language version of the Republican response to the State of the Union address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Gary |url=http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2012/01/julian-castro-and-quico-canseco-get-moment-in-spotlight-at-sotu/ |title=Julian Castro and Quico Canseco get moment in spotlight at SOTU - Texas on the Potomac |website=Blog.chron.com |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2011, Canseco was criticized after initially declining to introduce a bill allowing for a swap of land between the Federal Government and Bexar County, Texas. The bill, which was supported by [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Ken Salazar]] and sponsored by retiring Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] in the Senate, would expand the development of the [[San Antonio River]] to the [[San Antonio Missions National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Canseco is slow to move on Mission Park Expansion|date=2011-07-24|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/news_columnists/scott_stroud/article/Canseco-is-slow-to-move-on-Missions-park-expansion-1560374.php |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Canseco introduced the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park Boundary Expansion Act in the House, which mirrored Hutchison's Senate bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2011/11/san-antonio-missions-national-park-bill-approved-by-senate-panel/|title=San Antonio Missions national park bill approved by Senate panel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation would cost roughly $4 million over four years, even though the lands would be donated.

In April 2012, Canseco traveled using the San Antonio International Airport. He said that he was assaulted by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] when an officer "was patting me down where no one is supposed to go."  The TSA officer said that he was assaulted by Canseco, but no arrests were made. Canseco advocates for changes in security procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kens5.com/news/local/I-TEAM--Congressman-Canseco-says-TSA-agent-assaulted-him-during-a-pat-down-148756365.html |title=Congressman says he was assaulted during pat-down |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427192631/http://www.kens5.com/news/local/I-TEAM--Congressman-Canseco-says-TSA-agent-assaulted-him-during-a-pat-down-148756365.html |archivedate=April 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canseco reportedly voted with his party 96% of the time on all issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/C001082|title= Quico Canseco (R)|author= |date= |work= Washington Post|publisher= |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Canseco and his wife, Gloria, have been married since 1979. The couple resides in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. They have three children and attend St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cansecoforcongress.com/about |title=Canseco for Congress |publisher=Canseco for Congress |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016221632/http://www.cansecoforcongress.com/about |archivedate=October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Culver Academies|Culver Military Academy]] in his youth.

{{for|the professor emeritus of political science at Purdue University|Robert Melson}}
'''Robert Bryant Melson''' (June 5, 1971 – June 8, 2017) was an Alabama inmate who was sentenced to death and executed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.state.al.us/DeathRow.aspx|title=Alabama Department of Corrections|website=Doc.state.al.us|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the 1994 murders of three workers at a [[Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc.|Popeyes]] restaurant in [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]].

==The crime==
On the night of Friday, April 15, 1994, Melson and his accomplice Cuhuatemoc Hinricky Peraita (born May 19, 1976) entered a Popeyes restaurant in east Gadsden through the back door of the building after employee Darrell K. Collier unlocked it to allow fellow employees Nathaniel Baker and Bryant Archer to take out the trash. Upon entry, Melson and Peraita ordered Archer, Baker, Collier, and fourth employee Tamika Collins into the restaurant's office and demanded that they empty the safe. They complied, after which Melson ordered the four to get inside the restaurant's freezer. Shortly after locking them in the freezer, Melson unlocked the door and opened fire. Baker, Collier and Collins all died of their wounds before paramedics arrived. Archer was shot four times, but he survived and was able to crawl to the restaurant's office to call 911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cncpunishment.com/forums/showthread.php?1175-Robert-Bryant-Melson-Alabama-Execution-June-8-2017&amp;p=1526&amp;viewfull=1#post1526|title=Robert Bryant Melson - Alabama Execution - June 8, 2017|website=Cncpunishment.com|accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Melson was convicted of his role in the crime and sentenced to death on May 17, 1996, and he was placed on death row under [[Alabama Department of Corrections]] ID 0000Z601. Peraita was sentenced to life without parole, but he killed a fellow inmate on December 11, 1999, for which he received a death sentence in October 2001. Melson had two execution dates set in 2010, both of which were stayed. On April 5, 2017, Melson had an execution date set for [[List of offenders executed in the United States in 2017|June 8, 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/upcoming-executions|title=Upcoming Executions - Death Penalty Information Center|website=deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a temporary stay from an appellate court on June 2, but the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] vacated the stay on June 6 without comment. At 5:45 pm on the night of the execution, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a temporary stay so Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] could review Melson's appeals. The stay was later lifted and the execution began at 9:55 pm. Melson was pronounced dead at 10:27 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/robert-melson-executed-in-alabama-for-94-triple-murder-during-robbery/|title=Robert Melson executed in Alabama for '94 triple murder during robbery|website=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trelawny''', later '''Salusbury-Trelawny Baronetcy''', of [[Trelawny, Pelynt|Trelawny]] in the County of [[Cornwall]], is a title in the [[Baronetage of England]]. It was created on 1 July 1628 for [[Sir John Trelawny, 1st Baronet|John Trelawny]] of [[Trelawny, Pelynt|Trelawny]] in the parish of [[Pelynt]] in Cornwall.&lt;ref name=Cokayne&gt;{{Citation| editor-last=Cokayne| editor-first=George Edward |year=1902 | title= Complete Baronetage volume 2 (1625-1649) | url=  http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092524382#page/n61/mode/2up | location=Exeter | publisher=William Pollard and Co| pages= 43| accessdate = 9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family derived much of their political power from their patronage of the nearby [[pocket borough]] of [[East Looe (UK Parliament constituency)|East Looe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Parliament]]: House of Commons 1715-1754, ed. R. Sedgwick, 1970[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/constituencies/east-looe]&lt;/ref&gt; The second Baronet sat as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East Looe (UK Parliament constituency)|East Looe]], [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]] and [[Liskeard (UK Parliament constituency)|Liskeard]]. The third Baronet was a clergyman and one of the [[Seven Bishops]] imprisoned by [[James II of England|James II]]. The fourth Baronet represented [[West Looe (UK Parliament constituency)|West Looe]], [[Liskeard]] and [[East Looe]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The fifth Baronet was Member of Parliament for East Looe. The sixth Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for West Looe and served as [[Governor of Jamaica]]. The eighth Baronet was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|East Cornwall]] 1832–1837 and [[Lord-Lieutenant of Cornwall]]. In 1802 he assumed the additional surname of Salusbury. The ninth Baronet represented [[Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)|Tavistock]] and [[East Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|East Cornwall]] in [[Parliament]].

[[John Trelawny (died 1680)|John Trelawny]], [[Charles Trelawny]] and [[Henry Trelawny]], sons of the second Baronet and brothers of the third Baronet, all gained distinction in their own right. [[Edward Trelawny (governor)|Edward Trelawny]], younger son of [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet|Bishop Trelawny (3rd Bt)]], served as [[Governor of Jamaica]] 1738-52.

The '''Sama-Bajau''' refers to several [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[ethnic group]]s of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] with their origins from the southern [[Philippines]]. The name collectively refers to related people who usually call themselves the '''Sama''' or '''Samah'''; or are known by the [[exonym]]s '''Bajau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|dʒ|aʊ|,_|ˈ|b|æ|-}}, also spelled '''Badjao''', '''Bajaw''', '''Badjau''', '''Badjaw''', '''Bajo''' or '''Bayao''') and '''Samal''' or '''Siyamal''' (the latter being considered offensive). They usually live a seaborne lifestyle, and use small wooden sailing vessels such as the ''[[perahu]]'' (''layag'' in [[Maranao language|Meranau]]), ''djenging'', ''balutu'', ''[[lepa (ship)|lepa]]'', ''pilang'', and ''[[vinta]]'' (or ''lepa-lepa'').&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt; Some Sama-Bajau groups native to [[Sabah]] are also known for their traditional [[horse culture]].

The Sama-Bajau are traditionally from the many islands of the [[Sulu Archipelago]] in the [[Philippines]], coastal areas of [[Mindanao]], northern and eastern [[Borneo]], the [[Celebes]], and throughout eastern [[Indonesia]]n islands.&lt;ref name="orang bajo"&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=Social Anthropology Bachelor's |chapter= |title=Living on Boundaries: The Orang Bajo of Tinakin Laut, Indonesia |url=http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/student-theses/2010-0303-200346/Kemkens%20Lotte.pdf |author=Lotte Kemkens |publisher=University of Utrecht |accessdate=21 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117103949/http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/student-theses/2010-0303-200346/Kemkens%20Lotte.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Philippines, they are grouped together with the religiously-similar [[Moro people]]. Within the last fifty years, many of the Filipino Sama-Bajau have migrated to neighbouring [[Malaysia]] and the northern islands of the Philippines, due to the [[Moro conflict in the Philippines|conflict in Mindanao]].&lt;ref name="Statelessness"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinama.org/about-sama-people/the-bajau-and-sama-people/ |title=The Bajau, the Badjao, the Samals, and the Sama People|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, they were the second-largest ethnic group in the [[States of Malaysia|Malaysian state]] of [[Sabah]].&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.gov.my/main/en-GB/Home/About|title=Sabah's People and History|quote=The [[Kadazan-Dusun]] is the largest ethnic group in Sabah that makes up almost 30% of the population. The Bajaus, or also known as "Cowboys of the East", and [[Murut people|Muruts]], the hill people and head hunters in the past, are the second and third largest ethnic group in Sabah respectively. Other indigenous tribes include the [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]], [[Bruneian Malay people|Brunei Malay]], [[Bugis]], [[Kedayan]], [[Lotud]], [[Lundayeh people|Ludayeh]], [[Rungus people|Rungus]], [[Tausūg people|Suluk]], [[Minokok]], [[Bonggi people|Bonggi]], the [[Ida'an]], and many more. In addition to that, the Chinese makes up the main non-indigenous group of the population.|publisher=[[Government of Sabah|Sabah State Government]]|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sama-Bajau have sometimes been called the "Sea Gypsies" or "Sea Nomads", terms that have also been used for non-related ethnic groups with similar traditional lifestyles, such as the [[Moken]] of the Burmese-Thai [[Mergui Archipelago]] and the [[Orang Laut]] of southeastern Sumatra and the [[Riau Islands]] of Indonesia. The modern outward spread of the Sama-Bajau from older inhabited areas seems to have been associated with the development of sea trade in [[Sea cucumber (food)|sea cucumber]] ([[trepanging|trepang]]).

== Ethnonym ==
[[File:Old Moro Sailing Boat (A Bajau lepa houseboat).jpg|thumb|A Sama ''[[Lepa (ship)|lepa]]'' houseboat from the Philippines ({{circa|1905}})]]
Like the term [[Kadazan-Dusun]], Sama-Bajau is a collective term, used to describe several closely related indigenous people who consider themselves a single distinct ''bangsa'' ("ethnic group" or "nation").&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoogervorst"/&gt; It is generally accepted that these groups of people can be termed Sama or Bajau, though they never call themselves "Bajau" in the Philippines. Instead, they [[endonym|call themselves]] with the names of their tribes, usually the place they live or place of origin. For example, the sea-going Sama-Bajau prefer to call themselves the Sama Dilaut or Sama Mandilaut (literally "sea Sama" or "ocean Sama") in the Philippines; while in Malaysia, they identify as Bajau Laut.&lt;ref name="bracamonte2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nimfa L. Bracamonte|year=2005|title=Evolving a Development Framework for the Sama Dilaut in an Urban Center in the Southern Philippines|journal=Borneo Research Bulletin|volume=36|page=185|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/21393318/evolving-development-framework-sama-dilaut-urban-center-southern-philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nagatsu"/&gt;
[[File:Bajau Laut Pictures.jpg|thumb|left|A Sama-Bajau flotilla in [[Lahad Datu]], [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]].]]
Historically in the Philippines, the term "Sama" was used to describe the more land-oriented and settled Sama–Bajau groups, while "Bajau" was used to describe the more sea-oriented, boat-dwelling, nomadic groups.&lt;ref name="appell"&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.N. Appell|year=1969|title=Studies of the Tausug (Suluk( and Samal-speaking populations of Sabah and the southern Philippine islands|journal=Borneo Research Bulletin|volume=1|issue=2|pages=21–23|url=http://www.borneoresearchcouncil.org/BRB%20PDF%20scans/BRB_1969_01_02.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even these distinctions are fading as the majority of Sama-Bajau have long since abandoned boat living, most for Sama–style piling houses in the coastal shallows.&lt;ref name="nagatsu"/&gt;

"Sama" is believed to have originated from the Austronesian root word ''sama'' meaning "together", "same", or "kin".&lt;ref name="mahali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="low"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liebner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iwonder"/&gt; The exact origin of the [[exonym]] "Bajau" is unclear. Some authors have proposed that it is derived from a corruption of the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''berjauh'' ("getting further apart" or "the state of being away").&lt;ref name="iwonder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewelmercader.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/ethnographic-reading-of-silungan-baltapa-ancestral-tradition-and-sufic-islam-values-of-sama-bajau/|title=Ethnographic Reading of Silungan Baltapa: Ancestral Tradition and Sufic Islam Values of Sama Bajau |date=21 October 2013|publisher=iWonder|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bracamonte"/&gt; Other possible origins include the [[Brunei Malay]] word ''bajaul'', which means "to fish".&lt;ref name="bracamonte"/&gt; The term "Bajau" has pejorative connotations in the Philippines, indicating poverty in comparison to the term "Sama". Especially since it is used most commonly to refer to poverty-stricken Sama-Bajau who make a living through begging.&lt;ref name="nagatsu"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kazufumi Nagatsu|year=2001|title=Pirates, Sea Nomads or Protectors of Islam?: A Note on "Bajau" Identifications in the Malaysian Context|journal=アジア・アフリカ地域研究|volume=1|pages=212–230|url=http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/79972/1/aaas_1_212.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British administrators in Sabah classified the Sama-Bajau as "Bajau" and labelled them as such in their birth certificates. Thus the Sama-Bajau in Malaysia may sometimes self-identify as "Bajau" or even "Malay" (though the preferred term is "Sama"), for political reasons. This is due to the government recognition of the Sama-Bajau as legally [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]] (indigenous native) under the name "Bajau".&lt;ref name="nagatsu"/&gt; This ensures easy access to the [[Ketuanan Melayu|special privileges granted to ethnic Malays]]. This is especially true for recent Moro [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino migrants]]. The indigenous Sama-Bajau in Malaysia have also started labelling themselves as their ancestors called themselves, such as Simunul.

== History and origin ==
[[File:Sea Nomads distribution map.jpg|thumb|300px|Regions inhabited by peoples usually known as "Sea Nomads".&lt;ref name="sopher"/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{Legend|#88c885|Sama-Bajau}}{{Legend|#e8bb9c|[[Orang Laut]]}}{{Legend|#86adfd|[[Moken]]&lt;/small&gt;}}]]
For most of their history, the Sama-Bajau have been a [[nomadic]], seafaring people, living off the sea by trading and subsistence fishing.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/18/last-sea-nomads |title=The last of the sea nomads |work=The Guardian |date=18 September 2010|accessdate=18 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100918085932/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/18/last-sea-nomads| archivedate=18 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau see themselves as non-aggressive people. They kept close to the shore by erecting [[stilt house|houses on stilts]], and travelled using ''lepa'', handmade boats which many lived in.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

===Oral traditions===
Most of the various oral traditions and ''tarsila'' (royal [[genealogies]]) among the Sama-Bajau have a common theme which claims that they were originally a land-dwelling people who were the subjects of a king who had a daughter. After she is lost by either being swept away to the sea (by a storm or a flood) or being taken captive by a neighbouring kingdom, they were then supposedly ordered to find her. After failing to do so they decided to remain nomadic for fear of facing the wrath of the king.&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sopher"&gt;{{cite journal|author=David E. Sopher|year=1965|title=The Sea Nomads: A Study Based on the Literature of the Maritime Boat People of Southeast Asia|journal=Memoirs of the National Museum|volume=5|pages=389–403|doi=10.2307/2051635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bajo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mbal"/&gt;

One such version widely told among the Sama-Bajau of Borneo claims that they descended from [[Johor]]ean royal guards who were escorting a princess named Dayang Ayesha for marriage to a [[Sultanate of Sulu|ruler in Sulu]]. However, the [[Sultan of Brunei]] (allegedly [[Muhammad Shah of Brunei]]) also fell in love with the princess. On the way to Sulu, they were attacked by [[Brunei]]ans in the high seas. The princess was taken captive and married to the Sultan of Brunei instead. The escorts, having lost the princess, elected to settle in Borneo and Sulu rather than return to Johor.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark T. Miller|title =Social Organization of the West Coast Bajau|publisher =SIL International|year =2011|url =http://www-01.sil.org/silewp/2011/silewp2011-009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt;

Among the Indonesian Sama-Bajau, on the other hand, their oral histories place more importance on the relationship of the Sama-Bajau with the [[Sultanate of Gowa]] rather than Johor. The various versions of their origin myth tell about a royal princess who was washed away by a flood. She was found and eventually married a king or a prince of Gowa. Their offspring then allegedly became the ancestors of the Indonesian Sama-Bajau.&lt;ref name="bajo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jakarta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/07/Bajo-past-and-present.html|title=Bajo, past and present|author=Syamsul Huda M. Suhari|date=7 June 2013|publisher=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=21 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221062553/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/07/Bajo-past-and-present.html|archivedate=21 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are other versions which are also more mythological and do not mention a princess. Among the Philippine Sama-Bajau, for example, there is a myth that claims that the Sama-Bajau were accidentally towed into what is now [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]] by a giant stingray.&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt; Incidentally, the native pre-Hispanic name of [[Zamboanga City]] is "Samboangan" (literally "mooring place"), which was derived from the Sinama word for a [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring pole]], ''sambuang'' or ''samboang''.&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt;

===Modern research on origins===
[[File:Philippinen basilan seezigeuner ph04p69.jpg|thumb|left|Sama-Bajau children in [[Basilan]], [[Philippines]]]]
The origin myths claiming descent from Johor or Gowa have been largely rejected by modern scholars, mostly because these kingdoms were established too recently to explain the ethnic divergence.&lt;ref name="mbal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt; Though whether the Sama-Bajau are indigenous to their current territories or settled from elsewhere is still contentious.&lt;ref name="nagatsu"/&gt; Linguistically, they are distinct from neighbouring populations, especially from the [[Tausūg people|Tausūg]] who are more closely related to the northern Philippine ethnic groups like the [[Visayans]].&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt;

In 1965, the anthropologist David E. Sopher claimed that the Sama-Bajau, along with the [[Orang Laut]], descended from ancient "[[Australoid race|Veddoid]]" (Australoid)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The concept of an [[Australoid race|Australoid "race"]] is antiquated. Most modern literature refer to these peoples as the Australo-Melanesians. However, their exact relationship within their member groups and with other ethnic groups in Asia and Oceania is still debated.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hunter-gatherer]]s from the [[Riau Archipelago]] who intermarried with [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]]. They retained their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, though they became more maritime-oriented as Southeast Asia became more populated by later Austronesian settlers like the [[Ethnic Malay|Malays]].&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt;

[[File:Bajau Laut Pictures 6.jpg|thumb|Sama-Bajau woman anchoring a family boat (banglo) in Malaysia]]
In 1968, the anthropologist Harry Arlo Nimmo, on the other hand, believed that the Sama-Bajau are indigenous to the Sulu Archipelago, Sulawesi, and/or Borneo, and do not share a common origin with the Orang Laut. Nimmo proposed that the boat-dwelling lifestyle developed among the ancestors of the Sama-Bajau independently from the Orang Laut.&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt;

A more recent study in 1985 by the anthropologist Alfred Kemp Pallasen compares the oral traditions with historical facts and linguistic evidence. He puts the date of the [[ethnogenesis]] of Sama-Bajau as 800 AD and also rejects a historical connection between the Sama-Bajau and the Orang Laut. He hypothesises that the Sama-Bajau originated from a proto-Sama-Bajau people inhabiting the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] who practised both fishing and [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture. They were the original inhabitants of Zamboanga and the Sulu archipelago,&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt; and were well-established in the region long before the first arrival of the [[Tausūg people]] at around the 13th century from their homelands along the northern coast of eastern Mindanao. Along with the Tausūg, they were heavily influenced by the [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] kingdoms both culturally and linguistically, becoming [[Indianised Kingdom|Indianised]] by the 15th century and [[Islamised]] by the 16th century.&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt; They also engaged in extensive trade with China for "luxury" sea products like [[Trepanging|trepang]], [[pearl]]s, and [[Shark fin soup|shark fin]].&lt;ref name="Hoogervorst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mywanderlist.com/2014/03/06/secret-lives-sea-gypsies-living-sulawesi-indonesia/|title=The Secret Lives of Bajau Sea Gypsies: A True Account|author=Brad Bernard|date=6 March 2014|publisher=myWanderlist|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Zamboanga, some members of this people adopted an exclusively seaborne culture and spread outwards in the 10th century towards Basilan, Sulu, Borneo, and Sulawesi.&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt; They arrived in Borneo in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt; This hypothesis is currently the most widely accepted among specialists studying the [[Austronesian peoples]]. This would also explain why even boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau still practice agricultural rituals, despite being exclusively fishermen.&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt; Linguistic evidence further points to Borneo as the ultimate origin of the proto-Sama-Bajau people.&lt;ref name="Hoogervorst"/&gt;

A genetic study of three groups - the Derawan of Northeast Borneo, the Kotabaru of Southeast Borneo and the Kendari of Southeast Sulawesi - suggested that their origin was in southern [[Sulawesi]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusuma P, Brucato N, Cox MP, Letellier T, Manan A, Nuraini C, Grangé P, Sudoyo H Ricaut FX (2017) The last sea nomads of the Indonesian archipelago: genomic origins and dispersal. Eur J Hum Genet doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2017.88&lt;/ref&gt; Each group had its own unique genetic contribution from neighboring populations. These genetic findings are consistent with the oral history.

===Historical records===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bewoners van Badjo-kampong Kajoa op Ternate Noord-Molukken TMnr 10005731.jpg|thumb|left|Residents of a Bajau [[kampung]] in [[North Maluku|Afdeeling Ternate]], [[Groote Oost]], [[Dutch East Indies]] (present day North Maluku, Indonesia) {{circa|1925}}.]]
The [[Philippine epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Darangan (epic poem)|Darangan]]'' of the [[Maranao people]] record that among the ancestors of the hero Bantugan is a Maranao prince who married a Sama-Bajau princess. Estimated to have happened in 840 AD, it is the oldest account of the Sama-Bajau. It further corroborates the fact that they predate the arrival of the Tausūg settlers and are indigenous to the Sulu archipelago and parts of Mindanao.&lt;ref name="mbal"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mucha-Shim Lahaman Quiling|work = The Work of 2011/2012 API Fellows |title =Mbal Alungay Bissala: Our Voices Shall Not Perish - Listening, Telling, Writing of the Sama Identity and Its Political History in Oral Narratives|publisher = The Nippon Foundation Fellowships for Asian Public Intellectuals|year =2012|pages=141&amp;ndash;148|url =http://www.api-fellowships.org/body/international_ws_proceedings/2011-2012/P4-MBAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sama-Bajau were first recorded by European explorers in 1521 by [[Antonio Pigafetta]] of the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano expedition]] in what is now the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]]. Pigafetta writes that the "people of that island make their dwellings in boats and do not live otherwise". They have also been present in the written records of other Europeans henceforth; including in [[Sulawesi]] by the Dutch colonies in 1675, in Sulawesi and eastern Borneo by [[Thomas Forrest (navigator)|Thomas Forrest]] in the 1770s,&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt; and in the west coast of Borneo by [[Spenser St. John]] in the 1850s and 1860s.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

[[File:CO 1069-493-27 (7888161554).jpg|thumb|right|A Bajau chieftain in traditional attire from Kampung Menkabong, [[Tuaran]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British North Borneo]], {{circa|1948}}.]]
Sama-Bajau were often widely mentioned in connection to [[Timawa#Raids|sea raids]] (''mangahat''), [[piracy]] and the [[slave trade]] in Southeast Asia during the European colonial period, indicating that at least some Sama-Bajau groups from northern Sulu (e.g. the [[Banguingui people|Banguingui]]) were involved, along with non-Sama-Bajau groups like the [[Iranun people|Iranun]]. The scope of their pirate activities was extensive, commonly sailing from Sulu to as far as [[Moluccas]] and back again. Aside from early European colonial records, they may have also been the pirates described by Chinese and Arab sources in the [[Singapore Strait|Straits of Singapore]] in the 12th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt; Sama-Bajau usually served as low-ranking crewmembers of warboats, directly under the command of Iranun squadron leaders, who in turn answered to the Tausūg ''[[datu]]'' of the Sultanate of Sulu.&lt;ref name="Hoogervorst"/&gt;

The [[Bajoe]] harbour in Sulawesi was the site of a small settlement of Sama-Bajau under the [[Bugis]] [[Bone state|Sultanate of Bone]]. They were significantly involved in [[First Bone War|First]] and [[Second Bone War]]s (1824–1825), when the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] sent a punitive expedition in retaliation for Bugis and [[Makassar people|Makassar]] attacks on local Dutch garrisons. After the fall of Bone, most Sama-Bajau resettled in other areas of Sulawesi.&lt;ref name="liebner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bajo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Horst Liebner|title =Four Oral Versions of a Story about the Origin of the Bajo People of Southern Selayar|publisher =Wissenschaftlich-Literarischer Selbst- und Sonderverlach |series=Proyek Pengkajian dan Pengembangan Masyarakat Pantai, YIIS UNHAS|year =1996|url =http://www.oxis.org/resources-3/bajo-origins.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[History of Sabah|British colonial rule of Sabah]], the Sama-Bajau were involved in two uprisings against the [[North Borneo Chartered Company]]: the [[Mat Salleh Rebellion]] from 1894 to 1905, and the [[Pandasan Affair]] of 1915.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

==Modern Sama-Bajau==
Modern Sama-Bajau are generally regarded as peaceful, hospitable, and cheerful people, despite their humble circumstances. However, a significant number are also illiterate, uneducated, and impoverished, due to their nomadic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="bracamonte"/&gt;

The number of modern Sama-Bajau who are born and live primarily at sea is diminishing. Cultural assimilation and modernisation are regarded as the main causes.&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt; Particularly after the dissolution of the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], who were the traditional patrons of the Sama-Bajau for bartering fish for farm goods. The money-based fish markets which replaced the seasonal trade around mooring points necessitates a more land-based lifestyle for greater market penetration.&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt; In Malaysia, some hotly debated government programs have also resettled Bajau to the mainland.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

The Sama-Bajau in the Sulu Archipelago were historically discriminated against by the dominant [[Tausūg people]], who viewed boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau as 'inferior' and as outsiders (the traditional Tausūg term for them is the highly offensive ''Luwaan'', meaning "spat out" or "outcast"). They were also marginalised by other [[Moro peoples]] because they still practised [[animist]] folk religions either exclusively or alongside [[Islam]], and thus were viewed as "uncivilised pagans".&lt;ref name="aoyama"/&gt; Boat-dwelling and shoreline Sama-Bajau had a very low status in the caste-based Tausūg Sultanate of Sulu.&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimmo2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harry Arlo Nimmo|year=1968|title=Reflections on Bajau History|journal=Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints|volume=16|issue=4|pages=32–59|url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/ojs/index.php/ps/article/view/2222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survived into the modern Philippines where the Sama-Bajau are still subjected to strong cultural prejudice from the Tausūg. The Sama-Bajau have also been frequent victims of theft, extortion, kidnapping, and violence from the predominantly Tausūg [[Abu Sayyaf]] insurgents as well as pirates.&lt;ref name="Hoogervorst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amana.dk/2012/12/04/bajau-laut-of-semporna-peaceful-nomads-or-fish-bombers/|title=Bajau Laut of Semporna: Peaceful Nomads or Fish Bombers?|date=4 December 2012|publisher=Amana': Empowering the Outcasts|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daug"&gt;{{cite book|author=Artchil C.

The ancestral roaming and fishing grounds of the Sama-Bajau straddled the borders of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

With the loss of their traditional fishing grounds, some refugee groups of Sama-Bajau in the Philippines are forced to resort to begging (''agpangamu'' in Sinama), particularly diving for coins thrown by inter-island [[ferry]] passengers (''angedjo''). Other traditional sources of income include selling grated [[cassava]] (''magliis''), mat-weaving (''ag-tepoh''), and jewellery-making (especially from [[pearl]]s).

== Subgroups ==
The Sama-Bajau are fragmented into highly diverse subgroups. They have never been politically united and are usually subject to the land-based political groups of the areas they settle, such as the [[Sultanate of Brunei]] and the former [[Sultanate of Sulu]].&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt;
[[File:Bajau Laut Pictures 3.jpg|thumb|right|Sama-Bajau woman and children from Omadal Island, Sabah, Malaysia]]
Most subgroups of Sama-Bajau name themselves after the place they originated from (usually an island).&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunapipi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rodney C. Jubilado|year=2010|title=On cultural fluidity: The Sama-Bajau of the Sulu-Sulawesi Seas|journal=Kunapipi|volume=32|issue=1|pages=89–101|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1257&amp;context=kunapipi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt; Each subgroup speaks a distinct language or dialect that are usually mutually intelligible with their immediate neighbouring subgroup in a continuous linguistic chain.&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt; In the Philippines, the Sama-Bajau can be divided into three general groups based on where they settle:&lt;ref name="iwonder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt;
* '''Sama Bihing''' or '''Sama Lipid''' - The "shoreline Sama" or "[[littoral]] Sama". These are the Sama-Bajau which traditionally lived in [[stilt house]]s in shallows and coastal areas. An example is the Sama Simunul. They are originally from the larger islands of [[Tawi-Tawi]].&lt;ref name="iwonder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt; They have a more flexible lifestyle than the Sama-Gimba (Dilaut Origin), and will farm when there is available land. They usually act as middlemen in trade between the Sama Dilaut and other land-based peoples.&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt;
* '''Sama Dea''', '''Sama Deya''', or '''Sama Darat''' - The "land Sama". These are the Sama-Bajau which traditionally lived in island interiors. Some examples are the Sama Sibutu and the Sama Sanga-Sanga. They are usually farmers who cultivate [[rice]], [[sweet potato]], [[cassava]], and [[coconut]]s for [[copra]] through traditional [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture (in contrast to the [[Plough|plow agriculture]] technology brought by the Tausūg). They are originally from the larger islands of Tawi-Tawi and [[Pangutaran]].&lt;ref name="iwonder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt; In the Philippines, the Sama Dea will often completely differentiate themselves from the Sama Dilaut.&lt;ref name="sinama"/&gt;
* '''Sama Dilaut''', '''Sama Mandilaut''', '''Sama Pala'u''', or '''Bajau Laut''' - The "sea Sama" or "ocean Sama". In the Philippines, the preferred ethnonym is Sama Dilaut;&lt;ref name="bracamonte2"/&gt; while in Malaysia, they usually identify as Bajau Laut. This subgroup originally lived exclusively on elaborately crafted houseboats called ''lepa'', but almost all have taken to living on land in the Philippines. Their home islands include [[Sitangkai, Tawi-Tawi|Sitangkai]] and [[Bongao, Tawi-Tawi|Bongao]].&lt;ref name="dilaut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/e-books/e-book.php?id=61&amp;t=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915112052/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/e-books/e-book.php?id=61&amp;t=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 September 2008|title=Sama|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts, Government of the Philippines|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the Sama-Bajau subgroup most commonly called "Bajau", though Filipino Sama Dilaut consider it offensive.&lt;ref name="sinama"/&gt; They sometimes call themselves the "Sama To'ongan" (literally "true Sama" or "real Sama"), to distinguish themselves from the land-dwelling Sama-Bajau subgroups.&lt;ref name="mahali"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saidatul Nornis Haji Mahali|editor1=Merete Falck Borch |editor2=Eve Rask Knudsen |editor3=Martin Leet |editor4=Bruce Clunies Ross |title =Bodies and Voices: The Force-field of Representation and Discourse in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies|chapter =Tinggayun: Implications of Dance and Song in Bajau Society|series=Cross/Cultures 94|publisher =Rodopi|year =2008|pages=153–161|isbn = 9789042023345|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=xZmWF3qxHo4C&amp;dq=Turijene+bajo&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
{{Main|Sama-Bajaw languages}}
The Sama–Bajau peoples speak some ten languages of the Sama–Bajau subgroup of the Western [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Sather, "The Bajau Laut", Oxford U. Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinama]] is the most common name for these languages, but they are also called Bajau, especially in Malaysia. Most Sama-Bajau can speak multiple languages.&lt;ref name="Hoogervorst"/&gt;

The Sama-Bajau languages were once classified under the [[Central Philippine languages]] of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] geographic group of the [[Austronesian language]] family. But due to marked differences with neighbouring languages, they were moved to a separate branch altogether from all other Philippine languages.&lt;ref name="everyculture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/East-Southeast-Asia/Samal-Orientation.html|title=Samal - Orientation |publisher=Countries and Their Cultures|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sinama pronunciation is quite distinct from other nearby Central Philippine languages like Tausūg and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. Instead of the [[Stress (linguistics)|primary stress]] being usually on the final syllable; the primary stress occurs on the second-to-the-last syllable of the word in Sinama.&lt;ref name="lsp24"&gt;{{cite book|author =Alfred Kemp Pallasen|title =Culture Contact and Language Convergence|publisher =Linguistic Society of the Philippines|series =LSP Special Monogaph Issue 24|year =1985|url =http://www-01.sil.org/asia/philippines/ling/Culture_Contact_and_Language_Convergence_1985.pdf|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150511231324/http://www-01.sil.org/asia/philippines/ling/Culture_Contact_and_Language_Convergence_1985.pdf|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This placement of the primary stress is similar to [[Manobo languages|Manobo]] and other languages of the predominantly animistic ethnic groups of Mindanao, the [[Lumad peoples]].&lt;ref name="dubois"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carl D.

In 2006, the linguist [[Robert Blust]], proposed that the Sama-Bajaw languages derived from the [[Barito languages|Barito lexical region]], though not from any established group. It is thus a sister group to other Barito languages like [[Dayak language|Dayak]] and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. It is classified under the [[Bornean languages|Bornean]] geographic group.&lt;ref name="blust"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Blust |editor1=Hsiu-chuan Liao |editor2=Carl R.

Sama-Bajau languages are usually written in the [[Jawi alphabet]].&lt;ref name="low"/&gt;

Religion can vary among the Sama-Bajau subgroups; from a strict adherence to [[Sunni Islam]], forms of [[folk Islam]] (itself influenced by [[Sufism|Sufi traditions]] of early Muslim missionaries), to animistic beliefs in spirits and ancestor worship. There is a small minority of [[Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s, particularly from [[Davao del Sur]] in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="mbal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoyama"/&gt;

Among the modern coastal Sama-Bajau of Malaysia, claims to religious piety and learning are an important source of individual prestige. Some of the Sama-Bajau lack mosques and must rely on the shore-based communities such as those of the more Islamised or [[Malay peoples]]. Some of the more nomadic Sama-Bajau, like the Ubian Bajau, are much less adherent to orthodox Islam. They practice a [[syncretism|syncretic]] form of [[Folk religion|folk]] Islam, revering local sea spirits, known in Islamic terminology as [[Jinn]].&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt;
[[File:Tuaran Sabah MasjidAnNur-01.jpg|left|thumb|An-Nur Mosque, the main mosque in the Bajau village of Tuaran, Sabah, Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itc.gov.my/mosque/masjid-an-nur-tuaran/|title=Masjid An-Nur Tuaran|publisher=Islamic Tourism Centre of Malaysia|accessdate=12 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812050346/http://www.itc.gov.my/mosque/masjid-an-nur-tuaran/|archivedate=12 August 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ancient Sama-Bajau were [[animistic]], and this is retained wholly or partially in some Sama-Bajau groups. The supreme deities in Sama-Bajau mythology are ''Umboh Tuhan'' (also known as ''Umboh Dilaut'', the "Lord of the Sea") and his consort, ''Dayang Dayang Mangilai'' ("Lady of the Forest").&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt; ''Umboh Tuhan'' is regarded as the creator deity who made humans equal with animals and plants. Like other animistic religions, they fundamentally divide the world into the physical and spiritual realms which coexist.&lt;ref name="bracamonte2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="limpah"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://houseinthesea.wordpress.com/limpah-tangan/|title= Exploration into Sama Philosophy: OMBOH|publisher=Limpah Tangan [BELIEVE]|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Muslim Sama-Bajau, ''Umboh Tuhan'' (or simply ''Tuhan'' or ''Tuan'') is usually [[Syncretism|equated]] with [[Allah]].&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="limpah"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''[[:wikt:tuhan|Tuhan]]'' (literally "god" or "master") is a common word referring to a supreme deity in various [[Austronesian languages]] in eastern Malaysia, southwestern Philippines, and eastern Indonesia. It originally referred to a different concept of a deity separate from the [[Abrahamic god]], but [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] and other Muslim Austronesian ethnic groups usually equate Tuhan with Allah. Compare with ''[[Bathala]]'' of the [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]] and ''[[Kan-Laon]]'' of the [[Visayans]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other objects of reverence are spirits known as ''umboh'' ("ancestor", also variously spelled ''omboh'', ''m'boh'', ''mbo''', etc.).&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt; Traditionally, the ''umboh'' referred more specifically to [[Veneration of the dead|ancestral spirits]], different from the ''saitan'' ([[Nature worship|nature spirits]]) and the ''jinn'' ([[familiar spirit]]s); some literature refers to all of them as ''umboh''.&lt;ref name="oceans"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanafi Hussin|editor1=Birgit Abels |editor2=Morag Josephine Grant |editor3=Andreas Waczkat |title =Oceans of Sound: Sama Dilaut Performing Arts|chapter =Balancing the Spiritual and Physical Worlds: Memory, Responsibility, and Survival in the Rituals of the Sama Dilaut (Bajau laut) in Sitangkai, Tawi-Tawi, Southern Philippines and Semporna, Sabah, Malaysia|series =Göttinger Studien zur Musikwissenschaft Volume 3|year =2010|url =http://eprints.um.edu.my/11446/1/balancing_th_the_spiritual.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include ''Umboh Baliyu'' (the spirits of wind and storms), and ''Umboh Payi'' or ''Umboh Gandum'' (the spirits of the first rice harvest). They include [[totem]]ic spirits of animals and plants, including ''Umboh Summut'' (totem of [[ant]]s) and ''Umboh Kamun'' (totem of [[mantis shrimp]]).&lt;ref name="limpah"/&gt;

The construction and launch of sailing vessels are ritualised, and the vessels are believed to have a spirit known as ''Sumangâ'' ("guardian", literally "one who deflects attacks").&lt;ref name=Stacey2007/&gt; The ''umboh'' are believed to influence fishing activities, rewarding the Sama-Bajau by granting good luck favours known as ''padalleang'' and occasionally punishing by causing serious incidents called ''busong''.&lt;ref name="ccc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt;

Traditional Sama-Bajau communities may have [[dukun|shamans]] (''dukun'') traditionally known as the ''kalamat''. The ''kalamat'' are known in Muslim Sama-Bajau as the ''wali jinn'' (literally "custodian of [[jinn]]") and may adhere to taboos concerning the treatment of the sea and other cultural aspects. The ''kalamat'' preside over Sama-Bajau community events along with mediums known as ''igal jinn''.&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghosts"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hanafi Hussin|author2=MCM Santamaria|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2008|title=Dancing with the ghosts of the sea: Experiencing the Pagkanduli ritual of the Sama Dilaut (Bajau Laut) in Sikulan, Tawi-Tawi, Southern Philippines|journal=JATI: Jurnal Jabatan Pengajian Asia Tenggara Fakulti Sastera Dan Sains Sosial|volume=13|pages=159–172|url=http://jati-dseas.um.edu.my/filebank/published_article/472/159%20-%20172%20%20Hanafi%20Hussin%20&amp;%20MCM.pdf|access-date=10 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517083538/http://jati-dseas.um.edu.my/filebank/published_article/472/159%20-%20172%20%20Hanafi%20Hussin%20%26%20MCM.pdf|archive-date=17 May 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kalamat'' and the ''igal jinn'' are said to be "spirit-bearers" and are believed to be hosts of [[familiar spirit]]s. It is not, however, regarded as a [[spirit possession]], since the ''igal jinn'' never lose control of their bodies. Instead, the ''igal jinn'' are believed to have acquired their familiar spirit (''jinn'') after surviving a serious or near-fatal illness. For the rest of their lives, the ''igal jinn'' are believed to share their bodies with the particular ''jinn'' who saved them.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt;

One important religious event among the Sama-Bajau is the annual feast known as ''pag-umboh'' or ''magpaay-bahaw'', an offering of thanks to ''Umboh Tuhan''.&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt; In this ceremony, newly harvested rice (''paay-bahaw'') are dehusked (''magtaparahu'') while Islamic prayers (''duaa'') are recited. They are dried (''magpatanak'') and are then laid out in small conical piles symbolic of mountains (''bud'') on the living room floor (a process known as the "sleeping of rice"). After two or three nights, two-thirds are set aside for making sweet rice meals (''panyalam''), while one-third is set aside for making sweet rice cakes (''durul'').&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt; Additional prayers (''zikir''), which includes calling the names of ancestors out loud, are offered to the ''Umboh'' after the rice meals have been prepared. ''Pag-umboh'' is a solemn and formal affair.&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt;

Another annual religious ceremony among the boat-dwelling Sama Dilaut is the ''pagkanduli'' (literally "festive gathering").&lt;ref name="oceans"/&gt; It involves ritual dancing to ''Umboh Tuhan'', ''Dayang Dayang Mangilai'', and ancestral ghosts called ''bansa''. The ritual is first celebrated under a sacred [[Balete tree|''dangkan'' tree]] ([[strangler fig]]s, known elsewhere in the Philippines as [[Balete tree|''balete'']]) symbolising the male spirit ''Umboh Tuhan'' and afterwards in the centre of a grove of [[Pandanus|''kama'toolang'' trees]] ([[pandan tree]]s) symbolising the female spirit ''Dayang Dayang Mangilai''.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt;

The trance dancing is called ''mag-igal'' and involves female and male and ''igal jinn'', called the ''jinn denda'' and ''jinn lella'' respectively. The ''jinn denda'' perform the first dance known as ''igal limbayan'' under the ''dangkan'' tree, with the eldest leading. They are performed with intricate movements of the hands, usually with metal fingernail extensions called ''sulingkengkeng''. If the dance and music are pleasing, the ''bansa'' are believed to take possession of the dancers, whereupon the ''wali jinn'' will assist in releasing them at the end of the dance.

The ''bansa'' are not feared as they are regarded as spirits of ancestors. Temporarily serving as hosts for the ''bansa'' while dancing to music is regarded as a "gift" by the living Sama Dilaut to their ancestors. After the ''igal limbayan'', the ''wali jinn'' will invite the audience to participate, to celebrate, and to give their thanks. The last dance is the ''igal lellang'', with four ''jinn lella'' performing a warrior dance, whereupon the participants will proceed to the ''kama'toolang'' grove. There they will perform rituals and dance (this time with male and female dancers together), symbolically "inviting" ''Dayang Dayang Mangilai'' to come with them back to the ''dangkan'' tree. Further games and celebrations are held under the original ''dangkan'' tree before the celebrants say their farewells to the spirits. Unlike ''pag-umboh'', ''pagkanduli'' is a joyous celebration, involving singing, dancing, and joking among all participants. It is the largest festive event among the Sama Dilaut communities.&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt;

Aside from ''pagkanduli'' and ''magpaay-bahaw'', public dances called ''magigal jinn'' may occur. During these celebrations, the ''igal jinn'' may be consulted for a public [[séance]] and for nightly [[altered state of consciousness|trance]] dancing.&lt;ref name="oceans"/&gt; In times of epidemics, the ''igal jinn'' are called upon to remove illness causing spirits from the community. They do this by setting a "spirit boat" adrift in the open sea beyond the village or anchorage.

A few Sama-Bajau still live traditionally. They live in houseboats (''[[Lepa (ship)|lepa]]'') which generally accommodate a single [[nuclear family]] (usually five people). The houseboats travel together in [[flotilla]]s with houseboats of immediate relatives (a family alliance) and co-operate during fishing expeditions and in ceremonies. A married couple may choose to sail with the relatives of the husband or the wife. They anchor at common [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] points (called ''sambuangan'') with other flotillas (usually also belonging to extended relatives) at certain times of the year.&lt;ref name="jubilado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sather"/&gt;

These mooring points are usually presided over by an elder or headsman. The mooring points are close to sources of water or culturally significant locations like island cemeteries. There are periodic gatherings of Sama-Bajau clans usually for various ceremonies like weddings or festivals. They generally do not sail more than {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on|2}} from their "home" moorage.&lt;ref name="nimmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; They periodically trade goods with the land-based communities of other Sama-Bajau and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Sama-Bajau groups may routinely cross the borders of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia for fishing, trading, or visiting relatives.&lt;ref name="nagatsu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bracamonte"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=2011 International Conference on Humanities, Society and Culture|url= http://www.ipedr.com/vol20/56-ICHSC2011-M10061.pdf|chapter=From the Seas to the Streets: The Bajau in Diaspora in the Philippines |author1=Nimfa L.

===Music, dance, and arts===
[[File:Semporna Sabah Malay-girl-with-headgear-01.jpg|thumb|A Bajau girl clad in her traditional dress.]]
Sama-Bajau traditional songs are handed down orally through generations. The songs are usually sung during marriage celebrations (''kanduli pagkawin''), accompanied by dance (''pang-igal'') and musical instruments like ''pulau'' ([[flute]]), ''gabbang'' ([[xylophone]]), ''[[kulintang|tagunggo']]'' (kulintang gongs), ''biula'' ([[violin]]), and in modern times, [[electronic keyboard]]s.&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt; There are several types of Sama-Bajau traditional songs, they include: ''isun-isun'', ''runsai'', ''najat'', ''syair'', ''nasid'', ''bua-bua anak'', and ''tinggayun''.&lt;ref name="mahali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rahman"&gt;{{cite book|author =Inon Shaharuddin A.

Among the more specific examples of Sama-Bajau songs are three love songs collectively referred to as ''Sangbayan''. These are ''Dalling Dalling'', ''Duldang Duldang'', and ''Pakiring Pakiring''.&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt; The most well-known of these three is ''Pakiring Pakiring'' (literally "moving the hips"), which is more familiar to the Tausūg in its commercialised and modernised form ''[[Dayang Dayang]]''. The Tausūg claim that the song is native to their culture, and whether the song is originally Tausūg or Sama-Bajau remain controversial.&lt;ref name="kunapipi"/&gt; Most Sama-Bajau folk songs are becoming extinct, largely due to the waning interest of the younger generations.&lt;ref name="mahali"/&gt;

Sama-Bajau people are also well known for weaving and needlework skills.

===Horse culture===
[[File:KotaBelud.jpg|thumb|right|The West Coast Bajau [[equestrianism|horsemen]] in their hometown of Kota Belud, with a background of [[Mount Kinabalu]] behind.]]
The more settled land-based West Coast Bajau are expert [[equestrianism|equestrians]] – which makes them remarkable in Malaysia, where horse riding has never been widespread anywhere else. The traditional costume of Sama-Bajau horsemen consists of a black or white long-sleeved shirt (''badu sampit'') with gold buttons (''betawi'') on the front and decorated with silver floral designs (''intiras''), black or white trousers (''seluar sampit'') with gold lace trimmings, and a headpiece (''podong'').

Though some Sama-Bajau headsmen have been given honorific titles like "[[datu]]", "maharaja" or "panglima" by governments (like under the Sultanate of Brunei), they usually only had little authority over the Sama-Bajau community. Sama-Bajau society is traditionally highly individualistic,&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; and the largest political unit is the clan cluster around mooring points, rarely more. Unlike most neighbouring peoples, Sama-Bajau society is also more or less egalitarian, and they did not practice a [[caste system]]. The individualism is probably due to the generally fragile nature of their relationships with land-based peoples for access to essentials like wood or water. When the relationship sours or if there is too much pressure from land-based rulers, the Sama-Bajau prefer to simply move on elsewhere.&lt;ref name="lsp24"/&gt; Greater importance is placed on kinship and reciprocal labour rather than formal authority for maintaining social cohesion.&lt;ref name="bracamonte"/&gt; There are a few exceptions, however, like the Jama Mapun and the Sama Pangutaran of the Philippines, who follow the traditional pre-Hispanic Philippine feudal society with a caste system consisting of [[Tumao|nobles]], [[Timawa|notables]], and [[Alipin|commoners and serfs]]. Likely introduced by the Sultanate of Sulu.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

==Depictions in popular culture==

It has been suggested by some researchers that Sama-Bajau people's visits to [[Arnhem Land]] gave rise to the accounts of the mysterious [[Baijini]] people in the myths of Australia's [[Yolngu]] Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ronald Murray |last=Berndt|first2= Catherine Helen |last2=Berndt|publisher=F.

==Personal life==
He married Colinda Wijnants on 29 January 2011 in Greyton, South Africa.

Brits attended Stellenbosch University and stayed at the Wilgenhof residence while studying.

==Western Province==

==Stormers==

==Saracens==

Brits scored his first try for Saracens on 27 September 2009 against [[Gloucester]], the result: 19–16 to Saracens. Brits scored 7 tries in the 2009/10 season and was praised for his pace and ball carrying skills. Brits played every minute in the Guinness Premiership Final against Leicester Tigers, which Saracens lost 33–27 in one of the most exciting finals in Guinness Premiership history. Brits is now regarded as one of the most exciting players in the English Aviva Premiership.

'''Sylvester Krnka''' or Sylvestr Krnka in Czech (29 December 1825 &amp;ndash; 4 January 1903) was a Czech [[gunsmith]] and [[inventor]], best known for his [[M1867 Russian Krnka]].

== Life ==
At the age of thirteen he entered into the apprenticeship with the well-known gunsmith master Novotny in [[Vienna]] later known as company Springer. Some years later he became a [[Burgess (title)|burgess]] of  [[Volyně]] in the [[South Bohemian Region]] where he shortly had his own workshop since 1848. In 1871 he moved to [[Michle]], then a village near [[Prague]], where he opened his gunsmith workshop (which later became a factory). He died in 1903 in Michle.  
 
Krnka was the designer of a [[Breech-loading weapon|breechloader]] rifle, a conversion of the muzzle-loading Model 1857 [[Rifled musket|rifle musket]].  Although he had been continuously declined by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] military authorities, he was more successful in [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] – in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] his M1867 Russian Krnka triumphed – in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Sweden]] and in [[Norway]].

He had been awarded with many decorations and orders in Russia, Montenegro, Sweden and Norway.

His son Karel Krnka (1858–1926) carried on with his father’s work.

'''Tobias Emanuel Petersen''' (born October 27, 1978) is a retired American professional [[ice hockey]] right winger who formerly played for the [[Dallas Stars]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). He attended [[Colorado College]], and was drafted by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] 244th overall in the 9th round of the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toby Petersen|publisher=Hockey Reference|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/p/peterto01.html|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
During Game 3 of the Western Conference Final in the 2005–06 playoffs, Petersen scored his first ever NHL playoff goal against [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] of the [[Anaheim Ducks]] by stealing the puck and wrapping it into an empty net while Bryzgalov attempted to make a play behind his goal line.

In 2008 Petersen had a memorable experience at the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] All-Star Game. The experience began the day before the game when Petersen won the 2008 AHL Skills Competition's fastest skater event with a 14.001 second lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theahl.com/planetusa-takes-skills-competition-15-9-p134036 |title = PlanetUSA takes Skills Competition, 15-9 |publisher = The AHL.com|accessdate= March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The experience continued during the game as Petersen recorded 3 points including scoring on the first ever penalty shot in an AHL All-Star Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theahl.com/purcell-leads-canadians-to-all-star-game-victory-p134033 |title = Purcell leads Canadians to All-Star Game victory |publisher = The AHL.com|accessdate= March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2013-14 AHL season|2013–14]] season, his 7th within the Stars organization, Petersen helped the Texas Stars to claim their first [[Calder Cup]] and immediately announced his retirement from professional hockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/txstarphoto/status/479848952905207809/photo/1 | publisher = ''[[Twitter]]'' | author = ''[[Texas Stars]]'' | title = Petersen announces retirement upon celebrations | date = 2014-06-19 | accessdate = 2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Toby and wife Alexa have 2 sons: Bjorn (born August 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=148a51bf-8f41-4116-bfb4-f71330f188b7&amp;sponsor= | title = Petersen won't let diabetes slow him | publisher = ''[[Canada.com]]'' | date = 2011-02-02 | accessdate = 2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elliott (born October 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stars.nhl.com/club/recapprint.htm?id=2008020088 | title = Stars vs. Devils | date =  2008-10-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-22 | publisher = ''[[Dallas Stars]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petersen has stated that he is a [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type-one diabetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/hockey/stars/stories/022209dnspostarspeterson.4266448.html| title = Diabetes doesn't slow Dallas Stars' Toby Petersen | publisher = The Dallas Morning News | first = Brad | last = Townsend | date = 2009-02-22 | accessdate = 2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he must use his [[insulin pump]] during games. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins nominated him as their 2003–2004 AHL Man of the Year candidate for his work with Diabetes charities.

==Background==
Paul's father Jack immigrated to the United States from Ukraine with his mother and younger siblings in 1911 to join his father and other family members. While in America, Jack Paul met and married Sylvia Gleicher, a cousin of [[Norman Geschwind]]. Their son William Erwin Paul was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] on June 12, 1936. William Paul attended [[Erasmus Hall High School]] and graduated from Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York. William Paul graduated from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1956 before earning a medical degree from [[SUNY Downstate College of Medicine]] four years later.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaioh/&gt;

==Career==
Paul did his residency at the [[Boston Medical Center]] and [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI). He joined the [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] in 1962 and was assigned to the Endocrinology Branch of the NCI, where he worked for two years. Paul read the writings of [[Michael Heidelberger]], and decided to train as an immunologist. A desire to collaborate with rheumatologist Alan Cohen influenced his decision as well. Paul trained at [[New York University]] with [[Baruj Benacerraf]] and later moved with him to the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID). He succeeded Benacerraf as NIH immunology laboratory director in 1970. Upon the establishment of NIH's Office of AIDS Research in 1993, Paul was chosen as its first leader. He stepped down from that position in 1997. He also helped found NIAID's [[Vaccine Research Center]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaioh/&gt; Paul was the chief editor of the ''[[Annual Review of Immunology]]'' from 1983 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NIH Mourns William E.

'''William Livingston''' (November 30, 1723{{spaced ndash}}July 25, 1790) was an American politician who served as the [[Governor of New Jersey]] (1776–1790) during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was a signer of the [[United States Constitution]].

==Early life==
Livingston was born in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in the [[Province of New York]] on November 30, 1723.  He was the son of [[Philip Livingston (1686-1749)|Philip Livingston]] (1686–1749), the 2nd Lord of [[Livingston Manor]], and Catherine Van Brugh, the only child of [[List of mayors of Albany, New York|Albany mayor]] [[Pieter Van Brugh]] (1666–1740).  His older siblings included [[Robert Livingston (1708–1790)|Robert Livingston]] (1708–1790), 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor, [[Peter Van Brugh Livingston]] (1710–1792), [[New York State Treasurer]], and [[Philip Livingston]] (1716–1778), a member of the [[New York State Senate]].&lt;ref name="Livingston1910" /&gt;

Livingston received his early education from local schools and tutors. At age 13, Livingston was sent to live for a year and prepare for college with the Anglican missionary catechist and [[Yale College]] graduate Henry Barclay who lived among the Iroquois Indians in the [[Mohawk Valley]] at [[Fort Hunter]].&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, Franklin Bowditch, ''Biographical sketches of the graduates of Yale College: with annals of the college'', Holt, 1885, Volume 1, pp.503–504&lt;/ref&gt; Livingston enrolled at Yale in 1737 and graduated in 1741. He went on to New York City, where he studied law and became a law clerk first for the eminent lawyer [[James Alexander (lawyer)|James Alexander]]. He left Alexander's office in the spring of 1746 before finishing his apprentiship due to some disagreement,&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, p.682&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the office [[William Smith (judge)|William Smith, Sr]].&lt;ref name = soldierState&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/livingston.htm | title = Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution| id =CMH Pub 71-25| chapter = William Livingston|  location = Washington, DC| publisher=United States Army Center of Military History| first1 =Robert K.| last1 = Wright, Jr.|first2= Morris J.| last2 = MacGregor Jr.| last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He became a lawyer in 1748&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, p. 682&lt;/ref&gt; and began his practice in [[New York City]]. In 1752, he founded a weekly journal, the ''[[Independent Reflector]]'', along with fellow Presbyterian lawyers [[William Smith (chief justice)|William Smith, Jr.]], the son of his law teacher, and [[John Morin Scott]].  The three were called by contemporaries "The Triumvirate".&lt;ref&gt;Lustig, Mary Lou, ''Privilege and Prerogative: New York's Provincial Elite, 1710–1776'',Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Reflector'' was New York's first serial non-newspaper publication and the only one being published in British North America at the time. It was used as a platform by the political upstate Presbyterian landed "country faction" led by Livingston for challenging the powerful downstate Anglican and Dutch Reformed merchant or "popular faction" led by chief justice [[James De Lancey]]. Most notably the Triumvirate attacked the founding of [[Columbia College, Columbia University|King's College]] as a conspiracy by Anglicans to install a bishop in America, including his former tutor now Rev. Henry Barclay Rector of Trinity Church and his former law teacher James Alexander.

Publication of the ''Reflector'' ceased with the fifty-second issue in late 1753 after political pressure was brought to bear upon its printer, [[James Parker (publisher)|James Parker]],&lt;ref name = soldierState/&gt; but Livingston and his allies continued to attack the college over the next year with columns in newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughey, Robert A., ''Stand, Columbia : a history of Columbia University in the city of New York, 1754–2004'', Columbia University Press, 2003, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; By raising divisive issues of region, he managed to divert half the funds raised by a state lottery for the college to fund the construction of a new jail and a detention house for sailors from diseased ships. King's College was defiantly opened despite Livingston's efforts by [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|President Rev. Samuel Johnson]] in July 1754, and granted a charter by the King on October 31, 1754.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughey, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he failed to close the college, and no bishop arrived as predicted, Livingston remained politically active and served one term in the [[New York Assembly]] until his political allies lost power in 1769.&lt;ref name = soldierState/&gt;

=== New Jersey ===
In 1772, he moved to [[Elizabeth, New Jersey#History|Elizabethtown]] (today [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]), where he rented a house in town. A young [[Alexander Hamilton]] lived here with Livingston for at least the winter while he attended Francis Barber's grammar school.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton John C., ''The Life of Alexander Hamilton'', D. Appleton, 1840, Volume 1, p.8; Hamilton John C., History of the Republic, D. Appleton &amp; Company, 1857, Volume 1, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://discoveringhamilton.com/alexander-hamilton-lived-grammar-school-elizabethtown-new-jersey/|title=Where Did Alexander Hamilton Live While Attending Grammar School in Elizabethtown, New Jersey? – Discovering Hamilton|date=2018-01-22|work=Discovering Hamilton|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livingston started construction of a large country home to house his growing family. The house, known as ''[[Liberty Hall (New Jersey)|Liberty Hall]]'', still stands today.&lt;ref name = soldierState/&gt; After attaining considerable influence amongst the local patriots, Livingston was elected to serve as one of New Jersey's delegates to the [[Continental Congress]]. He served from July 1774 to June 1776. In October 1775, he was commissioned a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of the [[New Jersey Line|New Jersey Militia]].
[[File:William Livingston 1778.jpg|thumb|Letter from Governor William Livingston to Israel Shreve, 1778]]
In August 1776, he was elected [[Governor of New Jersey]] and was reelected to the office each year until his death in 1790.&lt;ref name = soldierState /&gt;  For much of the time between 1776 and 1779, the family was located in [[Parsippany, New Jersey|Parsippany]] for safety.

Liberty Hall was frequently visited by British troops or naval forces since there was a substantial reward for Livingston's capture. One attempt to kidnap him took place in mid-June 1779. False information about Livingston visiting his second home in Parsippany resulted in a raid by Loyalists and their subsequent capture.  The Loyalist mayor of New York City (and a distant cousin through the [[Schuyler family]]), [[David Mathews]], was suspected by being behind the attempted capture of Livingston.&lt;ref&gt;McBurney, Christian. Abductions in the American Revolution, 2016, page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The family returned to Liberty Hall in 1779 to begin restoring their looted home. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1782.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter L |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Livingston led the New Jersey Delegation to the [[Philadelphia Convention|1787 Constitutional Convention]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and was one of the signers of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].&lt;ref name = soldierState/&gt; He was appointed [[United States Ambassador to the Netherlands|United States Minister to the Netherlands]] in 1788 by U.S. Congress but turn down the proposition.

==Personal life==
Livingston married Susannah French (1723–1789) in New Jersey in 1745. She was the daughter of landowner, Philip French III and Susanna ([[née]] Brockholst) French.&lt;ref name="womenhistoryblog"/&gt;  Her paternal grandparents were [[Phillip French]], the 27th [[Mayor of New York City]], and Annetje (née Philipse) French (the daughter of [[Frederick Philipse]]).

===Descendants===
Livingston's daughter, Sarah, was born in 1756 and was educated at home in penmanship, English grammar, the Bible, and classic literature. At a time when women were usually relegated to the kitchen, she was brought up to be politically aware, even serving at times as her father's secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarahlivingstonjay.org/ About Sarah Livingston Jay]. Accessed October 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; who married [[John Jay]] at the age of 17 and became United States [[First Lady]] (age 22) while Jay served as the President of the [[Continental Congress]] from 1778–1779. Sarah accompanied [[John Jay]] to Spain and then [[Paris]] where he, along with [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Henry Laurens]] negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].  She is credited with writing the celebratory Treaty of Paris dinner toast. When Sarah and John returned to New York, Jay was appointed U.S. Foreign Secretary, and her Parisian training came in handy, as she and her husband established the custom of weekly dinners for the diplomatic corps and other guests in the U.S. capital city of New York.  Sarah would go on to serve in her hospitality role as the wife of the first [[Chief Justice of the United States]] and First Lady of New York.

Another descendant of William Livingston was Julia Kean, wife of [[United States Secretary of State]] and [[New York Governor]] [[Hamilton Fish]].

===Legacy===
In 1747, Livingston wrote and published a long pastoral poem entitled, "Philosophic Solitude, or the Choice of a Rural Life". One of the first successful original poems written by an American colonist, it was anthologized numerous times into the 19th century. In 1754, Livingston also played a key role in founding the [[New York Society Library]], which is still in existence over a quarter of a millennium later.

The township of [[Livingston, New Jersey]] was given its name in his honor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingstonnj.org/livingstonhistory.htm About Livingston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727041002/http://www.livingstonnj.org/livingstonhistory.htm |date=July 27, 2011 }}. Accessed March 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Governor Livingston High School]] in [[Berkeley Heights, New Jersey]].

The [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston campus]] of Rutgers University New Brunswick also was given its name in his honor.
