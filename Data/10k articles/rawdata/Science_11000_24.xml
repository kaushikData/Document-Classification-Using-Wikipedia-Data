'''Al-Bakbuk''' is an [[impact crater]] in the northern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Al-Bakbuk was first observed in ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]'' images during that mission's March 2005 flyby of Enceladus.  It is located at {{Coord|5.65|N|191.19|W|globe:enceladus_source:gpn|notes=&lt;ref name=gpn/&gt;}} and is 9 kilometers across.  Since the crater's formation, numerous north-south trending fractures cut across the crater, forming canyons several hundred meters deep along the crater's rim.

Al-Bakbuk is named after one of the barber's six brothers in "[[The Hunchback's Tale]]" in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

'''''Annals of Philosophy''''' was a [[learned journal]] founded in 1813 by the Scottish chemist [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]. It shortly became a leader in its field of commercial scientific periodicals.{{sfn|Morrell|2004}} Contributors included &lt;!--[[Friedrich Christian Accum]], --&gt;[[John George Children]],{{sfn|Bettany|1887}} [[Edward Daniel Clarke]],{{sfn|Wroth|1887}}  &lt;!--[[William Daniel Conybeare]], --&gt;[[Sir Philip Crampton, 1st Baronet|Philip Crampton]],{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, p 170}}{{sfn|Bettany|1888}} [[Alexander Crichton]],{{sfn|Boase|1888}}  [[James Cumming (chemist)|James Cumming]],{{sfn|Bettany|1888a}} &lt;!--[[Michael Faraday]], --&gt;[[John Herapath]],{{sfn|Goodwin|1891}}  [[William George Horner]],{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VI, pp 281 – 283}} &lt;!--[[Agnes Ibbetson]], --&gt;[[Thomas Dick Lauder]],{{sfn|Henderson|1892}}  [[John Miers (botanist)|John Miers]],{{sfn|Boulger|1894}} [[Matthew Paul Moyle]],{{sfn|Boase|1894}} [[Robert Porrett]],{{sfn|Hartog|1896}}  [[James Thomson (minister)|James Thomson]],{{sfn|Carlyle|1898}} and [[Charles Wheatstone]].{{sfn|Thompson|1899}}

Thomson edited it until 1821, when he was succeeded in 1821 by [[Richard Phillips (chemist)|Richard Phillips]]. The journal was bought by [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Richard Taylor]] in 1827, and closed down for the benefit of the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Harden|1898}}

The ''Annals of Philosophy'' were issued monthly following a standard pattern. Often the first article was a biographical article (10 pages) on a living or recently deceased scientist. This was then followed by a series of extended pieces (5-10 pages) on particular topics, sometimes by eminent authors. Then there were shorter news items and correspondence. Summaries followed: first of the proceedings of learned bodies (Royal Society, Linnean, French Institute -if available: the [[Napoleonic Wars]] made communications with the continent difficult at first,{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol III, pp iii – iv}} etc.), then of patents, and finally of new books. The last section was a [[meteorological]] journal. Every six months a title page, index, and preface were issued which could be bound before the six monthly issues to make a half-yearly volume.{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, p iii}}  Including front matter, volumes were just under 500 pages each.{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, pp v–viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol II, pp iv – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol III, pp v – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol IV, pp v – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol V, pp vi – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VI, pp iii – vii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VII, pp iii – vii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VIII, pp iii – vii}}

'''Antinaturalism''' is a view in [[sociology]] which states that the [[Nature|natural world]] and the [[society|social world]] are different. It is closely related to [[antipositivism]], and is the opposite of [[sociological naturalism]].

'''Appreciative listening''' is a type of listening behavior where the listener seeks certain information which they will appreciate, for example that which helps meet his/her needs and goals. One uses appreciative listening when listening to good [[music]], [[poetry]] or maybe even the stirring words of a great leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=John A.|title=Types of Listening|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/kline-listen/b10ch4.htm|accessdate=18 September 2011 | publisher=Air University Press |location=Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama | date=April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Team Approach to Behaviour Management |page=43 |first1=Chris |last1=Derrington |first2=Barry |last2=Groom |publisher=Paul Chapman Publishing |year=2004 |url=http://childhealthanddevelopment.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/different-types-of-listening.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves listening to music that one enjoys, people the listener likes to listen to because of their style and the choices the listener make in the films and television he/she watches, radio programmes and plays and musicals in the theatre.  Unlike [[informative listening]] or [[relationship listening]], appreciative listening does not rely on the message from the speaker it is how one responds as a listener.  Our appreciation of what we hear will vary depending on our individual tastes, but will also be affected by three different factors:

== Presentation ==
There are many different factors that encompass [[presentation]] including the medium, the setting and the style and personality of a presenter. Of course this works both ways and equally you will have been entranced by others because of the force of their personality and their delivery style.

The environment can also impact your appreciation of the presentation. Seating, temperature, clarity and volume of sound will all impact on whether it’s a good or poor experience.

== Perception ==
Perception is an important factor in appreciative listening. As one is exposed to different experiences his/her perceptions can change. For example: individual's taste in music. We need to listen to various [[List of music styles|types of music]] to have a preference over other types and appreciate them. An individual's expectations also affects our perception. 

An individual's perception and expectations are driven by his/her attitudes which determine how he/she reacts to and interact to the world in which he/she lives.

== Previous experience ==
Some of our perceptions are clearly influenced by our previous experience and impact on whether or not we enjoy listening to something, or whether we are even willing to listen. Whether our memories evoke pleasant or unpleasant reminders will affect our appreciation. However, it’s important to remain open to new experiences.  We can develop our appreciative listening skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6657">'''Biological pollution''' ('''impacts''' or '''bio pollution''') is the impact of humanity's actions on the quality of aquatic and terrestrial environment.&lt;br /&gt;
Biopollution may cause adverse effects at several levels of [[biological organization]]: 
* an individual [[organism]] (internal biological pollution by parasites or pathogens),
* a [[population]] (by genetic change, i.e. hybridization of IAS with a native species),
* a community or [[biocoenosis]] (by structural shifts, i.e. dominance of IAS, replacement or elimination of native species),
* a habitat (by modification of physical-chemical conditions),
* an [[ecosystem]] (by alteration of energy and organic material flow).
Biopollution may also cause decline in naturalness of nature conservation areas, adverse economic consequences and impacts on human health. The notion of "biological pollution" and "biological pollutants" described by Elliott (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, M. (2003) Biological pollutants and biological pollution - an increasing cause for concern. Marine Pollution Bulletin 46, 275-280&lt;/ref&gt; is generally accepted in invasion biology; it was used to develop the concept of biopollution level assessment (Olenin et al., 2007&lt;ref name="Olenin2007"&gt;Olenin S, Minchin D, Daunys D (2007).

The magnitude of the bioinvasion impact or biopollution level (Olenin et al., 2007&lt;ref name="Olenin2007" /&gt;) may be quantified using a free online service BINPAS.

In 1991 The Indiana Academy of Science held a national cross disciplinary conference in Indianapolis (McKnight 1993), the first of its find dealing with the issue.


== Biopollution level ==
"Biopollution Level (BPL)" is a quantitative measure of the magnitude of the biological invasion impact, ranging from "no impact" (BPL=0) through "weak" (BPL=1), "moderate" (BPL=2), "strong" (BPL=3) and "massive" (BPL=4) impact.&lt;br /&gt;
Initially the method of calculation involves assessing the abundance and distribution range of a [[non-indigenous species]] (NIS) for a specific area (this can be, for example, an entire regional sea, bay, inlet, lagoon, pond, lake, marina, a sand bank, an aquaculture site etc.). Abundance of a NIS may be ranked as "low", "moderate" or "high"; and the distribution may be scored as "one locality" (when a NIS was found only at one locality within the assessment area), "several localities", "many localities" or "all localities" (found at all localities). Combination of the abundance and distribution scores gives five classes of the abundance and distribution range. Once obtained this value aids in calculating an impact on 1) native communities, 2) habitats and, 3) ecosystem functioning. The calculation is based on ecological concepts, e.g. "key species", "type specific communities", "habitat alteration, fragmentation and loss", "functional groups", "food web shift", etc. Calculations are for a stated time period to enable assessment of temporal changes.&lt;br /&gt;
The method can be used for a single species or for several species for a specific (assessment) area. The method was designed for species in aquatic ecosystems (Olenin et al., 2007&lt;ref name="Olenin2007"/&gt;) but is currently being tested for terrestrial environments and there is a free on-line service [http://corpi.ku.lt/databases/binpas/ BINPAS].&lt;br /&gt;
The biopollution level enables quantification of an impact in a robust manner in a standard and repeatable way. It makes it possible for comparison between different regions and taxonomic groups at different time intervals. The most impacting biota can be readily distinguished for a given region. It does not evaluate whether an impact effect is either good or bad, it states the change in an ecosystem due to an alien species invasion and measures the magnitude of this change. However, the method requires adequate information in order to obtain the magnitude of the impact, assessed at three levels of confidence (low, medium and high) according to the quality of the data available.&lt;br /&gt;
The method is simple to undertake and provide a means of quantifying impacts within any world region. Some assessments have been published (Olenina et al., 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Olenina, I., Wasmund, N., Hajdu, S., Jurgensone, I., Gromisz, S., Kownacka, J., Toming, K., Vaiciute, D., Olenin, S. 2010. Assessing impacts of invasive phytoplankton: The Baltic Sea case. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 60 (2010) 1691–1700&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological Invasion Impact / Biopollution Assessment System (BINPAS) ==
This is a free online system that calculates the magnitude of the biological invasion impact or biopollution level (Narščius et al., 2012&lt;ref name="Narscius2012"&gt;Narščius A., S. Olenin, A. Zaiko, D. Minchin. 2012. Biological invasion impact assessment system: From idea to implementation. Ecological Informatics 7, 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
[http://corpi.ku.lt/databases/binpas/ BINPAS] translates the existing data on miscellaneous [[invasive alien species]] impacts on population, community, habitat or ecosystem into uniform biopollution measurement units. The service is free of charge and available at for anyone interested in biological invasions. Experts willing to perform the assessment for their studied regions are welcome to register and compile the information as contributors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20808">'''Cognitive inhibition''' refers to the mind's ability to tune out stimuli that are irrelevant to the task/process at hand or to the mind's current state. Cognitive inhibition can be done either in whole or in part, intentionally or otherwise.&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite journal| last = MacLeod| first = Colin| title = Concept of Inhibition in Cognition| year = 2007| url = http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~msommers/aging/inhibit0.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive inhibition in particular can be observed in many instances throughout specific areas of [[cognitive science]].

==History==

The early models of what would become the study and concept of cognitive inhibition were developed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition was believed to play two primary roles: the prevention of unwanted thoughts or behaviors, and the [[Psychological repression|repression]] of experiences from infancy and childhood.&lt;ref name=Dempster&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F.N.| title = Chapter 1: A Historical Perspective| journal = Interference and Inhibition in Cognition| year = 1995| url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021992632168?LI=true#page-3| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1023/A:1021992632168| volume=11| pages=1–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed cognitive inhibition was not just a lack of awareness to stimuli but an active process, requiring a constant energy expenditure.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

Other early theories of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists. They proposed that children acquire control of behavior and thought through internalized speech, and that they consciously exhibit a cognitively inhibitory process in order to regulate their own behavior. Cognitive inhibition was thought to develop as mental control over behavior developed.

During the past 30 years inhibitory mechanisms such as cognitive inhibition have not been particularly prominent in [[developmental psychology]], but currently they are undergoing a revival in the study of inefficient inhibition (explored in a later section) and resource limitations.&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt;

==Developmental psychology==

Cognitive inhibition can be seen at work during studies in [[developmental psychology]].  An experiment done by Friedman and Leslie&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; explained children's performance in the [[Theory of mind#False-belief task|false belief task]] as relying on a critical inhibitory process. What this demonstrated is that reaching the age of 3 or 4 triggers cognitive inhibition ability formation.&lt;ref name=MacLeod /&gt; The idea is that children who are 3 or 4 can suppress information from their cognitive experience in order to evaluate a situation from another's point of view. This is very important developmentally as it may interact with the formation of [[empathy]]: cognitive inhibition cannot be so great as to completely block one's experiences while evaluating another point of view, but must be strong enough to enable an accurate representation of that point of view. Other elements of cognitive inhibition that are studied in developmental psychology include memory formation &lt;ref name=Harnishfeger&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harnishfeger| first = Katherine| title = The Development of Cognitive Inhibition| publisher = Academic Press, Inc.| location = San Diego, CA| year = 1995| url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lJ5ubLyVaGYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=harnishfeger+memory+formation&amp;ots=i9OxRMNODo&amp;sig=kk-o4lud62_NJ7Vm5n7RTGSuia8#v=onepage&amp;q=harnishfeger%20memory%20formation&amp;f=false| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[memory inhibition]]. It has been demonstrated that intentional inhibition of memory commitment is not fully developed until adulthood, and is very difficult for children to accomplish. This illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition tasks, such as those in memory processing, are a gradually acquired skill rather than instinctual. Other cognitive functions that are developed gradually throughout childhood include exercising self-control over retained representational structures of information and quickly adapting cognitive processing to changing behavioral situations. Both of these functions were determined to be present throughout development, but not at full capacity until young adulthood.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Davidson| first = Matthew|author2=Dima Amso |author3=Loren Cruess Anderson |author4=Adele Diamond | title = Development of cognitive control and executive functions from 4 to 13 years: Evidence from manipulations of memory, inhibition, and task switching| journal = Neuropsychologia| volume = 44| issue = 11| pages = 2037–2078| publisher = Neuropsychologia| year = 2006| pmc=1513793| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006 | pmid=16580701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the ability to intentionally ignore irrelevant details and to focus attention and [[cognitive ability]] on more relevant details is not present in young children and is a highly developmentally-related process.&lt;ref name=Harnishfeger /&gt;

==Role in survival==

Cognitive inhibition may have played a role in the survival of human children, in what is called [[betrayal trauma theory]].&lt;ref name="Freyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Freyd|first = Jennifer|title = What is a Betrayal Trauma? What is Betrayal Trauma Theory?|journal = Encyclopedia of Psychological Trauma|pages = 76|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|location = New York|year = 2008|url = http://pages.uoregon.edu/dynamic/jjf/defineBT.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In situations involving treacherous acts by a caregiver, a 'cognitive information blockage' may occur that results in an isolation of knowledge of the event from awareness".&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal| last = Todd| first = Peter|author2=Ralph Hertwig |author3=Ulrich Hoffrage | title = Evolutionary Cognitive Psychology| journal = Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology| year = 2004| url = http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/pt/PT_Evolutionary_2005.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This motivated forgetting caused by cognitive inhibition would have been necessary in the past to maintain the crucial relationship between child and caregiver so that the child would survive; therefore, cognitive inhibition has endured through [[evolution]]. For example, a parent or caregiver may have been abusive physically or emotionally to a child, perhaps not intentionally, but the effect would be the same to the child. However, the world outside the protection of the caregiver would be even less forgiving and almost certainly fatal to the child in ancient history. So, they cognitively inhibited the memory of the abuse in order to maintain the relationship.

==Behavioral psychology==
[[Behavioral psychology]] may play an important part in the development of cognitive inhibition.
Cognitive inhibition is believed to strongly influence both sexual and aggressive urges within human society. When signals or stimuli are perceived by an individual, the mind processes the information and the body elicits a response. However, in the case of sexual arousal or perceived aggressive behavior, the individual needs to exercise caution in the cognitive processing of the incoming signals. This is where cognitive inhibition plays its part, preventing the individual from cognitively processing the stimuli and selecting an inappropriate response, thus potentially saving crucial social relationships.&lt;ref name=Dempster2&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dempster| first = F|author2=A. Corkill| title = Neo-interference research and the development of intelligence| journal = The development of intelligence| pages = 215–243| publisher = Hove| year = 1999| jstor = 10.1086/650572| volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior towards others in a social circle is strongly influenced by [[empathy]], which can be seen as a form of cognitive inhibition. Empathy causes an individual to understand the physical/emotional pain and suffering of others. When an interaction occurs, cognitive inhibition on the part of the individual causes him or her to respond appropriately and avoid upsetting someone already in physical or emotional pain. Again, this is important in maintaining [[social relationships]].

Behavioral control is an important application of cognitive inhibition in [[behavioral psychology]], as is emotional control. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is an example of cognitive inhibition failure in emotion control. Correctly functioning cognitive inhibition would result in reduced selective attention to negative stimuli and retention of negative thoughts. "There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material. These deficits could result in prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information thereby hindering recovery from negative mood and leading to the sustained negative affect that characterizes depressive episodes".&lt;ref name=Joorman&gt;{{cite journal| last = Joorman| first = J |author2=K.L. Yoon |author3=U. Zetsche| title = Cognitive inhibition in depression| journal = Applied and Preventive Psychology| volume = 12| pages = 128–139| year = 2007| url = http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/jjoormann/| accessdate = March 3, 2013| doi=10.1016/j.appsy.2007.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anger is another important emotion affected by cognitive inhibition. "Trait anger is a robust predictor of the angry and aggressive response to hostile situational input, but it is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying this personality...individuals low in trait anger systematically recruit cognitive control resources within hostile contexts".&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite journal| last = Robinson| first = Michael|author2=Benjamin M. Wilkowski |author3=Brian P. Meier |author4=Sara K. Moeller |author5=Adam K. Fetterman | title = Counting to ten milliseconds: Low-anger, but not high-anger, individuals pause following negative evaluations| journal = Cognition and Emotion| pages = 1–21| publisher = Psychology Press| year = 2011| url = http://public.gettysburg.edu/~bmeier/Publications/Robinson%20et%20al.%20(in%20press)%20-%20Counting%20to%20Ten.pdf| accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi = 10.1080/02699931.2011.579088 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations that may elicit anger leading to violence arise, cognitive inhibition is used extensively. Hostile stimuli magnitude are considered and ignored to avoid confrontation. Social context situations that may be interpreted as hostile are processed, and through cognitive inhibition, logic and reasoning are used to handle the situation. When a degree of cognitive inhibition ability is absent in an individual, it can result in "trait anger", or frequent angry and violent outbursts at relatively inoffensive stimuli.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; Without cognitive inhibition and its resulting omission of irrelevant or unimportant information, emotional stability can be compromised.

==Behavioral neuroscience==

[[Behavioral neuroscience]] applies the principles of [[neurobiology]], to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior.   Cognitive inhibition is caused by several different interacting [[biological]] factors. The first is the existence of inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]], or chemicals emitted by brain cells to both communicate and inhibit communication between each other. "[[GABA]], an inhibitory transmitter substance that has been implicated in certain simple behavioral measures of inhibition and the control of aggressive behavior, was discovered in the [[cerebral cortex]] in substantial quantities".&lt;ref name=Dempster2 /&gt; Given the [[cerebral cortex]]'s importance in many brain functions such as memory and thought, the presence of the inhibitory substance GABA supports the cognitive inhibition processes that go on in this area of the brain. [[Serotonin]] and [[dopamine]], which can play inhibitory roles as well, are present in the brain in large quantities. All three of these [[neurotransmitters]] are capable of "blocking" the transmissions between neurons, which can ultimately result in cognitive inhibition. In addition, the presence of inhibitory connections in the [[central nervous system]] has been firmly demonstrated (Eccles, 1969). A process known as [[lateral inhibition]], which involves the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, is integral in the biology of cognitive inhibition. It provides much of the [[neural]] background behind it and explains what exactly is going on at the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level.

==Theory of inefficient inhibition==

Many contemporary cognitive theorists postulate models featuring a central pool "of mental resources that must be allocated to the various operations involved in processing, retaining, and reporting information".&lt;ref name=Dempster /&gt; This means that [[working memory]] and the various areas of the [[brain]] responsible for it are theoretically limited to a finite set of "mental resources" or mental capacity with which to carry out operation. Cognitive inhibition, of course, is responsible for determining what is relevant to the working memory and shuts out what is irrelevant, "freeing up space" and mental capacity needed for more pressing matters. In the theory of inefficient inhibition, cognitive inhibition does not perform its function fully, and a shortage of mental resources leads to decreased performance or inefficiency in tasks that require more mental capacity. While inefficient inhibition can result naturally in individuals diagnosed with mild [[cognitive impairment]], this effect is especially pronounced in [[methamphetamine]]-dependent individuals.&lt;ref name=Salo&gt;{{cite journal | last = Salo | first = Ruth |author2=Thomas E. Nordahl |author3=Kate Possin |author4=Martin Leamon |author5=David R. Gibson |author6=Gantt P. Galloway |author7=Neil M. Flynn |author8=Avishai Henik |author9=Adolf Pfefferbaum |author10=Edith V. Sullivan  | title = Preliminary evidence of reduced cognitive inhibition in methamphetamine-dependent individuals | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 111 | pages = 65–74 | doi=10.1016/s0165-1781(02)00111-7  | year = 2002 | url = http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/salo_nordahl_etal_PR2002.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinically, these individuals can be highly distractible and exhibit difficulty focusing, which illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition is being impaired and that inefficient inhibition is resulting. Because of the nature of the [[psychoactive drug]], the brain is unable or reduced in its capacity to shut out irrelevant stimuli to the task at hand, and so tries to process and respond to any and all stimuli. This is most likely due to the effects of [[methamphetamine]] on inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]] like [[GABA]], discussed in an earlier section.

==Failure and deficits==

If an individual experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological results can be extremely debilitating. Patients with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. "Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rosenberg | first = D.R. |author2=Dick, E.L. |author3=O'Hearn, K.M. |author4=Sweeney, J.A. | title = Response-inhibition deficits in obsessive-compulsive disorder; an indicator of dysfunction in frontostriatal circuits | journal = Psychiatry Neuroscience | volume = 22  | issue = 1 | pages = 29–38 | year = 1997 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects have to make a simple motor response (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the motor response when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al. (2002) found that [[OCD]] patients made significantly more commission errors than matched [[panic]] disorder control subjects in a computerized task necessitating the inhibition of responses on a proportion of trials— OCD patients tended to make inappropriate motor responses to non-target stimuli".&lt;ref name=Chamberlain&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chamberlain | first = S.R. |author2=A.D. Blackwell |author3=N.A. Fineberg |author4=T.W. Robbins |author5=B.J. Sahakin | title = The neuropsychology of obsessive compulsive disorder: the importance of failures in cognitive and behavioural inhibition as candidate endophenotypic markers | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 29 | pages = 399–419 | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005 | url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/classes/psychology/psy860/readings/ocd.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.11.006 | pmid=15820546 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, the cognitive inhibition that OCD patients experience can have such effects as impairing response time to significant stimuli and decreasing the ability to shut out irrelevant stimuli. This may be why OCD responses to certain stimuli can be difficult to control. [[Suicidal behavior]] may also be related to cognitive inhibition impairment.&lt;ref name=Devantoy&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richard-Devantoy | first = S. |author2=F. Jollant |author3=Z. Kefi |author4=JP Olie |author5=C. Annweiler |author6=O. Beauchet |author7=D.

Nigg]] |author3=Laurie A. Carr |author4=Fernanda Ferreia  | title = Cognitive Inhibition and Working Memory in Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 591–605 | year = 2008 | url = http://libra.msra.cn/Publication/5486706/cognitive-inhibition-and-working-memory-in-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder | accessdate = March 3, 2013 | doi=10.1037/a0012593 | pmid=18729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that people diagnosed with ADHD experience an impaired cognitive inhibition ability and find it difficult to suppress irrelevant stimuli. The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of [[working memory]] deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on an individual's ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. "In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under ''inhibitory deficit theory'' as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target".&lt;ref name=Zacks&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zacks | first = R.T. |author2=L. Hasher | title = Directed ignoring: Inhibitory regulation of working memory | journal = Inhibitory processes in attention, memory, and language | pages = 241–264 | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego, CA | year = 1994 | url = http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/52B/6/P254.full.pdf | accessdate = March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When speaking, many older adults experience difficulty "finding" the words they want to use, which is evidence of cognitive inhibition skills not functioning properly. Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[ADHD]], or [[OCD]] indicate.

'''''Conraua derooi''''' is a species of [[frog]] in the family [[Conrauidae]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;&lt;ref name="African Amphibians"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmphibiaWeb/&gt; It is found in [[Togo]] and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmphibiaWeb/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt; Common name '''Togo slippery frog''' has been coined for this species.&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;&lt;ref name="African Amphibians"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt; Even feared to be extinct,&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt; a few populations were found in surveys in 2005–2007, after the species had gone unrecorded for more than 20 years.&lt;ref name="Hillers et al. 2009"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''derooi'' honours {{ill|Antoon Emeric Marcel De Roo|fi|Antoon Emeric Marcel De Roo|lt=Antoon De Roo}}, a Belgian ornithologist who was part of the expedition that discovered the species.&lt;ref name=AmphibiaWeb/&gt;

==Distribution==
''Conraua derooi'' is found in southwestern [[Togo]] and adjacent southeastern [[Ghana]] on the Togo-Volta Highlands, as well as in the [[Atewa Range]] in central Ghana.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmphibiaWeb/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt; Records of ''[[Conraua alleni]]'' from eastern Ghana and Togo refer to this species.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt; The [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] is {{ill|Misahohé|de|Missahoe}} (=Misahöhe) in western Togo.&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmphibiaWeb/&gt;

==Description==
''Conraua derooi'' are large frogs (though much smaller than their relative, the [[goliath frog]] ''Conraua goliath''), with males measuring {{convert|76|-|84|mm|abbr=on}} and females about {{convert|74|-|82|mm|abbr=on}} in snout–vent length. The head is relatively large with prominent eyes and a fairly small snout. The [[Tympanum (anatomy)|tympanum]] is not visible externally. The hindlimbs are very long and robust. The toes are long and have distinct adhesive discs and webbing extending midway to the discs. The forelimbs are short but muscular with webbed fingers.&lt;ref name=AmphibiaWeb/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt;

==Habitat and conservation==
''Conraua derooi'' lives in flowing water in forest habitats;&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; they are permanently aquatic.&lt;ref name=AmphibiaWeb/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hillers et al. 2009"/&gt; The [[tadpole]]s develop in streams.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

At the time of the latest assessment by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) in 2004, only one surviving population was believed to exist.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; However, surveys in 2005–2007 located a few populations in Ghana and Togo, after the species had gone unrecorded for more than 20 years.&lt;ref name="Hillers et al. 2009"/&gt; Nevertheless, the species is extremely threatened by habitat destruction and alteration, as well as by human consumption. Further, there is genetic differentiation between the [[Atewa Range|Atewa]] and [[Volta Region|Volta]] populations.&lt;ref name="Hillers et al. 2009"/&gt; Populations within the Atewa Range Forest Reserve seem large and viable; these are probably the largest remaining populations.&lt;ref name=AmphibiaWeb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4677">'''CrocBITE''' is an [[online]] [[database]] of [[crocodile]] attacks reported on humans. The [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] online research tool helps to scientifically analyze crocodile behavior via complex models. Users are encouraged to feed information in a [[crowdsourcing]] manner. The uploaded information needs to be verifiable. The database provides key insights into crocodile attack patterns and draws inferences to save human lives.

==About==
The online database was established in {{Start date|2013}} by Dr Adam Britton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam Britton - Profile @RIEL|url=http://riel.cdu.edu.au/people/profile/adam-britton|website=riel.cdu.edu.au|publisher=[[Charles Darwin University]]|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a researcher at [[Charles Darwin University]], his student Brandon Sideleau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Profile|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brandon_Sideleau|publisher=[[ResearchGate]]|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Erin Britton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erin Britton - profile|url=http://www.expeditions.com/why-us/expedition-team/staff-bio/erin-britton/|website=www.expeditions.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Croc attacks: a new website with bite|url=http://theconversation.com/croc-attacks-a-new-website-with-bite-20671|website=www.theconversation.com|date=3 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a compilation of government records, individual reports, registered contributors and historical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milman|first1=Oliver|title=Crocodile attack database ‘will aid conservation efforts and save lives’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/25/crocodile-attack-database-aid-conservation-save-lives|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ack"&gt;{{cite web|title=CrocBITE - Acknowledgments|url=http://www.crocodile-attack.info/about/acknowledgments|website=www.crocodile-attack.info|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Simon Pooley, Junior [[Research fellow]], [[Imperial College London]] joined hands to further the studies. The collaboration culminated when Dr Pooley met Dr Britton at the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] Crocodile Specialist Group, in [[Louisiana]] in 2014. Brandon was instrumental in designing the database and work on the [[Information technology|IT]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name="univarticle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Laura|title=Crocodile attack project could help save lives in vulnerable communities|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_12-12-2014-16-23-8|work=[[Imperial College London]]|date=12 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program received funds from [[Economic and Social Research Council]], [[United Kingdom]] to the tune of {{A$|30000}}&lt;ref name="univarticle" /&gt; and unspecified resourced plus amount from Big Gecko Crocodilian Research, Crocodillian.com and Charles Darwin University.&lt;ref name="ack" /&gt;

The research already has yielded pertinent observations that provide inside into crocodile attacks. It was observed that most attacks on humans occur from bites of [[Saltwater crocodile]] as against the popular understanding of [[Nile crocodile]]s taking the top spot. The broad category of Nile crocodile attacks were segmented into [[West African crocodile]] and ''Crocodylus niloticus'' (the Nile Crocodile) species to get a clear understanding of their respective attack zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - CrocBITE|url=http://www.crocodile-attack.info/about/frequently-asked-questions|website=www.crocodile-attack.info|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective is that the information will used by communities and conservation managers to help inform and educate people about how to keep safe. The information is vital for [[Australia]] and [[Africa]] where such attacks are more likely than in other parts of the world. This is the only database of its kind with such comprehensive collection of information made available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCafferty|first1=Georgia|title=Australian MP blames 'human stupidity' for suspected fatal croc attack|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/30/asia/australia-croc-attack/|work=[[CNN]]|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|other uses of the word "definition" itself}}

[[File:Blacks-Law-Dictionary.jpg|thumb|right|340px|A definition states the meaning of a word using other words. This is sometimes challenging. Common dictionaries contain lexical descriptive definitions but there are various types of definition - all with different purposes and focuses.]]

A '''definition''' is a statement of the meaning of a term (a [[word]], [[phrase]], or other set of [[symbol]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Bickenbach, Jerome E., and Jacqueline M. Davies. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mAjMaRr9d5gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=definition&amp;f=false Good reasons for better arguments: An introduction to the skills and values of critical thinking]. Broadview Press, 1996. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions can be classified into two large categories, [[intensional definition]]s (which try to give the essence of a term) and [[extensional definition]]s (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes).&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;Lyons, John. "Semantics, vol. I." Cambridge: Cambridge (1977). p.158 and on.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important category of definitions is the class of [[ostensive definition]]s, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Dooly, Melinda. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C5TdV8LgtaQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Semantics and Pragmatics of English: Teaching English as a Foreign Language]. Univ. Autònoma de Barcelona, 2006. p.48 and on&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Terms with the same pronunciation and spelling but unrelated meanings are called [[homonyms]], while terms with the same spelling and pronunciation and related meanings are  called [[polysemes]].}}

In [[mathematics]], a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, instead of describing a pre-existing term. Definitions and [[axioms]] are the basis on which all of modern mathematics is constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Rossi
 (2011) Theorems, Corollaries, Lemmas, and Methods of Proof. John Wiley &amp; Sons p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic terminology==
{{redirect|definiens|the company|Definiens (company)}}
In modern usage, a ''definition'' is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words. The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the ''definiendum'', and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the ''definiens''. In the definition ''"An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa"'', the word "elephant" is the ''definiendum'', and everything after the word "is" is the ''definiens''.&lt;ref name="hurley9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurley |first1=Patrick J. |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic |chapter=Language: Meaning and Definition |edition=9 |publisher=Wadsworth |year=2006 |pages=86–91 |accessdate=2016-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''definiens'' is not ''the meaning'' of the word defined, but is instead something that ''conveys the same meaning'' as that word.&lt;ref name="hurley9"/&gt;

There are many sub-types of definitions, often specific to a given field of knowledge or study. These include, among many others, '''lexical definitions''', or the common dictionary definitions of words already in a language; '''demonstrative definitions''', which define something by pointing to an example of it (''"This," [said while pointing to a large grey animal], "is an Asian elephant."''); and '''precising definitions''', which reduce the vagueness of a word, typically in some special sense (''"'Large', among female Asian elephants, is any individual weighing over 5,500 pounds."'').&lt;ref name="hurley9"/&gt;

==Intensional definitions vs extensional definitions==
{{Main article|Intension|Extension (semantics)}}

An ''[[intensional definition]]'', also called a ''connotative'' definition, specifies the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for a thing being a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]].&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt; Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by [[Genus-differentia definition|genus and differentia]], is an intensional definition.

An ''[[extensional definition]]'', also called a ''denotative'' definition, of a concept or term specifies its ''[[extension (semantics)|extension]]''. It is a list naming every [[object (philosophy)|object]] that is a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]].&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;

Thus, the "[[seven deadly sins]]" can be defined ''intensionally'' as those singled out by [[Pope Gregory I]] as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation. An ''extensional'' definition would be the list of wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. In contrast, while an intensional definition of "[[Prime Minister]]" might be "the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system", an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who future prime ministers will be.

===Classes of intensional definitions===
{{Main article|Genus–differentia definition}}
A '''genus–differentia definition''' is a type of [[intensional definition]] that takes a large category (the '''genus''') and narrows it down to a smaller category by a distinguishing characteristic (i.e. the differentia).&lt;ref&gt;Bussler, Christoph, and Dieter Fensel, eds. Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems and Applications: 11th International Conference, AIMSA 2004: Proceedings. Springer-Verlag, 2004. p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, a genus-differentia definition consists of:
# '''a [[genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
# '''the differentia''': The portion of the new definition that is not provided by the genus.

For example, consider the following genus-differentia definitions:
* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure that has three straight bounding sides.
* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure that has four straight bounding sides.

Those definitions can be expressed as a genus ("a plane figure") and two differentiae ("that has three straight bounding sides" and "that has four straight bounding sides", respectively).

It is possible to have two different genus-differentia definitions that describe the same term, especially when the term describes the overlap of two large categories. For instance, both of these genus-differentia definitions of "square" are equally acceptable:
* ''a square'': a [[rectangle]] that is a [[rhombus]].
* ''a square'': a [[rhombus]] that is a [[rectangle]].

Thus, a "square" is a member of both the genus "rectangle" and the genus "rhombus".

===Classes of extensional definitions===
One important form of the extensional definition is ''[[ostensive definition]]''. This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. So one can explain who ''Alice'' (an individual) is by pointing her out to another; or what a ''rabbit'' (a class) is by pointing at several and expecting another to understand. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical investigations'', Part 1 §27–34&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[enumerative definition]]'' of a concept or term is an ''[[extensional definition]]'' that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the [[object (philosophy)|objects]] that fall under the concept or term in question. Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.

===''Divisio'' and ''partitio''===
''Divisio'' and ''partitio'' are [[Classics|classical]] terms for definitions. A ''partitio'' is simply an intensional definition. A ''divisio'' is not an extensional definition, but an exhaustive list of [[subset]]s of a set, in the sense that every member of the "divided" set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of ''divisio'' lists all sets whose only member is a member of the "divided" set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list ''members'', and not subsets.&lt;ref&gt;Katerina Ierodiakonou, "The Stoic Division of Philosophy", in ''Phronesis: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 38, Number 1, 1993, pp. 57–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominal definitions vs real definitions===
{{Main article|Essence}}
In classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. [[Aristotle]] had it that an object's essential attributes form its "essential nature", and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Posterior Analytics]], Bk 1 c. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' essence, originating with Aristotle. In a passage from the [[Posterior Analytics]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Posterior Analytics]] Bk 2 c. 7&lt;/ref&gt; he says that the meaning of a made-up name can be known (he gives the example "goat stag"), without knowing what he calls the "essential nature" of the thing that the name would denote, if there were such a thing. This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the ''quid nominis'' or "whatness of the name", and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the ''quid rei'' or "whatness of the thing". (Early modern philosophers like Locke used the corresponding English terms "nominal essence" and "real essence"). The name "[[hobbit]]", for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a ''quid nominis''. But one could not know the real nature of hobbits, and so the real nature or ''quid rei'' of hobbits cannot be known. By contrast, the name "man" denotes real things (men) that have a certain ''quid rei''. The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it.

This leads to a corresponding distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' definitions. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means, i.e. which says what the "nominal essence" is, and is definition in the classical sense as given above. A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or ''quid rei'' of the thing.

This preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. [[Analytic philosophy]] in particular is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] described essence as "a hopelessly muddle-headed notion".&lt;ref&gt;''A history of Western Philosophy'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently [[Kripke semantics|Kripke's]] formalisation of [[possible world]] semantics in [[modal logic]] led to a new approach to [[essentialism]]. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are ''necessary'' to it, they are those things it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as [[rigid designator]]s.

==Operational Versus Theoretical Definitions==
A definition may also be classified as an [[operational definition]] or [[theoretical definition]].

==Terms with multiple definitions==

===Homonyms===
{{main article|Homonym}}
A [[homonym]] is, in the strict sense, one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different  meanings.&lt;ref name="RHUD"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homonym homonym], ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' at dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus homonyms are simultaneously [[homograph]]s (words that share the same spelling, regardless of their pronunciation) ''and'' [[homophone]]s (words that share the same pronunciation, regardless of their spelling).  The state of being a homonym is called '''''homonymy'''''. Examples of homonyms are the pair ''stalk'' (part of a plant) and ''stalk'' (follow/harass a person) and the pair ''left'' (past tense of leave) and ''left'' (opposite of right).  A distinction is sometimes made between "true" homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as ''skate'' (glide on ice) and ''skate'' (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or [[Polysemy|polysemes]], which have a shared origin, such as ''mouth'' (of a river) and ''mouth'' (of an animal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/semanticsHANDOUT.htm |title=Linguistics 201: Study Sheet for Semantics |publisher=Pandora.cii.wwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AefSOW9MW5UC&amp;pg=PA123 Semantics: a coursebook, p. 123], James R. Hurford and Brendan Heasley, Cambridge University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polysemes===
{{main article|Polysemy}}
[[Polysemy]]  is the capacity for a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] (such as a [[word]], [[phrase]], or [[symbol]]) to have multiple meanings (that is, multiple [[seme (semantics)|semes]] or [[sememe]]s and thus multiple [[word sense|senses]]), usually related by contiguity of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] within a [[semantic field]]. It is thus usually regarded as distinct from [[homonymy]], in which the multiple meanings of a word may be unconnected or unrelated.

==In logic and mathematics==
In mathematics, definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms, but to give meaning to a new term.&lt;ref&gt;David Hunter (2010) Essentials of Discrete Mathematics. Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers, Section 14.1&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of a mathematical statement changes if definitions change. The precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different than the English definition of the word used,&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Houston
 (2009) How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; which can lead to confusion for students who do not pay close attention to the definitions given.

===Classification of mathematical definitions===
Authors have used different terms to classify definitions used in formal languages like mathematics.  [[Norman Swartz]] classifies a definition as "stipulative" if it is intended to guide a specific discussion.   A stipulative definition might be considered a temporary, working definition, and can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/swartz/definitions.htm#part5.1|title=Norman Swartz - Biography|work=sfu.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a "descriptive" definition can be shown to be "right" or "wrong" with reference to general usage.

Swartz defines a ''[[precising definition]]'' as one that extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) for a specific purpose by including additional criteria. A precising definition narrows the set of things that meet the definition.

[[Charles Stevenson|C.L. Stevenson]] has identified ''[[persuasive definition]]'' as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the "true" or "commonly accepted" meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief). Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are "legal" or "coercive"&amp;nbsp;– their object is to create or alter rights, duties, or crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, C.L., ''Ethics and Language'', Connecticut 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recursive definitions===
A [[recursive definition]], sometimes also called an ''inductive'' definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way. Normally this consists of three steps:
# At least one thing is stated to be a member of the set being defined; this is sometimes called a "base set".
# All things bearing a certain relation to other members of the set are also to count as members of the set. It is this step that makes the definition [[Recursion|recursive]].
# All other things are excluded from the set

For instance, we could define a [[natural number]] as follows (after [[Peano axioms|Peano]]): 
# "0" is a natural number.
# Each natural number has a unique successor, such that:
#* the successor of a natural number is also a natural number;
#* distinct natural numbers have distinct successors;
#* no natural number is succeeded by "0".
# Nothing else is a natural number.

So "0" will have exactly one successor, which for convenience can be called "1". In turn, "1" will have exactly one successor, which could be called "2", and so on. Notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves [[self-reference]]. Although this sort of definition involves a form of [[Circular definition|circularity]], it is not [[Vicious circle principle|vicious]], and the definition has been quite successful.

In the same way, we can define [[ancestor]] as follows:
#A parent is an ancestor.
#A parent of an ancestor is an ancestor.
#Nothing else is an ancestor.
Or simply: an ancestor is a parent or a parent of an ancestor.

==In medicine==
In [[medical dictionaries]], definitions should to the greatest extent possible be:

==Issues with definitions==

===Fallacies of definition===
{{Main article|Fallacies of definition}}
Certain rules have traditionally been given for definitions (in particular, genus-differentia definitions).&lt;ref&gt;Copi 1982 pp 165–169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joyce, Ch. X"&gt;Joyce, Ch. X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Ch. V&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macagno &amp; Walton 2014, Ch. III&lt;/ref&gt;
#A definition must set out the essential attributes of the thing defined.
#Definitions should avoid circularity. To define a horse as "a member of the species ''equus''" would convey no information whatsoever. For this reason, Locking{{specify|date=November 2010}} adds that a definition of a term must not consist of terms which are synonymous with it. This would be a circular definition, a ''circulus in definiendo''. Note, however, that it is acceptable to define two relative terms in respect of each other. Clearly, we cannot define "antecedent" without using the term "consequent", nor conversely.
#The definition must not be too wide or too narrow. It must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e. not miss anything out), and to nothing else (i.e. not include any things to which the defined term would not truly apply).
#The definition must not be obscure. The purpose of a definition is to explain the meaning of a term which may be obscure or difficult, by the use of terms that are commonly understood and whose meaning is clear. The violation of this rule is known by the Latin term ''obscurum per obscurius''. However, sometimes scientific and philosophical terms are difficult to define without obscurity.
#A definition should not be negative where it can be positive. We should not define "wisdom" as the absence of folly, or a healthy thing as whatever is not sick. Sometimes this is unavoidable, however. For example, it appears difficult to define blindness in positive terms rather than as "the absence of sight in a creature that is normally sighted".

===Limitations of definition===
Given that a [[natural language]] such as [[English language|English]] contains, at any given time, a finite number of words, any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon [[primitive notion]]s. If every term of every ''definiens'' must itself be defined, "where at last should we stop?"&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=0OoNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22where+at+last+should+we+stop%22+inauthor:locke&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Bk. III, Ch. iv, 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This problem parallels the [[diallelus]], but leads to scepticism about meaning rather than knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of [[lexical definition]]s, must resort to [[Symbol grounding|circularity]].&lt;ref&gt;Generally [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] seek to avoid circularity wherever possible, but the definitions of words such as "the" and "a" use those words and are therefore circular. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/the] [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/a] Lexicographer [[Sidney I. Landau]]'s essay "''Sexual Intercourse in American College Dictionaries''" provides other examples of circularity in dictionary definitions. (McKean, p. 73–77)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An exercise suggested by [[J. L. Austin]] involved taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. Then, iterating this process until the list of words begins to repeat, closing in a "family circle" of words relating to the key concept.&lt;br&gt;(''[http://www.ditext.com/austin/plea.html A plea for excuses]'' in Philosophical Papers. Ed. [[J. O. Urmson]] and [[Geoffrey Warnock|G. J. Warnock]]. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1961. 1979.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the game of [[Vish (game)|Vish]], players compete to find circularity in a dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined. The [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] claimed that the highest genera (the so-called ten ''generalissima'') cannot be defined, since a higher genus cannot be assigned under which they may fall. Thus [[being]], unity and similar concepts cannot be defined.&lt;ref name="Joyce, Ch. X"/&gt; [[John Locke|Locke]] supposes in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iv&lt;/ref&gt; that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition. More recently [[Bertrand Russell]] sought to develop a formal language based on [[Logical atomism|logical atoms]]. Other philosophers, notably [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' that what counts as a "simple" in one circumstance might not do so in another.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' Part 1 §48&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: "As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one",&lt;ref&gt;He continues: "Whereas an explanation may indeed rest on another one that has been given, but none stands in need of another&amp;nbsp;– unless ''we'' require it to prevent a misunderstanding. One might say: an explanation serves to remove or to avert a misunderstanding&amp;nbsp;– one, that is, that would occur but for the explanation; not every one I can imagine." [[Philosophical Investigations]], Part 1 §87, italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed to avoid misunderstanding.

Locke and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] also argued that [[Principle of individuation|individuals]] cannot be defined. Names are learned by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used.&lt;ref&gt;This theory of meaning is one of the targets of the [[private language argument]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has "fallen under our notice".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iii, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Russell offered his [[theory of descriptions]] in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a [[definite description]] that "picks out" exactly one individual. [[Saul Kripke]] pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to [[modal logic|modality]], in his book ''Naming and Necessity''.

There is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the ''definiens'' can be stated. Wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Investigations&lt;/ref&gt; The examples he used include ''game'', ''number'' and ''family''. In such cases, he argued, there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition. Rather, the items are grouped together because of a [[family resemblance]]. For terms such as these it is not possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition; rather, one simply comes to understand the ''use'' of the term.{{efn|Note that one learns inductively, from [[ostensive definition]], in the same way, as in the [[Ramsey–Lewis method]].}}

== History ==
The project started as a class project taught by professor Thomas Jarboe; after the end of the class, the design was continued by Jarboe and PhD student Derek Sutherland, who had worked on reactor design at [[MIT]].&lt;ref name="cheaperthancoal" /&gt;

As of 2014 [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] densities reached 5x10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, temperatures of 60&amp;nbsp;eV, and maximum operation time of 1.5&amp;nbsp;ms.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} No confinement time results were available. At those temperatures no fusion, alpha heating or neutron production were expected.

==Design==
Dynomak incorporates an ITER-developed cryogenic pumping system. Spheromak use an oblate [[spheroid]] instead of a [[tokamak]] configuration without a central core and without ITER's large, complex [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting magnets]]. The magnetic fields are produced by putting electrical fields into the center of the plasma using superconducting tapes wrapped around the vessel, such that the plasma contains itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/dynomak-fusion-reactor-university-washington/34174|title=University of Washington fusion reactor promises "cheaper than coal" energy|last=Szondy|first=David|date=October 12, 2014|website=newatlas.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynomak is smaller simpler and cheaper to build than ITER, while producing more power. The fusion reaction is self-sustaining as excess heat is drawn off by a [[molten salt]] blanket to power a steam turbine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The prototype was about one tenth the scale of a commercial project, is able to sustain plasma efficiently. Higher output would require increased scale and higher plasma temperature.&lt;ref name="cheaperthancoal" /&gt; 

== Commercialization ==
Unlike other fusion reactor designs (such as [[ITER]]), the Dynomak would be, according to its engineering team, comparable in costs to a conventional [[coal plant]].&lt;ref name="cheaperthancoal" /&gt; Dynomak was expected to cost a tenth of ITER and produce five times as much energy at an efficiency of 40 percent. A one gigawatt Dynomak would cost US$2.7 billion compared to US$2.8 billion for a coal plant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Eminescu''' [[quadrangle (geography)|quadrangle]] (H-9) is one of [[List of quadrangles on Mercury|fifteen quadrangles on Mercury]]. It runs from 216 to 288° longitude and from -25 to 25° latitude. Named after the [[Eminescu (crater)|Eminescu]] crater, it was mapped in detail for the first time after ''[[MESSENGER]]'' entered orbit around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 2011. It had not been mapped prior to that point because it was one of the six quadrangles that was not illuminated when ''[[Mariner 10]]'' made its flybys in 1974 and 1975. These six quadrangles continued to be known by their [[list of albedo features on Mercury|albedo feature]] names, with this one known as the Solitudo Criophori quadrangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/mercuryQuadMap| title=1:5 Million-Scale Maps of Mercury| publisher=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature (USGS/IAU/NASA)| accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/p21.htm| title=SP-423 Atlas of Mercury| page=21| publisher=NASA| accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4811">'''Éphéméride Lunaire Parisienne''' is a [[lunar theory]] developed by Jean Chapront, Michelle Chapront-Touzé, and others at the [[Bureau des Longitudes]] in the 1970s to 1990s.

ELP gives a [[series expansion]] of the [[orbital elements]] and the coordinates of the [[Moon]].  The authors refer to it as a "semi-analytical" theory because they developed their expressions not purely symbolically, but introduced numerical values for orbital constants from the outset; but they also constructed [[partial derivatives]] of all terms with respect to these constants, so they could make corrections afterwards to reach the final solution.

ELP has been fitted not directly to observations, but to the [[numerical integration]]s known as the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris]] (which includes the Lunar Ephemerides), that in their turn have been fitted to actual astronomical observations.  ELP was fitted initially &lt;ref name=ELP2000-82&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Chapront-Touzé |author2=J. Chapront | title = The lunar ephemeris ELP-2000 | year = 1983 | journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume = 124 | pages = 50–62 |bibcode = 1983A&amp;A...124...50C }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[DE200]], but improved parameters have been published up to [[DE405]].&lt;ref name=ELP2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Chapront |author2=M. Chapront-Touzé |author3=G. Francou | title = A new determination of lunar orbital parameters, precession constant and tidal acceleration from LLR measurements | year = 2002 | journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume = 387 | pages = 700–709 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20020420 | bibcode=2002A&amp;A...387..700C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though ELP contains more than 20,000 periodic terms,&lt;ref name=ELP2000-82 /&gt; it is not sufficiently accurate to predict the Moon's position to the centimeter accuracy with which that can be measured by [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|LLR]].  An attempt was made to improve the planetary terms with the ELP/MPP02 lunar theory,&lt;ref name="ELP/MPP02"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Chapront |author2=G. Francou | title = The lunar theory ELP revisited.  Introduction of new planetary perturbations | year = 2003 | journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume = 404 | pages = 735..742 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20030529 | bibcode=2003A&amp;A...404..735C}}&lt;/ref&gt; but heuristic corrections remained necessary.

A theory like the ELP has two advantages over numerical integration:
# it can be truncated to a lower level of accuracy for faster computation, which made it suitable for implementing in programs for [[micro computer]]s.
# it can be evaluated for an unlimited period of time, unlike the results of a numerical integration which has specific moments of begin and end; however the accuracy deteriorates into the remote past or future, depending on the quality of the polynomials that model the so-called secular (long-term) changes in the orbital parameters.  For the Moon, the main secular factor is [[tidal acceleration]]: the magnitude of that effect has become better known after the initial version of the ELP was published, due to a longer base line of LLR observations.

Upon popular demand, the Chapronts also published ELP2000-85 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Chapront-Touzé |author2=J. Chapront | title = ELP2000-85: a semi-analytical lunar ephemeris adequate for historical times | year = 1988 | journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume = 190 | pages = 342–352 |bibcode = 1988A&amp;A...190..342C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book, ''Lunar Programs and Tables from 4000&amp;nbsp;B.C. to A.D.&amp;nbsp;8000'' (1991) with a truncated version of their theory and with programs, that could be used by historians and amateur astronomers to compute the position of the Moon themselves.  [[Jean Meeus]] also used the ELP in his popular ''Astronomical Algorithms'' (1991, 1998).
Finally, the ELP has also been used ''e.g.'' to compute [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/ephemeris.html NASA´s 5000-year canon of eclipses].

'''FluxNet''' is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites that use [[eddy covariance]] methods to measure the exchanges of [[carbon dioxide]], [[water vapor]], and energy between the [[biosphere]] and [[atmosphere]].  Fluxnet is a global 'network of regional networks' that serves to provide an infrastructure to compile, archive and distribute data for the scientific community.  It works to ensure that different flux networks are calibrated to facilitate comparison between sites, and it provides a forum for the distribution of knowledge and data between scientists.&lt;ref name=Baldocchi2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldocchi|first1=Dennis|last2=Falge|first2=Eva|last3=Gu|first3=Lianhong|last4=Olson|first4=Richard|last5=Hollinger|first5=David|last6=Running|first6=Steve|last7=Anthoni|first7=Peter|last8=Bernhofer|first8=Ch|last9=Davis|first9=Kenneth|last10=Evans|first10=Robert|last11=Fuentes|first11=Jose|last12=Goldstein|first12=Allen|last13=Katul|first13=Gabriel|last14=Law|first14=Beverly|last15=Lee|first15=Xuhui|last16=Malhi|first16=Yadvinder|authorlink16=Yadvinder Malhi|last17=Meyers|first17=Tilden|last18=Munger|first18=William|last19=Oechel|first19=Walt|last20=Paw|first20=K.

As of April 2014, there are over 683{{fact|date=April 2018}} tower sites in continuous long-term operation. Researchers also collect data on site [[vegetation]], [[soil]], trace gas fluxes, hydrology, and meteorological characteristics at the tower sites.

According to the Fluxnet website, the goals of the project are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

#To "quantify the spatial differences in carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange rates that may be experienced within and across natural ecosystems and climatic gradients"
#To "quantify temporal dynamics and variability (seasonal, inter-annual) of carbon, water and energy flux densities; such data allows us to examine the influences of phenology, droughts, heat spells, El Nino, length of growing season and presence or absence of snow on canopy-scale fluxes"
#To "quantify the variations of carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes due to changes in insolation, temperature, soil moisture, photosynthetic capacity, nutrition, canopy structure and ecosystem functional type."

==History==
[[File:Fluxnet Growth.jpg|thumb|right|The growth of the Fluxnet Network]]

Scientists have been measuring water vapor and carbon dioxide exchange between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere since the late 1950s.  The relatively undeveloped computing capabilities and solid state measurement capabilities made it almost impossible to be able to get accurate measurements.  Early scientists such as [[John Monteith]] used the "[[flux gradient]]" method to make semi-accurate assessments of the fluxes in a variety of natural settings.  The work of scientists such as [[John Monteith|Monteith]] realized that the Flux Gradient method was not nearly as accurate as it needed to be when used to measure [[trace gas]] exchange in tall [[forests]].  Eventually, they realized that the downfall of their models was caused by "large scale transport in the roughness sublayer".&lt;ref name=Baldocchi2001/&gt; The reason for these data inaccuracies was hypothesized to arise from [[Monin-Obukhov Length|Monin-Obukhov]] scaling theory.

As digital technology advanced throughout the 1970s and 80s, so did advances in the [[sensors]] and [[digital hardware]] necessary to provide the means to make advanced measurements of fluxes with what became known as the [[eddy covariance]] technique.  With this method as well as further advances in digital [[data storage device|data storage]], it became possible for curious scientists to make these eddy flux measurements for long periods of time and consequently get a sense of annual [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapor]] changes in the biosphere.  As these techniques became more widespread in the scientific community, more research groups took the initiative to establish further measurement sites.  Eventually, enough sites were established to allow research of fluxes over wide areas of land with the help of multiple investigators.  An example of such a study is the "Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study".&lt;ref name=Sellers1995&gt;{{citation

With the success of such projects, participating scientists began to explore the idea of creating a [[world|global]] [[computer network|network]] of sensor sites that could be used to integrate their data and provide access for the members of the [[academic]] community and [[general public]].  At a meeting in [[La Thuile, Italy]] during 1995, contributing scientists began to discuss the feasibility of such a network. With the successful conclusion of this meeting, there was an increase in the rate of sensor site installation and the growth of regional networks.  Eventually, the [http://www.carboeurope.org/ Euroflux] network took hold in 1996 and was soon followed by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080916214622/http://public.ornl.gov/ameriflux/ AmeriFlux] network in 1997.  When [[NASA]] saw the enthusiasm from the scientific community for these two networks as well as the possibility to integrate trace gas data from the ground with data from the [[Terra (satellite)|Earth Observatory Satellite]], it finally funded the Fluxnet project as a whole in 1998.

In 2002, Fluxnet was added to the [[NOAA Observing System Architecture]] (NOSA).

==Future site planning==
[[File:Tonzi Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Optimal sites have uniform vegetation and minimal topographic disturbances like the site here at Tonzi Ranch]]

Future FluxNet sites are planned according to a desirable accuracy in the acquired [[data]].  With the current [[computer model|model]] used to determine flux between the surface and the [[atmosphere]], it is desirable to situate the [[scaffold|tower]] in an area with uniform [[vegetation|vegetative]] cover and minimal disturbances in the terrain.  Deviations in [[terrain]] or plant cover would prevent  a constant gas flux along the height of the tower.

Another very important part of the [[sensor]] array is the tower on which it rests.  The sensor tower must fit within a certain design criteria dependent on:
# the height of the vegetation in the area
# the [[average]] [[wind speed]]
# the sampling time of the sensors

Typically, investigators who are monitoring fluxes in agricultural cropland place their sensors close to the ground.  Meanwhile, scientists who hope to measure the fluxes in tall forests must place their sensors on relatively high [[scaffolding]].  The difference in sizes is attributed to the [[boundary layer]]s that form close to the ground because of the vegetation.
To minimize [[turbulence]] from the tower itself, instrumentation is often placed at the top of the tower and offset several feet with the help of booms.

==Instrumentation and data processing==
[[File:Eddy Covariance IRGA Sonic.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anemometer#Sonic anemometers|Sonic anemometer]] and [[Infrared gas analyzer]] are the essential elements needed to measure [[trace gas]] flux]]

Most FluxNet sites have at minimum sensors to accurately measure the wind speed as well as the [[concentration]] of the trace gases in question.  To obtain the necessary [[data]], it is common for the towers to employ a [[anemometer#Sonic anemomters|sonic anemometer]], an [[infrared gas analyzer]] and some sensor to [[hygrometer|measure humidity]].  These tools are necessary because they provide the necessary variables to be put into the eddy covariance model of gas flux in the biosphere.&lt;ref name=Baldocchi1988&gt;{{citation

{{main|Eddy covariance}}

The principle behind the eddy covariance technique is that parcels of [[air]] have [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]] like characteristics in the [[atmosphere]].  In other words, when trace gases are respired by [[vegetation]], their [[velocity]] can be represented by a 3D [[Euclidean vector|vector]].  The purpose of using such a precise anemometer is to measure value of the wind velocity component in three dimensions.  Using the infrared gas analyzer and the humidity sensor, the [[concentration]] of water vapor and trace gases in the air [[sample (material)|sample]] is measured and sent to a computer which quickly figures out the mass flux of the gas in question.  This mass flux makes the FluxNet project a valuable tool to scientists trying to monitor long term changes in trace gas flux within the atmosphere.

{{main|Anemometer#Sonic_anemometers}}

Many different forms of anemometer exist on the current market.  Unfortunately, the majority of the anemometers can only measure [[wind]] velocity in one [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] and require a certain start-up wind speed.  Sonic anemometers are [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices that measure the wind speed by passing ultrasonic [[sound waves]] through the moving air.  As wind speed changes, so does the air [[density]] and when the density changes, so does the [[speed of sound]].  By measuring the change in time it takes for the [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] sound wave to make its way from the [[Infrared|emitter]] to the [[sensor]], the sonic anemometer can measure the total air speed as well as its direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4031756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Infrared_gas_analyzer}}
[[File:Humidity sensor.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a hygrometer]]
This sensor works because [[Infrared]] light is absorbed by a variety of gases at different wavelengths within the spectrum including [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]].  To measure the concentration, a beam of [[light]] is emitted into the air sample.  By measuring the difference between the input and output of the infrared beam, the sensor can determine the amount of the trace gases in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4914719}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is common for an infrared gas analyzer to have two configurations.  The "open design" operates by shooting a beam of infrared light through the air outside of the sensor body.  Meanwhile, the [[closed design]] works by sucking air into the sensor body measuring the concentration of trace gases inside of a [[Seal (mechanical)|sealed]] chamber.  Usually, open sensors are placed within half a meter of the anemometer while closed sensors use a collection tube mounted inside the anemometer to get their air sample.&lt;ref name=Baldocchi2001 /&gt;

{{main|Hygrometer}}
The hygrogemeter is an essential tool used to figure out the concentration of [[water vapor]] in the air.  Unfortunately, water vapor absorbs several frequencies of light in the infrared range and most of these bands overlap that of the trace gases.  Without accounting for water vapor, the Infrared gas analyzer would give false data.  To solve this problem, an accurate water vapor measurement is needed.  [[Solid state (electronics)|Solid state]] hygrometers are designed to have two metal plates separated by a small air gap.  Differing levels of [[humidity]] in the air change the [[capacitance]] of the air gap.  This can be measured by applying a high frequency AC voltage to the plates and measuring the capacitance through an [[RC circuit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">'''Francis Hauksbee the Younger''' (1687 – 11 January 1763) was an English instrument maker and experimentalist.

==Life==
He was son of John Hauksbee, who belonged to the [[Drapers' Company]], and his wife Mary; and a nephew of [[Francis Hauksbee the elder]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=12619|title=Hauksbee, Francis|first=Larry|last=Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected clerk and housekeeper to the [[Royal Society]] on 9 May 1723. [[Augustus De Morgan]] believed that Hauksbee was the first to give lectures with experiments in London, and began them about 1714.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Hauksbee, Francis|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated with [[William Whiston]] on lecture series.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Hauksbee died on 11 January 1763, aged 75.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Instrument maker==
According to an advertisement, Hauksbee made and sold [[air-pump]]s, [[hydrostatic balance]]s, and [[reflecting telescope]]s in Crane Court, [[Fleet Street]], London. His ''Proposals for making a large Reflecting Telescope'' evidences skill as an instrument-maker, and also an acquaintance with [[John Hadley]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
In 1731 was published ''Essay for introducing a Portable Laboratory by means whereof all the Chemical operations are commodiously performed by P. Shaw and F. Hauksbee,'' dedicated to [[Sir Hans Sloane]]. In 1731 also, Hauksbee printed ''Experiments with a view to Practical Philosophy, Arts, Trades, and Business'', a summary of conventional chemical operations, with illustrations of distillation, mineralogy, metallurgy, and dyeing. This publication was a syllabus of a course of experimental lectures, ''Experimental Course of Astronomy proposed by Mr. Whiston and Mr. Hauksbee''.  ''Course of Mechanical, Optical, and Pneumatical Experiments, to be performed by Francis Hauksbee, and the Explanatory Lectures read by Wm. Whiston, M.A.'' covered "Pneumatics". Its scope included, with experiments on the "qualities of air", others "concerning the vitreous phosphori", and "relating to the electricity of bodies".&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Ibercivis''' is a [[distributed computing]] platform which allows [[internet]] users to participate in scientific research by donating unused [[computer cycle]]s to run scientific simulations and other tasks. The project, which became operational in 2008, is a scientific collaboration between the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] governments, but it is open to the general public and scientific community, both within and beyond the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The project's name is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[Iberia]]" and the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''civis'', meaning "[[citizen]]".

==History==
Ibercivis was developed in Spain with the cooperation of the Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems at the [[University of Zaragoza]], [[CIEMAT]], CETA-CIEMAT, the [[Spanish National Research Council]] (CSIC) and RedIris. The project tasks are issued by different scientific and technological centers in Spain with the aim of creating a functional platform for volunteer-based scientific [[distributed computing]]. The project is a [[Europe]]an counterpart to the successful United States-based [[SETI@home]] and [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) distributed computing projects.

Ibercivis' predecessor, the University of Zaragoza-based distributed computing project '''Zivis''', began operation in 2007, and Ibercivis itself started operating in June 2008. The Zivis project was a local distributed computing application funded by the ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (city council) of the city of [[Zaragoza]]. The larger-scale Ibercivis infrastructure has been used for a variety of calculating applications, including [[nuclear fusion]] research, [[protein folding]] and [[Materials science|materials]] simulations. In July 2009, the Ibercivis platform was extended to Portugal following an agreement signed by the governments of both countries during the Luso-Spanish Summit held in [[Zamora, Spain]], in January 2009. Several Portuguese institutions subsequently affiliated themselves with Ibercivis, including the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education|Ministry of Science]], the [[Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology]] at the [[University of Coimbra]], and the [[Laboratory of Instrumentation and Experimental Particles Physics|LIP]] experimental [[high-energy physics]] laboratory.

===Number of participants===
At its inception in June 2008, Ibercivis had 3,000 registered users hosting its various projects. By December 2012, this figure had risen to over 19,800, distributed across 124 countries.&lt;ref name="BOINCstats_IbercivisOverview"/&gt; There are around 55,000 individual hosting devices registered with the project, of which over 3,600 are active on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name="BOINCstats_IbercivisOverview"/&gt;

==Projects==
Ibercivis is intended to run indefinitely, and is designed to run several simultaneous applications belonging to different scientific disciplines, in a manner similar to the [[IBM]]-funded [[World Community Grid]]. Users can select which projects they wish to contribute to via the project's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibercivis.es/index.php?section=channels&amp;id_channel=1&amp;id_subchannel=31#faq7 |title=Faqs |publisher=Ibercivis.es |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2011, Ibercivis encompasses eight different active projects:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibercivis.pt/index.php?module=public&amp;section=channels&amp;action=view&amp;id_channel=3 Ibercivis.pt - Projects]. Retrieved 2011-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Amiloide: searching for drugs against neurodegenerative amyloid diseases''':&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPGrXBJgCeE AMILOIDE, The Movie — Inception Style Trailer], [[youtube.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; the AMILOIDE project aims to search digital libraries of millions of compounds for potential drugs to interfere with the formation of aggregates and [[amyloid]] fibers, which can lead to [[neurodegenerative]] diseases. Currently, the main target diseases being studied are [[familial amyloid polyneuropathy]] (FAP) and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. This project is the responsibility of scientists of the Structural and Computational Biology Group at the [[Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology]] (CNC) of the [[University of Coimbra]].
* '''Neurosim: an immersion in the molecular structure of memory''': scientists at the Institute of Matter Structure, CSIC use the results of the Neurosim application to analyze the structural properties of [[amino acids]] and small [[peptides]] (sequences of a few tens of amino acids) that act in the human [[brain]] and [[nervous system]]. By simulating the so-called energy landscape for each amino acid, key steps can be made in reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of proteins from the amino acid sequence, advancing the study of the structure and function of the human brain.
* '''Adsorption: behaviour of confined fluids in limited spaces''': the Adsorption application helps researchers from the Instituto de Química-Física Rocasolano from CSIC study the [[adsorption]] properties of the [[pillared clay]]s that are widely used as industrial [[catalysis|catalysers]], materials for gas storage, and industrial separation agents. This kind of clay is used in industrial processes such as the production of [[biofuel]]s from [[vegetable oil]]s, the storage of [[natural gas]] at room temperature and the storage of [[greenhouse gas]]es produced by industry.
* '''Cuanticables: quantic wires simulations''': scientists of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] use this application to study the degree to which the faults in the material of [[quantum wire]]s has on their [[electric current]]. For this purpose, they develop a theoretical model which simulates the quantum wire, the impurities and the [[electrode]]s to which the quantum wire connects, and study the behaviour of the current that is generated across the wire when an external voltage is applied to it.
* '''Sanidad: improved diagnostics''': [[ionizing radiation]] is used in health applications ranging from basic [[diagnostic]] tests in a modern hospital (in [[radiology]], [[nuclear medicine]] and laboratory tests) to the treatment of cancer by [[radiotherapy]]. For these purposes, both actual [[radioactive material]]s (in the form of seeds or injectable material) and complex equipment that generates [[photon]] beams and [[electron]]s can be utilised. Physicists from Andalucía use the Sanidad simulations to improve knowledge of the safe use of radiation  in healthcare, and to explore potential new applications.
* '''Criticalidad: electron transport in disordered systems with fractal properties''': the Criticalidad project helps [[Mexico|Mexican]] investigators understand the properties and effects of [[fractal]]ity in the transport of [[electron]]s through [[Chaos theory|disordered systems]] in the [[Anderson localization|Anderson transition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibercivis.pt/index.php?module=public&amp;section=channels&amp;action=view&amp;id_channel=3&amp;id_subchannel=133 Ibercivis.pt - Criticalidad.] Retrieved 2011-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Soluvel: researching solubility of toxic and pharmaceutical compounds:''' the aim of the Soluvel project is to calculate the [[solubility|solvation]] energies of certain soluble compounds, so as to identify through computation which compounds may prove toxic to humans, and which may serve as effective medical drugs. The project is being conducted by researchers from the Laboratory of Molecular Simulation of Separation and Reaction Engineering (LSRE), a division of the Faculty of Engineering of the [[University of Porto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibercivis.pt/index.php?module=public&amp;section=channels&amp;action=view&amp;id_channel=3&amp;id_subchannel=144 Ibercivis.pt - Soluvel.] Retrieved 2011-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Primalidad: search for Wilson primes:''' a "citizen science" project open to all mathematicians, the Primalidad application searches for the next [[Wilson prime]] - the first three having been 5, 13 and 563. It is conjectured that the fourth Wilson prime must be larger than 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibercivis.pt/index.php?module=public&amp;section=channels&amp;action=view&amp;id_channel=2&amp;id_subchannel=138 Ibercivis.pt - Primalidad]. Retrieved 2011-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibercivis furthermore publishes monthly online progress bulletins, featuring interviews with leading researchers involved with the platform's various research projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibercivis.es/index.php?module=public&amp;section=channels&amp;action=view&amp;id_channel=4&amp;id_subchannel=136 "Prensa y Divulgación" (in Spanish)], Ibercivis.es, November 2011. Retrieved 2011-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former projects===
Ibercivis projects that have been completed or discontinued as of October 2011 include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibercivis.pt/index.php?module=public&amp;section=channels&amp;action=view&amp;id_channel=3&amp;id_subchannel=145 Ibercivis.pt - Previous Projects.] Retrieved 2011-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fusion: a star on your screen''': this application helped scientists at the Research Center for Energy Environment and Technology (CIEMAT) and at the Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI) perform simulations of the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s that will be produced in the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER). The ITER project, which will begin operation in 2018, seeks to make [[nuclear fusion power]] a reality, replicating on Earth conditions typically found inside [[stars]].
* '''Docking: looking for anti-cancer drugs''': the Docking application assisted the search for new [[medicines]] through the simulation of [[protein docking]]. The Bioinformatics Unit of the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa ([[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]-UAM) developed a platform to allow the automatic simulation of interactions of proteins and small molecules. Its purpose was to find effective drugs to treat serious illnesses, such as [[cancer]].
* '''Materials: simulation of magnetic systems''': the Materials application aided physicists from the [[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]], Universidad de Extremadura and the Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems in discovering how non-magnetic impurities in [[magnetic]] materials modify the properties of their transition from a magnetic state to a non-magnetic one. The knowledge of these transitions is important not only from a theoretical point of view but also may help develop many fields of [[technology]], such as magnetic [[hard disks]] and [[superconducting]] materials.
* '''Nanoluz: light at a nanoscale''': knowing how [[light]] reacts at a [[nanometer]] scale is a scientific challenge with important implications for the construction of new materials, development of new computing and communication systems and the improvement of technologies such as [[solar panels]]. Using the Nanoluz application, scientists at the Institute of Optics Daza Valdés CSIC investigated the behavior of light in metal [[nanoparticles]], seeking to develop systems that could simplify medical and biological analysis.
* '''IberNet: let's research inside Ibercivis''': with this project, researchers sought to study and represent the structure of Ibercivis as a [[social network]] and try to export their conclusions to other social networks, to help with the study and prediction of the dynamics of a mass social environment.

An '''intensity interferometer''' is the name given to devices that use the [[Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect]].  In [[astronomy]], the most common use of such an [[astronomical interferometer]] is to determine the apparent angular diameter of a radio source or star. If the distance to the object can then be determined by [[parallax]] or some other method, the physical diameter of the star can then be inferred.  An example of an optical intensity interferometer is the [[Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer]].  In [[quantum optics]], some devices which take advantage of [[correlation]] and anti-correlation effects in beams of [[photons]] might be said to be intensity interferometers, although the term is usually reserved for [[observatories]].

An intensity interferometer is built from two light detectors, typically either [[Antenna (radio)|radio antenna]] or optical telescopes with [[photomultiplier]] tubes (PMTs), separated by some distance, called the baseline. Both detectors are pointed at the same astronomical source, and intensity measurements are then transmitted to a central correlator facility. A major advantage of intensity interferometers is that only the measured intensity observed by each detector must be sent to the central correlator facility, rather than the amplitude and phase of the signal. The intensity interferometer measures interferometric visibilities like all other astronomical interferometers. These measurements can be used to calculate the diameter and limb darkening coefficients of stars, but with intensity interferometers [[aperture synthesis]] images cannot be produced as the visibility phase information is not preserved by an intensity interferometer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6230">'''Inventors' Day''' is a day of the year set aside by a [[country]] to recognise the contributions of [[inventor]]s.  Not all countries recognise Inventors' Day.  Those countries which do recognise an Inventors' Day do so with varying degrees of emphasis and on different days of the year.

==By location==
===Argentina===
[[Image:Ladislao Biro Argentina Circa 1978.JPG|150px|thumb|right|[[László József Bíró]]]]
The Inventors' Day ({{lang-es|Día del Inventor}}) in [[Argentina]] has been celebrated since 1986 and is held yearly on 29 September, the birthday of the inventor of the [[ballpoint pen]], [[László József Bíró]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Well-known 20th and 21st century Hungarians |publisher=MTI – Hungarian News Agency Corp |accessdate=2008-04-28 |url=http://english.mti.hu/default.asp?menu=6&amp;cat=33 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409110845/http://english.mti.hu/default.asp?menu=6&amp;cat=33 |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria, Germany and Switzerland===
[[Image:Hedy Lamarr in Dishonored Lady 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hedy Lamarr]], actress and inventor]]
The Inventors' Day ({{lang-de|Tag der Erfinder}}) in the German-speaking countries [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] is celebrated on 9 November, the birthday of the Austrian-born inventor and [[Hollywood]] [[actress]] [[Hedy Lamarr]] whose main [[invention]] was the [[frequency hopping|frequency-hopped spread spectrum]] 1942.

The day was proclaimed by [[Berlin]] [[inventor]] and [[entrepreneur]] [[Gerhard Muthenthaler]].  According to the website of the organisation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inventors-day.com|title=Inventors Day - November 9 - Inventor Promotion Invention Ideas Innovations Inventing|first=Marijan|last=Jordan|website=www.inventors-day.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it intends to pursue the following goals:
* Encourage people towards their own ideas and for a change to the better
* Remind people of forgotten inventors

=== Hungary ===
[[File:GyorgyiNIH.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1937]]
''Hungarian Inventors' Day'' (&lt;!--{{lang-hu|Magyar Feltalálók Napja}}--&gt;[[:hu:Magyar Feltalálók Napja|Magyar Feltalálók Napja]]) is celebrated on 13 June in memoriam of [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] who registered his national patent about the synthesized [[Vitamin C]] in 1941. It is celebrated by the Association of Hungarian Inventors (MAFE) since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inventor.hu/mfn/mfn3.htm|title=Hungarian Inventors' Day/Magyar Feltalálók Napja official page, 201|website=www.inventor.hu|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moldova===
Since 1995, the [[Republic of Moldova]] has celebrated an '''Inventors' and Rationalizers' Day''' annually at the end of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inventors and Rationalizers Day |publisher=State Agency on Intellectual Property of the Republic of Moldova (AGEPI) |url=http://www.agepi.md/en/noutati/detail.php?ID=684 |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Since 1957, [[Russia]] has celebrated an '''Inventors' and Rationalizers' Day''' ({{lang-ru|День изобретателя и рационализатора}}) annually at the last Saturday of June.

===Thailand===
[[Thailand]] recognises 2 February as '''Inventors' Day''' each year.  The [[Thai Cabinet]] set this date to commemorate the anniversary of His Majesty King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]’s allocation of a patent for a ''slow speed surface aerator'' on 2 February 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 2007 Inventors' Day Project |publisher=National Research Council of Thailand |url=http://nrct.net/eng/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1284 |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2008-04-28}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

While as of yet, the United Kingdom does not officially recognize an Inventor's Day, in 2014 [[BT Group|BT]] made a public appeal to celebrate "the first" National Inventor's Day on 2 December 2014. While many countries celebrate inventiveness on a significant day relating to one of that country's inventors, 2 December does not appear to have such a relationship. However, the day was also the release of a study by BT of the inventiveness of UK residents.&lt;ref name="BT Plc 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=BT launches first National Inventors Day to inspire the next generation of inventive thinkers | website=BT Plc | date=2014-12-02 | url=http://www.btplc.com/Innovation/Innovationnews/InventorsDay/index.htm | access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 9 November, 2016 there has not been any announcement of a second or subsequent National Inventor's Day in the United Kingdom.

[[Image:Edison-at home in Ft. Myers Florida 1914 detail LC-LC-USZ62-131044, adjusted.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Thomas Alva Edison]]]]

[[Ronald Reagan]] as [[President of the United States]] proclaimed 11 February 1983 as '''National Inventors' Day''', [http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1983/11283i.htm Proclamation 5013], to "...call upon the people of the [[United States]] to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities".

In recognition of the enormous contribution [[inventor]]s make to the nation and the world, the [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution 140 (Public Law 97 – 198), has designated 11 February, the anniversary of the birth of the inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]], who held over 1,000 [[patent]]s, as '''National Inventors' Day'''.

'''Johann Baptist Emanuel Pohl''' (23 February 1782, [[Česká Kamenice]] ({{lang-de|Böhmisch Kamnitz}}) – 22 May 1834, Vienna) was an [[Austria]]n [[botanist]], [[entomologist]], [[geologist]], and [[physician]].

==Biography==
Johan Emanuel Pohl grew up in ''Politz an der Elbe'' (''Boletice nad Labem''−{{cs icon}} of northwestern [[Bohemia]], in the present day [[Děčín District]] of the northern [[Czech Republic]]. 

He studied in [[Prague]], and graduated as Doctor of Medicine in 1808. 

While he taught botany at the University he became librarian and curator of the collections of the Princess [[Kinsky]].  After a stint teaching at the University he worked in military hospitals in [[Náchod]] and Prague.

In this period he published the ''Tentamen florae bohemicae'' of which only the two first volumes got published: ''Expositio generalis anatomica organi auditus per classes animalium''  and ''Systematischer Überblick der Reihenfolge der einfachen Fossilien''.

He made his professional name in several branches of natural history. 

===Brazil===
In 1817, he accompanied the [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Archduchess Leopoldine]] to [[Brazil]] on the occasion of her marriage to [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Pohl, Johann Emanuel|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then was chosen by his government to participate in the [[Austrian Brazil Expedition]] in charge of mineralogy and geology. 

After the return of [[Johann Christian Mikan|Dr. Mikan]] to Europe, he was responsible for the botany collections as well.
Pohl spent four years between 1817 and 1821 in Brazil, during which he explored mainly the provinces of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Goias]], [[Bahia]]; as well as the province of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] as far as the District of [[Itha Grande]].

His voluminous collections, among them some 4000 specimens of plants, were housed with the rest of the expedition collections in the Brazil Museum of Vienna, which included also two live 'human specimens' − a pair of [[Botocudo]] tribespeople. The woman died soon after, and the man was eventually returned to his native homeland. 

After his return to Europe, Pohl served as a curator at the [[Naturhistorisches Museum|Vienna Natural History Museum]] and the Brazil Museum of Vienna until his death.

'''John Browning''' (c.1831 – 1925) was an English inventor and manufacturer of precision [[scientific instruments]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. He hailed from a long line of English instrument makers and transformed the family business from one dealing in [[nautical instrument]]s to one specialising in scientific instruments. Browning was particularly well known for his advances in the fields of [[spectroscopy]], [[astronomy]], and [[optometry]].

==Background==

John Browning was born around 1831 in [[Kent]], England, the city recorded variously as [[Bexley]] or [[Welling]].&lt;ref name=di&gt;{{cite web|last=Browning|first=John|title=England &amp; Wales, Death Index: 1916–2005|publisher=England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes.

==Choice of profession==

[[File:Spectrum Apparatus.jpg|thumb|left|Spectrum apparatus of John Browning]]
John Browning initially intended to follow the medical profession, and entered [[Guy's Hospital]], a teaching hospital and the location of a school of medicine. Despite having passed the required examinations, however, he abandoned his plans due to ill health. Instead, he apprenticed with his father, William Spencer Browning.&lt;ref name=cyc/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; At the same time, in the late 1840s, he was also a student at the [[Royal College of Chemistry]].&lt;ref name=rsnr&gt;{{cite journal|title=Technical assistance in the world of London science, 1850–1900|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|date=March 2008|volume=62|issue=1|pages=51–75|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2007.0033|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/62/1/51.full|accessdate=20 April 2012|author=Hannah Gay}}&lt;/ref&gt; When John Browning came of age, he joined his father in the family business. However, he decided to change the nature of the business, due to increasing competition in the making of nautical instruments. Instead, he elected to pursue the design and manufacture of scientific instruments.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In 1856, he assumed sole ownership of the enterprise.&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite web|title=A sun diagonal for observing the sun|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=230591|website=powerhousemuseum.com|publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Australia|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory was at 111 [[Minories]], London for decades; it moved to 63 Strand, London in 1872. There was an additional London workshop at 6 Vine Street.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; John Browning's choice of profession was somewhat unusual for a graduate of the Royal College of Chemistry. Those who were inclined to become entrepreneurs tended to enter more chemically-oriented businesses, or have been associated with them before matriculating.&lt;ref name=rsnr/&gt;

==Scientific instruments==

[[File:Guildhall Menu for Shah of Persia.png|thumb|180px|right|Section of 1873 [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] menu]]
Between 1856 and 1872, Browning acquired provisional patents for designs of numerous scientific instruments. He was also the recipient of an award at the 1862 International Exhibition held in London. He was recognised for his temperature-compensated aneroid barometer.&lt;ref name=power/&gt; Browning's scientific instruments were used in physics, chemistry, and biology. The products he designed and manufactured included spectroscopes, telescopes, microscopes, barometers, photometers, cameras, ophthalmoscopes, and electrical equipment such as electric lamps.&lt;ref name=cyc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rsnr/&gt;&lt;ref name=how/&gt;&lt;ref name=opt/&gt;

==Spectroscopes==

[[File:Capron Rainband Spectrum.png|thumb|left|[[John Rand Capron|J. Rand Capron]] rainband spectrum published in the second (1882) edition of ''How to Work With the Spectroscope'']]
John Browning was perhaps best known as the leading manufacturer of spectroscopes. His were considered to be of the highest quality in England.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In 1865, he supplied photographer [[William Henry Fox Talbot]] (1800–1877) with a custom-made spectroscope.&lt;ref name=power/&gt; His crafting of fine spectroscopes strengthened his connection to the field of chemistry. In April 1872, Browning exhibited one of his spectroscopes at the [[Royal Society]], more formally known as the [[Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge]].&lt;ref name=rsnr/&gt; In his 1878 book ''How to Work With the Spectroscope: A Manual of Practical Manipulation With Spectroscopes of All Kinds'', John Browning provided an overview of the field of spectroscopy, and the book became well known among spectroscopists.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Work With the Spectroscope: A Manual of Practical Manipulation With Spectroscopes of All Kinds|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 9781108014182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EW8v8ktac9UC&amp;q=John+Browning#v=snippet&amp;q=John%20Browning&amp;f=false|author=John Browning|accessdate=20 April 2012|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Work With the Spectroscope: A Manual of Practical Manipulation With Spectroscopes of All Kinds|date=1878|publisher=John Browning|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VTQDAAAAQAAJ|author=John Browning|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been published in a number of editions, most recently on 3 June 2010 by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref name=how/&gt; 
	
While the first edition of 1878 contained only black and white images, the second edition of ''How to Work With the Spectroscope'' included one notable colour illustration ''(pictured)''. It was of the rainband spectrum by lawyer and scientist [[John Rand Capron]].&lt;ref name=howII&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Work With the Spectroscope|date=1882|publisher=Browning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_nMvWN0gTAC&amp;q=Browning#v=snippet&amp;q=Browning&amp;f=false|author=John Browning (F.R.A.S)|accessdate=26 April 2012|page=Before Title Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared as a black and while image in ''Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine''. However, the second, 1882 edition of John Browning's handbook reproduced the plate in colour.&lt;ref name=howII/&gt; It demonstrated [[Fraunhofer lines|Joseph von Fraunhofer's solar lines]] A-F, with the rainband adjacent to the D lines.&lt;ref name=rain&gt;{{cite web|title=Spectrum of Rain|url=http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2008/NewsletterJanuary2008Smith.html|website=hssonline.org|publisher=History of Science Society|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, scientists were interested in the rainband for its potential in the detection of atmospheric water vapour and, therefore, the prediction of rain. Evaluation of the rainband represented the first attempt to use spectroscopy in the field of meteorology.&lt;ref name=rain/&gt; Scottish astronomer [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]] supported the contention that water vapour bands could be used to predict rainfall in the 22 July 1875 issue of ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=rain/&gt; While the topic of the rainband and its use in meteorology was controversial, John Browning (and his competitors) manufactured pocket spectroscopes designed to show the rainband and marketed them as meteorological tools.&lt;ref name=howII/&gt;&lt;ref name=rain/&gt;

==Royal Astronomical Society==

[[File:Solar Automatic Spectroscope.png|thumb|right|Solar automatic [[spectroscope]] of John Browning, to be used with [[telescope]]s]]
An astronomer, Browning was also Optical and Physical Instrument Maker to Her Majesty's Government. As such, he supplied telescopes to the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in [[Greenwich]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web|title=John Browning, English instrument maker|url=http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/223753/enlarge#|website=sciencephoto.com|publisher=SciencePhotoLibrary|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browning also attached spectroscopes to telescopic equipment, garnering the attention of astronomical physicists [[Norman Lockyer|J. Norman Lockyer]] and [[William Huggins]].&lt;ref name=rsnr/&gt; He was elected to the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1865. Browning was a pioneer in the manufacture of reflecting telescopes and bringing them to the attention of astronomers.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; As the popularity of astronomy grew during the 19th century, his business in telescopes flourished.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; An advocate of the Newtonian reflector, he was the author of ''A Plea for Reflectors, Being a Description of the New Astronomical Telescopes With Silvered-glass Specula'', first published in 1867.&lt;ref name=cyc/&gt;&lt;ref name=braye/&gt; By 1876, the book was in its sixth printing.&lt;ref name=braye/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Plea for Reflectors, Being a Description of the New Astronomical Telescopes With Silvered-Glass Specula|date=1876|publisher=J.

When he delayed in providing Lockyer with a spectroscope until it performed to his high standards, Lockyer missed the opportunity of being the first astronomer to observe a prominence on the uneclipsed sun. While the delay was only partially responsible for Lockyer's missed opportunity, there is evidence that Browning long regretted his reluctance to part with the spectroscope in question.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Browning made a number of instruments for Lockyer, among them an 8-inch reflecting telescope that was delivered to Lockyer in 1871 and now greets visitors near the main door of the [[Lockyer Observatory and Planetarium|Norman Lockyer Observatory]] in [[Sidmouth]], Devon.&lt;ref name=lockyer&gt;{{cite web|title=The Browning 8-inch Reflecting Telescope (1871)|url=http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/nlo/tour/browning.htm|website=projects.exeter.ac.uk|publisher=Norman Lockyer Observatory|accessdate=27 April 2012|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the late 1860s, in his quest to produce telescopes for a growing market, Browning collaborated with George Henry With (1827–1904), former schoolmaster at the Blue Coat School in [[Hereford]]. With was talented at producing high quality, large reflecting mirrors.&lt;ref name=braye/&gt;&lt;ref name=lockyer/&gt;

==British Optical Association==

[[File:Diagram of the Eye.png|thumb|left|Diagram of the eye in ''Our Eyes'' (1883)]]
By the early 1870s, practical optics had become John Browning's primary interest, and he listed his occupation as optician on the census records from 1871 to 1901.&lt;ref name=census/&gt;&lt;ref name=censu/&gt;&lt;ref name=cen/&gt;&lt;ref name=cens/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was well known among London's ophthalmic surgeons for his various ophthalmic instruments.&lt;ref name=power/&gt; Browning had a large part in reforming the art of crafting spectacles.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Employees of his company tested people's eyesight and made eyeglasses for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nineteenth Century Spectacles|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/spectacles/nineteen.cfm|website=college-optometrists.org|publisher=The College of Optometrists|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Browning was the author of the book, ''How to Use Our Eyes and How to Preserve them by the Aid of Spectacles''.&lt;ref name=oureyes&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Use Our Eyes and How to Preserve Them by the Aid of Spectacles|date=1883|publisher=Chatto and Windus, Piccadilly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDcDAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=Browning#v=snippet&amp;q=Browning&amp;f=false|author=John Browning (F.R.A.S.)|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1883, the book included thirty-seven illustrations, including a diagram demonstrating the anatomy of the eye ''(pictured)''.&lt;ref name=oureyes/&gt; In 1895, he was one of the founders of the [[British Optical Association]], the first professional and examining organisation for optometry. He was not only its first president, but also registered as its first member, so that many consider him to be the first professional optometrist.&lt;ref name=opt&gt;{{cite web|title=September 2009 – John Browning Jeweller's Spectroscope|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/month/sep2009.cfm|website=college-optometrists.org|publisher=The College of Optometrists|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other professional organisations==

Browning was also a member of [[The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain]]. In 1871, he constructed the first [[wind tunnel]], located in Greenwich at Penn's Marine Engineering Works. It had been designed by another member of the Aeronautical Society, British engineer [[Francis Herbert Wenham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Wind Tunnels|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/first_wind_tunnels/Tech34.htm|website=centennialofflight.net|publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of other scientific organisations, such as the [[Microscopical Society of London]], the Meteorological Society, and the [[Royal Institution]].&lt;ref name=power/&gt;

==Marriage and family==

Based on census and marriage records, John Browning married at least three times. In 1871, Browning lived in [[Richmond, Surrey]] with three unmarried sisters. Browning is identified as married, but no wife or child is recorded. His occupation is identified as "optician, master (employing 61 workpeople)."&lt;ref name=census/&gt; On 18 February 1874, a widowed Browning married widow Charlotte Hotten, née Stringer, at St Mary's Church in [[Lewisham]], Kent. His wife Charlotte, a resident of Lewisham, was the daughter of William Stringer. Browning's father was recorded as William Browning (deceased). Both his occupation and that of his father were listed as optician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Browning|first=John|title=London, England, Marriages and Banns, 1754–1921|publisher=Church of England Parish Registers, 1754–1921. London Metropolitan Archives (as re-printed on Ancestry.com)|url=http://ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, John Browning was in residence at [[Croydon]] in Surrey. He lived with his wife Charlotte, sister Emma, and daughter Maria Browning, as well as stepdaughters Florence and Gertrude Hotten. John Browning's profession was listed as "master optician employing 20 men."&lt;ref name=censu/&gt; He was widowed in 1888, his wife Charlotte dying on 13 March 1888 in Croydon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Browning|first=Charlotte|title=England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1861–1941|publisher=Calendar of the Grants of Probate and Letters of Administration made in the Probate Registries of the High Court of Justice in England.

Widower John Browning remarried on 24 July 1890 at the Church of Holy Trinity, Clapham on [[Clapham Common]] in [[Clapham]], London, at the time recorded as Surrey.&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite web|last=Browning|first=John|title=London, England, Marriages and Banns, 1754–1921|publisher=Church of England Parish Registers, 1754–1921.

Their marriage record and John Browning's death record are most probably responsible for the difference in dates of birth cited for John Browning in a variety of publications. The marriage record suggests that he was born around 1835, with a given age of 55 at marriage, while his death record suggests that his birth occurred about 1831.&lt;ref name=di/&gt;&lt;ref name=marriage/&gt; Browning's father was listed as William Browning (deceased), with his profession that of optician.

==Retirement and death==

The company of W. Watson &amp; Son, opticians and camera makers, was founded in London in 1837. In 1900, that company took over John Browning &amp; Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="894">A '''land lab''' is an area of land that has been set aside for use in [[biology|biological]] studies.  Thus, it is literally an outdoor laboratory based on an area of land.

Studies may be elementary or advanced.  For instance, students may simply be given the task of identifying all the [[tree]] species in a land lab, or an advanced student may be doing an intensive survey of the microbial life forms found in a [[soil]] sample.

Land labs are often marked out in plots or [[transect]]s for studies.  A plot may be any size, usually marked out in square meters.  This allows for more intensive, delimited studies of changes and inventories of [[biota (ecology)|biota]].  Transects are straight lines at which, at intervals, measurements are taken for a profile of the [[ecology|ecological]] community.

[[File:Countries by Birth Rate in 2014.svg|thumb|550px|Countries by birth rate, 2014.]]

This article includes three versions of the '''list of countries by crude [[birth rate]]'''.

== Methodology ==
Crude birth rate refers to the number of births over a given period divided by the person-years lived by the population over that period. 

It is expressed as number of births per 1,000 population.
The first list is based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "2011 annual statistics".

Lists 236 countries and territories in 2011 crude birth rate.

The second list is based on [[World Bank]] Data for the year 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN?order=wbapi_data_value_2010+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc Worldbank - Birth rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third list is based on [[CIA World Factbook]] estimates for years 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2054rank.html The World Factbook - Birth rate]&lt;/ref&gt; Dependent territories and not fully recognized states are not ranked.

'''Liulin-type''' is a class of [[Mass spectrometry|spectrometry]]-[[dosimetry]] instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=21177270 | doi=10.1093/rpd/ncq506 | volume=144 | title=Liulin-type spectrometry-dosimetry instruments | year=2011 | journal=Radiat Prot Dosimetry | pages=675–9 | last1 = Dachev Ts | first1 = Dimitrov P | last2 = Tomov | first2 = B | last3 = Matviichuk | first3 = Y | last4 = Spurny | first4 = F | last5 = Ploc | first5 = O | last6 = Brabcova | first6 = K | last7 = Jadrnickova | first7 = I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The first Liulin device  was developed in 1986-1988 time period for the scientific program of the second Bulgarian cosmonaut for the flight on “MIR” space station.

All Liulin type dosimetric instruments use one or more silicon detectors and measure the deposited energy and number of particles into the detector(s) when charged particles hit the device, that allowing it to calculate the dose rate and particle flux.

The measurements in the LIULIN instrument were based on a single silicon detector followed by a charge-sensitive shaping amplifier (CSA). The number of the pulses at the output of CSA above a given threshold was proportional to the particle flux hitting the detector; the amplitude of the pulses at the output of CSA was proportional to the particles deposited energy. Further the integral of the energy depositions of the particles accumulated in the detector during the measurement interval allowed calculation of the dose rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dachev | first1 = Ts.P. | last2 = Matviichuk | first2 = Yu.N. | last3 = Semkova | first3 = J.V. | last4 = Koleva | first4 = R.T. | last5 = Boichev | first5 = B. | last6 = Baynov | first6 = P. | last7 = Kanchev | first7 = N.A. | last8 = Lakov | first8 = P. | last9 = Ivanov | first9 = Ya.J. | last10 = Tomov | first10 = B.T. | last11 = Petrov | first11 = V.M. | last12 = Redko | first12 = V.I. | last13 = Kojarinov | first13 = V.I. | last14 = Tykva | first14 = R. | year = 1989 | title = Space radiation dosimetry with active detections for the scientific program of the second Bulgarian cosmonaut on board the Mir space station | doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(89)90445-6 | journal = Adv.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16624">Thousands of plant diseases have been recorded throughout the world, many of these causing heavy crop losses. Early detection and accurate diagnosis is essential for the effective management of plant disease. Thus the first step in studying any disease is its timely detection of the diseased plant. Quick initial detection is largely based on the signs and symptoms of disease.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plantpath.iastate.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Signs''' are the visible physical presence of either the pathogen itself or the structures formed by the [[pathogen]]. Common examples of easily detected signs are those such as the [[Mycelium|fungal mycelia]] and [[spore]] masses of [[downy mildew]]s observed on infected leaves and the bacterial ooze of ''[[Xanthomonas]]'' [[Bacterial leaf streak|leaf streak disease]] on [[rice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://plantpath.psu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symptoms''' are the visible changes that occur in the host plant in response to infection by pathogens. For any disease in a given plant, there is the characteristic expression of symptoms, usually occurring in a sequential series during the course of the disease. This series of symptoms depicting the disease picture is referred to as the '''disease syndrome'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plantpath.wisc.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphological symptoms may be exhibited by the entire plant or by any organ of the plant. These have been categorized into different groups for easy of study. Primarily, morphological symptoms of plant diseases can be categorized into 6 different types.&lt;ref&gt;http://plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Necroses
* Growth abnormalities
* Metaplastic symptoms
* Proleptic symptoms
* Color changes
* Wilts

==Necroses==
'''Necroses''' are caused due to [[necrosis]] or death of plant cells. The affected plant tissue usually turns brown to black in color. Necrotic symptoms could appear in any part of the plant such as in storage organs, in green tissues, or in woody tissues.&lt;ref&gt;http://homeguides.sfgate.com/necrosis-plant-diseases-39504.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necrosis in storage organs===
Death of cells in storage organs terminates in [[decomposition]] or decay referred to as a '''rot'''. Two types of rots are identified as '''[[Dry rot]]''' and '''[[Wet rot]]''' on storage tissues.

Soft rots are those where the pathogen breaks down the host cell walls, resulting in the exudation of juices from the infected tissue. The organ becomes mushy or pulpy and a foul smell often develops due to colonization by secondary invaders. Many fungi and bacteria cause soft rots on several fruits and vegetables. Species of the fungus, ''[[Rhizopus]]'' and bacterium ''[[Erwinia]]'' are two such commonly found pathogens causing soft rots.

In a dry rot, the storage organ becomes hard and dry, and in some diseases, there is rapid loss of water and the infected organs become shriveled, wrinkled, and leathery. Dry rots showing such symptoms are referred to as '''mummifications'''.

===Necrosis in green tissues===
Necroses on green tissue are termed differently based on the nature of symptoms and the type of green tissue. The term, '''[[damping off]]''' refers to the sudden wilting and topping over of seedlings as a result of extensive necrosis of tender tissue of the roots and stem near the soil line, due to the attack of soil-borne pathogens such as fungus, ''[[Pythium]]''. This fungus is known to cause damping off in an assortment of seedlings such as that of [[brinjal]], [[chilli]], [[mung beans]], [[tobacco]], [[tomato]], and ''[[Cucurbita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://tomclothier.hort.net/page13.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Diplocarpon rosae|spot]]''' refers to a well-defined area of gray or brown necrotic tissue. Spots are very common on leaves and fruits and are probably the most familiar necrotic symptom. Sometimes the necrotic tissue within a leaf spot may crack and fall off from the surrounding green tissue leaving an empty space. Such a symptom is known as a '''[[List of almond diseases|shot hole]]'''.

Minute or very small spots are sometimes referred to as '''[[Carnation necrotic fleck virus|flecks]]''' or '''[[Gymnosporangium globosum|specks]]'''.

When dark mycelia of a fungal pathogen appear on the surface of necrotic spot, blotting the leaves, shoots, an stems as large and irregular spots, the symptom is referred to as a '''[[Mycosphaerella graminicola|blotch]]'''.

Both '''[[Tobacco streak virus|streaks]]''' and '''[[Tenuivirus|stripes]]''' occur in grasses and are elongated areas having dead cells. Streaks occur along the stem and veins, while stripes are in the laminar tissues between veins.

'''Net necrosis''' is a symptom resulting from an irregular pattern of [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]] between streaks or stripes.

'''[[Blight]]'''s are characterized by the rapid death of entire leaves including the veins or parts of the leaves. Blights also could occur on flowers and stems.

'''[[Leaf scorch|Scorches]]''' resemble blights, but there necrosis occurs in irregular patterns between veins and along leaf margins.

'''Firing''' is sudden drying, collapse and death of entire leaves. Firing occurs in response to the activity of root rot and vascular wilt pathogens.

'''[[Scald (barley disease)|Scald]]''' is the term used to describe the blanching of epidermal and adjacent tissues of fruits and occasionally of leaves.

The sudden death of unopened buds or inflorescence is referred to as '''[[Magnaporthe grisea|blast]]'''.

Extensive necrosis of fruits that resemble in premature dropping is called '''shelling'''.

===Necrosis in woody tissues===
Necrosis of woody tissue often brings about various types of die-back symptoms. '''[[Forest dieback|Dieback]]''' is the extensive necrosis of a shoot from its tip downwards.

Restricted necrosis of the bark and cortical tissue of stems and roots is termed as a '''[[canker]]'''. In cankers, necrotic tissue in the sunken lesions is sharply limited, usually by a callus from adjacent healthy tissue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/prokaryotes/Pages/CitrusCanker.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

When woody tissues are diseased, they may exude different kinds of substances. When the exudate is gummy, the symptom is called '''[[gummosis]]''', while it is '''resinosis''' when it is resinous. If the exudate is neither gummy nor resinous, it is described as '''bleeding'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcollege/plantpathology/ext_files/PPFShtml/PPFS-FR-T-8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abnormalities in growth==
Many disease symptoms are associated with growth changes in diseased plants. These could be caused by either reduced growth due to hypoplasia and atrophy or excessive growth due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy.

===Hypoplasia and atrophy===
'''[[Hypoplasia]]''' is the failure of plants or plant organs to develop fully due to a decreased production of the number of cells. Hypoplasia results in plants or plant parts of sub-normal size.&lt;ref&gt;http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/280003/hypoplastic-symptom&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Atrophy]]''' is the reduction in the size of plant cells produced. This also results in stunted plants or plant parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atrophy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Dwarfing]]''' is the failure of a plant or a plant part to attain its full size.

'''Rosetting''' is a condition where the internode of a plant do not elongate, and hence, the leaves appear close together in a cluster.

===Hyperplasia and hypertrophy===
'''[[Hyperplasia]]''' is the enlargement of a plant tissue due to excessive increase in the number of plant cells produced. Hyperplasia results in overdevelopment in size of plants or plant organs.&lt;ref&gt;http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/279676/hyperplastic-symptom&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Hypertrophy]]''' is excessive growth due to the enlargement of individual cells. This condition also results in the overdevelopment in size of plants or plant organs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hypertrophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperplasia and hypertrophy could result in the enlargement of leaves and fruits, and the enlargement of stems and roots.

====Enlargement of leaves and fruits====
Several symptoms expressing enlargement of leaves and fruits are commonly observed among diseased plants.

'''Curling''' which is the bending of the shoot or the rolling of the leaf, is a result of over-growth on one side of an organ. Often viral diseases cause such leaf distortions due to irregular growth of the [[Leaf|lamina]]. Extreme reduction of the leaf lamina brings about the symptom known as the '''Shoe-string effect'''.

The puckering or crinkling of leaves due to different growth rates in adjacent tissue is known as '''savoying'''.

Overgrowth of [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermal]] and underlying tissues of leaves, stems, fruits and tubers may result scab formation. '''[[Powdery scab|Scab]]''' consists of raised, rough, and discrete lesions. These are often sunken and cracked, giving a typical scabby appearance.

Localized swellings or enlargement of epidermal cells due to excessive accumulation of water is termed '''intermuscence''' and the diagnostic symptom is the appearance of a '''[[Rust (fungus)|blister]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ppws.vt.edu/extension/plant-disease-clinic/DiseaseAdvisory/Archives/032014-LeafBlisters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enlargement of stems and roots====
Symptoms causing enlargement of stems and roots are termed differently based on their nature. Excessive accumulation of food material in stems, above a constricted area produces a swelling termed '''[[Kaposi's sarcoma|sarcody]]'''.

Localized swellings that involve entire organs are termed '''[[Swelling (medical)|tumefaction]]'''.
Commonly exhibited tumefactions are '''[[gall]]s''', '''[[Clubroot|clubs]]''', and '''[[Root-knot nematode|knots]]'''.

Excessive development of '''[[Root|adventitious organs]]''' results in '''[[fasciculation]]''', that is the clustering of organs around a focal point. Such examples include witch's broom and hairy root. '''[[Witch's broom]]''' is a broom-like mass proliferation due to the dense clustering of branches of woody plants while '''[[Hairy root culture|hairy root]]''' results due to excessive development of roots.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2005/2-23-2005/witchesbroom.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Fasciation]]''' is the broadening or flattening of cylindrical organs such as stems. The continued development of any organ after it has reached a stage beyond which it normally does not grow is known as '''[[Cell growth|proliferation]]'''.

The outgrowth of tissue in response to wounding is known as a '''[[Callus (cell biology)|callus]]'''. Callus formation is found to form around most cankers.

==Metaplastic symptoms==
Metaplastic symptoms are those which form when tissues change from one form to another. Such symptoms include '''[[phyllody]]''', the development of floral organs into leaf-like structures, '''juvenillody''', the development of juvenile seedlings on mature plants and '''russeting''', a superficial browning of surfaces of fruits and tubers due to '''[[Suberin|suberization]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acs.edu.au/courses/plant-pathology-46.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proleptic symptoms==
Proleptic symptoms result from the development of tissues earlier than usual. Examples include '''prolepsis''', the premature development of a shoot from a bud, '''proleptic abscission''', the premature formation of '''[[abscission]]''' layers and '''restoration''', the unexpected development of organs that are normally rudimentary.&lt;ref&gt;http://erec.ifas.ufl.edu/plant_pathology_guidelines/module_03.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color changes==
Changes in the color of plant tissue are a common symptom of plant disease. Often these color changes are brought about by the '''[[Zucchini yellow mosaic virus|yellowing]]''' of normal green tissue due to the destruction of '''[[chlorophyll]]''' or a failure to form chlorophyll. Such repression of leaf color may be complete or partial.

When color repression is complete, it is known as '''albication'''. However, the more common, partial repression is referred to as '''[[chlorosis]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://urbanext.illinois.edu/focus/index.cfm?problem=chlorosis&lt;/ref&gt;

Patches of green tissue alternating with chlorotic areas are described as a '''[[Mosaic virus|mosaic]]'''. Mosaic is a symptom caused by many viruses. Based on the intensity and the pattern of discoloration, mosaics are termed differently. Irregular patches of distinct light and dark areas are known as '''[[Mottle|mottling]]'''. '''Streaking''' and '''[[Turf necrotic ring spot|ring spots]]''' are still other distinct types of discolorations. Ring spots are circular masses of chlorosis with a green center. '''Vein clearing''' and '''vein banding''' are yet other common color changes on leaves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetnatural.com/pest-problem-solver/plant-disease/mosaic-virus/&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorophyll may also develop in tissues normally devoid of it. Thus usually white or colored tissue becomes green in color. This is called as '''[[virescence]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/virescence&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anthocyanin|Anthocyanescence]]''' is due to the overdevelopment of anthocyanin and result in the development of a purplish coloration. Color changes can also take place in flowers. Such an example is the [[Tulip breaking virus|color break virus-affected tulips]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawaiiplantdisease.net/glossary/Anthocyanescence.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilts==
'''[[Wilt disease|Wilting]]''' is due to loss of [[Turgor pressure|turgor]] in plant tissue resulting in the dropping of plant parts. They are common symptom in diseases where the pathogen or the toxic metabolites it produces affects the [[vascular tissue]] of the host plant. Interference in water transport brought about by the infection of these vascular pathogens leads to wilting. Unlike wilting due to low [[Water content|soil moisture]], wilting due to the activity of these pathogens cannot be overcome by watering the plants. Infected plants eventually die.&lt;ref&gt;http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/644850/wilt&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nils Christian Stenseth 2014.jpg|thumb|Nils Christian Stenseth in 2014]]
'''Nils Christian Stenseth''' (born 29 July 1949 in [[Fredrikstad]], [[Norway]]) is a Norwegian [[biologist]] with a focus on ecology and evolution. He is the director of the [[Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis]] (CEES) at the [[University of Oslo]]. He is also the Chief Scientist at the [[Norwegian Institute of Marine Research]] in Norway. In December 2006, CEES was given ''Centre of Excellence'' status by the [[Research Council of Norway]].

Stenseth finished his first degree in 1972 with main topics [[biology]], [[zoology]] and [[mathematics]]. He then became a student of [[John Maynard Smith]], still working mostly on the theoretical aspects of evolution and ecology. Major publications from this period is his work on the [[Red Queen Hypothesis]] (Van Valen, 1973; Stenseth, 1979; Stenseth and Maynard-Smith, 1984) in addition to his work on population cycles of the [[Norway Lemming|Norwegian lemming]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} A [[dr.philos.]] since 1978, he was appointed as a professor of [[population ecology]] and [[zoology]] at the University of Oslo in 1980.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Nils Christian Stenseth|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|first=Dag Øystein|last=Hjermann|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Nils_Christian_Stenseth|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later turned to more empirical investigations, and as chair of CEES he continues to be a well-known and respected scientist within biology. He is an ''ISI Highly Cited'' researcher within Ecology/Environment.

He was the vice-president/president of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2009/01/herforarar-for-vitskapen.html|title=Hærførarar for vitskapen|last=Toft|first=Martin|date=23 January 2009|work=Uniforum|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2009 to 2014.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Nature of mathematics==
*[[Definitions of mathematics]] – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.
*[[Philosophy of mathematics]] – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

===Mathematics is===
*an [[academic discipline]] – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
*a [[formal science]] – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

===General reference===

====Classification systems====
*[[List of Dewey Decimal Classes#500-599 – Science|Mathematics in the Dewey Decimal Classification system]]
&lt;!--*[[Mathematics in the Library of Congress Classification system]]--&gt;
*''[[Mathematics Subject Classification]]'' – alphanumerical classification scheme collaboratively produced by staff of and based on the coverage of the two major mathematical reviewing databases, Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt MATH.

====Reference databases====
*''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' – journal and online database published by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) that contains brief synopses (and occasionally evaluations) of many articles in mathematics, statistics and theoretical computer science.
*''[[Zentralblatt MATH]]'' – service providing reviews and abstracts for articles in pure and applied mathematics, published by Springer Science+Business Media. It is a major international reviewing service which covers the entire field of mathematics. It uses the Mathematics Subject Classification codes for organizing their reviews by topic.

'''Paul Reiter''' is a professor of medical entomology at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="DOP"/&gt; He is a member of the [[World Health Organization]] Expert Advisory Committee on Vector Biology and Control{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. He was an employee of the [[Center for Disease Control]] (Dengue Branch) for 22 years. He is a specialist in the natural history, epidemiology and control of [[mosquito]]-borne diseases&lt;ref name="DOP"/&gt; such as [[dengue fever]], [[West Nile Virus]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/RAR/RAR2007/Imi-en.html | title=Report from Institut Pasteur| date=2007 | first=Paul | last=Reiter | publisher= [[Institut Pasteur]] | accessdate=4 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Fellow of the [[Royal Entomological Society]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

==Criticism of the IPCC==
Reiter says he was a contributor to the third [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] Working Group II (Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability) report, but resigned because he "found [himself] at loggerheads with persons who insisted on making authoritative pronouncements, although they had little or no knowledge of [his] speciality". After ceasing to contribute he says he struggled to get his name removed from the Third report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeconaf/12/12we21.htm | title=Memorandum: The IPCC and technical information, example: Impacts on Human Health | date=31 March 2005 | first=Paul | last=Reiter | publisher=Select Committee on Economic Affairs for the [[House of Lords]] | accessdate=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"After much effort and many fruitless discussions, I decided to concentrate on the USGCCRP and resigned from the IPCC project. My resignation was accepted, but in a first draft I found that my name was still listed. I requested its removal, but was told it would remain because "I had contributed". It was only after strong insistence that I succeeded in having it removed."

Reiter is sceptical about the IPCC process, as seen in his April 25, 2006, testimony to the [[United States Senate]]:

:"A galling aspect of the debate is that this spurious 'science' is endorsed in the public forum by influential panels of 'experts.'  I refer particularly to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]).  Every five years, this UN-based organization publishes a 'consensus of the world's top scientists' on all aspects of climate change.  Quite apart from the dubious process by which these scientists are selected, such consensus is the stuff of politics, not of science.  Science proceeds by observation, hypothesis and experiment.  The complexity of this process, and the uncertainties involved, are a major obstacle to a meaningful understanding of scientific issues by non-scientists.  In reality, a genuine concern for mankind and the environment demands the inquiry, accuracy and scepticism that are intrinsic to authentic science.  A public that is unaware of this is vulnerable to abuse." &lt;ref name="mosquito_senate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/reiter-042606.pdf | title=Malaria in the debate on climate change and mosquito-borne disease | date=April 25, 2006 | first=Paul | last=Reiter | publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation]] | accessdate=2007-10-07 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiter presented ''Malaria in the debate on climate change and mosquito-borne disease''&lt;ref name="mosquito_senate"/&gt; on April 25, 2006.  The four primary points of his presentation here were: 
#Malaria is not an exclusively tropical disease
#The transmission dynamics of the disease are complex; the interplay of climate, ecology, mosquito biology, mosquito behavior and many other factors defies simplistic analysis.
#It is facile to attribute current resurgence of the disease to climate change, or to use models based on temperature to “predict” future prevalence.
#Environmental activists use the ‘big talk’ of science to create a simple but false paradigm. Malaria specialists who protest this are generally ignored, or labelled as ‘sceptics’.

The UK government has said that Reiter "does not accurately represent the current scientific debate on the potential impacts of climate change on health in general, or malaria in particular. He appears to have been quite selective in the references and reports that he has criticised, focusing on those that are neither very recent nor reflective of the current state of knowledge, now or when they were published."&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeconaf/71/71.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]'', Reiter says, "This claim that the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] is the world's top 1500 or 2500 scientists, you look at the bibliographies of the people and it's simply not true. There are quite a number of non-scientists."

'''''Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines''''' is a 2008 book by [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor [[Richard A. Muller]]. It attempts to explain many physics concepts to the educated layperson, with specific applications to current issues like terrorism, energy, and climate change.

==Contents==
The book explains physics concepts and shows statistics as they relate to terrorism, energy, nuclear weapons, space and global warming. Muller believes that gasoline is one of the best weapons for a terrorist due to its availability and high [[energy density]]. ''Physics for Future Presidents'' is interspersed with policy recommendations, such as that future presidents should not worry about terrorists building nuclear weapons and instead focus on stopping them from flying planes. It criticizes those who distort the facts, especially with regards to climate change. “Global warming is real," Muller writes. "It is very likely caused by humans.”&lt;ref name=sciencenews&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benjamin|first1=Heather|title=Book Review: Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines by Richard A.

==Reception==
''Physics for Future Presidents'' received mostly favorable reviews from critics. It received the 2009 Northern California Book Award for General Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh Ink|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/FRESH-INK-3163709.php|accessdate=28 October 2014|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heather Benjamin of [[Science News]] recommended it to people who are interested in political policies based on science.&lt;ref name=sciencenews /&gt;

Lisa Jardine-Wright disliked the book's first section on terrorism, which she thought focused too much on the personalities of terrorists as opposed to the actual physics. She also took issue with how the book "lacked insight into how physics and science really work - the importance of observation and experimentation that provide evidence from which we are able to draw a series of conclusions." However, she writes, "as I read beyond the emotional subject of terrorism in Muller's first section, I became much more engaged with his writing. The later parts of his book, covering issues of energy, nuclear power and global warming, were informative, easy to follow and, in my opinion, contained a lot more physics. Indeed, beginning the book with part two would have changed my first impressions significantly." Jardine believes ''Physics for Future Presidents'''s biggest strength is how "Muller reinforces the point that there are no immediate solutions to our 21st-century problems and that ultimately one must make a judgment call."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jardine-Wright|first1=Lisa|title=Physics for Future Presidents: The Science behind the Headlines|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/physics-for-future-presidents-the-science-behind-the-headlines/404435.article|accessdate=28 October 2014|work=Times Higher Education|date=27 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''rational planning model''' is a model of the planning process involving a number of rational actions or steps. Taylor (1998) outlines five steps, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Urban Planning Theory since 1945|last = Taylor|first = Nigel|publisher = Sage Publications|year = 1998|isbn = |location = London|pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Definition of the problems and/or goals;
* Identification of alternative plans/policies;
* Evaluation of alternative plans/policies;
* Implementation of plans/policies;
* Monitoring of effects of plans/policies. 
The rational planning model is used in planning and designing neighborhoods, cities, and regions. It has been central in the development of modern [[urban planning]] and [[transportation planning]]. The model has many limitations, particularly the lack of guidance on involving stakeholders and the community affected by planning, and other models of planning, such as [[collaborative planning]], are now also widely used.

The very similar '''rational decision-making model''', as it is called in [[organizational behavior]], is a process for making logically sound decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Stephen P.|title=Organizational Behavior|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0132431569|edition=12th|pages=156–8|author2=Timothy A. Judge }}&lt;/ref&gt; This multi-step model and aims to be logical and follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution. Rational decision making is a multi-step process for making logically sound decisions that aims to follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution.

==Method==
Rational [[decision-making]] or [[planning]] follows a series of steps detailed below:

===Verify, define,detail the problem, give solution or alternative to the problem ===
Verifying, defining &amp; detailing the problem (problem definition, goal definition, information gathering).  This step includes recognizing the problem, defining an initial solution, and starting primary analysis.  Examples of this are creative devising, creative ideas, inspirations, breakthroughs, and [[Brainstorming|brainstorm]]s.

The very first step which is normally overlooked by the top level [[management]] is defining the exact problem. Though we think that the problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem.

===Generate all possible solutions===
This step encloses two to three final solutions to the problem and preliminary implementation to the site.  In planning, examples of this are Planned Units of Development and downtown revitalizations.

This activity is best done in groups, as different people may contribute different ideas or alternative solutions to the problem.  Without alternative solutions, there is a chance of arriving at a non-optimal or a rational decision. For exploring the alternatives it is necessary to gather information. Technology may help with gathering this information.

===Generate objective assessment criteria===
Evaluative criteria are measurements to determine success and failure of alternatives.  This step contains secondary and final analysis along with secondary solutions to the problem.  Examples of this are site suitability and site sensitivity analysis. After going thoroughly through the process of defining the problem, exploring for all the possible alternatives for that problem and gathering information this step says evaluate the information and the possible options to anticipate the consequences of each and every possible alternative that is thought of.  At this point optional criteria for measuring the success or failure of the decision taken needs to be considered.
The rational model of planning rest largely on objective assessment.

===Choose the best solution generated===
This step comprises a final solution and secondary implementation to the site.  At this point the process has developed into different strategies of how to apply the solutions to the site.

Based on the criteria of assessment and the analysis done in previous steps, choose the best solution generated.  These four steps form the core of the Rational Decision Making Model.

===Implement the preferred alternative===
This step includes final implementation to the site and preliminary monitoring of the outcome and results of the site.  This step is the building/renovations part of the process.

===Monitor and evaluate outcomes and results===
This step contains the secondary and final monitoring of the outcomes and results of the site.  This step takes place over a long period of time.

=== Feedback===
Modify future decisions and actions taken based on the above evaluation of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Michael P.|title=Planning Theory for Practitioners|year=2002|publisher=American Planning Association|location=Chicago|pages=175–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discourse of rational planning model used in policy making==
The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simon, Herbert |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions in order for it to work, such as:

*The model must be applied in a system that is stable,
*The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices,
*The policy problem is unambiguous,
*There are no limitations of time or cost.

Indeed, some of the assumptions identified above are also pin pointed out in a study written by the historian H.A. Drake, as he states:

''In its purest form, the Rational Actor approach presumes that such a figure [as Constantine] has complete freedom of action to achieve goals that he or she has articulated through a careful process of rational analysis involving full and objective study of all pertinent information and alternatives. At the same time, it presumes that this central actor is so fully in control of the apparatus of government that a decision once made is as good as implemented. There are no  staffs on which to rely, no constituencies to placate, no generals or governors to cajole. By attributing all decision making to one central figure who is always fully in control and who acts only after carefully weighing all options, the Rational Actor method allows scholars to filter out extraneous details and focus attention on central issues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Drake, H.A. |title=Constantine and the Bishops: The Politics of Intolerance |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as we have seen, in the context of policy rational models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. For this purpose, Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering— data and potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems
#Assessing the consequences of all options
#Relating consequences to values— with all decisions and policies there will be a set of values which will be more relevant (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and which can be expressed as a set of criteria, against which performance (or consequences) of each option can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option— given the full understanding of all the problems and opportunities, all the consequences and the criteria for judging options.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar lines, Wiktorowicz and Deber describe through their study on ‘Regulating biotechnology: a rational-political model of policy development’ the rational approach to policy development. The main steps involved in making a rational decision for these authors are the following:

#The comprehensive organization and analysis of the information
#The potential consequences of each option
#The probability that each potential outcome would materialize
#The value (or utility) placed on each potential outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wiktorowicz, Mary |author2=Deber, Raisa |title=Regulating biotechnology: a rational-political Model of policy development |journal=Health Policy Journal |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=115–138 |date=May 1997 |doi=10.1016/S0168-8510(96)00889-5 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V8X-3SWTKM6-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1997&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_origin=browse&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=fff8e9fe6163caa0b6011b53c3aa37dd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach of Wiktorowicz and Deber is similar to Simon and they assert that the rational model tends to deal with “the facts” (data, probabilities) in steps 1 to 3, leaving the issue of assessing values to the final step. According to Wiktorowicz and Deber values are introduced in the final step of the rational model, where the utility of each policy option is assessed.

Many authors have attempted to interpret the above-mentioned steps, amongst others, Patton and Sawicki &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Patton, C., Sawicki, D. |title=Basic methods of policy analysis and planning |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=NJ |year=1986 |isbn=0-13-060948-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; who summarize the model as presented in the following figure (missing):

#Defining the problem by analyzing the data and the information gathered.
#Identifying the decision criteria that will be important in solving the problem. The decision maker must determine the relevant factors to take into account when making the decision.
#A brief list of the possible alternatives must be generated; these could succeed to resolve the problem.
#A critical analyses and evaluation of each criterion is brought through. For example, strength and weakness tables of each alternative are drawn and used for comparative basis.  The decision maker then weights the previously identified criteria in order to give the alternative policies a correct priority in the decision.
#The decision-maker evaluates each alternative against the criteria and selects the preferred alternative.
#The policy is brought through.

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, many criticisms of the model arise due to claim of the model being impractical and lying on unrealistic assumptions.  For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extra ordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings. This latter argument can be best illustrated by the words of Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, who wrote in his book `Understanding Public Policy´ the following passage:

''There is no better illustration of the dilemmas of rational policy making in America than in the field of health…the first obstacle to rationalism is defining the problem. Is our goal to have good health — that is, whether we live at all (infant mortality), how well we live (days lost to sickness), and how long we live (life spans and adult mortality)? Or is our goal to have good medical care — frequent visits to the doctor, wellequipped and accessible hospitals, and equal access to medical care by rich and poor alike?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems faced when using the rational model arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3–4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

However, as Thomas states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref name=Thomas07/&gt;

===Decision criteria for policy analysis — Step 2===

As illustrated in Figure 1, rational policy analysis can be broken into 6 distinct stages of analysis. Step 2 highlights the need to understand which factors should be considered as part of the decision making process. At this part of the process, all the economic, social, and environmental factors that are important to the policy decision need to be identified and then expressed as policy decision criteria. For example, the decision criteria used in the analysis of environmental policy is often a mix of —

* [[Environmental impact assessment|Ecological impacts]] —  such as [[biodiversity]], [[water quality]], [[air quality]], [[Habitat conservation|habitat quality]], species [[population]], etc.
* [[Economic efficiency]] — commonly expressed as benefits and costs.
* [[Welfare economics|Distributional equity]] — how policy impacts are distributed amongst different demographics. Factors that can affect the distribution of impacts include location, ethnicity, income, and occupation.
* [[Cultural psychology|Social/Cultural acceptability]] — the extent to which the policy action may be opposed by current [[Norm (social)|social norms]] or [[Value theory|cultural values]].
* [[Implementation|Operational practicality]] — the capacity required to actually operationalize the policy.
* Legality — the potential for the policy to be implemented under current legislation versus the need to pass new legislation that accommodates the policy.
* Uncertainty — the degree to which the level of policy impacts can be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Loomis, John |author2=Helfand, Gloria |title=Environmental Policy Analysis for Decision Making |publisher=Kluwer Academic |year=2001 |isbn=0-7923-6500-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criteria, such as economic benefit, will be more easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality will be harder to measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals, and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards a subset of the policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weimer|Vining|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of identifying a suitably comprehensive decision criteria set is also vulnerable to being skewed by pressures arising at the political interface. For example, decision makers may tend to give "''more weight to policy impacts that are concentrated, tangible, certain, and immediate than to impacts that are diffuse, intangible, uncertain, and delayed''."^8. For example, with a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions the net financial cost in the first five years of policy implementation is a far easier impact to conceptualise than the more diffuse and uncertain impact of a country's improved position to influence [[Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions|global negotiations on climate change action]].

===Decision methods for policy analysis — Step 5===

Displaying the impacts of policy alternatives can be done using a policy analysis matrix (PAM) such that shown in Table 1. As shown, a PAM provides a summary of the policy impacts for the various alternatives and examination of the matrix can reveal the tradeoffs associated with the different alternatives.

Table 1. Policy analysis matrix (PAM) for SO2 emissions control.

Once policy alternatives have been evaluated, the next step is to decide which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method is an exercise in benefit cost analysis (BCA).
 
At the other extreme, the numerous goals will require the policy impacts to be expressed using a variety of metrics that are not readily comparable. In such cases, the policy analyst may draw on the concept of utility to aggregate the various goals into a single score. With the utility concept, each impact is given a weighting such that 1 unit of each weighted impact is considered to be equally valuable (or desirable) with regards to the collective well-being.

Weimer and Vining also suggest that the "''go, no go''" rule can be a useful method for deciding amongst policy alternatives^8. Under this decision making regime, some or all policy impacts can be assigned thresholds which are used to eliminate at least some of the policy alternatives. In their example, one criterion "''is to minimize SO2 emissions''" and so a threshold might be a reduction SO2 emissions "of at least 8.0 million tons per year". As such, any policy alternative that does not meet this threshold can be removed from consideration. If only a single policy alternative satisfies all the impact thresholds then it is the one that is considered a "go" for each impact. Otherwise it might be that all but a few policy alternatives are eliminated and those that remain need to be more closely examined in terms of their trade-offs so that a decision can be made.

===Case study of rational policy analysis===

To demonstrate the rational analysis process as described above, let’s examine the policy paper “Stimulating the use of biofuels in the European Union: Implications for climate change policy” by Lisa Ryan where the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels has been proposed in the European Union (EU) between 2005–2010 as part of a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from road transport, increase security of energy supply and support development of rural communities.

Considering the steps of Patton and Sawicki model as in Figure 1 above, this paper only follows components 1 to 5 of the rationalist policy analysis model:

# Defining The Problem – the report identifies transportation fuels pose two important challenges for the European Union (EU). First, under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol to the Climate Change Convention, the EU has agreed to an absolute cap on greenhouse gas emissions; while, at the same time increased consumption of transportation fuels has resulted in a trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions from this source. Second, the dependence upon oil imports from the politically volatile Middle East generates concern over price fluctuations and possible interruptions in supply. Alternative fuel sources need to be used &amp; substituted in place of fossil fuels to mitigate GHG emissions in the EU.
# Determine the Evaluation Criteria – this policy sets Environmental impacts/benefits (reduction of GHG’s as a measure to reducing climate change effects) and Economical efficiency (the costs of converting to biofuels as alternative to fossil fuels &amp; the costs of production of biofuels from its different potential sources)as its decision criteria.  However, this paper does not exactly talk about the social impacts, this policy may have. It also does not compare the operational challenges involved between the different categories of biofuels considered.
# Identifying Alternative Policies – The European Commission foresees that three alternative transport fuels: hydrogen, natural gas, and biofuels, will replace transport fossil fuels, each by 5% by 2020.
# Evaluating Alternative Policies – Biofuels are an alternative motor vehicle fuel produced from biological material and are promoted as a transitional step until more advanced technologies have matured. By modelling the efficiency of the biofuel options the authors compute the economic and environmental costs of each biofuel option as per the evaluation criteria mentioned above.
# Select The Preferred Policy – The authors suggest that the overall best biofuel comes from the sugarcane in Brazil after comparing the economic &amp; the environmental costs. The current cost of subsidising the price difference between European biofuels and fossil fuels per tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions saved is calculated to be €229–2000. If the production of European biofuels for transport is to be encouraged, exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transactions costs, as no separate administrative or collection system needs to be established. A number of entrepreneurs are producing biofuels at the lower margin of the costs specified here profitably, once an excise duty rebate is given. It is likely that growth in the volume of the business will engender both economies of scale and innovation that will reduce costs substantially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2005.06.010 |author1=Ryan L. |author2=Convery F. |author3=Ferreira S. |title=Stimulating the use of biofuels in the European Union: Implications for climate change policy |journal=Energy Policy |volume=34 |issue=17 |pages=3184–94 |date=November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements and limitations==
However, there are a lot of assumptions, requirements without which the rational decision model is a failure. Therefore, they all have to be considered. 
The model assumes that we have or should or can obtain adequate information, both in terms of quality, quantity and accuracy. This applies to the situation as well as the alternative technical situations. It further assumes that you have or should or can obtain substantive knowledge of the cause and effect relationships relevant to the evaluation of the alternatives. In other words, it assumes that you have a thorough knowledge of all the alternatives and the consequences of the alternatives chosen. It further assumes that you can rank the alternatives and choose the best of it. 
The following are the limitations for the Rational Decision Making Model:

* requires a great deal of time
* requires great deal of information
* assumes rational, measurable criteria are available and agreed upon
* assumes accurate, stable and complete knowledge of all the alternatives, preferences, goals and consequences
* assumes a rational, reasonable, non – political world

==Current status==
While the rational planning model was innovative at its conception, the concepts are controversial and '''questionable processes today.''' The rational planning model has fallen out of mass use as of the last decade. Rather than conceptualising human agents as rational planners, [[Lucy Suchman]] argues, agents can better be understood as engaging in [[situated action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|title=Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situation Action|year=2007|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going further, [[Guy Benveniste]] argued that the rational model could not be implemented without taking the political context into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benveniste|first=Guy|title=Mastering the Politics of Planning|year=1994|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] '''Richard Meinertzhagen''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (3 March 1878 – 17 June 1967)&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=M.R. D.|last=Foot|title=Meinertzhagen, Richard (1878–1967)|encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|origyear=2004|edition=online|date=May 2006|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37754|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[soldier]], [[intelligence officer]] and [[ornithologist]]. He had a decorated military career spanning Africa, where he was credited with creating and executing the infamous Haversack Ruse.  While early biographies lionized Meinertzhagen as a master of military strategy and espionage, later works such as ''The Meinertzhagen Mystery'' present him as a fraud for fabricating stories of his feats and speculated he was also a murderer.  The discovery of stolen museum bird specimens resubmitted as original discoveries had raised serious doubts on a number of scores as to the veracity of [[ornithology|ornithological]] records he claimed as well.

==Background and youth==
Meinertzhagen was born into a wealthy, socially connected [[British people|British]] family.  His father, Daniel Meinertzhagen, was head of the [[Frederick Huth &amp; Co.]] merchant-banking dynasty, which had an international reputation, that one biographer claimed in the introduction to his book was second in importance only to the [[Rothschilds]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, ''The Meinertzhagen Mystery'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Georgina Potter, sister of [[Beatrice Webb]], a co-founder of the [[London School of Economics]].  Meinertzhagen's [[surname]] derives from [[Meinerzhagen]] in [[Germany]], the home of an ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;During the First World War, apparently in an attempt to overcome rampant Germanophobia, Meinertzhagen invented the fiction of having Danish ancestry [Garfield, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; On his mother's side (the wealthy Potter family), he was of English descent.  Among his relations were "many of Britain's titled, rich and influential personages." Although he had his doubts, he also claimed to be a distant descendant of [[Philip III of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Garfield, p. 70"&gt;Garfield, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; His nephew, Daniel Meinertzhagen (1915-1991), was a chairman of [[Lazard]]. His niece, Teresa Georgina Mayor (1915-1996), married [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild]].

Young Richard was sent as a boarding student to [[Aysgarth School]] in the north of England, then was enrolled at Fonthill in Sussex, and finally at [[Harrow School]], where his stay overlapped with that of [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, at the age of eighteen, he reluctantly obeyed his father's wishes to join the family bank as a clerk.  He was assigned to offices in Cologne and Bremen.  There he picked up the German language but remained uninterested in banking.  After he returned to the bank’s home office in England in 1897, he received his father’s approval to join a territorial militia of weekend soldiers called the [[Hampshire Yeomanry]]. In 1911 he would marry Armorel, the daughter of Colonel Herman Le Roy-Lewis, who commanded the Hampshire Yeomanry.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12909/page/329/data.pdf ''Edinburgh Gazette''], 25 February 1916, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meinertzhagen's passion for [[bird-watching]] began as a child.  He and his brother Daniel were encouraged by a family friend, the [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Herbert Spencer]], who, like another family friend, [[Charles Darwin]], was an ardent [[Empiricism|empiricist]].  Spencer would take young Richard and Daniel on walks around the family home of [[Mottisfont Abbey]], urging them to observe and enquire on the habits of birds.  Around 1887 they kept a pet sparrowhawk, which was taken to Hyde Park to let it prey on sparrows.  The first serious ornithologist that Richard met was [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Brian Hodgson]].  Daniel took an interest in bird illustration which brought them in contact with [[Archibald Thorburn]] and led to an introduction to [[Joseph Wolf]] and [[George Edward Lodge|G.E. Lodge]].  They had first met [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]] at the Natural History Museum in 1886 and noted that he was very fond of encouraging children, showing them around the bird collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nineteenth century recollections|journal=Ibis|volume=101|issue=1|pages=46–52|year=1959|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1959.tb02355.x|author=Meinertzhagen, R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Lacking the desire to make a career in merchant banking, Meinertzhagen took examinations for a commission in the British Army, and after training at [[Aldershot]] was commissioned as a [[Second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Fusiliers]] on 18 January 1899. He was sent to India to join a battalion of his regiment.&lt;ref name="Garfield, p. 50"&gt;Garfield, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Other than routine regimental soldiering, he participated in big-game hunting, was promoted, sent on sick leave to England, and after recovery posted to the relocated battalion at [[Mandalay]] in Burma. He was promoted [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]] on 8 February 1900. He then started his “zealous campaign” for a transfer to Africa, and in April 1902 was seconded for service with the Foreign Office,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27439 |date=3 June 1902|page=3608}}&lt;/ref&gt; who attached him to the 3rd (East African) Battalion of the [[King's African Rifles]].  The following month he finally arrived at [[Mombasa]] in [[British East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Meinertzhagen was assigned as a staff officer with the King's African Rifles (KAR). Again he participated in big-game hunting, but “regarded himself as scientist-explorer first, and only incidentally as a soldier.” His maps, landscape and wildlife drawings proved him an artist of exceptional talent. In 1903 he was delegated to conduct a wild animal census in the [[Serengeti]] and [[Athi]] plains.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

During Meinertzhagen's assignment to Africa, frequent native "risings and rebellions" occurred. By 1903 KAR's retaliatory ventures focused on confiscation of livestock, a highly effective form of punishment, and "the KAR had become accomplished cattle-rustlers." One such [[punitive expedition]] was commanded by a Captain F.A. Dickinson of the 3rd KAR with participation by Meinertzhagen, where more than 11,000 stock were captured at the cost of 3 men killed and 33 wounded. The body count on the African side was estimated at 1,500 from the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[List of tribes of Kenya|Embu]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kenya Highlands in 1905, Meinertzhagen crushed a major revolt, the [[Nandi Resistance]], by killing its leader, the [[Nandi people|Nandi]] [[Orkoiyot]] (spiritual leader) [[Koitalel Arap Samoei]]. He arranged a meeting to negotiate by Koitalel's home on 19 October 1905, at which he planned to assassinate him. Meinertzhagen shot Koitalel, while shaking his hand and his men machine-gunned two dozen Nandi tribesmen, including most of Koitalel's advisors. Initially he had been able to orchestrate a cover-up and was to be commended for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Timothy|title=The Rule of Empires|page=291|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yrc7BGHGJIAC&amp;lpg=PA292&amp;pg=PA291|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Africa, 1800–1915|last=Okoth|first=Assa|publisher=E.A.E.P.|year=2006|isbn=9789966253576|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed self-defense and eventually, after a third court of inquiry, he was cleared by the presiding officer, Brig. William Manning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first= Edwin|title=Small Wars and Skirmishes 1902–18|location= Nottingham|year= 2003|pages=78–84|isbn=1901543056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meinertzhagen collected [[Tribalism|tribal]] artifacts after this revolt. Some of these items, including a walking stick and baton belonging to Koitalel, were returned to [[Kenya]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/1515836/Kenyans-welcome-home-sacred-relics-stolen-by-British.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|title=Kenyans welcome home sacred relics stolen by British|first=Mike|last=Pflanz|date=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure from the Colonial Department on the War Office eventually brought about Meinertzhagen's removal from Africa, as "he had become a negative symbol" and on 28 May 1906 "he found himself on a ship being trundled back to England in disgrace and in disgust."&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Meinertzhagen then spent the latter part of 1906 at "dreary administrative War Office desk jobs pushing papers."  However, "... by making full use of his wide network of contacts in high places" he was able to rehabilitate himself and was assigned to the Fusiliers' Third Battalion in [[South Africa]], arriving at [[Cape Town]] on 3 February 1907.&lt;ref name="Garfield, p. 70"/&gt; He served there in 1908 and 1909, then on [[Mauritius]]. By 1913, he was again in [[India]].

At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], he was posted to the intelligence staff of the British [[Indian Army during World War I|Indian Expeditionary Force]]. His map-making skills were much valued and recognized, though his assessments of the German [[Schutztruppe]] strength and other contributions to the conduct of the [[Battle of Tanga]] and the [[Battle of Kilimanjaro]] were a complete miss.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; From January 1915 through August 1916 Meinertzhagen served as chief of British military intelligence for the East Africa theater at Nairobi. His diaried records of this campaign contain harsh assessments of senior officers, of the role played by the Royal Navy and of the quality of the Indian units sent to East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Miller, ''Battle for the Bundu – the First World War in East Africa'', pp. 56–71; {{ISBN|0-02-584930-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in February 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 116; he was nominated for the award by J.C. Smuts, the new commanding general, "who took a liking to Meinertzhagen"&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year General [[Jan Smuts|J.C. Smuts]] ordered him invalided to England.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinai Desert and the ''Haversack Ruse''===
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=May 2018}}
During 1917, Meinertzhagen was transferred from East Africa to be put in place at Deir-el-Belah. He made contact with [[Nili]], a Jewish spy network headed by the agronomist [[Aaron Aaronsohn]]. Meinertzhagen later asserted that he respected Aaronsohn more than anyone else he ever met. They were instrumental in contacting Jewish officers in the Ottoman army, amongst many other sources, for information, and attempted their defection to the allies. A German Jewish doctor stationed at [[el-Afulah]] railway junction gave valuable reconnaissance reports on troop movements south.  Meinertzhagen's department produced regular maps from the data showing the dispositions of enemy forces in the desert.&lt;ref&gt;R. M's Army Diary, 1899–1926, pp. 224–5; Sheffy, British Military Intelligence, pp. 269–73; J.D. Grainger, Palestine 1917, pp. 100–1&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1917, the Turks broke up the network by  intercepting a carrier pigeon and subjecting the Jews to hideous torture. [[Sarah Aaronsohn]], age 27, a key figure, committed suicide in her home after torture.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish History of the period&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Meinertzhagen's sources of information dwindled to the occasional prisoner caught out by patrols, and deserters.  He is frequently credited with a surprise attack known as the ''Haversack Ruse'' in October 1917: during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of the [[World War I|First World War]], according to his diary, he let a [[haversack]] containing false [[United Kingdom|British]] battle plans fall into [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman military]] hands, thereby bringing about the British victory in the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] and [[Third Battle of Gaza|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=812591|title=Musings/Such a strange bird: The revisionist vultures are now about to pick at Meinertzhagen's carcass|publisher=Haaretz.com|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence was wrapped in paper used for sandwiches, and taken to General [[Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein|Kress von Kressenstein]], who examined the pocket book and mused on its authenticity.  According to an account by Turkish Colonel [[Hussein Husni]], Chief of Staff of 7th Army, Meinertzhagen's German-sounding name added to its genuine feel.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Von Kressenstein wanted to believe it, which threw the staff into some confused arguments.  The ideas of Allenby's general leave-time played on Turk preconceptions about the way British and Australians were thought to behave.&lt;ref&gt;Army Diary, pp. 222–4 and, pp. 283–6; Official History, vol.2.1, pp. 30–2&lt;/ref&gt;  The main consequence was a swap in the German High Command, and [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]]'s resignation.  At a time when the British were planning their third attempt to capture Gaza the timing proved critical.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, pp. 107–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Meinertzhagen's participation in this ruse has been discounted (he may have neither planned nor executed it), his stories of the ruse themselves would have a major impact on events in the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Brian Garfield, author of ''The Meinertzhagen Mystery'', it appears the idea was that of Lieutenant-Colonel J.D. Belgrave and the rider was Arthur Neate.&lt;/ref&gt; It inspired [[Winston Churchill]] to create the [[London Controlling Section]], which planned countless Allied deception campaigns during the war, and such operations as [[Operation Mincemeat|Mincemeat]] and diversions covering [[D-Day]] were influenced by the Haversack Ruse.&lt;ref&gt;Cave Brown, Anthony, ''Bodyguard of Lies'', p. 311 (2-volume edition), Harper and Row, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military Intelligence Reservations ===
Another story from 1917 refers to a number of Arab spies suspected of wandering through British lines in disguise.  He caught a couple of Arabs and extracted their Ottoman paymaster, a merchant who lived in Beersheba.  Meinertzhagen sent him money with an Arab he knew would talk.  The merchant was executed by the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Army Diary, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; "Near the end of 1917, having participated in no battles, he was ordered back to England for reassignment [and] found office duty as dreary as ever."&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Meinertzhagen was outraged by the continual sorties to bomb the enemy camp, given the bombs always missed their target, and invaluable reconnaissance planes were shot down, and with lives lost.  One such raid as many as eight planes went down.  From an intelligence viewpoint it was pointless as the Germans gave as good as they got in return to no overall gain.&lt;ref&gt;Army Diary, pp. 214–15; Raleigh and Jones, War in the Air, pp. 232–3; Grainger, Palestine, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He hated the notion that the Holy City of Jerusalem would be bombed from the air, and expressed outrage when this occurred.  For example, the bombing of the enemy's HQ at Mount of Olives.  But Allenby told him that the Turks had to be induced to escape Jerusalem, northwards if possible, and so a boundary was set at 6 miles no-fighting zone to facilitate their flight.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine and Israel===
From the spring of 1918 until August he commuted between England and France, delivering lectures on intelligence to groups of officers – then was assigned full-time to France at GHQ. After the armistice he attended the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919 and was [[Edmund Allenby]]'s Chief Political Officer, involved in the creation of the [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]], which eventually led to the creation of the state of [[Israel]]. In the film ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' (1990), which depicted the Paris Peace Conference, Meinertzhagen was a major character and was played by [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]]. His unpublished diaries hint, among other exploits, at a successful rescue attempt of one of the Czarist-Russian Grand Duchesses, possibly [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Tatiana]] (see ''The Romanov Conspiracies'' by Michael Occleshaw).

In the August 1920 Report of the [[Palin Commission]], Meinertzhagen was attacked for an alleged bias:
{{pull quote|...it is fairly clear from Colonel Meinertzhagen's own statement that what he demands is not this equal holding of the scales, but a definite bias in favour of the Zionists. He is wholly unable to appreciate the justice of the native case, which he dismisses contemptuously as "superficially justifiable", because in his view, the Arab is a very inferior person... It is fairly clear that, just as in one or two unfortunate cases certain individual officials have betrayed anti-Zionist bias, so Colonel Meinertzhagen arrived with a definite anti-Arab bias and a prejudice in favour of Zionism and took his views from the Zionists alone. It is possible that the unfortunate example of Colonel Gabriel threw him violently into the opposite camp; there is something significant in his admission to Brig. General Waters Taylor that he believed that he was Dr. Weizmann's nominee. A careful examination of Colonel Meinertzhagen's reckless championship of the Zionist cause fails to convince the Court that he has added materially to the proof of general bias charged against the O.E.T.A.(S) officials, while Colonel Meinertzhagen's own indiscretions on a tour which was apparently intended to conciliate the Arabs, reveal him as an agent who, however capable of doing good work in other spheres is singularly out of place in the East.|source=Report of the [[Palin Commission]], August 1920}}

Israeli historian [[Tom Segev]] considers Meinertzhagen both a "great anti-semite and a great Zionist," quoting from his ''Middle East Diary'': "I am imbued with antisemitic feelings. It was indeed an accursed day that allowed Jews and not Christians to introduce to the world the principles of Zionism and that allowed Jewish brains and Jewish money to carry them out, almost unhelped by Christians save a handful of enthusiasts in England."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Segev|Segev, Tom]]. ''One Palestine, Complete'', Hold Paperbacks, 1999, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Meinertzhagen was and is considered however a true and valued friend of Zionism. "On 3 December 1947, four days after the UN voted in favour of partition in Palestine, Dr [[Chaim Weizmann]], the modern State of [[Israel]]'s first president, cabled Col. Richard Meinertzhagen to say, “To you dear friend we owe so much that I can only express it in simple words – May God Bless You”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdn-friends-icej.ca/isreport/mayjun04/meinertzhagen.html|title=iPage|publisher=Cdn-friends-icej.ca|accessdate=9 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416030705/http://www.cdn-friends-icej.ca/isreport/mayjun04/meinertzhagen.html|archivedate=16 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Weizmann's biography he wrote of Meinertzhagen,&lt;blockquote&gt;“At our first meeting, he told me the following story of himself:  he had been an anti-Semite, though all he had known about Jews had been what he picked up in a few casual, anti-Semitic books. But he had also met some of the rich Jews, who had not been particularly attractive. But then, in the Near East, he had come across Aaron Aaronsohn, a Palestinian Jew, also a man of great courage and superior intelligence, devoted to Palestine.  Aaronson was a botanist, and the discoverer of wild wheat. With Aaronson, Meinertzhagen had many talks about Palestine, and was so impressed by him that he completely changed his mind and became an ardent Zionist – which he has remained till this day.  And that not merely in words. Whenever he can perform a service for the Jews or Palestine he will go out of his way to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaim Weizmann|Weizmann, Chaim]]. ''Trial and Error'', Harper Press, New York, 1949, pp. 180–181&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meinertzhagen wrote in his book, ''Middle East Diary'', “But thank God I have lived to see the birth of Israel. It is one of the greatest historical events of the last 2,000 years and thank God I have been privileged to assist in a small way this great event which, I am convinced, will bring benefit to mankind”.&lt;ref&gt;Meinertzhagen, Richard. ''Middle East Diary'', London: Cresset Press, 1959.&lt;!--page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 ''Middle East Diary'' was published in Hebrew, translated by [[Aharon Amir]]. &lt;ref&gt;Published 1973 by the Shikmona Publishing Company of Jerusalem - קולונל ר. מיינרצהאגן, "פרקי יומן מזרח תיכוני", מתורגם על ידי אהרון אמיר, הוצאת שקמונה, ת.ד.4044, ירושלים &lt;/ref&gt;

===Diaries===
Meinertzhagen was a prolific diarist and published four books based on these diaries. However, his ''Middle East Diary'' contains entries that are in all probability fictional, including those on [[T. E. Lawrence]] and a bit of absurd slapstick concerning [[Adolf Hitler]]. In October 1934, Meinertzhagen claimed to have mocked Hitler in response to being "baffled when Hitler raised his arm in the Nazi salute and said, 'Heil Hitler.' After a moment's thought, Meinertzhagen says he raised his own arm in an identical salute and proclaimed, 'Heil Meinertzhagen'."&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have carried a loaded pistol in his coat pocket at a meeting with Hitler and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] in July 1939 and was "seriously troubled" about not shooting when he had the chance, adding "... [I]f this war breaks out, as I feel sure it will, then I shall feel very much to blame for not killing these two."&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Alan. [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s31019.htm Profile of Meinertzhagen], abc.net.au; accessed 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors Lockman and Garfield show that Meinertzhagen later falsified his entries. The original diaries are kept at [[Rhodes House]] (the [[Bodleian Library]]), Oxford, and contain differences in the paper used for certain entries as well as in the [[typewriter ribbon]] used, and there are oddities in the page numbering.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Character==
{{see|Annie Meinertzhagen#Death}}
Meinertzhagen has inspired three biographies since his death in 1967.  Early biographers largely lionized him as a grand elder statesman of espionage and ornithology.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. E. Lawrence]], a sometime colleague in 1919 and again 1921, described him more ambiguously and with due attention to his violence:{{quotation|Meinertzhagen knew no half measures. He was logical, an idealist of the deepest, and so possessed by his convictions that he was willing to harness evil to the chariot of good. He was a strategist, a geographer, and a silent laughing masterful man; who took as blithe a pleasure in deceiving his enemy (or his friend) by some unscrupulous jest, as in spattering the brains of a cornered mob of Germans one by one with his African knob-kerri. His instincts were abetted by an immensely powerful body and a savage brain....|T. E. Lawrence|[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]], 1926}}

Meinertzhagen himself traced the "evil" side of his personality to a period during his childhood when he was subjected to severe physical abuse at the hands of a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] schoolmaster when he was at Fonthill [[boarding school]] in [[Sussex]]:{{quotation|Even now I feel the pain of that moment, when something seemed to leave me, something good; and something evil entered into my soul. Was it God who forsook me, and the devil took his place. But whatever left me has never returned, neither have I been able to entirely cast out the evil which entered me at that moment.... The undeserved beatings and sadistic treatment which were my lot in childhood so upset my mind that much of my present character can be traced to Fonthill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diary of a Black Sheep|pages=161, 173|author=Meinertzhagen, Richard|publisher=Oliver &amp; Boyd|date=1964|location=Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Gavin Maxwell]] wrote about how his parents would scare him and other children to behave themselves when Meinertzhagen visited with "... remember ... he has killed people with his bare hands..."&lt;ref&gt;Ali, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salim Ali (ornithologist)|Salim Ali]] noted Meinertzhagen's special hatred for [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his refusal to believe that Indians could govern themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, ''The Fall of a Sparrow'', pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Meinertzhagen Mystery'', Garfield presents a fuller perspective of Meinertzhagen as not only a fraud but also  a murderer. The book argues many of Meinertzhagen's accomplishments were myths including the famous haversack incident, which Garfield claims Meinertzhagen neither came up with nor carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, pp. 14–36&lt;/ref&gt; In another example Garfield researched Meinertzhagen diary records noting three meetings on separate dates with Adolf Hitler. Although Meinertzhagen was in Berlin on these dates in 1934, 1935 and 1939, Garfield found no record of any of these alleged meetings in surviving German chancellory records, British embassy files, British intelligence reports or newspapers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, pp. 188–192&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfield's research leads him to speculate that Richard also killed his second wife, Annie (born [[Anne Constance Jackson]] daughter of Major Randle Jackson of Swordale, married Meinertzhagen in 1921&lt;ref name=shot&gt;{{cite news|title=Highland lady shot dead|newspaper=Dundee Courier| date=7 July 1928| page=5| url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000564/19280707/093/0005| via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] | subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), an ornithologist, and that her death was not an accident as claimed and ruled in court.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Garfield, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1928 at age 40 in a remote [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[village]] in an incident that was officially ruled a shooting accident. The finding was that she accidentally shot herself in the head with a revolver during [[target practice]] alone with Richard, but Garfield argues Meinertzhagen shot her out of fear that she would expose him and his fraudulent activities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Storrs L. Olson]] has pointed out some errors in Garfield's research, while confirming the validity of its overall negative tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Wilson Journal of Ornithology|volume=120|issue=4|pages=917–926|year=2008|doi=10.1676/0043-5643-120.4.917|title=The Meinertzhagen Mystery: The Life and Legend of a Colossal Fraud|author=Olson, Storrs L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Garfield writes, "From boyhood on [Meinertzhagen] had been in tune with nature; he took photographs, made drawings and provided armchair tourists with keen descriptions of rain forests and snowy mountains ... and discovered new (previously unrecorded) species of bats, birds, and ''mallophaga'' (''bird lice'')".&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He became a chairman of the [[British Ornithologists' Club]] and a recipient in 1951 of the [[Godman-Salvin Medal]]; the British Museum (Natural History) named a room after him.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Meinertzhagen "first achieved a sliver of international fame when he discovered, killed, stuffed, and shipped back to London the first known to Europeans [[Giant forest hog|Giant African Forest Hog]], soon dubbed ''Hylochoerus meinertzhageni'', and attributed to Richard Meinertzhagen". At that time, while on active duty in 1903, he was "fearlessly exploring and mapping areas no European had seen before."&lt;ref name="Garfield, p. 60"/&gt; He later also discovered the [[Afghan snowfinch]] or ''Montifringilla theresae'', and the Moroccan ''[[Riparia rupestris theresae]]'' and named them, and ten others, after [[Theresa Clay]].&lt;ref name="Garfield, p. 193"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

He edited ''Nicoll's Birds of Egypt'' in 1930. Michael J. Nicoll was a friend and Assistant Director of the [[zoo|Zoological Gardens]] at [[Giza]]; Nicoll attempted to write a comprehensive guide to the ornithology of [[Egypt]], but died in 1925 before it could be published.  The work was finished by Meinertzhagen with contributions of his own independent research and illustrations. It was printed with the title "that seems appropriate," "''Nicoll's Birds of Egypt'' by Col. R. Meinertzhagen."&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948–49, he was accompanied by Dr. [[Phillip Clancey]] on an ornithological expedition to [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[Aden]], [[Somalia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], and [[South Africa]]. As the author of numerous [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] and other works on birds, and possessing a vast collection of bird and bird lice specimens, he was long considered one of Britain's greatest [[Ornithology|ornithologists]]. Garfield, however, claims Meinhertzhagen's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''Birds of Arabia'' (1954), was based on the unpublished manuscript of another [[Natural science|naturalist]], [[George Latimer Bates|George Bates]], who has been insufficiently credited in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, an analysis of Meinertzhagen's bird collection at the [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]] in [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]], revealed large-scale fraud involving [[theft]] and [[Forgery|falsification]]. The birds claimed as specimens collected by Meinhertzhagen matched with the ones that had been reported missing and the examination of the style of specimen preparation and the DNA sequences of the cotton used inside them matched the cotton used in other specimens prepared by the collectors of the stolen specimens. This also corroborated hear-say and other evidence on the specimen fraud. Many of the specimens that he submitted as his own were found to be missing samples belonging to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and collected by others, such as [[Hugh Whistler]]. A species of owl, the [[forest owlet]] thought to have gone extinct was rediscovered in 1997 based on searches made in the locality where the original specimens were collected.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, P.C. and Collar, N.J. (1999). "Major specimen fraud in the Forest Owlet Heteroglaux (Athene auct.) blewitti." Ibis 141 (1):11–21. doi:10.1111/j.1474-919X.1999.tb04258.x.&lt;/ref&gt; Searches for the bird had failed before as these were made in a locality falsely claimed by Meinertzhagen. More research by [[Pamela C. Rasmussen|Rasmussen]] and Robert Prŷs-Jones indicates the fraud was even more extensive than first thought.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rasmussen |first1=P.

==Personal life==
In 1911, Meinertzhagen married Armorel, the daughter of Colonel Herman Le Roy-Lewis, who commanded the [[Hampshire Yeomanry]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12909/page/329/data.pdf ''Edinburgh Gazette''], 25 February 1916, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; This marriage was dissolved in 1919.&lt;ref name=ibis_obit&gt;{{cite journal|title=Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen C.B.E., D.S.O., 1878–1967|author=[J. N. K. and A. L. T.]|journal=Ibis|volume=109|issue=4|pages=617–620|year=1967|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1967.tb00031.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 Meinertzhagen married [[Anne Constance Jackson]], a fellow ornithologist and the daughter of Major Randle Jackson of [[Swordale, Ross-shire]] in Scotland. They had three children:  Anne (born 1921), Daniel (born 1925) and Randle (born 1928)&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, The Meinertzhagen Mystery&lt;/ref&gt;. From about 1926 Meinertzhagen started to have a cold relationship with his wife and became increasingly close with his cousin [[Theresa Clay|Tess Clay]], then aged fifteen - spending much time with her and her sisters. 

In 1928, three months after the birth of Randle, Anne was killed, aged 40, at her birth village of Swordale. The finding, ruled in court, was that she accidentally shot herself in the head with a revolver during [[target practice]] alone with Richard&lt;ref name=shot&gt;{{cite news|title=Highland lady shot dead|newspaper=Dundee Courier| date=7 July 1928| page=5| url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000564/19280707/093/0005| via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] | subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As noted above, [[Brian Garfield]]'s research led him to speculate that in fact she was murdered by Meinertzhagen, out of fear that she would expose him and his fraudulent activities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;. This idea was never conclusively proved or disproved.  

Annie Constance Meinertzhagen left ₤113,466 (net personalty ₤18,733) in her will to her husband if he remained her widower, while if he remarried he was to get an annuity of ₤1200 and interest in their London home for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Western Daily Press|title=Rich lady's bequest to husband| date=25 October 1928| page=12| url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000264/19281025/107/0012| via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In fact, Meinertzhagen never married again, but had a lasting relationship with Tess Clay, more than three decades his junior. The unmarried couple lived in adjacent buildings originally constructed with an internal passage connecting the foyers of the two houses.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, p. 164; Clay inherited the property from her parents, Sir Felix Clay and Rachel (née Hobhouse) Clay. Rachel Clay was a first cousin of Meinertzhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; Clay was his housekeeper, secretary, "confidante" and later scientific partner who studied and eventually documented the vast collections of bird lice that Meinertzhagen had gathered. When they traveled they sometimes took separate rooms. He introduced her as his housekeeper or cousin or sometimes, inaccurately, as his niece.&lt;ref name="Garfield, p. 193"&gt;Garfield, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if Meinertzhagen and Clay's relationship was "physical": Meinertzhagen's friend [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Victor Rothschild]] asked Meinertzhagen this outright, but was told "in no uncertain terms to shut up";&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, The Meinertzhagen Mystery&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1951 article in ''TIME''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science: Niche for the Colonel|date=2 July 1951|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815089-1,00.html|accessdate=4 May 2010|newspaper=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to their relationship with "wink-wink, nudge-nudge innuendo".{{sfn|Garfield|2007| |pp=310–311}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">'''The Science and Technology Center in Ukraine''' commonly known as the '''STCU''', is an intergovernmental organization dedicated to the non-proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry and related technologies. It was established in 1993, through an international multilateral treaty to help scientists and researches involved in the research, development and production of nuclear, biological and chemical assets in former Soviet member states to transition from military to civilian, market oriented careers in their fields of expertise. The STCU was established and continues to receive its funding from Canada, Sweden (later the European Union) and the United States to provide grants and funding for projects which employ these scientists and engineers.

==Background==
By 1984 close to a quarter of the Soviet Unions Gross National Product had been allocated for defense spending. The former Soviet Union conducted research, development and deployed nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry and had employed several thousand scientists, physicists and engineers with expertise in these areas. The collapse of the Soviet Union lead to the unemployment of many of these scientists and engineers while others had not received payments for their employment. The West believed that the dissemination of expert knowledge in these areas or the employment of these researchers and developers of these military assets by unfriendly nations or terror networks would lead to the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry. The West providing funding grants to keep these researchers and developers employed on civilian oriented projects thus preventing them from selling their services or expertise to enemy nation states or organizations. Canada, the European Union and the United States funded these projects by establishing organizations and foundations through which funds and grants were provided to projects which employed these scientists and engineers.

==Member Nations==
The original donor member nations were Canada, Sweden and the United States. In 1997, the original treaty was amended to include the European Union supplanting Sweden's membership in the organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2151">In [[botany]] and [[plant taxonomy]], a '''series''' is a subdivision of a [[genus]], a [[taxonomic rank]] below that of [[section (botany)|section]] (and [[subsection (botany)|subsection]]) but above that of [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 in {{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

Sections and/or series are typically used to help organize very large [[genus|genera]], which may have hundreds of species.

[[File:Geological map Britain William Smith 1815.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]'s [[geological map]] of England, Wales, and southern Scotland. Published in 1815, it was the first national-scale geological map, and by far the most accurate of its time.]]

'''''The Map that Changed the World''''' is a book by [[Simon Winchester]] about English geologist [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] and his great achievement, the first [[geological map]] of England and Wales.

Smith's was the first national-scale geological map, and by far the most accurate of its time. His pivotal insights were that each local sequence of rock strata was a subsequence of a single universal sequence of strata and that these rock strata could be distinguished and traced for great distances by means of embedded fossilized organisms.

Winchester's book narrates the intellectual context of the time, the development of Smith's ideas and how they contributed to the [[theory of evolution]] and more generally to a dawning realisation of the true age of the earth. The book describes the social, economic or industrial context for Smith's insights and work, such as the importance of coal mining and the transport of coal by means of canals, both of which were a stimulus to the study of geology and the means whereby Smith supported his research. Land owners wished to know if coal might be found on their holdings. Canal planning and construction depended on understanding the rock and soil along its route.

Related topics, such as the founding of the [[Geological Society of London]], are included. Smith's map was published by [[John Cary]], a leading map publisher. Winchester describes the practice of publishing at the time as well as the system of [[debtor's prison]]s through his account of the sojourn of Smith in the [[King's Bench Prison]].

==Book format details==
''The Map that Changed the World'' was published in 2001 by [[Harper Collins]], while Winchester retains the copyright. The first edition is illustrated by Soun Vannithone. It includes an extensive index, glossary of geological terms, recommended reading and (lengthy) acknowledgements, as well as many stippled images (of consistent style). The last numbered page is page 329. There are 16 chapters, and single clay paper sheet in the middle containing colour plates of Smith's famous map and a modern geological map for comparison. (Smith's map is less complete, but essentially in agreement with the modern map). An image of Smith's first table of strata, and first (circular) geological map are also included. Just after the contents section, there is a 5-page section giving extensive details on the illustrations (such as the names of the chapter heading fossils). Each chapter begins with an inset image of a fossil, and a large first Capital. The dust-cover of the book can be removed and unfolded to reveal a larger print of the map in question.

===Escape on a Northbound Stage===
A plausible but whimsical description of the day on which William Smith was let out of debtor's prison. It inducts the reader into the interpretation of the time and place to be held consistently throughout the book.  Smith is described physically, as heavy-set balding and plain-looking, and emotionally as quitting London in disgust.  He is leaving London with nothing other than his wife, nephew, and such possessions as they can carry.  It is implied that these circumstances are the result of unjustified discrimination from the scientific elite.  The chapter ends with a brief note that 12 years later the injustice was in some measure redressed.

===A Land Awakening from Sleep===
A description of the social circumstances of the time of the birth of Smith. It begins by emphasising that the date of 4004 bc, for the beginning of the world, computed from the genealogy tables of the bible, was firmly accepted by most; the idea that the world was any older was considered implausible.  Explanations based on [[Noah's flood]] were acceptable in scientific circles. But, in the year 1769, as Smith was born, [[James Watt]] was patenting a steam engine, cloth manufacture was improving, the postal service was viable. New technology and information was rapidly becoming available or even common-place. "William Smith appeared on the stage at a profoundly interesting moment: he was about to make it more so."

These claims by Winchester are inaccurate.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Geologists had begun to recognize that the earth was old in the late 1600s. Ussher's 4004 BC age for the earth, along with similar estimates by Isaac Newton and other academics of the 17th century, was merely a historical footnote in academia by Smith's lifetime. In 1787, Scottish geologist [[James Hutton]] argued that the earth's age was immeasurable.&lt;ref name="TaylorReviewBaxter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/hisn/2006/00000068/00000003/art00006 |title=''Ages in Chaos: James Hutton and the Discovery of Deep Time''|date=September 2006|work=[[The Historian (journal)|The Historian]] ([[Abstract (summary)|abstract]])|access-date=8 April 2017|publisher=[[Book review]] of [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], {{ISBN|0-7653-1238-7}}|author=Kenneth L. Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Smith was in no way challenging the church or risking jail - American paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] refuted such claims in his review of The Map That Changed the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=The Man Who Set the Clock Back |journal=The New York Review of Books |date=2001-10-04 |volume=48 |issue=15 |page=51–6 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2001/10/04/the-man-who-set-the-clock-back/ |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, Smith's single-minded focus on recognizing layers made him rather late to realize that the earth was old.  Additionally, Smith's focus on recognizing layers based on the fossils in them was not unique.  Though he was especially thorough, similar work (especially on the mainland of Europe) around the same time independently cemented the principle that fossils change over time and can be reliably used to identify layers.  [[Martin Rudwick]]'s ''Earth's Deep History: How It Was Discovered and Why It Matters'' is perhaps the most accessible account of the development of geology in this time interval.

'''''The Second Voyage of the Mimi''''' is a twelve-episode American [[education|educational]] [[television program]] depicting a fictional crew of a [[sailboat]] named the ''Mimi'' exploring [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins in Southern [[Mexico]]. Along the way, they learn about ancient civilization and also attempt to foil the plans of looters who steal the artifacts from the ancient sites. This series is a sequel to ''[[The Voyage of the Mimi]]'', produced in 1984, in which the Granvilles rented their boat and services to zoologists studying the [[humpback whale]] in the waters off [[Massachusetts]].

The series aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and was created by the [[Bank Street College of Education]] in 1988 to teach middle-schoolers about [[science]] and [[social studies]]. 

In each episode, viewers are taught something scientific relating to plot events in the previous episode of the show. For example, an episode's plot would be about deciphering Mayan writing, and the viewer also receives information about how the Maya wrote various words and numbers.

==Cast==

''The Second Voyage of the Mimi'' saw a young [[Ben Affleck]] return as C.T. Granville, and Peter G. Marston as his grandfather Captain Granville. Marston was a scientist at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]{{Fact|date=May 2009}} during the production of the program and used to own the actual ship, the ''Mimi''.

Main Cast Listing:
*[[Ben Affleck]] as Clement Tyler (C.T.) Granville
*[[Peter G. Marston]] as Captain Clement Tyler Granville
*Martha Hill as Pepper Thornton, who is an expert scuba diver
*Roger Cudney as Pepper's former employer, Harvey Westerman.
*Hector Tellez as Pedro, an employee of Westerman's.
*Inaki Carrion as Victor Cobos, an archeologist
*Cheryl Lynn Bruce as Terry Gibbs, another archeologist who works with Victor.
*Carla Douglin as Quiché Gibbs, Terry Gibbs's daughter.
*Enrique Lucero as Tomás Segovia, the man in charge of archeological sites in that part of Mexico.
*Patricia Ancira as Rosa Segovia, Tomas Segovia's daughter, also a skilled diver.

==Episodes==
Each episode consists of two fifteen-minute segments. 

The first segment of each episode follows the serialized tale of scientists studying the ancient Maya and getting involved with thwarting site looters. The two scientists are Victor Cobos, a Mexican man of Maya descent, and Terry Gibbs, an American woman. Terry's husband is revealed to have been killed by site looters. Terry's daughter Quiché has grown up with archeology and can already read Maya writing. They hire the Granvilles in [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]], near [[Tulum]], to help them study the routes of ancient Maya ships. The Granvilles in turn hire Pepper Thornton, the daughter of one of Captain Granville's old sailing buddies, because she is an expert diver. Previously, Pepper worked for Harvey Westerman, a skinflint tour operator, guiding tourists on dives through then reefs. 

Each second segment is a standalone exploration of one of the scientific principles touched on in the serialized tale. In these second segments, one of the child actors (Ben Affleck or Carla Douglin) comes out of character and interviews real, in many cases well-known, scientists abouts their work. These scientists include [[archeology|archeologists]] Bill Fash, Peter Reynolds and [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]], and [[rain forest]] [[ecology|ecologist]] [[Nalini Nadkarni]]. In addition, Martha Hill, a silver medalist in the Winter Paralympics, comes out of character in an interview with Ben Affleck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.paralympic.org/ipc_results/results2pdf.php?sport=alpine&amp;competition=1988PWG&amp;gender=f&amp;discipline=&amp;event=Downhill&amp;eclass=LW2 | title = Innsbruck 1988 Paralympic Winter Games Alpine Skiing Women's Downhill LW2 | work = International Paralympic Committee |accessdate = September 21, 2016|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160817133444/https://www.paralympic.org/ipc_results/results2pdf.php?sport=alpine&amp;competition=1988PWG&amp;gender=f&amp;discipline=&amp;event=Downhill&amp;eclass=LW2 |archivedate = August 17, 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation given|date=September 2016}}

==The real vessel ''Mimi''==
The ''Mimi'' was a French-built sailboat, originally constructed in 1931 as a small cargo and fishing vessel. It was purchased in the early 1980s by Peter Marston and was kept moored in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Massachusetts]]. Besides its appearances on the TV show, it went from city to city and acted as a tourist attraction in places such as Salem, Massachusetts, [[Boston]], and other cities. 
In 1988, Peter Marston and some freelance musicians produced a cassette and songbook called "Sea Songs from the Mimi Crew" of old-time sea songs self-published under the name "The Barn School" based in Gloucester, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ben Raye|title=Songs of the Sea - Greenland Whale Fisheries - as sung by The Crew of the Mimi|date=2013-06-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdvwgnxxLds|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cassette and songbook were available from the actual sailing vessel Mimi, as well as where music was sold, and in museum gift shops. The cassette and songbook are now out of print.
Also available from the sailing vessel Mimi were souvenirs such as T-shirts and buttons that said "I was on board the Mimi." The souvenirs are no longer manufactured, and have hardly turned up on Internet marketers such as [[eBay]] or [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].

Marston retained ownership of the vessel until 1999, when the boat was sold to new owners; Captain George G. Story of Gloucester, Massachusetts, his brother Captain Alan M. Story of Deltona, Florida and Spiro "Steve" Cocotas, also from Gloucester. They operated the vessel as Three Mates Inc. for several years, bringing the boat to as many as 28 cities along the east coast. The ''Mimi'' eventually fell into disrepair, and was scrapped in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-08-11/yourtown/29877081_1_mimi-voyage-trawler|title=In East Boston, the last voyage of the Mimi|last=McGonegal|first=Joe|date=2011-08-11|newspaper=Boston.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Operation Upshot test.ogv|thumb|320px|Video of Upshot–Knothole Grable test]]
[[Image:uk-grable2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A closeup of the [[mushroom cloud]] and fireball.]]
'''Upshot–Knothole ''Grable''''' was a [[nuclear testing|nuclear weapons test]] conducted by the [[United States]] as part of [[Operation Upshot–Knothole]]. Detonation of the associated [[nuclear weapon]] occurred 19 seconds after its deployment at 8:30am [[Pacific Time zone|PDT]] (1530 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on May 25, 1953, in Area 5 of the [[Nevada Test Site]].  The codename ''Grable'' was chosen because the letter ''Grable'' is phonetic for G, as in "gun", since the warhead was a [[gun-type fission weapon]]. As a shell, or [[nuclear artillery|artillery-fired atomic projectile]] (AFAP), the device was the first of its kind. The test remains the only nuclear artillery shell ever actually fired in the [[Nuclear weapons testing|U.S. nuclear weapons test program]].

''Grable'' was the second of only four gun-type warheads ever detonated (the first was [[Little Boy]], the weapon used against [[Hiroshima]], the last two were test firings of the [[W33 (nuclear weapon)|W33]]; all other atomic weapons were [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion type weapon|implosion-type]] weapons).  The shell, designated a [[W9 (nuclear warhead)|Mark 9]] nuclear weapon, had a diameter of 280 mm (11.02 in), was 1380 mm (54.4 in) long and weighed 364 kg (803 lb).  The [[M65 Atomic Cannon]] from which it was fired had a muzzle velocity of 625 m/s (2,060 ft/s), for a nominal range of {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and weighed 77 [[tonne|metric tons]] (85 [[short ton|t]]).

The detonation of ''Grable'' occurred 6 seconds after its firing.&lt;ref name="Operation Upshot-Knothole DOE film"&gt;[http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/films/film.aspx?ID=1 "Operation Upshot–Knothole."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507020233/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/films/film.aspx?ID=1 |date=2008-05-07 }} Department of Energy, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;  It detonated over 11,000 yards (over 10 km, 6.25 mi) away from the gun it was fired from, over a part of the Nevada Test Site known as [[Frenchman Flat]].  The explosion was an [[air burst]] of 160 m (524 ft) above the ground (7 m (24 ft) above its designated burst altitude), 26 m (87 ft) west and 41 m (136 ft) south of its target (slightly uprange).  Its yield was estimated at 15 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], around the same level as [[Little Boy]].  An anomalous feature of the blast was the formation of a [[Precursor (physics)|precursor]], a second shock front ahead of the incident wave.  This precursor was formed when the [[shock wave]] reflected off the ground and surpassed the incident wave and Mach stem due to a heated ground air layer and the low burst height.&lt;ref name="Operation Upshot-Knothole DOE film" /&gt;  It resulted in a lower overpressure, but higher overall dynamic pressure, which inflicted much more damage on [[Drag (physics)|drag]] sensitive targets such as jeeps and personnel carriers.  This led strategists to rethink the importance of low air bursts in tactical [[nuclear warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuran, Pete. [[Trinity and Beyond]]: The Atomic Bomb Movie. Visual Concept Entertainment, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some images from Upshot–Knothole ''Grable'' were accidentally relabeled as belonging to the ''Priscilla'' shot from [[Operation Plumbbob]] in 1957. As a consequence many publications including official government documents have the photo mislabeled.&lt;ref&gt;Carey Sublette, "Operation Plumbbob," Nuclear Weapon Archive, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Plumbob.html http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Plumbob.html].  (accessed December 27, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]], at the time the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]] were present for the test.

'''William Frederick Purcell''' (18 September 1866 [[London]] - 3 October 1919 [[Cape Town]]) was an English-born South African arachnologist and zoologist. He is regarded as being the founder of modern [[araneology]] in [[South Africa]].

Purcell was awarded a doctorate after studying at a number of German universities. He then took up an appointment as First Assistant at the [[South African Museum]] in charge of terrestrial vertebrates. He was the first South African zoologist to start a systematic study of spiders, devising keys and providing full descriptions of species. Up to that time [[Arthur Stanley Hirst]] (1883–1930), [[Frederick Octavius Pickard-Cambridge|Pickard-Cambridge]] and [[R. I. Pocock]] of the [[British Museum]] had occasionally named spiders sent them from South African sources. Pocock especially was supplied with unknown specimens from Natal and Rhodesia, many coming from [[Selmar Schonland]], the botany professor at [[Rhodes University]].

South Africa is a fertile hunting ground for the study of [[Mygalomorphae]] or 4-lunged spiders, and both Purcell and R. W. E. Tucker who succeeded him, were drawn to this group, as was J. Hewitt. William and Anna Purcell afford an example of collaboration in arachnology of husband and wife, the other well-known couple being [[George and Elizabeth Peckham]] from the States who worked on South African [[Salticidae]].

A species of South African gecko, ''[[Pachydactylus|pachydactylus purcelli]]'', is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).
