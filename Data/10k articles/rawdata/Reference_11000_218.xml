The '''"1890 Manifesto"''' (also known as the '''"Woodruff Manifesto"''' or the '''"Anti-polygamy Manifesto"''') is a statement which officially advised against any future [[plural marriage]] in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Issued by church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Wilford Woodruff]] in September 1890, the Manifesto was a response to mounting anti-polygamy pressure from the [[United States Congress]], which by 1890 had disincorporated the church, [[escheat]]ed its assets to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and imprisoned many prominent polygamist Mormons. Upon its issuance, the LDS Church in conference accepted Woodruff's Manifesto as "authoritative and binding."

The Manifesto was a dramatic turning point in the [[history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|history of the LDS Church]]. It advised against church members from entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for [[Utah]] to become a [[U.S. state]]. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada,&lt;ref name = manifestoend&gt;{{cite web|title=The Manifesto and the End of Plural Marriage|url=http://www.lds.org/topics/the-manifesto-and-the-end-of-plural-marriage|website=lds.org|publisher=LDS Church|accessdate=8 June 2015|quote=The ledger of 'marriages and sealings performed outside the temple,' which is not comprehensive, lists 315 marriages performed between October 17, 1890, and September 8, 1903. Of the 315 marriages recorded in the ledger, research indicates that 25 (7.9%) were plural marriages and 290 were monogamous marriages (92.1%). Almost all the monogamous marriages recorded were performed in Arizona or Mexico. Of the 25 plural marriages, 18 took place in Mexico, 3 in Arizona, 2 in Utah, and 1 each in Colorado and on a boat on the Pacific Ocean.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=D.

Though neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early 1900s.

==Background==
The Manifesto was issued in response to the anti-polygamy policies of the [[federal government of the United States]], and most especially the [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] of 1887. This law disincorporated the LDS Church and authorized the federal government to seize all of the church’s assets. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the provisions of the Edmunds–Tucker Act in ''[[Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States]]'' in May 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|136|1|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1889, Woodruff, then president of the church, began privately refusing the permission that was required to contract new plural marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Wagoner|1989|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1889, Woodruff publicly admitted that he was no longer approving new polygamous marriages, and in answer to a reporter's question of what the LDS Church's attitude was toward the law against polygamy, Woodruff stated, "we mean to obey it. We have no thought of evading it or ignoring it."&lt;ref&gt;''Salt Lake Herald'', 1889-10-27, quoted in: {{harvnb|Van Wagoner|1989|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it had been Mormon practice for over 25 years to either evade or ignore anti-polygamy laws, Woodruff's statement was a signal that a change in church policy was developing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2005|p=62-63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1890, the Supreme Court had already ruled in ''[[Davis v. Beason]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|133|333|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that a law in [[Idaho Territory]] which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2005|p=63-64}}&lt;/ref&gt; That decision left the Mormons no further legal recourse to their current marriage practices and made it unlikely that without change [[Utah Territory]] would be granted statehood.

Woodruff later said that on the night of September 23, 1890, he received a [[revelation]] from [[Jesus Christ]] that the church should cease the practice of plural marriage.&lt;ref name = wwremarks&gt;Remarks of Wilford Woodruff at Cache [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]] Conference, [[Logan, Utah]], November 1, 1891; reported at Wilford Woodruff, "Remarks", ''Deseret Weekly'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) November 14, 1891; excerpts reprinted in LDS Church, [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/1# "Official Declaration 1"], [[Doctrine and Covenants]].&lt;/ref&gt; The following morning, he reported this to some of the [[General authority|general authorities]] and placed the hand-written draft on a table. [[George Reynolds (Mormon)|George Reynolds]] would later recount that he, [[Charles W. Penrose]], and [[John R. Winder]] modified Woodruff's draft into the current language accepted by the general authorities and presented to the church as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Proceedings Before the Committee On Privileges and Elections of the United States Senate in the Matter of The Protests Against the Right of Hon.

Utah applied for statehood again in 1895, and it was granted on January 4, 1896. One of the conditions for granting Utah and other western territories statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into the state constitution.

==Text==
The Manifesto states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To Whom It May Concern:

Press dispatches having been sent for political purposes, from Salt Lake City, which have been widely published, to the effect that the Utah Commission, in their recent report to the Secretary of the Interior, allege that plural marriages have been contracted in Utah since last June or during the past year, also that in public discourses the leaders of the Church have taught, encouraged and urged the continuance of the practice of polygamy—

I, therefore, as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, do hereby, in the most solemn manner, declare that these charges are false. We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory.

One case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the marriage was performed in the [[Endowment House]], in Salt Lake City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without delay.

Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I heareby declare my intention to submit to those laws, to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.

There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey such teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.

Wilford Woodruff [signed]

President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;ref name=LDSOD1&gt;LDS Church, {{lds|Official Declaration |od|1}}, [[Doctrine and Covenants]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Formal acceptance by the LDS Church==
Less than a month after the Manifesto was issued, the LDS Church used the procedure of [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|common consent]] to make it binding upon church members. At a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] of the church in Salt Lake City on October 6, 1890, the Manifesto was read, after which [[Lorenzo Snow]], the [[president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], made the following motion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the only man on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the sealing ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his position to issue the Manifesto which has been read in our hearing, and which is dated September 1890, and that as a Church in General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning plural marriages as authoritative and binding.&lt;ref name=LDSOD1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conference proceedings recorded that "the vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous."&lt;ref name=LDSOD1/&gt; However, a modern author reports that "at least some voted against the Manifesto and perhaps a majority abstained".&lt;ref name = erickson/&gt; Some members, including [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Moses Thatcher]], only reluctantly supported the Manifesto and interpreted it as a sign that the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus was imminent, after which plural marriage would be reinstated.&lt;ref name = erickson/&gt;

==New plural marriages vs. existing plural marriages==
The Manifesto was the end of official church authorization for the creation of new plural marriages that violated local laws. It had no effect on the status of already existing plural marriages, and plural marriages continued to be performed in locations where it was believed to be legal. As Woodruff explained at the general conference where the Manifesto was accepted by the church, "[t]his Manifesto only refers to future marriages, and does not affect past conditions. I did not, I could not, and would not promise that you would desert your wives and children. This you cannot do in honor."&lt;ref&gt;Diary entry of [[Marriner W. Merrill]], 1890-10-06 (LDS Church archives), as cited in: {{harvnb|Hardy|1992|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Woodruff's explanation, some church leaders and members who were polygamous did begin to live with only one wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lorenzo Snow]], who would succeed Woodruff as president of the church, was one such leader.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of Mormon polygamists continued to cohabit with their plural wives in violation of the [[Edmunds Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Kenneth L., II |last= Cannon |title= Beyond the Manifesto: Polygamous Cohabitation among LDS General Authorities after 1890 |journal= [[Utah Historical Quarterly]] |volume= 46 |issue= 1 |page= 24 |year= 1978 |url= http://utahhistory.sdlhost.com/#/item/000000031000612/view/26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and post-Manifesto plural marriage==
Within six years of the announcement of the Manifesto, Utah had become a [[U.S. state|state]] and federal prosecution of Mormon polygamists subsided. However, Congress still refused to seat representatives-elect who were polygamists, including [[B. H. Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Kathleen |last= Flake |authorlink= Kathleen Flake |year= 2003 |title= The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle |place= Chapel Hill |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |isbn= 0-8078-5501-4 |oclc= 57707347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. Michael Quinn]] and other Mormon historians have documented that some church [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] covertly sanctioned plural marriages after the Manifesto. This practice was especially prevalent in [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]] because of an erroneous belief that such marriages were legal in those jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous marriages also were performed in international waters on the high seas.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant minority were performed in Utah and other western American states and territories. The estimates of the number of post-Manifesto plural marriages performed range from scores to thousands, with the actual figure probably close to 250.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardy|1992|loc=pp. 167–335 and appendix II}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the LDS Church officially acknowledges that although the Manifesto "officially ceased" the practice of plural marriage in the church, "the ending of the practice after the Manifesto was ... gradual."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-and-families-in-early-utah "Plural Marriage and Families in Early Utah"], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = manifestoend/&gt;

Rumors of post-Manifesto marriages surfaced and began to be examined by Congress in the [[Reed Smoot hearings]]. In response, church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] issued a "[[Second Manifesto]]" in  1904 which reaffirmed the church's opposition to the creation of new plural marriages and threatened excommunication for Latter-day Saints who continued to enter into  or solemnize new plural marriages. [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostles]] [[John Whittaker Taylor|John W. Taylor]] and [[Matthias F. Cowley]] both resigned from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] due to disagreement with the church's position on plural marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Victor W. |last= Jorgensen |first2= B. Carmon |last2= Hardy |title= The Taylor-Cowley Affair and the Watershed of Mormon History |journal= Utah Historical Quarterly |volume= 48 |issue= 1 |page= 4 |year= 1980 |url= http://utahhistory.sdlhost.com/#/item/000000031000669/view/6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Plural marriage in violation of local law continues to be grounds for [[Disciplinary council|excommunication]] from the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year= 2010 |title= [[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]] |place= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= LDS Church |page= 57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cessation of plural marriage within LDS Church gave rise to the [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] movement.

==Evolution of Latter-day Saint views on the Manifesto==
The Manifesto has been canonized by the LDS Church, and its text appears in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], one of the church's books of [[Standard works|scripture]]. However, when the Manifesto was issued, it was not apparent that Woodruff or the other leaders of the LDS Church viewed it as the result of a divine revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardy|1992|pp=146–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one year after he declared the Manifesto, Woodruff began to claim that he had received instructions from Jesus Christ that formed the basis of what he wrote in the text of the Manifesto.&lt;ref name=wwremarks/&gt; These instructions were reportedly accompanied by a [[Vision (religion)|vision]] of what would occur if the Manifesto were not issued.&lt;ref name=wwremarks/&gt;

Following Woodruff's death in 1898, other church leaders began to teach that the Manifesto was the result of a [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] of God.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Discourse delivered by [[Lorenzo Snow]] at [[St. George, Utah]], on 1899-05-03, published as Lorenzo Snow, [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/MStar&amp;CISOPTR=36519&amp;filename=36520.pdf "Discourse"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025160142/http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=%2FMStar&amp;CISOPTR=36519&amp;filename=36520.pdf |date=2007-10-25 }}, ''[[Millennial Star]]'', vol. 61, no. 34 pp. 529–33 at p. 532 (1899-08-24), reprinted in Lorenzo Snow (1998, Clyde J. Williams ed.). ''The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow: Fifth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) pp. 192–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, church leaders have consistently taught that the Manifesto was inspired of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= John A. |last= Widtsoe |authorlink= John A.

A non-Mormon observer of the church has stated that "[t]here is no question that, from a doctrinal standpoint, President Woodruff's Manifesto now has comparable status with [Joseph Smith's] revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Jan |last= Shipps |authorlink= Jan Shipps |year= 1985 |title= Mormonism: The Story of a New Religious Tradition |place= Urbana |publisher= University of Illinois Press |page= 114 |isbn= 0252011597 |oclc= 10726560}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another writer has stated bluntly that "contemporary Latter-day Saints regard the Manifesto as a revelation".&lt;ref name = turner/&gt; The Manifesto is currently published as "Official Declaration 1" in the Doctrine and Covenants.

'''''Dissostichus mawsoni''''', the '''Antarctic toothfish''', is a [[species]] of [[cod icefish]] native to the [[Southern Ocean]]. It is often mistakenly referred to as an [[Antarctic]] cod, consistent with the misnaming of other [[notothenioid]] Antarctic fish as rock cods. However, notothenioid fishes are unrelated to [[cod]]s, which are in another taxonomic order, the [[Gadiformes]]. The generic name ''Dissostichus'' is from the Greek ''dissos'' (twofold) and ''stichus'' (line) and refers to the presence of two long lateral lines, which are very important to the species’ ecology. The common name "toothfish" refers to the presence of biserial dentition in the upper jaw, thought to give it a shark-like appearance. The habitat of the Antarctic toothfish is in subzero degree water below latitude [[60th parallel south|60°S]].

==Description==
Fully grown, these fish (and their warmer-water relative, the [[Patagonian toothfish]], ''D. eleginoides'') can grow to more than {{convert|1.7|m}} in length and 135&amp;nbsp;kg in weight, twice as large as the next largest Antarctic fish. Being large, and consistent with the unstructured [[food web]]s of the ocean (i.e., big fish eat little fish regardless of identity, even eating their own offspring), the Antarctic toothfish has been characterized as a voracious predator. Furthermore, by being by far the largest midwater fish in the [[Southern Ocean]], it is thought to fill the ecological role that [[sharks]] play in other oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Andriashev, A.P. (1962). On the systematic position of the giant nototheniid fish (Pisces, Nototheniidae) from the McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Zool. Zhur. 41:1048–1050 (in Russian; English translation available from National Institute of Oceanography, Wormley, Godalming, Surrey, UK, No. NIOT/1132, June 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeVries, A.L.; and Eastman JT (1998) Brief review of the biology of ''Dissostichus mawsoni''.

Academic Press, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; Aiding in that role, the Antarctic toothfish is one of only five notothenioid species that, as  adults, are [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]].

Marine Biology 140:815–822.&lt;/ref&gt; Both bottom-dwelling and mid-water prey are therefore available to them. Most other notothenioid fish and the majority of all Antarctic fish, including smaller toothfish, are [[Demersal fish|confined to the bottom]].&lt;ref name="Eastman"/&gt; Coloring is black to olive brown, sometimes lighter on the undersides, with a mottled pattern on body and fins. Small fish blend in very well among the [[benthic]] [[sponge]]s and [[coral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eastman, J.T.; and Barry, J.P. (2002) Underwater video observation of the Antarctic toothfish ''Dissostichus mawsoni'' (Perciformes: Nototheniidae) in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Polar Biology 25: 391–395&lt;/ref&gt; They have a broad head, an elongated body, long [[Dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]]s, large [[pectoral fin]]s and a rudder-like [[caudal fin]]. They typically move slowly, but are capable of speed bursts that can elude predatory seals.&lt;ref name="Fuiman"/&gt;

==Feeding ecology==
Over the continental shelf, Antarctic toothfish feed on [[shrimp]] (''[[Hippolytidae|Nauticaris]]'' spp.) and small fish, principally another neutrally buoyant nototheniid, the [[Antarctic silverfish]] (''Pleuragramma antarcticum''). This loosely [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] species is also a major prey of [[Adélie Penguin|Adélie]] (''Pygoscelis adeliae'') and [[Emperor Penguin|emperor penguins]] (''Aptenodytes forsteri''), [[Weddell Seal|Weddell seals]] (''Leptonychotes weddellii'') and [[Minke whale#Taxonomy|Antarctic minke whales]] (''Balaenoptera bonaerensis'').&lt;ref&gt;Eastman, J.T. (1985) ''Pleuragramma antarcticum'' (Pisces, Nototheniidae) as food for other fishes in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Polar Biology 4:155–160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Mesa, M.; Eastman, J.T.; and Vacchi, M. (2004) The role of notothenioid fish in the food web of the Ross Sea shelf waters: a review. Polar Biology 27:321–338.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, competition for prey among toothfish and these other mesopredators (middle [[trophic level]] predators) could be very important. The large Antarctic toothfish are eaten by [[sperm whale]]s (''Physeter macrocephalus''), [[killer whale]]s (''Orcinus orca''), Weddell seals and possibly [[colossal squid]] (''Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni''). Toothfish that are dwelling on the bottom, particularly those caught during the summer on the [[continental slope]], eat mainly [[Rattail|grenadiers]] (Macrouridae) but also feed on other smaller fish species and [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s (''Raja'' spp.).&lt;ref&gt;Fenaughty, J.M.; Stevens, D.W., Hanchet, S.M. (2003). Diet of the Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawsoni'') from the Ross Sea, Antarctica (CCAMLR Statistical Subarea 88.1). CCAMLR Sci. 10:1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Antarctic toothfish have been caught to depths of 2200m, though  based on commercial fishing effort, few occur that deep.&lt;ref name="Hanchet"&gt;Hanchet, S.M.; Rickard, G.J.; Fenaughty, J.M.; Dunn, A.; and Williams, M.J.H. (2008). Hypothetical life cycle for Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawsoni'') in the Ross Sea region. CCAMLR Sci. 15:35–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and reproduction==
Aging data indicate Antarctic toothfish are relatively fast-growing when young, but then growth slows later in life. They reach about one-third of maximum size after five years, and half maximum by 10 years, after which growth slows considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, P.L. (2002).

Age estimation and lead–radium dating of Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawsoni'') in the Ross Sea. Polar Biology {{doi|10.1007/s00300-010-0883-z}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To grow fast when small is an adaptation of most [[predatory fish]], e.g., sharks, so as not to be small for very long. The maximum age recorded so far has been 48 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hanchet, S.M.; Stevenson, M.L.; Phillips, N.L.; and Dunn, A.

(2010). Length- and age-at-spawning of Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawsoni'') in the Ross Sea. CCAMLR Sci. 17: 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few Antarctic toothfish with mature eggs have ever been caught, meaning knowledge is sparse about fecundity.&lt;ref name="Yukhov, V.L. 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HanchetTwo"&gt;Hanchet, S.M. (2010) Updated species profile for Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawson''i). CCAMLR WG-FSA-10/24.

Hobart, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Large, mature, older fish have been caught among the [[seamount]]s of the [[Pacific-Antarctic Ridge]], a location thus thought to be important for spawning. Smaller, subadult Antarctic toothfish tend to concentrate in shallower waters on the continental shelf, while a large portion of the older fish are found on  in the continental slope.&lt;ref name="HanchetTwo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashford et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashford|first1=Julian|last2=Dinniman|first2=Michael|last3=Brooks|first3=Cassandra|last4=Andrews|first4=Allen H.|last5=Hofmann|first5=Eileen|last6=Cailliet|first6=Gregor|last7=Jones|first7=Christopher|last8=Ramanna|first8=Nakul|last9=Gillanders|first9=Bronwyn |title=Does large-scale ocean circulation structure life history connectivity in Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawsoni'')? |journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |date=2012 |volume=69 |issue=12 |pages=1903–1919 |doi=10.1139/f2012-111}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequestering by size and age could be another adaptation for small fish to avoid being eaten by large ones. The recruitment potential of Antarctic toothfish, a measure of both fecundity and survival to spawning age, is not known.

==Anatomy and physiology==
The Antarctic toothfish has a lightweight, partially [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] skeleton, lacks a [[swim bladder]], and has fatty deposits which act as a stored energy source, particularly during spawning. This fat also makes large toothfish neutrally buoyant. Many toothfish caught over the seamounts are very depleted of fat, and this is thought perhaps to be related to spawning and spawning migration, which are energy-demanding activities.&lt;ref&gt;Fenaughty, J.M.; Eastman, J.T.; and Sidell, B.D. (2008). Biological implications of low condition factor “axe handle” specimens of the Antarctic toothfish, ''Dissostichus mawsoni'', from the Ross Sea. Antarctic Science 20:537–551.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known what happens to these fat-depleted fish, including whether they reach, or how long it takes them to reach, breeding condition again; this ostensibly occurs upon returning to continental slope waters. Antarctic toothfish have [[Vision in fishes|vision]] and [[lateral line]] systems well adapted to find prey in low light levels.&lt;ref name="EastmanLanoo"&gt;Eastman, JT; Lannoo, MJ. (2011). Divergence of brain and retinal anatomy and histology in pelagic Antarctic notothenioid fishes of the sister taxa ''Dissostichus'' and ''Pleuragramma''. Journal of Morphology 272:419-441.&lt;/ref&gt; Since ice covers the surface of the ocean where Antarctic toothfish occur even in summer, these sensory specializations likely evolved to enable survival in the reduced light levels found under ice and in the Antarctic winter, as well as at deep depths. Antarctic toothfish also have a very well developed sense of smell,&lt;ref name="EastmanLanoo"/&gt; which is why they are easily caught by baited hooks and also scavenge the remains of penguins killed by other predators.

==Cold adaptation==
The Antarctic toothfish is noteworthy, like most other Antarctic notothenioids, for producing [[antifreeze protein|antifreeze glycoproteins]], a feature not seen in its closest relative, the Patagonian toothfish, which typically inhabits slightly warmer waters. The presence of antifreeze glycroproteins allows the Antarctic toothfish (and other notothenioids) to thrive in sub-zero waters of the Southern Ocean surrounding [[Antarctica]]. The Antarctic toothfish's voracious appetite also is important in coping with cold water.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, J.; Xavier, J.C.; and Agnew, D.L. (2011). The diet of toothfish species ''Dissostichus eleginoides'' and ''Dissostichus mawsoni'' with overlapping distributions. Journal of Fish Biology 79: 138–154.&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly caught in the [[Ross Sea]] in the austral summer, but has also been recorded from Antarctic coastal waters south of the [[Indian Ocean]] sector, in the vicinity of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], and near the [[South Sandwich Islands]].

== Fishery and associated ecosystem ==
A fishery for Antarctic toothfish, managed by the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), has existed since 1997. The existence of this fishery in the Ross Sea, the area where most Antarctic toothfish are caught, is very contentious - the main argument proposed for this being   the lack of accurate population parameters, such as original [[Fish stock|stock size]], fecundity, and recruitment. Moreover, the main fishing grounds is presumed by some researchers to cover the area through which the entire stock of Antarctic toothfish pass.&lt;ref name="Ashford et al. 2012"/&gt; Typically the fishing season has finished in the area by the end of February and for the remainder of the year much of the area is covered by sea-ice providing a natural impediment to fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Fenaughty and Parker (2014) Quantifying the impacts of ice on demersal longlining; a case study in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1 . WG-FSA 14/55 rev 2&lt;/ref&gt; This fishery is characterised by opponents as being a challenge to manage owing to the nature of benthic [[longline fishing]]. The bycatch of other fish can also be significant, with the ratio to tonnes of toothfish caught ranging from 4.5% to 17.9% and averaging 9.3% from the 1999/2000 fishing season to 2013/14 in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1 when the toothfish catch first exceeded 50 tonnes and from 2.3% to 24.5% averaging 12.4% in CCAMLR Subarea 88.2 up to the latest publicly available figure from 2013/14.&lt;ref&gt;Fishery Report 2014: Exploratory fishery for ''Dissostichus'' spp. in Subareas 88.1 and 88.2. http://www.ccamlr.org/en/system/files/08%20TOT881%20882%202014_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The bycatch of other fish species is also regulated to a maximum amount annually by CCAMLR.  CCAMLR decision rules are based on determining the catch level that will ensure that the median estimated spawning stock biomass (not total biomass) is greater than or equal to 50% of the average pre-exploitation spawning biomass after a further 35 years of fishing (i.e. 35 years from each year of assessment), with the additional condition that there is less than a 10% probability that the spawning biomass will decline below 20% of the pre-exploitation level at any time during this period.&lt;ref name="CONSTABLE, A.J. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Constable |first1=Andrew J. |last2=de la Mare |first2=William K. |last3=Agnew |first3=David J. |last4=Everson |first4=Inigo |last5=Miller |first5=Denzil |title=Managing fisheries to conserve the Antarctic marine ecosystem: practical implementation of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |date=2000 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=778–791 |doi=10.1006/jmsc.2000.0725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current spawning stock biomass for Antarctic toothfish in the Ross Sea Region is estimated to be at 75% of the pre-exploitation level (95% Bayesian probability interval 71–78%), well above the 50% target reference point.

An independent study was reported to have detected the disappearance of large fish at the southern periphery of its range in the McMurdo Sound area and was postulated to be consistent with this apparent loss of large fish.&lt;ref name="Ainley"&gt;Ainley, D.G.; Nur, N.; Eastman, J.T.; Ballard, G.; Parkinson, C.L.; Evans, C.W.; and DeVries, A.L. (2012). Decadal trends in abundance, size and condition of Antarctic toothfish in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, 1972-2011. Fish &amp; Fisheries, {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-2979.2012.00474.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However more recent work has shown this was not to be the case in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctic toothfish, lost - and found. http://www.comsdev.canterbury.ac.nz/rss/news/?feed=news&amp;articleId=1531&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have reported that the prevalence of [[Killer whale#Taxonomy and evolution|fish-eating killer whales]] has been apparently decreasing in the southern Ross Sea, foraging efficiency of [[Weddell seal]]s is decreasing, and numbers of [[Adélie penguin]]s (competitors for silverfish) have been increasing.&lt;ref name="Ainley" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainley, D.G.; Ballard, G. (2012) Trophic interactions and the decrease in Killer Whale (''Orcinus orca'') prevalence with reduced availability of large fish in the southern Ross Sea. Aquatic Mammals 38:153-160.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have confirmed visual sightings of Weddell seals and Type-C killer whales holding and consuming large toothfish in the McMurdo Sound area and raise questions over the previously assumed importance of assumed dominance of Antarctic silverfish (''Pleuragramma antarcticum'') in the diet of Weddell seal and Type-C killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;Eisert R., M.H. Pinkerton, S.D. Newsome, O.T. Oftedal. (2013) A Critical Re-examination of the Evidence for a Possible Dependence of Weddell Seals (''Leptonychotes weddellii'') on Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawsoni'') in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. https://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/niwa.co.nz/files/emm-13-28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torres L., Matt H. Pinkerton, R. Pitman, J. Durban, Regina Eisert. (2013) To what extent do type C killer whales (''Orcinus orca'') feed on Antarctic toothfish (''Dissostichus mawsoni'') in the Ross Sea, Antarctica?&lt;/ref&gt;  These reports highlight the importance of managing this fishery in the [[Ecosystem approach to fisheries|best interests of the ecosystem]] by continuing to collect information on both Antarctic toothfish life history and the interaction of that species with predators and prey. An important{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} research programme in this regard is the annual 'Shelf' survey carried out annually since 2012 which is designed to monitor the abundance of subadult Antarctic toothfish in areas where subadult-sized fish have been regularly found (e.g., in the southern Ross Sea) has been designed provide data to better estimate recruitment variability and provide an important early-warning signal of changes in toothfish recruitment.  The project also is used for additional targeted data collection to better understand the life cycle and ecosystem role of Antarctic toothfish.&lt;ref&gt;Mormede S., S.J. Parker, S.M. Hanchet, A. Dunn, and S. Gregory (2014) Results of the third CCAMLR sponsored research survey to monitor abundance of subadult Antarctic toothfish in the southern Ross Sea, February 2014 and development of the time series WG-FSA 14/41. http://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/niwa.co.nz/files/fsa-14-51.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent{{When|date=October 2016}} research provides evidence for long-distance migrations of Type-C killer whales between the Ross Sea and New Zealand waters, indicating a much wider range that had been postulated by a number of scientists.  One adult female Type-C killer whale has been seen in both New Zealand waters and McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and a high large proportion of Type-C killer whales sighted in McMurdo Sound have scars caused by cookiecutter sharks that are currently assumed to be limited to north of 50°S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278672675_Seasonal_site_fidelity_and_movement_of_type-C_killer_whales_between_Antarctica_and_New_Zealand|title=Seasonal site fidelity and movement of type-C killer whales between Antarctica and New Zealand|first1=Regina|last1=Eisert|first2=Ekaterina|last2=Ovsyanikova|first3=Ingrid|last3=Visser|first4=Paul|last4=Ensor|first5=Rohan|last5=Currey|first6=Ben|last6=Sharp|date=1 May 2015|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as this study was occurring Italian whale experts at Terra Nova Bay, about 360&amp;nbsp;km north of Scott Base, deployed satellite transmitters on Type-C killer whales in  to determine the whales' movements. Their results independently verified last month{{When|date=October 2016}} that type-C killer whales were commuting between Scott Base and the waters off Northland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/science/69744937/killer-whales-swim-nearly-5000km-from-antarctica-to-nz|title=Orca discovery excites scientists|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total catch of Antarctic toothfish in 2013–14 was 3820 tonnes. 3,320 tonnes of this was taken from the Ross Sea (FAO Statistical Divisions 88.1 and 88.2) with the remainder taken from other high seas areas within the CCAMLR convention area.&lt;ref&gt;Table 1, page 336 REPORT OF THE THIRTY-THIRD MEETING OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE HOBART, AUSTRALIA 20–24 OCTOBER 2014. https://www.ccamlr.org/en/system/files/e-sc-xxxiii_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
The ecosystem approach to fishing is encapsulated in Article II of the CAMLR Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/organisation/camlr-convention-text#II|title=CAMLR Convention text - CCAMLR|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecosystem approach utilizes decision rules based on both population status targets and on limit reference points and incorporates uncertainty and ecosystem status in the calculation of these targets. Different reference points to account for the needs of dependent predators in the ecosystem are used depending on the location of the species in the food web. The ecosystem fisheries management approach by CCAMLR involves use of move-on rules to protect trophic interactions,&lt;ref&gt;CONSERVATION MEASURE 41-09 (2014) Limits on the exploratory fishery for ''Dissostichus'' spp. in Statistical Subarea 88.1 in the 2014/15 season. http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-41-09-2014, CONSERVATION MEASURE 41-10 (2014) Limits on the exploratory fishery for ''Dissostichus'' spp. in Statistical Subarea 88.2 in the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons. http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-41-10-2014&lt;/ref&gt; and limit direct effects of fishing on fish bycatch, seabirds and Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). There are annually reviewed mitigation measures such as line weighting and streamer lines to minimize seabird bycatch which have resulted in a substantial reduction in accidental seabird mortalities in the CAMLR Convention Area.&lt;ref&gt;CONSERVATION MEASURE 24-02 (2014) Longline weighting for seabird conservation http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-24-02-2014&lt;/ref&gt; The 50% (target) and 20% (limit) reference points used by the CCAMLR decision rules exceed the requirements for target and limit reference points set by almost all national and international fisheries management organizations, even for species longer lived than toothfish. A wide study of many fisheries generally indicated that most reach maximum sustainable yield at 30–35% of their pre-exploitation abundances.&lt;ref&gt;HILBORN, R. 2010. Pretty good yield and exploited fishes. ''Marine Policy'', 34, 193–196&lt;/ref&gt; CCAMLR uses a more conservative reference level to allow exploitation at a level where toothfish recruitment and the ecosystem in general is not appreciably impacted.  This is required by  Article II of the CAMLR Convention. A common misunderstanding{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} of the CCAMLR decision rules is an assumption that the decline in population size will follow a clear trajectory from the starting year to a point 35 years later when the stock size will reach 50% of pre-exploitation levels and an assumption that there is no feedback during each assessment. The catch limit however is re-calculated based on all updated or revised data at each annual or biennial assessment. This approach is used to ensure that the 50% level will be approached slowly and enables an ongoing readjustment of catch levels as knowledge improves.&lt;ref name="CONSTABLE, A.J. 2000"/&gt;

=== Environment and bycatch ===
CCAMLR imposes stringent environmental protection and [[bycatch]] mitigation measures to Antarctic toothfish fisheries, including:
* Monitoring of daytime setting and movement of vessels from the fishery should any vessel catch more than three seabirds &lt;ref name="ccamlr.org"&gt;CCAMLR CM 25-02, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-25-02-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of streamer lines during setting to keep birds away from baited hooks &lt;ref name="ccamlr.org"/&gt;
* Weighting of lines to ensure fast sink rates to prevent seabirds from accessing baited hooks &lt;ref&gt;CCAMLR CM 24-02, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-24-02-2008, and CCAMLR CM 25-02, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-25-02-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of bird exclusion devices to prevent birds from accessing hooks whilst lines are being hauled &lt;ref name="ccamlr.org"/&gt;
* Limitations on the release of fish offal overboard at the same time as setting and hauling of lines to avoid attracting seabirds. An additional requirement prohibits the dumping of all offal south of 60°S, the region where Antarctic toothfish are caught &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;CCAMLR CM 26-01, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-26-01-2001{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prohibition on the dumping of oil, plastic, garbage, food waste, poultry, eggs or eggshells, sewage, and ash by fishing vessels &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Prohibition of the use of plastic packaging bands on fishing vessels &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Incidental mortality]] of seabirds as a result of fishing has fallen to near-zero levels in the CCAMLR convention area. No mortality of seabirds or marine mammals was recorded as a result of fishing for Antarctic toothfish in 2011–12 and only two seabirds (Southern Giant Petrels Macronectes giganteus) have been killed as a result of fishing in the Ross Sea since 1996/97.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/sc-camlr-xxxi|title=SC-CAMLR-XXXI - CCAMLR|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compliance ===
Compliance measures adopted by CCAMLR apply to all Antarctic toothfish fisheries. These include:
* At-sea inspections of [[fishing vessel]]s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/en/document/publications/inspectors-manual CCAMLR System of Inspection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930085618/http://www.ccamlr.org/en/document/publications/inspectors-manual |date=September 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vessel licensing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-02-2011|title=Conservation Measure 10-02 (2011) - CCAMLR|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Port inspections of fishing vessels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-03-2009|title=Conservation Measure 10-03 (2009) - CCAMLR|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Continuous reporting of fishing vessel positions via satellite linked [[Vessel Monitoring System]]s (VMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-04-2010|title=Conservation Measure 10-04 (2010) - CCAMLR|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Catch documentation scheme for toothfish which tracks toothfish from the point of landing through to the final point of sale and requires verification and authorisation by government authorities at each step&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-10-05-2009|title=Conservation Measure 10-05 (2009) - CCAMLR|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The requirement to carry two scientific observers on each licensed vessel – including one from a member state other than the vessel flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-41-09-2014|title=Conservation Measure 41-09 (2014) - CCAMLR|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-41-10-2014|title=Conservation Measure 41-10 (2014) - CCAMLR|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainability ===
In November 2010, the [[Marine Stewardship Council]] certified the Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish fishery as a sustainable and well-managed fishery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ross Sea Toothfish Fishery|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/southern-ocean/ross-sea-toothfish-longline|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification is contentious, with many conservation groups protesting the certification due to the paucity of information needed to reliably manage the fishery,&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=C. |last2=Ainley |first2=D. |last3=Bailey |first3=M. |last4=Dayton |first4=P. |last5=Hocevar |first5=J. |last6=LeVine |first6=M. |last7=Nikoloyuk |first7=J. |last8=Nouvian |first8=C. |last9=Velarde |first9=E. |last10=Werner |first10=R. |last11=Jacquet |first11=J. |year=2013 |title=Questionable stewardship: A review of formal objections to MSC fisheries certifications |journal=[[Biological Conservation (journal)|Biological Conservation]] |volume=161 |issue= |pages=10–17 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2013.01.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that only eight of the nineteen vessels in the fishery during the latest year for which data are publicly available were certified. During the 2013–14 season vessels operating under the Marine Stewardship Certification landed 51.3% of all Antarctic toothfish from the Ross Sea Region (CCAMLR Subarea 88.1) and 64.7% of Antarctic toothfish from the Amundsen Sea sector (CCAMLR Subarea 88.2).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/fisheries-in-the-program/certified/southern-ocean/ross-sea-toothfish-longline/assessment-downloads-1/20141216_SR4_TOO100.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that only a portion of Antarctic toothfish is certified, the high price it commands and the remote areas where a large proportion of the fish are caught have been advanced as an encouragement to [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing]] and [[Seafood mislabeling|mislabeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knecht |first=G. B. |year=2006 |title=Hooked: Pirates, Poaching and the Perfect Fish |location=Emmaus |publisher=Rodale |isbn=1-59486-110-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Knecht |first=G.

Due to the challenges that faced toothfish management in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g., IUU fishing, mislabelling, and inadequate data for management), consumer seafood guides such as [[Seafood Watch]] placed toothfish of both species (Chilean seabass) on their red, or “avoid”, list;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx?c=ln Seafood Watch (2012)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114161244/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx?c=ln |date=January 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in light of up-to-date, internationally peer-reviewed scientific information, in April 2013, Seafood Watch upgraded the Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish fishery to a "good alternative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chilean Seabass Seafood Watch Report |url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=11 |accessdate=19 April 2013 |date=April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412183508/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=11 |archivedate=12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a comprehensive review in 2012 the Monterey Bay Aquarium revised its rating of Antarctic toothfish to 'good alternative'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-recommendations/groups/toothfish?type=antarctic&amp;q=Toothfish,%20Antarctic|title=Toothfish Recommendations from the Seafood Watch Program|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/-/m/sfw/pdf/reports/mba_seafoodwatch_chileanseabassreport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080453/http://www.seafoodwatch.org/-/m/sfw/pdf/reports/mba_seafoodwatch_chileanseabassreport.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenpeace International]] added the Antarctic toothfish to its seafood red list in 2010. &lt;!--"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This assessment is contentious. [http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/ Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is at variance with the high score given the fishery when it was granted certification by the Marine Stewardship Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified/southern-ocean/ross-sea-toothfish-longline|title=Ross Sea toothfish longline — Marine Stewardship Council|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24261">'''Archival science''', or '''archival studies''', is the study and theory of building and [[Curator|curating]] [[archive]]s,&lt;ref name="SAA-archival-science"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archival-science|title=Archival Science|work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2012-12-07 |publisher=Society of American Archivists|last=Pearce-Moses|first=Richard|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are collections of documents, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]s and [[data storage device]]s.

To build and curate an archive, one must acquire and evaluate recorded materials, and be able to access them later. To this end, archival science seeks to improve methods for [[Archival appraisal|appraising]], storing, [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preserving]], and [[cataloging]] recorded materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An archival record preserves [[data]] that is not intended to change. In order to be of value to society, archives must be trustworthy. Therefore, an archivist has a responsibility to authenticate archival materials, such as [[historical document]]s, and to ensure their reliability, integrity, and usability. Archival records must be what they claim to be; accurately represent the activity they were created for; present a coherent picture through an array of content; and be in usable condition in an accessible location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ica.org/125/about-records-archives-and-the-profession/discover-archives-and-our-profession.html|title=About records, archives and the profession|accessdate=2011-11-03 |publisher=International Council on Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An archive curator is called an ''[[archivist]]''; the curation of an archive is called ''archive administration''.

==Background==

===History===
[[File: Archivistica2.pdf|thumb|right|The earliest archival manuals: Jacob von Rammingen, ''Von der Registratur'' (1571), Baldassare Bonifacio, ''De Archivis'' (1632).]]

Archival science emerged from [[diplomatics]], the critical analysis of [[document]]s.&lt;ref name="SAA-archival-science"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duranti |first=Luciana |author2=Heather MacNeil |date=January 1996 |title=The Protection of the Integrity of Electronic Records: An Overview of the UBC-MAS Research Project |journal=Archivaria |volume=1 |issue=42 |pages=46–67 |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12153/13158 | accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1540, Jacob von Rammingen (1510-1582) wrote the manuscript of the earliest known archival manual. He was an expert on ''registries'' (''Registraturen''), the German word for what later became known as ''archives''.&lt;ref name="Weidling"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weidling | first1 = T. | title = Den äldsta arkivläran: Jacob von Rammingens båda läroböcker i registratur- och arkivskötsel från 1571, samt en monografi om arkiv från 1632 av Baldassare Bonifacio |trans-title=The oldest archival science: Jacob von Rammingen's two manuals of registry and archival management from 1571, and a monography on archives from 1632 by Baldassare Bonifacio| language = Swedish| doi = 10.1080/03468755.2013.776405| journal = Scandinavian Journal of History | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 270–271 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammingen elaborated a registry for the [[Augsburg]] city council. However, since he could not attend the council meeting, he described the structure and management of the archives in writing. Although this is not the first work about archival science (Rammingen himself refers to earlier literature about record-keeping), earlier manuals were usually not published. Archival science had no formal beginning. Jacob von Rammingen's manual was printed in [[Heidelberg]] in 1571.&lt;ref name="Weidling"/&gt;

Traditionally, archival science has involved the study of methods for preserving items in climate-controlled storage facilities. It is also the study of [[cataloging|cataloguing]] and [[accession number (library science)|accession]], of retrieval and safe handling. The advent of [[Digital data|digital]] documents along with the development of electronic [[database]]s has caused the field to re-evaluate its means and ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archivists.org/catalog/stds99/foreword.html|title=Foreword|work=Standards for Archival Description: A Handbook|accessdate=2007-04-03 |publisher=Society of American Archivists| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405070948/http://www.archivists.org/catalog/stds99/foreword.html| archivedate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While generally associated with [[museum]]s and [[library|libraries]], the field also can pertain to individuals who maintain private collections or business archives. Archival Science is taught in colleges and universities, usually under the umbrella of [[Information Science]] or paired with a History program.

A list of foundational thinkers in archival studies could include: American archivist [[T. R. Schellenberg|Theodore Schellenberg]] and British archivist [[Hilary Jenkinson|Sir Hilary Jenkinson]]. Some important archival thinkers of the past century include: Canadian archivist and scholar [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]], South African archivist [[Verne Harris]], Australian archival scholar [[Sue McKemmish]], UCLA faculty and archival scholar Anne Gilliland, University of Michigan faculty and archival scholar [[Margaret Hedstrom]], American archival scholar and University of Pittsburgh faculty member Richard Cox, Italian archival scholar and faculty at University of British Columbia [[Luciana Duranti]], and American museum and archival scholar David Bearman.

===Standards===
There is no universal set of laws or standards that governs the form or mission of archival institutions.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;Adrian Cunningham, "Archival Institutions," in Archives: Recordkeeping in Society, ed. Sue McKemmish et al. (Wagga Wagga, New South Wales: Charles Sturt University, Centre for Information Studies, 2005), 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms, functions, and mandates of archival programs and institutions tend to differ based on geographical location and language, the nature of the society in which they exist and the objectives of those in control of the archives.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"/&gt; Instead, the current standards that have been provided and are most widely followed, such as the ICA standard, ISO standard, and [[DIRKS]] standard, act as working guidelines for archives to follow and adapt in ways that would best suit their respective needs.

Following the introduction of computer technology in archival repositories, beginning in the 1970s, archivists increasingly recognized the need to develop common standards for descriptive practice, in order to facilitate the dissemination of archival descriptive information.&lt;ref&gt;Roe, Kathleen D. (2005). ''Arranging &amp; Describing Archives &amp; Manuscripts''. Chicago: Society of American Archivists. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard developed by archivists in Canada, ''[[Rules for Archival Description]]'', also known as RAD, was first published in 1990. As a standard, RAD aims to provide archivists with a consistent and common foundation for the description of archival material within a ''[[fonds]]'', based on traditional archival principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/rules-for-archival-description|title=Rules for Archival Description|work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2016-01-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|last=Pearce-Moses|first=Richard|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable standard used in the United States is ''[[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]]'', also known as DACS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archivists.org/glossary/terms/d/describing-archives-a-content-standard|title=Describing Archives: A Content Standard|work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2016-01-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|last=Pearce-Moses|first=Richard|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards are in place to provide archivists with the tools for describing and making accessible archival material to the public.&lt;ref name="Cloonan"&gt;Michèle V. Cloonan, "Preserving Records of Enduring Value," in Currents of Archival Thinking, ed. Terry Eastwood and Heather MacNeil (Santa Barbara, California: Libraries Unlimited, 2010), 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metadata]] comprises contextual data pertaining to a record or aggregate of records. In order to compile metadata consistently, so as to enhance the discoverability of archival materials for users, as well as support the care and preservation of the materials by the archival institution, archivists look to standards appropriate to various kinds of metadata for different purposes, including administration, description, preservation, and digital storage and retrieval. For example, common standards used by archivists for structuring descriptive metadata, which conveys information such as the form, extent, and content of archival materials, include [[MARC format|Machine-Readable Cataloguing]] (MARC format), [[Encoded Archival Description]] (EAD), and [[Dublin core]].&lt;ref name="SAAmetadata"&gt;Pearce-Moses, Richard (2005). "[http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/m/metadata Metadata]." ''A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology''. Society of American Archivists. Retrieved 2016-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance in archival science==
[[Provenance]] in archival science refers to the "origin or source of something; information regarding the origins, custody, and ownership of an item or collection."&lt;ref name="SAA-provenance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archivists.org/glossary/terms/p/provenance|title=Provenance|work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2016-01-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|last=Pearce-Moses|first=Richard|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a fundamental principle of archives, provenance refers to the individual, family, or organization that created or received the items in a collection. In practice, provenance dictates that records of different origins should be kept separate to preserve their context.&lt;ref name="SAA-provenance"/&gt; As a methodology, provenance becomes a means of describing [[Document|records]] at the series level.

===The principle of provenance===
Describing records at the series level to ensure that records of different origins are kept separate, provided an alternative to item-level manuscript cataloguing.&lt;ref name="Swetland"&gt;Luke J. Gilliland-Swetland, “The Provenance of a Profession: The Permanence of the Public Archives and Historical Manuscripts Traditions in American Archival History,” ''American Archivist'' 54, no. 2 (1991): 160-174; here: p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of provenance has two major concepts: "''[[respect des fonds]]''," and "[[original order]]." "''Respect des fonds''" rose from the conviction that records entering an [[archive]] have an essential connection to the person or office that generated and used them; archivists consider all the records originating with a particular administrative unit (whether former, or still existing) to be a separate archival grouping, or "[[fonds]]", and seek to preserve and describe the records accordingly, with close attention to evidence of how they were organized and maintained at the time they were created.&lt;ref name="Posner"&gt;[[Ernst Posner]], "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015014985066;view=1up;seq=183 Some Aspects of Archival Development Since the French Revolution]," ''American Archivist'' 3, no. 3 (July 1940): 159-174.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167-168}} "Original order," refers to keeping records "as nearly as possible in the same order of classification as obtained in the offices of origin," gives additional credibility to preserved records and to their originating "[[fonds]]."&lt;ref name="Swetland" /&gt; Records must be kept in the same order they were placed in the course of the official activity of the agency concerned; records are not to be artificially reorganized. Records kept in their original order are more likely to reveal the nature of the organizations which created them, and more importantly, of the order of activities out of which they emerged.&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Douglas, Jennifer (2010). "Origins: Evolving Ideas about the Principle of Provenance," in ''Currents of Archival Thinking'', ed. Terry Eastwood and Heather MacNeil (Santa Barbara, California: Libraries Unlimited), p. 23-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not infrequently, practical considerations of storage mean that it is impossible to maintain the original order of records physically. In such cases, however, the original order should still be respected intellectually in the structure and arrangement of [[finding aid]]s.

===Practices before the emergence of provenance===
Following the [[French Revolution]], a newfound appreciation for historical records emerged in French society. Records began to "acquir[e] the dignity of national monuments",&lt;ref name="Posner1940-p166"&gt;Posner (1940), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and their care was entrusted to scholars who were trained in [[libraries]].&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; The emphasis was on historical research, and it seemed obvious at the time that records should be arranged and catalogued in a manner that would "facilitate every kind of scholarly use".&lt;ref name="Posner1940-p166"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; To support research, artificial systematic collections, often arranged by topic, were established and records were [[cataloguing|catalogued]] into these schemes.&lt;ref name="Posner" /&gt; With archival documents approached from a [[librarianship]] perspective, records were organized according to [[classification scheme]]s and their original context of creation were frequently lost or obscured.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt; This form of archival arrangement has come to be known as the "historical manuscripts tradition".

===Emergence of provenance===
The principle of "''[[respect des fonds]]''" and of "original order" was adopted in [[Belgium]] and [[France]] about 1840 and spread throughout [[Europe]] during the following decades.&lt;ref name="Posner" /&gt; Following the rise of state-run [[archives]] in France and [[Prussia]], the rising volume of modern records entering the archive made the adherence to the manuscript tradition impossible; there were not enough resources to organize and classify each record. Provenance received its most pointed expression in the "Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives," a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] text published in 1898 and written by three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin. This text provided the first description of the principle of [[provenance]] and argued that "original order" is an essential trait of archival arrangement and description.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;Terry Cook, "What is Past is Prologue: A History of Archival Ideas Since 1898, and the Future Paradigm Shift," ''Archivaria'' 43, no. 1997 (February 1, 1997): 17-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementing the work of the Dutch archivists and supporting the concept of provenance were the historians of the era. Though subject-based classification aided research, [[historian]]s began to concern themselves with objectivity in their source material. For its advocates, provenance provided an objective alternative to the generally subjective classification schemes borrowed from [[librarianship]]. Historians increasingly felt that records should be maintained in their original order to better reflect the activity out of which they emerged.

===Debates===
Although original order is a generally accepted principle, there has been some debate surrounding this theory in regards to [[personal archiving|personal archives]].&lt;ref name="Posner"/&gt; It has been argued that original order is not always ideal for personal archives as they are far more complex than organizational archives.&lt;ref name="Douglas"/&gt; However, others prefer to remain loyal to the principle of original order and maintain that personal records are created and maintained for much the same reason as organizational archives and should therefore follow the same principles.&lt;ref name="Douglas"/&gt;

==Preservation in archival science==
[[File:NASA history archives.jpg|alt=Image of archival boxes.|thumb|Archival boxes at the NASA archives.]]
[[Preservation (library and archival science)|Preservation]], as defined by the Society of American Archivists (SAA), is the act of protecting materials from physical deterioration or loss of information, ideally in a noninvasive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archivists.org/glossary/terms/p/preservation|title=Preservation|work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2016-01-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|last=Pearce-Moses|first=Richard|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of preservation is to maintain as much originality as possible while maintaining all the information which the material has to offer. Both scientific principles and professional practices are applied to this technique to obtain maximum  effectiveness. In an archival sense, preservation refers to the care of all the [[aggregate supply|aggregates]] within a collection. [[Conservation movement|Conservation]] can be included in this practice and often these two definitions overlap.&lt;ref name="Cloonan"/&gt;

===The beginnings of preservation===
Preservation emerged with the establishment of the first central archives. In 1789, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[Archives nationales (France)|Archives Nationales]] was established and later, in 1794, transformed into a central archives.&lt;ref name="Posner"/&gt; This was the first independent national archives and their goal was to preserve and store documents and records as they were. This trend gained popularity and soon other countries began establishing national archives for the same reasons, to maintain and preserve their records as they were created and received.&lt;ref name="Cloonan"/&gt;

Cultural and scientific change also helped to bring about the idea and practice of preservation. In the late eighteenth century, many museums, national libraries, and national archives were established in Europe; therefore ensuring the preservation of their [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref name="Cloonan"/&gt;

===Archival preservation===
Preservation, like provenance, is concerned with the proper representation of archival materials. Archivists are primarily concerned with maintaining the record, along with the context in which it was produced, and making this information accessible to the user.&lt;ref name="Cloonan"/&gt;

''Tout ensemble'' is a definition relating to preservation. This definition encompasses the idea of context and the importance of maintaining context. When a record is removed from its fellow records, it loses its meaning. In order to preserve a record it must be preserved in its original entirety or else it may lose its significance. This definition relates to the principle of provenance and ''respect des fonds'' as it similarly emphasizes the idea of the original record.&lt;ref name="Cloonan"/&gt;

Metadata is key for the preservation of context within archival science. Metadata, as defined by the SAA, is “data about data.”&lt;ref name="SAAmetadata"/&gt; This data can help archivists locate a specific record, or a variety of records within a certain category.  By assigning appropriate metadata to records or record aggregates, the archivist successfully preserves the entirety of the record and the context in which it was created. This allows for better accessibility and improves the authenticity of the record.&lt;ref name="Cumming"&gt;Kate Cumming, "Metadata Matters," in Managing Electronic Records, ed. Julie McLeod and Catherine Hare (London: Facet Publishing, 2005) 34-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical maintenance is another key feature of preservation. There are many strategies in place to preserve archives properly; such as rehousing items in acid-free containers, storing items in climate controlled areas, and copying deteriorating items. These preservation techniques are to be carried out with respect to provenance.&lt;ref name="Cloonan"/&gt;

===Digital preservation===
{{Main|Digital preservation}}

Digital preservation involves the implementation of policies, strategies, and actions in order to ensure that digitized documents remain accurate and accessible over time. Due to emerging technologies, archives began to expand and require new forms of preservation. Archival collections spread to include new media such as [[microfilm]], [[content (media and publishing)|audiofiles]], [[visual]]files, [[moving images]], and digital documents. Many of these new types of media suffer from a shorter life expectancy than paper.&lt;ref name="Cloonan"/&gt; With the quick advancement of our technological society, old media is becoming obsolete. Therefore, migration from old formats to new formats is necessary for the preservation of these digital medias so they can remain accurate and accessible.&lt;ref name="Cumming"/&gt;

Metadata is an important part of digital preservation as it preserves the context, usage, and migration of a digital record. Similarly to traditional preservation, metadata is required to preserve the context, authenticity, and accessibility of a record.&lt;ref name="Cumming"/&gt;

==Professional associations==
Professional archivist associations seek to foster study and professional development:

==Regional Professional Associations==
Smaller professional regional associations also provide more local professional development, such as:

}}

In 2002, the Society of American Archivists published guidelines for a [[graduate program]] in archival studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp#_ftn1|title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies |accessdate=2007-04-03 |publisher=Society of American Archivists| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406075051/http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of 2007 these guidelines have not been adopted by many universities. Practitioners of archival science might come from such academic backgrounds as [[library science]], [[information science]], [[history]], or [[museology]].

The '''Hungarian Recording Industry Association''' (Hungarian: '''''Magyar Hanglemezkiadók Szövetsége''''', more commonly abbreviated to '''MAHASZ''' or '''Mahasz''') is the Hungarian [[music industry]] association, founded in 1992. MAHASZ issues the [[Hungarian Music Awards]] and maintains the [[music chart]]s for [[Hungary]].

==Certification levels==
Certifications have existed in Hungary since the mid-1970s. During that period, albums had to sell 50,000 units to qualify for Gold status.&lt;ref name="Gold awards 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Billboard Vol. 86, No. 52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=%22hungary%22+%22no+Silver+disk+for+singles%22 |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=40|date=1974-12-26|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singles were required to sell 100,000 units to reach Gold level in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="Gold awards 1974"/&gt;

Note: There have been changes to the thresholds for international repertoire in the past. For example, an official [[RIAJ]] report from 2005 specifies levels of 10,000 for Gold and 20,000 for Platinum.&lt;ref name="IFPI report 2005"/&gt; The changes in levels for ''International Repertoire'' have most likely taken place on the same dates as for ''Domestic Repertoire''.

The '''Assumption of Mary''' into Heaven (often shortened to '''the Assumption''') is, according to the beliefs of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]],&lt;ref name="England1907"&gt;{{cite book |author= Church of England |title= The Annotated Book of Common Prayer: An Historical, Ritual, and Theological Commentary on the Devotional System of the Church of England |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=01T-IGOmTlEC&amp;pg=PA159 |accessdate= 15 August 2015 |year=1907 |publisher= Longmans, Green and Company |page= 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Entering Heaven alive|bodily taking up]] of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] into [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] at the end of her earthly life.

Flinn, J. Gordon Melton 207 {{ISBN|0-8160-5455-X}} p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; While the Catholic Church and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] believe in the [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition of the Theotokos]] ("the Falling Asleep of the Mother of God"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html Munificentissimus Deus, 17] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |date=4 September 2013 }} In the liturgical books which deal with the feast either of the dormition or of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin there are expressions that agree in testifying that, when the Virgin Mother of God passed from this earthly exile to heaven, what happened to her sacred body was, by the decree of divine Providence, in keeping with the dignity of the Mother of the Word Incarnate, and with the other privileges she had been accorded.&lt;/ref&gt; whether Mary had a physical death has not been dogmatically defined. In ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' (item 39) Pope Pius XII pointed to the [[Book of Genesis]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#3:15|3:15]]) as scriptural support for the dogma in terms of Mary's victory over sin and death through her intimate association with "the new Adam" (Christ)&lt;ref&gt;http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus.html&lt;/ref&gt; as also reflected in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:54|1 Corinthians 15:54]]: "then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory".&lt;ref name=IntroM75&gt;''Introduction to Mary'' by Mark Miravalle (1993) Queenship Pub.

The [[New Testament]] contains no explicit narrative about the death or Dormition, nor of the Assumption of Mary, but several scriptural passages have been theologically interpreted to describe the ultimate fate in this and the afterworld of the Mother of Jesus (see [[Assumption of Mary#Scriptural basis|below]]).&lt;ref name="ARCIC"/&gt;

In the churches that observe it, the Assumption is a major [[feast day]], commonly celebrated on 15 August. In many countries, the feast is also marked as a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] in the Roman Catholic Church.

==History of the belief==
The Assumption (Latin: ''assumptio'', "a taking") was defined as [[dogma]] by the Catholic Church in 1950, when [[Pope Pius XII]] defined it ''[[ex cathedra]]'' in his Apostolic Constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''.&lt;ref name="Resch2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dustin Resch|title=Barth's Interpretation of the Virgin Birth: A Sign of Mystery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSPtCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171|date=8 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-17611-4|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] itself interprets [[Revelation 12|chapter 12]] of the [[Book of Revelation]] as referring to it.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution, ''Munificentissimus Deus'', para 27, Vaticsn (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known narrative is the so-called ''Liber Requiei Mariae'' (''The Book of Mary's Repose''), which survives intact only in an [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] translation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J.

The story also appears in ''De Transitu Virginis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~sshoemak/texts/dormitionL/dormitionL1.htm |title=De Transitu Virginis |publisher=Uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413212601/http://www.uoregon.edu/~sshoemak/texts/dormitionL/dormitionL1.htm |archivedate=13 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a late 5th-century work ascribed to [[Melito of Sardis|St. Melito of Sardis]] that presents a theologically redacted summary of the traditions in the ''Liber Requiei Mariae''. The ''Transitus Mariae'' tells the story of the apostles being transported by white clouds to the deathbed of Mary, each from the town where he was preaching at the hour.
The ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' in the 490s declared some ''transitus Mariae'' literature apocryphal.

An Armenian letter attributed to [[Dionysus the Areopagite]] also mentioned the supposed event, although this was written sometime after the 6th century. [[John of Damascus]], from this period, is the first church authority to advocate the doctrine under his own name. His contemporaries, [[Gregory of Tours]] and [[Modestus of Jerusalem]], helped promote the concept to the wider church.

In some versions of the story, the event is said to have taken place in [[Ephesus]], in the [[House of the Virgin Mary]]. This is a much more recent and localized tradition. The earliest traditions say that Mary's life ended in [[Jerusalem]] (see "[[Tomb of the Virgin Mary|Mary's Tomb]]"). By the 7th century, a variation emerged, according to which one of the apostles, often identified as [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas]], was not present at the death of Mary but his late arrival precipitates a reopening of Mary's tomb, which is found to be empty except for her grave clothes. In a later tradition, Mary drops [[Girdle of Thomas|her girdle]] down to the apostle from heaven as testament to the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf08.vii.xliii.html#vii.xliii-Page_594 Ante-Nicene Fathers – ''The Writings of the Fathers Down to A.D. 325''], vol. 8 page 594&lt;/ref&gt; This incident is depicted in many later paintings of the Assumption.

Teaching of the Assumption of Mary became widespread across the Christian world, having been celebrated as early as the 5th century and having been established in the East by Emperor Maurice around AD 600.&lt;ref name=Alban140 &gt;''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' by Alban Butler, Paul Burns 1998 {{ISBN|0860122573}} pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; St. John Damascene records the following: 

{{quote|St. Juvenal, Bishop of Jerusalem, at the Council of Chalcedon (451), made known to the Emperor Marcian and Pulcheria, who wished to possess the body of the Mother of God, that Mary died in the presence of all the Apostles, but that her tomb, when opened upon the request of St. Thomas, was found empty; wherefrom the Apostles concluded that the body was taken up to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/maryc3c.htm] ''More on the Assumption of Mary'' by Fr. William Saunders, EWTN&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Assumption of Mary was celebrated in the West under [[Pope Sergius I]] in the 8th century and [[Pope Leo IV]] confirmed the feast as official.&lt;ref name=Alban140 /&gt; Theological debate about the Assumption continued, following the Reformation. But the people celebrated the Assumption as part of the cult of Mary that flourished from the Middle Ages. In 1950 Pope [[Pius XII]] defined it as dogma for the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="Vatican-deus_en"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |title=Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus, no 44 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |archivedate=4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic theologian [[Ludwig Ott]] stated, "The idea of the bodily assumption of Mary is first expressed in certain transitus-narratives of the fifth and sixth centuries.&amp;nbsp;... The first Church author to speak of the bodily assumption of Mary, in association with an apocryphal transitus B.M.V., is St. Gregory of Tours."&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Ott, Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma (Rockford: Tan, 1974), pp. 209–210&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] writer [[Eamon Duffy]] states that "there is, clearly, no historical evidence whatever for it."&lt;ref&gt;Eamon Duffy, ''What Catholics Believe About Mary'' (London: Catholic Truth Society, 1989), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Catholic Church has never asserted nor denied that its teaching is based on the apocryphal accounts. The Church documents are silent on this matter and instead rely upon other sources and arguments as the basis for the doctrine.

Psychologist [[Carl Jung]], who was deeply interested in archetypes and comparative religion, celebrated that the Catholic Church had officially elevated the Virgin Mary (whom he noted as symbolizing the feminine principle) to standing with three masculine figures in the panoply of the church.

===Dogmatic definition===
On 1 November 1950, in the Apostolic Constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' Pope [[Pius XII]] declared the Assumption of Mary as a dogma:

{{quote|By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html item 44 at the Vatican web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |date=4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pope Pius XII deliberately left open the question of whether Mary died before her Assumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm According to Catholic dogma, because the Virgin Mary remained an ever-virgin and sinless, the church believed that the Virgin Mary could not suffer the consequences of Original Sin, which is death. Nicea II Session 6 Decree]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/NICAEA2.HTM#2 |title=Nicaea II Definition, "without blemish"  |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the dogmatic definition, in ''[[Deiparae Virginis Mariae]]'' Pope Pius XII sought the opinion of Catholic Bishops. A large number of them pointed to the [[Book of Genesis]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#3:15|3:15]]) as scriptural support for the dogma.&lt;ref name=IntroM75/&gt; In ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' (item 39) Pius XII referred to the "struggle against the infernal foe" as in Genesis 3:15 and to "complete victory over the sin and death" as in the [[Letters of Paul]] as a scriptural basis for the dogmatic definition, Mary being assumed to heaven as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:54|1 Corinthians 15:54]]: "then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory".&lt;ref name="IntroM75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mariology pages 328-350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="item 39at the Vatican web site"/&gt;

===Theological issues===
[[File:Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, San Luis Potosi city, San Luis Potosi state, Mexico14.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of Assumption, [[San Luis Potosi]], Mexico.]]
In Pius XII's dogmatic statement, the phrase "having completed the course of her earthly life", leaves open the question of whether the Virgin Mary died before her assumption or not. Mary's assumption is said to have been a divine gift to her as the 'Mother of God'. Ludwig Ott's view is that, as Mary completed her life as a shining example to the human race, the perspective of the gift of assumption is offered to the whole human race.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Ott's ''Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma'', pp. 250 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludwig Ott writes in his book, ''Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma'', that "the fact of her death is almost generally accepted by the Fathers and Theologians, and is expressly affirmed in the Liturgy of the Church", to which he adds a number of helpful citations. He concludes: "for Mary, death, in consequence of her freedom from [[original sin]] and from personal sin, was not a consequence of punishment of sin. However, it seems fitting that Mary's body, which was by nature mortal, should be, in conformity with that of her [[Jesus|Divine Son]], subject to the general law of death".&lt;ref name=Ott6&gt;''Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma,'' Ludwig Ott, Book III, Pt. 3, Ch. 2, §6, {{ISBN|0-89555-009-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The point of her bodily death has not been infallibly defined by any pope. Many Catholics believe that she did not die at all, but was assumed directly into Heaven. The dogmatic definition within the Apostolic Constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'' which, according to Roman Catholic dogma, infallibly proclaims the doctrine of the Assumption leaves open the question of whether, in connection with her departure, Mary underwent bodily death. It does not dogmatically define the point one way or the other, as shown by the words "having completed the course of her earthly life".&lt;ref name = "Vatican-deus_en" /&gt;

===Scriptural basis===
{{see also|Mary, mother of Jesus#After the Ascension of Jesus}}
In ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'', near the end of the review of the doctrine's history, Pope [[Pius XII]] stated : "All these proofs and considerations of the holy Fathers and the theologians are based upon the Sacred Writings as their ultimate foundation." Precedent to this, he cited many passages that have been offered in support of this teaching.

The pope cited {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians 15}}. In this passage Paul alludes to {{Bibleref2|Genesis 3:15}} (in addition to the primary reference of {{Bibleref2|Psalm 8:6}}), where it is prophesied that the [[seed of the woman]] will crush Satan with his feet: "I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel." Since, then, Jesus arose to Heaven to fulfill this prophecy, it follows that the woman would have a similar end, since she shared this enmity with Satan.

The pope also mentioned (in paragraph 26) {{Bibleref2|Psalm 132}}, a psalm commemorating the return of the Ark of God to Jerusalem and lamenting its subsequent loss. The second half of the psalm says that the loss will be recompensed in the New Covenant, and so it is hopefully prayed, "Arise, O Lord, into thy resting place: thou and the ark, which thou hast sanctified" (v. 8). Since the Church sees this New Covenant ark in Mary, it understands that she was taken into Heaven in the same manner as the Lord – that is, body and soul.

Finally, he mentioned in the next paragraph "that woman clothed with the sun [{{Bibleref2|Revelation 12:1–2}}] whom John the Apostle contemplated on the Island of Patmos" was support for the creating this dogmatic doctrine for Catholics.

==Assumption vs. Dormition==
[[File:Dormition de la Vierge.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Dormition: ivory plaque, late 10th-early 11th century ([[Musée de Cluny]]).]]

The [[Latin Catholic]] Feast of the Assumption is celebrated on 15 August, and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholics]] celebrate the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] (the falling asleep of the Mother of God) on the same date, preceded by a 14-day [[fasting|fast]] period. Eastern Christians believe that Mary died a natural death, that her soul was received by Christ upon death, and that her body was resurrected on the third day after her death and that she was taken up into heaven bodily in anticipation of the general [[resurrection]]. Her tomb was found empty on the third day. 

{{quote|Orthodox tradition is clear and unwavering in regard to the central point [of the Dormition]: the Holy Virgin underwent, as did her Son, a physical death, but her body – like His – was afterwards raised from the dead and she was taken up into heaven, in her body as well as in her soul. She has passed beyond death and judgement, and lives wholly in the Age to Come. The Resurrection of the Body ... has in her case been anticipated and is already an accomplished fact. That does not mean, however, that she is dissociated from the rest of humanity and placed in a wholly different category: for we all hope to share one day in that same glory of the Resurrection of the Body which she enjoys even now.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Kallistos (Ware) of Diokleia, in: Festal Menaion [London: Faber and Faber, 1969], p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many Catholics also believe that Mary first died before being assumed, but they believe that she was miraculously resurrected before being assumed. Others believe she was assumed bodily into Heaven without first dying.&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholicism Answer Book: The 300 Most Frequently Asked Questions'' by John Trigilio, Kenneth Brighenti 2007 {{ISBN|1-4022-0806-5}} p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Traditions of the Virgin Mary's Dormition and Assumption'' by Stephen J. Shoemaker 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-921074-8}} p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Either understanding may be legitimately held by Catholics, with [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] observing the Feast as the Dormition. 

Many theologians note by way of comparison that in the Catholic Church, the Assumption is dogmatically defined, while in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, the Dormition is less dogmatically than liturgically and mystically defined. Such differences spring from a larger pattern in the two traditions, wherein Catholic teachings are often dogmatically and authoritatively defined – in part because of the more centralized structure of the Catholic Church – while in Eastern Orthodoxy, many doctrines are less authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/johndamascus-komesis.html Three Sermons on the Dormition of the Virgin]" by [[John of Damascus]], from the Medieval Sourcebook&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant views==
Views differ within Protestantism, with those with a theology closer to Catholicism sometimes believing in a bodily assumption, while most Protestants do not.  

===Anglican views===
Within [[Anglican doctrine]], the Assumption of Mary is either rejected, or regarded as [[adiaphora]] ("a thing indifferent");&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2007). pp. 238, 251, quote: "Where Anglican writers discuss the doctrine of the Assumption, it is either rejected or held to be of the ''adiaphora''."&lt;/ref&gt; it therefore disappeared from Anglican worship in 1549, partially returning in some branches of Anglicanism during the 20th century under different names. A Marian feast on 15 August is celebrated by the [[Church of England]] as a non-specific [[Festival (Anglicanism)|feast]] of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a feast called by the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] simply "Mary the Virgin",&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2007). p. 253, incl. note 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Church of England, official website: [https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/calendar  The Calendar].

while other Anglican provinces have a feast of the Dormition&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2007). p. 253, incl. note 54.&lt;/ref&gt; – the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] for instance marks the day as the "Falling Asleep of the Blessed Virgin Mary",&lt;ref name="PrayerBook"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://prayerbook.ca/the-prayer-book-online/57-the-calendar-ix |title= The Calendar |page= ix |publisher=Prayerbook.ca |date= |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104172841/http://prayerbook.ca/the-prayer-book-online/57-the-calendar-ix |archivedate=4 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission]], which seeks to identify common ground between the two communions, released in 2004 an non-authoritative declaration meant for study and evaluation, the "Seattle Statement"; this "agreed statement" concludes that "the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the [[Immaculate Conception]], understood within the biblical pattern of the economy of hope and grace, can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions".&lt;ref name="ARCIC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/angl-comm-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_20050516_mary-grace-hope-christ_en.html |title= Mary: Grace and Hope in Christ |publisher= Vatican.va |date= 26 June 2000 |quote= There is no direct testimony in Scripture concerning the end of Mary’s life.

===Other Protestant views===
[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|Possibly the most famous treatment in Western art, [[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Titian's ''Assumption'']](1516–1518).]]
The Protestant Reformer [[Heinrich Bullinger]] believed in the assumption of Mary. His 1539 polemical treatise against idolatry&lt;ref&gt;''De origine erroris libri duo'' (On the Origin of Error, Two Books) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EXLscQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22De+origine+erroris+libri+duo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RjnCTba2KIudgQfjw7jnAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgy]. "In the ''De origine erroris in divorum ac simulachrorum cultu'' he opposed the worship of the saints and iconolatry; in the ''De origine erroris in negocio Eucharistiae ac Missae'' he strove to show that the Catholic conceptions of the Eucharist and of celebrating the Mass were wrong. Bullinger published a combined edition of these works in [[Octavo|4 °]] (Zurich 1539), which was divided into two books, according to themes of the original work."

&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his belief that Mary's ''sacrosanctum corpus'' ("sacrosanct body") had been assumed into heaven by angels:

For this reason, we believe that the Virgin Mary, Begetter of God, the most pure bed and temple of the Holy Spirit, that is, her most holy body, was carried to heaven by angels.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousand Faces of the Virgin Mary'' (1996), [[George Tavard|George H.

Most modern Protestants neither teach nor believe in the Assumption of Mary, as they see no [[Sola Scriptura|biblical basis]] or extra-biblical basis for it. Although many churches within [[Lutheranism]] do not teach the Assumption of Mary, 15 August remains a Lesser Feast in celebration of "Mary, Mother of Our Lord", according to the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liturgybytlw.com/LessFest/MaryMoth.html |title=Mary, Mother of Our Lord |publisher=Liturgybytlw.com |date= |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wmltblog.org/2011/08/st-mary-mother-of-our-lord/ |title=St. Mary, Mother of Our Lord |publisher=Wmltblog.org |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasts==
[[File:Assunzione agosto NovaradiSicilia tre.jpg|thumb|The feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary at [[Novara di Sicilia]] in August]]

The Assumption is important to many Catholic and Orthodox Christians as the Virgin Mary's heavenly birthday (the day that Mary was received into Heaven). Belief about her acceptance into the glory of Heaven is seen by some Christians as the symbol of the promise made by Jesus to all enduring Christians that they too will be received into paradise. The Assumption of Mary is symbolised in the [[Fleur-de-lys]] Madonna.

The present Italian name of the holiday, ''"Ferragosto"'', may derive from the Latin name, ''Feriae Augusti'' ("Holidays of the [[Emperor Augustus]]"),&lt;ref name="Pianigiani"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pianigiani, Ottorino|title=Vocabolario etimologico della lingua italiana|year=1907|url=http://www.etimo.it/?term=ferragosto}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the month of August took its name from the emperor. The Solemnity of the Assumption on 15 August was celebrated in the eastern Church from the 6th Century. The [[Catholic Church]] adopted this date as a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] to commemorate the Assumption of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], a reference to the belief in a real, physical elevation of her sinless soul and incorrupt body into Heaven.

===Public holidays===
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--only first paragraph has a citation--&gt;
Assumption Day on 15 August is a nationwide public holiday in Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chile, Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, East Timor, France, Gabon, Greece, Georgia, Republic of Guinea, Haiti, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Republic of Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Mauritius, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro (Albanian Catholics), Paraguay, Poland (Polish Army Day), Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tahiti, Togo, and Vanuatu;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Columbus World Travel Guide'', 25th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; and was also in [[Hungary]] until [[1948]].

It is also a public holiday in parts of Germany (parts of [[Bavaria]] and [[Saarland]]) and Switzerland (in 14 of the 26 [[Swiss canton|cantons]]). In Guatemala, it is observed in [[Guatemala City]] and in the town of [[Santa Maria Nebaj]], both of which claim her as their [[patron saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemisphericinstitute.org/journal/4.2/eng/en51_pg_reiland.html Reiland, Catherine. "To Heaven Through the Streets of Guatemala City: the Processions of the Virgin of the Assumption", ''Emisferica'']&lt;/ref&gt; Also, this day is combined with [[Mother's Day]] in Costa Rica and parts of Belgium.

Prominent Catholic and Orthodox countries in which Assumption Day is an important festival but is not recognized by the state as a public holiday include [[Brazil]], Bulgaria, [[Czech Republic]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Russia]].

In many places, religious parades and popular festivals are held to celebrate this day. In Canada, Assumption Day is the Fête Nationale of the [[Acadian]]s, of whom she is the patron saint. Some businesses close on that day in heavily francophone parts of [[New Brunswick]], Canada. The Virgin Assumed in Heaven is also patroness of the [[Maltese Islands]] and her feast, celebrated on 15 August, apart from being a public holiday in Malta is also celebrated with great solemnity in the local churches especially in the seven localities known as the Seba' Santa Marijiet. The hamlet of [[Praha, Texas]] holds a festival during which its population swells from approximately 25 to 5000 people.

In [[Anglicanism]] and [[Lutheranism]], the feast is kept, but without official use of the word "Assumption". In the [[Armenians|Armenian]] tradition, a cultural custom of blessing of the [[grapes]] is annually observed each 12 August in religious commemoration of the Feast of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In Eastern Orthodox churches following the [[Julian Calendar]], the feast day of Assumption of Mary falls on 28 August.

A '''book series''' is a sequence of [[book]]s having certain characteristics in common that are formally identified together as a group. Book series can be organized in different ways, such as written by the same [[author]], or marketed as a group by their [[publisher]].

==Publishers' series==
Reprint series of public domain fiction (and sometimes nonfiction) books appeared as early as the 18th century, with the series [[Poets of Great Britain Complete from Chaucer to Churchill]] (founded by British publisher [[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]] in 1777).&lt;ref&gt;John Feather, ''A History of British Publishing'', London: Croom Helm, 1988, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Later British reprint series were to include the Routledge's Railway Library ([[George Routledge]], 1848–99), the [[Oxford World's Classics]] ([[Oxford University Press]], 1901- ), the [[Everyman's Library]] ([[J. M. Dent]], 1906- ), the [[Penguin Classics]] ([[Penguin Books]], 1945- ) and the [[Penguin English Library]] (1963- ).

Reprint series were also published in the United States, including the [[Modern Library]] ([[Boni &amp; Liveright]], 1917- ), in Germany, including the Universal-Bibliothek ([[Reclam]], 1867- ), and in most other countries of the world.

The early 19th century saw numerous improvements in the printing, publishing and book-distribution processes, with the introduction of steam-powered printing presses, pulp mills, automatic type setting, and a network of railways.[3] These innovations enabled the likes of Simms and McIntyre of Belfast,[4] Routledge &amp; Sons (founded in 1836) and Ward &amp; Lock (founded in 1854) to mass-produce cheap uniform yellowback or paperback editions of existing works, and distribute and sell them across the British Isles, principally via the ubiquitous W H Smith &amp; Sons newsagent found at most urban British railway stations. These paper bound volumes were offered for sale at a fraction of the historic cost of a book, and were of a smaller format (110x175mm) aimed at the railway traveller.[5] The Routledge's Railway Library series of paperbacks remained in print until 1898, and offered the traveling public 1,277 unique titles.[6]

In 1841 the German [[Tauchnitz publishers|Tauchnitz]] publishing firm launched the ''[[Collection of British and American Authors]]'', a reprint series of inexpensive paperbound editions of both public domain and copyrighted fiction and nonfiction works.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Suarez and H. R. Woudhuysen, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to the Book''. Oxford University Press, 2010. Vol. 2. p. 1194.&lt;/ref&gt; This book series was unique for paying living authors of the works published even though copyright protection did not exist between nations in the 19th century.

==Fiction books==
{{main|Novel sequence}}
Fictional series typically share a common [[Setting (fiction)|setting]], [[story arc]], set of [[fictional character|character]]s or [[Chronology|timeline]]. They are common in [[genre fiction]], particularly [[crime fiction]], [[adventure fiction]], and [[science fiction]], as well as in [[children's literature]].

Some works in a series can stand alone—they can be read in any order, as each book makes few, if any, reference to past events, and the characters seldom, if ever, change. Many of these series books may be published in a numbered series. Examples of such series are works like [[The Hardy Boys]], [[Nancy Drew]], and [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]].

Some series do have their characters go through changes, and make references to past events. Typically such series are published in the order of their internal chronology, so that the next book published follows the previous book. How much these changes matter will vary from series to series (and reader to reader). For some, it may be minor—characters might get engaged, change jobs, etc., but it does not affect the main storyline. Examples of this type include [[Tony Hillerman]]'s [[Jim Chee]] and [[Joe Leaphorn]] books. In other series, the changes are major and the books must be read in order to be fully enjoyed. Examples of this type include the [[Harry Potter]] series.

There are some book series that are not really proper series, but more of a single work so large that it must be published over two or more books. Examples of this type include ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' volumes or the ''[[Dark Tower series|Dark Tower]]'' series by Stephen King.

Some authors make it difficult to list their books in a numerical order when they do not release each work in its 'proper' order by the story's internal chronology. They might 'jump' back in time to early adventures of the characters, writing works that must be placed before or between previously published works. Thus, the books in a series are sometimes enumerated according to the internal chronology rather than in publication order, depending on the intended purpose for the list. Examples of this series include works from the [[Chronicles of Narnia]], where the fifth book published, ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', is actually set during the time of the first book, and the sixth book published, ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' is actually set long before the first book. This was done intentionally by [[C. S. Lewis]], a medieval literature scholar. Medieval literature did not always tell a story chronologically.

==Academic and scholarly publications==
{{main|Monographic series}}
In scholarly and [[academic publishing]], scientific and non-fiction books that are released [[Serial (literature)|serial]]ly (in successive parts) once a year, or less often, are also called a '''series'''. (Publications that are released more often than once a year are known as [[periodical]]s.) The connection among books belonging to such a series can be by discipline, focus, approach, type of work, or geographic location. Examples of such series include the "Antwerp Working Papers in Linguistics", "Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile", "Garland Reference Library", "Canterbury Tales Project", "[[Early English Text Society]]", and "[[List of Cambridge Companions to Music|Cambridge Companions to Music]]".

'''''Books of Blood''''' are a series of [[horror fiction]] collections written by the British author [[Clive Barker]].

There are six books in total, each simply subtitled ''Volume 1'' through to ''Volume 6'', and were subsequently re-published in two omnibus editions containing three volumes each. Each volume contains four or five stories. The volume 1–3 omnibus was published with a foreword by Barker's fellow Liverpudlian horror writer [[Ramsey Campbell]].

They were published between 1984 and 1985. With the publication of the first volume, Barker became an overnight sensation and was hailed by [[Stephen King]] as "the future of horror". The book won both the [[British Fantasy Award|British]] and [[World Fantasy Award]]s.

Although undoubtedly horror stories, like most of Barker's work they mix fantasy themes in as well. The unrelentingly bleak tales invariably take place in a contemporary setting, usually featuring [[Everyman|everyday people]] who become embroiled in terrifying or mysterious events. Barker has stated in ''[[Faces of Fear (interview book)|Faces of Fear]]'' that an inspiration for the ''Books of Blood'' was when he read ''[[Dark Forces (book)|Dark Forces]]'' in the early 1980s and realised that a horror story collection need not have any narrow themes, consistent tone or restrictions. The stories could range from the humorous to the truly horrific.

For some editions, each book's cover was illustrated by Clive Barker himself.

Eighteen of the stories in the ''Books of Blood'' were adapted by Eclipse Books in the comic series ''[[Tapping the Vein (comic)|Tapping the Vein]]'' as well as other titled adaptations.

Several of the stories have been adapted into films, "[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]" (1986); "[[Books of Blood#The Forbidden|The Forbidden]]" (filmed in 1992 as ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rose|first=Bernard|title=INTERVIEW / The sweet smell of excess: Bernard Rose has an oral fixation: Kevin Jackson talked to him about the appetites behind his new horror film, Candyman|date=13 March 1993|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/interview--the-sweet-smell-of-excess-bernard-rose-has-an-oral-fixation-kevin-jackson-talked-to-him-about-the-appetites-behind-his-new-horror-film-candyman-1497390.html|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovell|first=Glenn|title=Black Slasher `Candyman` Draws Fire Over `racist` Depictions|date=29 October 1992|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-10-29/features/9204080203_1_candyman-white-women-tony-todd|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Books of Blood#The Last Illusion|The Last Illusion]]" (filmed in 1995 as ''[[Lord of Illusions]]''); "[[Books of Blood#The Body Politic|The Body Politic]]" (filmed in 1997 as ''[[Quicksilver Highway]]''); "[[The Midnight Meat Train]]" (2008); "[[Books of Blood#The Book of Blood|The Book of Blood]]" and "[[Books of Blood#On Jerusalem Street (a postscript)|On Jerusalem Street (a postscript)]]" (combined and filmed in 2008 as ''[[Book of Blood (2008 film)|Book of Blood]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivebarker.info/newfilmse.html#bob |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203105858/http://www.clivebarker.info/newfilmse.html#bob |archivedate=3 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Dread (film)|Dread]]" (2009). "[[The Yattering and Jack]]" was adapted by Barker himself in 1986 for the US series ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]''.

==Story list and synopses==

===Volume One===

====The Book of Blood====

This is the [[frame story]] for the entire ''Books of Blood'' series. A [[psychic]] researcher, Mary Florescu, has employed a [[Quackery|quack]] [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]] named Simon McNeal to investigate a [[haunted house]]. Alone in an upstairs room, McNeal at first fakes visions, but then the ghosts attack him for real and carve words in his flesh {{ndash}} comprising the rest of the stories as a literal, living "Book of Blood." 

This prologue, along with closing story "On Jerusalem Street" from Volume Six, was adapted into the film ''[[Book of Blood]]'', written and directed by [[John Harrison (filmmaker)|John Harrison]].

====The Midnight Meat Train====

After [[New York City|New York]] office worker Leon Kaufman falls asleep on a late-night [[Rapid transit|subway]] train, he awakens to discover that the next car over has been turned into an [[abbatoir]] where other passengers have been butchered. Kaufman encounters the killer, a man named Mahogany, and kills him in [[self-defense]]. The motorman, nonplussed at Mahogany's death, brings the train into a secret station where strange, malformed humanoid creatures board and eat the bodies. It is revealed that the creatures, the "City Fathers", have been the secret rulers of New York for centuries, and show Kaufman an immense being further inside the [[catacombs]]. They then pull out Kaufman's tongue to ensure his silence, recruiting him as the new "butcher" devoted to bringing fresh meat to the City Fathers.

A [[The Midnight Meat Train|film of the same name]] was released on 1 August 2008. The film differs from the book in a number of ways, most notably with the introduction of additional characters such as Maya, Leon's girlfriend.   [[Bradley Cooper]] and [[Vinnie Jones]] star in the film.

====The Yattering and Jack====

Jack Polo is a [[gherkin]] importer who is haunted by a minor [[demon]] called the Yattering. The demon is commanded to haunt Jack by [[Beelzebub]], because one of Jack's ancestors reneged on a pact made with the demon lord. The Yattering is frustrated when its determined efforts to drive Jack insane are answered with good cheer and apparent obliviousness. Unknown to the Yattering, Jack is purposely ignoring the demon in order to simultaneously frustrate it and maintain his own sanity. The Yattering subjects him to increasingly severe torments, including killing his cats and terrorising his family, but these efforts all fail. Eventually Jack tricks the Yattering into violating its orders, allowing Jack to take advantage of a [[loophole]] and make the Yattering his slave.

Unusual for Barker's early work, this story is unabashedly comic. It was made into an episode of the horror anthology TV series ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' (Season 4 - 1987/88, episode 76; broadcast Nov 8, 1987) with Barker writing the screenplay from his own story.

====Pig Blood Blues====

Former policeman Redman starts working in a [[borstal]], where he uncovers a deadly secret involving a boy named Lacey. Lacey claims that a missing boy named Henessey is not missing, but rather is present in the form of a ghost. As Redman investigates, he finds that things are not what they seem, and that a giant pig in a sty on the grounds is possessed by Henessey's soul.

====Sex, Death and Starshine====
Leroy Townsonio is directing ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' in a run-down theatre. Leroy relies on the [[soap opera]] fame of his leading lady, Diane Duvall, to bring in a big audience; however, this is compromised by his affair with Diane and her poor acting skills. A mysterious man with an obscured face, Mr. Lichfield, introduces himself and expresses dissatisfaction with Diane's casting as [[Viola (Twelfth Night)|Viola]]. On the day of the final rehearsal, Lichfield confronts Diane and states that his wife, Constantia, will play the role on opening night. Diane removes Lichfield's mask to reveal him as an animated corpse. Lichfield kisses Diane, and she slips into a [[coma]]. Constantia takes over the role of Viola while Diane is put in intensive care. Following her "recovery", Leroy realises during sex that Diane is [[undead]], just before she kills him.

The play opens to a packed house. When the house lights are extinguished after the performance, the actors realise that the audience consists entirely of ghosts and decaying corpses. The theatre trustee, newly-dead Tallulah, burns down the theatre. Every living player in the production is killed. Several of the actors and Leroy join Mr. Lichfield and Constantia on the road as a repertory company of the undead.

====In the Hills, the Cities====
In an isolated rural area of [[Yugoslavia]], two entire cities, Popolac and Podujevo, create massive communal creatures by binding together the bodies of their citizens. Almost forty thousand people walk as the body of a single giant as tall as a skyscraper. This ritual occurs every ten years, but this time things go wrong and the Podujevo giant collapses, killing tens of thousands of citizens horribly. In shock, the entire population of Popolac goes mad and becomes the giant they are strapped into. Popolac wanders the hills aimlessly. By nightfall many of the people who make up the giant die from exhaustion, but the giant continues walking.

Mick and Judd, two gay men vacationing in the area, come upon the smashed bodies of the Podujevans in a ravine awash with blood. A local man tries to steal their car to catch up with Popolac and reason with it before it collapses and destroys the people who compose it. The man explains the truth of the situation to Mick and Judd, but they do not believe his story. They seek shelter at a remote farm, where Popolac blunders into the farmhouse, killing Judd accidentally. Mick and the elderly couple who own the farmhouse are driven mad with fear. Mick wants to join Popolac. He climbs up the tower of ropes and bodies, and is carried away as it walks into the hills.

A line from this story, "stale incense, old sweat, and lies," appears in the song ''Sin'' on the album ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' by the American industrial band [[Nine Inch Nails]].

===Volume Two===

====Dread====
Steve, a young student, becomes acquainted with an older classmate named Quaid, an intellectual who has a morbid fascination with [[fear]]. Quaid reveals to Steve that he kidnapped a [[vegetarian]] girl and imprisoned her in a room with merely a [[steak]] for sustenance, only releasing her when she finally overcame her dread of eating meat to prevent [[starvation]]; she eats the meat even though it has spoiled. Steve becomes Quaid's next candidate for his experiments, held captive in a dark, silent room, forcing him to relive a childhood period of deafness that terrified him. Steve is driven [[insane]] by this forced [[sensory deprivation]] and eventually butchers Quaid with an axe. Quaid's experiments, all along, were to try to help him understand the nature of fear, but ironically his experiments in [[phobias]] made his own worst fears come to life.

This story has been made into a [[Dread (film)|film]], with [[Jackson Rathbone]] playing Steve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=''Dread'' Poster Creeps Online |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33665/dread-poster-creeps-online |publisher=DreadCentral.com |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hell's Event====
Every one-hundred years, during an annual [[London]] marathon, [[Satan]] sends one of his representatives to compete against the (unsuspecting) human runners. If Satan's minion wins, he gets to rule the Earth. An athlete taking part in the event, Joel, begins to realise the actual stakes of the race when the other runners begin to fall, savaged by some unseen beast. A [[satanist]] politician, Gregory, has made a bargain with Hell on the outcome of the race. Joel does not win due to a struggle with Hell's shape-shifting runner, a demonic [[Familiar spirit|familiar]] who bites off his face. However, during this struggle, the last surviving runner jogs past them to the finishing line. Hell loses out once again. Gregory is punished for his overconfidence by being gruesomely slain.

====Jacqueline Ess: Her Will And Testament====
Jacqueline Ess is a housewife who attempts [[suicide]] after becoming bored with her life. She recovers only to find that she has an ability to change people's body shapes with her mind. She accidentally kills her therapist and then – somewhat less accidentally – her husband, simply by willing their bodies into tearing apart or folding in on themselves. One man becomes obsessed with her and tracks her down. Jacqueline eventually becomes a [[prostitute]], her abilities giving her the power to give men the ultimate sexual experience, albeit one that always proves fatal. She has by now lost control of herself and has to be watched while sleeping in case she unconsciously mutilates her own body. The man eventually makes love to Jacqueline and they willingly die together by her powers.

This story is also published in the book ''I Shudder at Your Touch''.

====The Skins of the Fathers====
After his car breaks down in [[Arizona]], a man named Davidson witnesses a bizarre parade of freakish monsters. It turns out that these creatures mated with a woman in a nearby town six years previously, and are intending on reclaiming the child, which they promptly achieve. Davidson reaches the town, where a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] of gun-toting locals are eager to set out to slay the monsters. Everything goes wrong, however, and Davidson and just a few other survivors end up with a horrific fate; they sink in [[quicksand]] which then hardens when they are half-buried, and are left for dead in the burning desert heat.

This was used as a scene in the film ''[[Lord of Illusions]]'', which was in turn based on "The Last Illusion", a story in volume six.

====New Murders in the Rue Morgue====
Lewis is a 73-year-old man who goes to [[Paris]] after his friend, Phillipe, is arrested for butchering a young woman. Phillipe eventually commits suicide in his cell after babbling about an [[orangutan]] who committed the murder he had been arrested for. Lewis does not believe it until he sees the primate – dressed like a human, completely shaved, and wielding a razor – for himself. The beast had been raised by Philippe, a notorious eccentric, as a strange experiment based on [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|classic story]].

===Volume Three===

====Son of Celluloid====
An escaped convict dies behind a film screen. Over the years following his death, a cancerous [[tumor]] gains sentience from the strong emotions of the cinema's audiences and torments the few people that remain after a show. The sole survivor of the massacre is seen some time later, having tracked down the murderous entity which was roaming the country after possessing the body of a young girl unaccounted for after the events. She covers the creature with acid, killing it completely.

====Rawhead Rex====
An ancient, malevolent monster, magically imprisoned underground, is accidentally awakened in a village in [[Kent]]. Rawhead is a nine-foot humanoid with a huge, toothed head, goes on a rampage, killing and eating several townsfolk. He corrupts the local [[verger]], who surrenders to the violent, depraved impulses that Rawhead represents, and who helps the monster slay the [[vicar]], Coot. Rawhead sets the village alight, and is eventually overcome by Ron, father of one of Rawhead's victims, who uses a [[amulet|talisman]] to stall the beast until he is overrun by a mob of enraged villagers. The talisman depicts a pregnant woman, Rawhead's [[antithesis]] and the only thing he fears.

''Rawhead Rex'' has a structure similar to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' or ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', but uses a disturbing rural setting. The story was later turned into the film ''[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]'' (1986), which Barker has disowned.

====Confessions of a (Pornographer's) Shroud====
Ronnie is a straight-laced Catholic man who is set up to look like the king of a [[pornography]] cartel. He kills some of his enemies, but is murdered by their cohorts. Awakening as a ghost, he possesses the shroud that covers his body in the morgue, and in the shape of the shroud takes revenge on the rest of his enemies. In a gory finale, he enters the mouth of the man responsible for his ordeal and turns him inside out.

Despite containing graphic descriptions of acts of extreme violence, the story is written as a [[black comedy]], revolving around the visual gag of a real ghost looking like someone wearing a bedsheet over his or her head.

====Scape-Goats====
A [[yacht]] is stranded on the beach of a deserted island located at a point in the Atlantic Ocean where converging undersea currents bring all the human bodies of sailors drowned at sea. The hundreds of bodies littering the ocean floor, unfortunately for the stranded crew, aren't as dead as they should be.

====Human Remains====
A young gay prostitute is hired by an [[archaeologist]]. During the course of the night he stumbles into the bathroom to discover a Roman-esque statue of a man lying in the bath. Over the next few weeks, he has the sense of being haunted by a [[doppelgänger]]. At the same time, his mind and body transforms; he becomes cold and lifeless, no longer needing to eat or sleep. He finally discovers his doppelganger, the statue from the bath, at his father's grave, crying in sorrow, as he is unmoved. It becomes clear that the doppelganger has become more convincing as a human than he is, and he wanders away, allowing it to continue living in his persona.

===Volume Four===
====The Inhuman Condition====
A young man named Karney and his friends beat up a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] for fun. Karney steals a strange knotted piece of string he finds on the vagrant. A keen fan of [[puzzles]], Karney undoes the knots that evening, not knowing that in doing so he is releasing a succession of demons who proceed to kill off his friends. The demons seem progressively more advanced, appearing to evolve with each knot. When he realises what he has done, Karney has to seek out the vagrant for help.

====The Body Politic====
In a bizarre version of a revolution, it appears that all our hands have their own [[consciousness]] and are not happy at being ordered what to do by their owners. The hands of a factory worker named Charlie plan to lead the revolution. Charlie's hands even have their own personalities, with Left being more cautious and Right being very determined and even proclaiming himself a [[Messiah]]. Right – against Charlie's own wishes – chops off Left, who scuttles away to summon other hands to do the same before returning to rescue Right, starting an unfortunate revolution for the population. 

This book was later adapted and used, in part, for the film ''[[Quicksilver Highway]]''.

====Revelations====
A woman named Virginia is unwillingly taken on a tour of the U.S. by her unfeeling husband, a preacher named John Gyer. They stay at a [[motel]] which is visited by the ghosts of Buck and Sadie, a married couple who stayed there. In the same room, 30 years before, Sadie murdered Buck and was subsequently put to death for the murder. Buck and Sadie find that Virginia has the ability to both see and hear them. Meanwhile, a scuffle ensues when John discovers their driver, Earl, has been giving Virginia pills to help her deal with her anxiety issues. While looking for Earl to confront him about the pills, John finds the married driver in bed with the daughter of the motel owner, Laura-May. Virginia ends up getting her hands on the same murder weapon used by Sadie 30 years prior, which Laura-May has kept as a souvenir. Virginia uses the gun to try to kill Buck's ghost, who managed partial materialization in order to attempt to [[rape]] her, but the bullet goes through him and finds its way into John's throat,  killing him. Virginia contemplates suicide, but Sadie's ghost advises her to [[insanity plea|plead insanity]]. Whilst being taken in by the local sheriff, someone asks her why she did it. Virginia answers "the Devil made me do it" whilst gazing at the moon with "the craziest smile she (can) muster".

====Down, Satan!====
One of the shortest stories relates the tale of a wealthy middle-aged businessman, Gregorius, who becomes depressed when he believes God has deserted him, and he comes up with a plan to build a [[Hell]] on Earth to summon [[Satan]], believing that God will then sweep him (Gregorius) out of Satan's clutches, and into his heavenly fold. In his vast Satanic Cathedral, Gregorious soon loses sight of his original intention of attracting God's attention, and he is captured after torturing hundreds of people to death in the well-equipped [[torture]] chambers. It is deliberately left ambiguous whether Gregorius went [[insane]], or if he really did succeed in tempting Satan into taking residence in his own personal Hell.

====The Age of Desire====

A private laboratory runs experiments on volunteers to investigate the [[libido]] and try to develop a chemical [[aphrodisiac]]. One of the experiments goes wrong, when a man suddenly goes insane with lust. His perpetual state of arousal erodes his respect for [[morality]] or the law. He rapes, murders, and mutilates one of the scientists and then escapes to cause wanton mayhem, eventually burning himself out and dying.

===Volume Five===
(published in the United States as ''In the Flesh'')

====The Forbidden====
A university student named Helen is doing a [[thesis]] on [[graffiti]], and selects a run-down estate to focus her study. She notices disturbing graffiti in an abandoned building that makes references to an [[urban legend]] known as the Candyman. Further enquiries lead her to believe this is connected with recent murders and mutilations in the neighbourhood, although the locals are seemingly reluctant to discuss the incidents. She eventually encounters the Candyman himself, gaining notoriety by becoming his latest victim. 

This book was later adapted and made into the film ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]''.

====The Madonna====
A man named Jerry is trying to talk a local shady businessman into financing the redevelopment of an old swimming pool complex. However, the pool has some mysterious inhabitants in the form of nude teenage girls who flee should Jerry or his would-be financial backer encounter them. A swimming pool in the centre is unlike the other pools in the building, in that it is full, glows with a strange light, and appears to be inhabited by some misshapen life-form. Curiosity leads Jerry to return to the place, which somehow causes him to wake up one morning to see that he has been transformed into a woman.

====Babel's Children====
After breaking down in the middle of nowhere, a young woman happens across a secluded compound in which the world's greatest minds, a group of elderly scientists and scholars, are responsible for determining the outcome of major world events. They have lived in the complex for many years and by this point their decisions have degenerated to being made solely via games of chance. Chaos ensues when the woman and the men seek to flee the compound. They end up getting in a car accident, and all the elders are killed with the exception of the single one who refused to go along. The woman is forced to participate in the games of chance with him until replacements can be found.

====In The Flesh====
A prison inmate named Cleve gets a new cellmate, a mysterious young man called Billy, who admits that he committed a crime with the sole intention of coming to this particular prison. Billy believes he has been summoned there by his grandfather, a supposedly powerful sorcerer who was buried in the prison after his execution for murder years before. Billy's efforts to summon his grandfather Tait's spirit cause Cleve to be haunted by dreams in which he travels to a form of [[purgatory]] for murderers, where killers are obliged to spend some portion of their [[after life]] in a replica of the scene of their crime. In the end, Billy vanishes from his cell. His grandfather's coffin is exhumed and found to contain Billy curled up next to his grandfather's corpse. Once released, Cleve finds that his travels to the murderer's purgatory have left him with the ability to hear other people's thoughts, as long as they revolve around killing people. He becomes disillusioned with humanity and becomes a [[heroin]] addict to suppress his newfound powers. Cleve later commits a murder himself to feed his habit, and is shot dead by the police. He spends an indeterminate amount of time in his own murderer's purgatory, before discovering that individuals can escape via [[reincarnation]].

===Volume Six===
(several of these stories are also published in ''[[Cabal (novella)|Cabal]]'')

==== The Life of Death ====
Following a brush with cancer and a subsequent [[hysterectomy]], a woman named Elaine becomes fascinated by a church that is being demolished. She encounters a cheerfully morbid man named Kavanagh, who shares her fascination. The demolition soon reveals a tomb of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] victims that had been fermenting for centuries, and Elaine breaks in at night to view the bodies. Later, when her friends begin to die off and the police come after her, Elaine takes refuge with Kavanagh, who she firmly believes, due to his mysterious personality and skeletal features, to be [[Death (personification)|Death]]. It turns out Kavanagh is only a [[serial killer]] and [[necrophile]]; he strangles and rapes Elaine. As her soul flees her body, Elaine feels a sick sort of glee when she realizes that Kavanagh will now be the carrier of the plague she contracted in the tomb, and will spread it far and wide.

====How Spoilers Bleed====
Several European [[mercenary|mercenaries]], led by a cold-hearted man named Locke, have bought land in the [[jungles]] of [[South America]] that it is inhabited by a tribe of [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] natives. When the tribe refuse to leave, one of Locke's cohorts impulsively shoots one of them dead accidentally. The elder of the tribe puts a curse on the men which, one by one, strikes them down with a gruesome condition that makes their bodies incredibly delicate; a mote of dust can slice their skin open, the soles of their feet crack when they stand. After his men die off, Locke goes back to the tribe to beg for forgiveness. However, when he gets there, the tribe has been massacred by some of his other colleagues. Locke begins to suffer the symptoms of the deadly curse just as he realises there is now no way of having it removed.

==== Twilight at the Towers ====
A British spy named Ballard stationed in [[Berlin]] meets with a [[KGB]] counterpart named Mironenko. After their meet, Mironenko disappears. Ballard witnesses a vicious mauling, then soon learns that he and Mironenko are both [[werewolf|werewolves]], trained by each agency to defeat the other. Both governments raid their meeting place, causing Mironenko to transform fully. Ballard runs and wakes up in a fellow operative's house. Ballard's rival, Suckling, arrives and kills the agent, only to be killed by the transformed Ballard. Ballard seeks Mironenko, and finds him preaching to a group of wolves, verbally preparing them to overthrow humankind.

====The Last Illusion====
Private investigator [[Harry D'Amour]] takes a strange case where a magician named Swann has been killed under mysterious circumstances. D'Amour is recruited by Swann's wife to watch over his body so he can be [[cremation|cremated]] in line with a letter written before his death. Almost immediately, D'Amour is drawn into a battle with demons from the underworld seeking to claim Swann's body due to a deal he made with them which gave him the magical powers he possessed. With the assistance of Swann's underling Valentin, who is secretly a demon himself, D'Amour fights off the demons desiring Swann's body and manages to cremate it, but not before Swann performs one last magical act. 

This story was later adapted by Barker himself into the film ''[[Lord of Illusions]]''.

====On Jerusalem Street (a postscript)====
Only included in some UK editions of the ''Books of Blood'', "On Jerusalem Street" is a sequel to "The Book of Blood" from Volume One told as a sort of wrap-around tale. Wyburd is hired to obtain the Book of Blood for a collector. He captures and skins Simon McNeal. Later, the skin starts to bleed and won't stop, and Wyburd eventually drowns. He ends up on the highways of the dead, where he tells his story. 

This story, along with the prologue from Volume One, was adapted and directed into the film ''Book of Blood'' by John Harrison.

The '''Corcoran Gallery of Art''' was an art museum in [[Washington, D.C.]] that is now the location of the [[Corcoran School of the Arts and Design]], a part of the [[George Washington University]]. The Corcoran School, founded in 1878, hosts exhibitions by its students and visiting artists and offers degrees in Fine Art, Photojournalism, Interaction Design, Interior Architecture, etc. Prior to the Gallery's closing, it was one of the oldest privately supported cultural institutions in the United States. Starting in 1890, a museum school, later known as the [[Corcoran School of the Arts and Design|Corcoran College of Art + Design]], co-existed with the gallery. The museum's main focus was [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]]. In 2014, after decades of financial problems and mismanagement, the Corcoran was dissolved by court order. A new non-profit was established and the Corcoran's $2 billion, 17,000 piece art collection was given away for free to the National Gallery of Art (NGA).  What works the NGA did not accession were donated to cultural institutions throughout Washington, D.C. and across the country. The Corcoran School of Art and Design was given to [[George Washington University]] (GWU) along with the $200 million historic 17th street building along with $50 million.

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:USA-Corcoran Gallery of Art2.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance of the former Corcoran Gallery of Art]]
When the gallery was founded in 1869 by [[William Wilson Corcoran]], the co-founder of [[Riggs Bank]], it was one of the first [[fine art]] galleries in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ability.org.uk/art.html |title=Art And Museums |accessdate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corcoran established the gallery, supported with an [[financial endowment|endowment]], "for the perpetual establishment and encouragement of the Fine Arts."  While an independent institution, the Corcoran was the oldest and largest non-federal [[art museum]] in the [[District of Columbia]].  Its mission was "dedicated to art and used solely for the purpose of encouraging the American genius."

The Corcoran Gallery of Art was originally located at 17th Street and [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], in the building that now houses the [[Renwick Gallery]].  Construction of that building started before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  The building, near completion, was used by the government as a warehouse during the Civil War.  It was finally completed in 1874 and the gallery opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reed, Robert |title=Old Washington, D.C. in Early Photographs: 1846–1932 |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1980 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1897, the Corcoran Gallery collection outgrew the space of its original building.  A new building was constructed, designed by [[Ernest Flagg]] in a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style.  The 135,000 square feet (12,500 m²) building was built to house an expanded Corcoran collection in addition to the nascent school, which had been formally founded in 1890.  The new building features a pair of bronze statues, the [[Canova Lions]], at its entrance. These lions were purchased at auction by the Corcoran Galley in 1888 and placed in front of the museum at its original location. The iconic bronze castings were moved to their current location in 1897 when the museum moved to its current building at 17th Street and New York Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMJN4H_Corcoran_Gallery_of_Art_Lions_Washington_DC|title=Corcoran Gallery of Art Lions - Washington, D.C. - Exact Replicas on Waymarking.com|website=www.waymarking.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Years of growth ===
In 1928, the art collection of former Senator [[William A. Clark]] joined the Corcoran in a new wing designed by Charles Adam Platt, and inaugurated by President Calvin Coolidge. For decades, the Corcoran examined the possibility of adding on a final wing which would complete the campus footprint. These plans abruptly ended in 2005 after a [[Frank O. Gehry]] -designed wing was scrapped due to lack of funding, and the remainder of the available property was sold to a private developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/27/AR2005052701609.html |title=Crushed |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the gallery continued to display its main collection from Corcoran, Clark, and a few select major donors. At its peak, the museum owned a significant collection including work from [[Rembrandt Peale]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Mariano Fortuny (painter)|Mariano Fortuny]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], and many others. Space was always a challenge - only a small percentage of the gallery's permanent collection was able to be displayed in the confines of the 17th street gallery, which shared its roughly 140,000 square feet with the art school.

=== Mapplethorpe controversy ===
In 1989, the Corcoran Gallery of Art had agreed to host a traveling solo exhibit of [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]'s works. Mapplethorpe decided to show a new series that he had explored shortly before his death, ''[[The Perfect Moment|Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment]]'' curated by Janet Kardon of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaphila.org/news/pdf/mapplethorpe_pr.pdf |title=Imperfect Moments: Mapplethorpe and Censorship Twenty Years Later |publisher= Institute of Contemporary Art }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Trustees of the Corcoran and U.S. Representatives Dick Armey (TX) and Jesse Helms (NC) were horrified when the works were revealed to them, and the museum director, Christina Orr-Cahall succumbed to pressure and cancelled the exhibit, which had already been announced to its members through an exhibition preview invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1212527.html |title=Corcoran Offers `Regret' on Mapplethorpe; Statement Promises Support for Art, Artists and Artistic Freedom |work=[[The Washington Post]] Article |date=September 19, 1989 |first=Elizabeth |last=Kastor |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Coalition of Washington Artists organized a demonstration to protest the Corcoran Gallery's cancellation of the exhibit. An estimated 700 people attended the demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/01/arts/crowd-at-corcoran-protests-mapplethorpe-cancellation.html |title=Crowd at Corcoran Protests Mapplethorpe Cancellation |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Barbara |last=Gamarekian |date=July 1, 1989 |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1989, [[pop art]]ist [[Lowell Blair Nesbitt]] became involved in the controversy over Mapplethorpe's work. 
It was at this time that Nesbitt, a long-time friend of Mapplethorpe, revealed that he had a $1.5 million bequest to the museum in his will. Nesbitt publicly promised that if the museum refused to host the exhibition he would revoke his [[bequest]]. The Corcoran refused and Nesbitt bequeathed the money to the [[Phillips Collection]] instead.

After the Corcoran cancelled the Mapplethorpe exhibition, the underwriters of the exhibition went to the nonprofit [[Washington Project for the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v47/no2/fitzpat.html |title=The Sensitive Society |first=James F. |last=Fitzpatrick |page=FCLJ Vol 47 No 2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613072721/http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v47/no2/fitzpat.html |archivedate=2008-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed the controversial images in its own space from July 21 to August 13, 1989, to large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73897099.html?dids=73897099:73897099&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+6%2C+1989&amp;author=Judd+Tully&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=b.01&amp;desc=Corcoran+Cut+From+Painter%27s+Will%3BLowell+Nesbitt%27s+Mapplethorpe+Protest |title=Corcoran Cut From Painter's Will; Lowell Nesbitt's Mapplethorpe Protest | first=Judd | last=Tully |date=6 September 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photography-now.net/listings/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=354&amp;Itemid=334 |title=Robert Mapplethorpe |accessdate=December 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1990 [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] Appropriations Bill included language against "obscene" work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publiceye.org/theocrat/Mapplethorpe_Chrono.html |title=The Mapplethorpe Censorship Controversy.

As a result of the controversy, more than a dozen artists canceled exhibitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1209019.html |title=Artists Cancel Exhibitions At Corcoran; Mapplethorpe Case Prompts Boycott |work=The Washington Post|date=August 30, 1989 |first=Paul |last=Richard |accessdate=December 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the director, Christina Orr-Cahall, resigned and moved to the [[Norton Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-02-11/entertainment/9002093777_1_cahall-corcoran-mapplethorpe |title=Out Of The Frying Pan, Into West Palm |date=February 11, 1990|first= Chuck |last=Twardy |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final years ===
[[File:Gallery display of American paintings formerly in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.jpg|thumb|By 2018, artwork accessioned by the National Gallery of Art from the Corcoran collection had been incorporated into displays at the Gallery; these four paintings are among those currently visible in the rooms dedicated to American art.]]
In its final years, the museum and its affiliated art and design college [[Corcoran School of the Arts and Design]] together had a staff of about 140 and an operating budget of about $24 million. Revenue came from grants and contributions, admissions fees, tuition, membership dues, gift shop and restaurant sales, and an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] worth around $30 million. In February 2001, two [[America Online|AOL]] executives ([[Robert W. Pittman]] and [[Barry Schuler]]) and their wives donated $30 million to the museum, its largest single donation since its founding.

In 2014, following decades of financial problems, the Corcoran Trustees chose to break the founder's deed of trust by going to court to have the Corcoran dissolved. Following a court order dissolving the city's oldest independent museum, the trustees gave the former college of art and design, the $200 million Beaux Arts building, and $50 million to [[George Washington University]] to renovate the facility and operate the school programs. The 17,000 piece art collection worth $2 billion was donated to the [[National Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/corcoran-gallery-george-washington-university-and-national-gallery-close-deal-to-transform-corcoran/2014/05/15/4ddba908-dc4a-11e3-b745-87d39690c5c0_story.html | newspaper=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Montgomery | title=Corcoran Gallery, GWU and National Gallery close deal to transform Corcoran | date=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of 2018, the director of the [[Corcoran School of the Arts and Design]] officially disclosed plans for the [[National Gallery of Art]] to bring art back to the second floor of the Flagg building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/article/20987508/is-a-renovation-at-the-george-washington-university-making-its-students-sick | newspaper=Washington City Paper | first=Kriston | last=Capps | title=Is a Renovation at the Corcoran's Flagg Building Making Its Students Sick? | date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interior ==
Flagg also designed the interior of the building. When one enters the building's front doors on 17th Street, they first enter the 170&amp;nbsp;ft x 50&amp;nbsp;ft atrium. The vast space, separated into three connected sections, consists of forty limestone columns and twin skylights (to light the intended display of sculptures). The Beaux-Arts-inspired room rises two interior stories and has housed exhibit space and other uses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;National Register of Historic Places nomination, https://dcpreservation-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Corcoran-Gallery-of-Art-Interior-Nomination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly across the atrium from the front entrance stands the grand staircase, leading to the second floor. Low rise stairs, sixteen feet wide, are watched over by six statues on pedestals atop marble platforms, and lead to a landing halfway to the second floor. Hold onto the brass-topped railing for balance. From the grand staircase one can access the rotunda and the second story level of the atrium, including a bridge that heads across the atrium back towards the direction of the front door. Gallery space exists throughout.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Back on the first floor, three galleries lead from the atrium (originally there were seven). The second floor originally had eight galleries. The rotunda came later, designed by [[Charles A. Platt|Charles Platt]] in 1925. Forty eight feet wide, the room's domed ceiling culminates in an oculus skylight. Reminiscent of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the space offers an exquisite entry to the building's Clark Wing. An observer would access a marble floored, square, dark staircase hall with wood panels to reach the Clark Wing galleries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the northern end of the building, the Hemicycle's unusual shape fills the angle created by New York Avenue and 17th Street. The space is the auditorium, being 67&amp;nbsp;ft x 45&amp;nbsp;ft with a 300-person capacity. The Salon Doré appears on the building's opposite side. Also referred to as the "French Room," it displays intricate French decorations; it was designed in the early 1700s by [[Jean Chalgrin|Jean‐François‐Thérèse Chalgrin]] and was moved from Paris to the United States sometime before 1904.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, preservationists added the interior portions of the Corcoran Gallery to the National Register of Historic Places (the exterior had been listed in 1971). The interior nomination includes the grand staircase, atrium, rotunda, gallery, and other notable spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/preservationists-file-to-protect-corcoran/2012/10/01/d8a6e728-0bd6-11e2-a310-2363842b7057_story.html|title=Preservationists file to protect Corcoran|last=https://www.facebook.com/david.montgomery.5682944|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/landmark-status-for-corcoran-gallery-of-art-interior/|title=Landmark Status for Corcoran Gallery of Art Interior|last=Wolfe|first=Jonathan|work=ArtsBeat|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets''''' is a 1998 [[children's book]] written by [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].  It concerns the two pets that lived in the [[White House]] during the [[Clinton administration]], [[Socks (cat)|Socks the cat]] and [[Buddy (dog)|Buddy the dog]]. 

==Description==
The book includes more than 50 letters written to the First Pets by children and more than 80 photographs of Socks and Buddy.  Examples of questions that letters asked include, "Who do you like best? Mr. Clinton? Mrs. Clinton or Chelsea?" and, "How do you like being a dog, Buddy? I like being a person."&lt;ref name="nyt-announce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cst-about"/&gt; Socks was also asked if he was allowed to watch [[MTV]]&lt;ref name="cst-about"/&gt; and Buddy was asked if he ever got petted by the [[Spice Girls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22dear+socks%22+%22dear+buddy%22+%22spice+girls%22&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=bks&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjhqq6zsPaAhVik-AKHTBQDZA4ChD8BQgQKAE&amp;biw=1044&amp;bih=757&amp;dpr=1.2 | title='Dear Buddy, Did You Ever Get Petted By the Spice Girls?' | magazine=[[Newsweek]] | date=October 1998 | page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also includes several sections of text by Clinton discussing the two pets' habits, as well as the rivalry between them. Clinton also provided a history of the previous pets that had lived in the White House.&lt;ref name="cst-about"/&gt; The text also dispensed some advice on caring for pets and told parents to encourage children to express themselves through writing.&lt;ref name="cst-about"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4473145.html | title=Socking it to Buddy; First lady's pet book is a tail-all account | newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=December 6, 1998 | first=Paul D. | last=Colford |subscription= yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The last chapter of the book is titled "A Note on Saving America's Parks and Treasures".&lt;ref&gt;''Dear Socks, Dear Buddy'', pp. 193–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hillary Clinton in 1999 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The First Lady with Socks and Buddy in 1999]]

The idea for the book originated with her publisher, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], who were interested in a follow-up to Clinton's best-selling 1996 volume ''[[It Takes a Village]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt-announce"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/08/business/media-talk-the-first-pets-get-their-own-book.html | title=Media Talk: The First Pets Get Their Own Book | first=Doreen | last=Carvajal | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also followed in the pawsteps of prior First Lady [[Barbara Bush]]'s popular 1990 effort ''[[Millie's Book]]'', about [[Millie (dog)|the prior White House dog]].&lt;ref name="sr-announce"/&gt; Plans for ''Dear Socks, Dear Buddy'' were announced in June 1998&lt;ref name="sr-announce"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19980605&amp;id=Z4BXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uvEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4264,2334094&amp;hl=en | title=First Lady's book deal is animal act | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] | location=Spokane, Washington | date=June 5, 1998 | page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was stated that [[Linda Kulman]], a reporter based in Washington, would assist Clinton in the writing.&lt;ref name="sr-announce"/&gt; [[Book Magazine|''Book'']] magazine would subsequently characterize Kulman's role as that of a [[ghostwriter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-82260536.html | title= Master Class: Want to Write a Book?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14857">'''Dewey-free''' (also '''Dewey free''', '''Dewey-less''', or '''word-based''') refers to [[Library classification|library classification schemes]] developed as alternatives to [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC).  Dewey-free systems are often based on the [[BISAC]] subject headings developed by the [[Book Industry Study Group]], and are typically implemented in libraries with smaller collections.  Instead of using numerical notation to indicate a document's shelving location, Dewey-free systems organize documents alphabetically by natural language words.  Dewey-free systems have been implemented in both [[Public library|public]] and [[School library|school]] libraries.

==Motivations==

A primary motivation for the development of Dewey-free systems is to eliminate DDC's numerical notation, which many library patrons find intimidating.  Abandoning numerical notation in favor of natural language words may also facilitate browsing.&lt;ref name=lj&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fister|first1=Barbara|title=The Dewey Dilemma|journal=Library Journal|date=2009|volume=134|issue=16|pages=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoption of Dewey-free classification is often seen as part of a greater trend of using a "bookstore model" to deliver library services.  This trend gained traction in 1998 with an article by Los Angeles librarian Steve Coffman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coffman|first1=Steve|title=What if you ran your library like a bookstore?|journal=American Libraries|date=March 1998|pages=40–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some librarians see this as a beneficial approach that will make patrons more comfortable and increase circulation statistics, others disagree with the approach, particularly as large bookstores such as [[Borders Group]] have met severe financial challenges.

Many Dewey-free proponents believe that Dewey is outdated and ill-suited for non-academic environments.&lt;ref name=lj /&gt;&lt;ref name=gibson /&gt;  DDC organizes documents not only by subject, but also by academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hope|first1=Olson|title=Sameness and difference: a cultural foundation of classification|journal=Library Resources and Technical Services|date=2001|volume=45|issue=3|page=117|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/files/resources/lrts/archive/45n3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This leads to materials on the same topic being filed in wildly disparate locations.  For example, Dewey places books about railroad trains in both the 380s and the 620s.&lt;ref name=metis /&gt; The discipline-based orientation is also problematic for categorizing interdisciplinary works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Searing|first1=Susan E.|title=How Libraries Cope with Interdisciplinarity: The Case of Women's Studies|journal=Issues in integrative studies|date=1992|volume=10|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-academic titles, which make up the bulk of most public libraries' non-fiction holdings.

DDC has also faced a number of critiques for its biases.  Scholars and catalogers have specifically criticized its marginalization of
[[developing countries]] and continents,&lt;ref name=afolabi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Afolabi|first1=M|title=Spiritual matters: Provision for independent African churches in general classification schemes.|journal=International Classification|date=1992|volume=19|issue=4|pages=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iwuji|first1=H.O.M.|title=Africana in LC and DD classification schemes: A need for an Africana scheme?|journal=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|date=1989|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1177/096100068902100101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McConnell|first1=Fraiser|title=Classification of Melanesia|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=13 August 1984|volume=5|issue=1|pages=53–60|doi=10.1300/J104v05n01_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McConnell|first1=Fraiser|title=Languages of Melanesia|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=10 May 1985|volume=5|issue=3|pages=57–66|doi=10.1300/J104v05n03_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McConnell|first1=Fraiser|title=Peoples of Melanesia|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=2 October 1985|volume=5|issue=4|pages=47–51|doi=10.1300/J104v05n04_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kua|first1=Eunice|title=Non-Western Languages and Literatures in the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme|journal=Libri|date=2004|volume=54|pages=256–265|url=http://www.librijournal.org/pdf/2004-4pp256-265.pdf|doi=10.1515/libr.2004.256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarians who work with children point to additional benefits within their collections. They note that school library workers often have little support and few resources for teaching the DDC system to children.  The numbers themselves are often opaque to younger students, who typically don't learn about decimals until late in elementary school.&lt;ref name=gibson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibson|first1=Marjorie|title=Innovative 21st Century Classification Schemes for Elementary School Libraries|journal=Feliciter|date=2011|volume=57|issue=2|pages=48–61|url=http://www.cla.ca/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/Feliciter/PastIssues/2011/Vol57No2/Feliciter2_Vol_57_2011_web.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
In the 1970s and 1980s, public libraries in the United Kingdom and United States designed new "reader-interest classification" systems as alternatives to DDC.  These systems organized materials in ways that are intuitive to non-academic users and employed modern terminology, resulting in collections that are more browsable.  However, a lack of standardization led libraries to abandon these systems.  Dewey-free classification schemes can be seen as new cases of reader-interest classification schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martínez-Ávila|first1=Daniel|last2=San Segundo|first2=Rosa|last3=Olson|first3=Hope A.|title=The Use of BISAC in Libraries as New Cases of Reader-Interest Classifications|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|volume=52|issue=2|pages=137–155|doi=10.1080/01639374.2013.846284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Maricopa County Library District]] announced that its Gilbert Library would abandon DDC in favor of a BISAC-based system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Sarah N.|last2=Mulero|first2=Eugene|title=Dewey? At This Library With a Very Different Outlook, They Don't|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/us/14dewey.html|work=New York Times|date=14 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library district reported the change as a success, with non-fiction circulation improving sixfold.&lt;ref name=discord&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lavallee|first1=Andrew|title=Discord over Dewey|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB118340075827155554|accessdate=13 June 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Rangeview Library District]] became the first library district to fully convert to a BISAC-based scheme.  Rangeview's classification system, which is branded as "WordThink", is based on BISAC headings.&lt;ref name=anythink&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oder|first1=Norman|title=In the Country of Anythink|journal=Library Journal|date=15 November 2010|volume=135|issue=19|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the librarians at the [[Ethical Culture School]] in New York City developed a Dewey-Free system called [[Metis Classification|Metis]].  The school's novel approach incorporated focus groups of students from Kindergarten through the Fifth Grade in designing the system.&lt;ref name=metis /&gt;

The Darien Library in Connecticut employs a hybrid approach to classification.  While books are still organized by DDC number, DDC categories are "clumped into eight broad categories," known as glades.&lt;ref name=lj /&gt;  A glade groups together books from several Dewey classes that Darien librarians feel may be useful to similar groups.  For example, the ''Places'' glade is intended for international travellers, and combines books from the 400s (Languages) and 910s (Travel and Geography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting to Know the Glades|url=http://www.darienlibrary.org/node/1706|website=Darien Library|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nyack Library]] used a "marketplace" system similar to Darien's glades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=John|last2=Mahoney|first2=James|title=Nyack Library’s Dewey Decimal Debate|url=http://www.nyacknewsandviews.com/2012/06/nl_deweydecimal_oview/|accessdate=13 June 2014|work=Nyack News and Views|date=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after complaints from community members, the library reverted to a traditional DDC collection in 2013.

The [[King County Library System]] announced in 2014 that all 48 of its branches will convert their fiction [[picture book]] collections to a Dewey-free subject classification system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGowan|first1=Cecilia|title=When Finding Picture Books Really Can Be Child’s Play [presentation]|url=https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2014-08-05.0715.M.51A1F6BD288768B43F3C46EBA9B642.vcr&amp;sid=2008170|website=First Tuesdays|publisher=Washington State Library|accessdate=12 August 2014|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
There has been very little formal evaluation of Dewey-free systems, even by libraries that have implemented them.&lt;ref name=anythink /&gt;

Many libraries point to an increase in circulation statistics—either for a particular topic or for the non-fiction collection as a whole—as a measure of the success of their Dewey-free systems.&lt;ref name=gibson /&gt;&lt;ref name=metis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaplan|first1=Tali Balas|last2=Dolloff|first2=Andrea K.|last3=Giffard|first3=Sue|last4=Still-Schiff|first4=Jennifer|title=Are Dewey’s Days Numbered?: Libraries Nationwide Are Ditching the Old Classification System|journal=School Library Journal|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the correlation between circulation statistics and library classification scheme is not easy to demonstrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morson|first1=Ian|last2=Perry|first2=Mike|title=Alternative Arrangement: New Approaches to Public Libraries Stock|date=1982|publisher=Association of Assistant Librarians|location=London|chapter=Two-Tier and Total: Stock Arrangement in Brent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Arrangement in Glasgow City Libraries|journal=Public Library Journal|date=1992|volume=7|issue=5|pages=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dewey-free reclassification projects are often undertaken in conjunction with other projects that aim to better merchandise a library's holdings, so it can be very unclear how much of a circulation increase can be attributed to a new classification scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Nanci Milone|title=Dewey or Don't We?|journal=Public Libraries|date=July–August 2010|volume=49|issue=4|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, library scholars typically warn against using circulation statistics as the sole metric of any project's success, because such statistics fail to account for materials used within the library, materials that were circulated but never read, or materials that were circulated but failed to provide users with the information they needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spiller|first1=David|title=Providing Materials for Library Users|date=2000|publisher=Library Association Publishing|location=London|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Call numbers are generally not indexed by [[Integrated Library System]]s, so the adoption of word-based classification systems has had little impact on [[information retrieval]] quality within library catalogs to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://media.sois.uwm.edu/v/ea51a00429ec43c2993b1c5513477bf7 | title=Information Retrieval with BISAC in Bookstore, Library, and Other Catalogs | publisher=School of Information Studies, UW-Milwaukee | accessdate=18 June 2014 | author=Martinez Ávila, Daniel | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Critics of the new systems argue that BISAC's broad categories actually impede browsing, as many different subtopics are interspersed with one another.  They prefer DDC's arrangement of materials by specific subject.  They also argue that many of the issues addressed by Dewey-free systems could be resolved much more easily with improved signage and book labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stauffer|first1=Suzanne M.|title=Dewey - or Don't We - Classify?|journal=Children &amp; Libraries|date=Summer 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even proponents of Dewey-free systems note that BISAC-based classification systems would be unsuitable for libraries with large or specialized collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Jeff|title=Doing it without Dewey: A Perry Branch Library Tour|url=http://gathernodust.blogspot.com/2007/07/doing-it-without-dewey-perry-branch.html|website=Gather No Dust|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics have also questioned the pedagogical value of Dewey-free classifications, questioning whether library patrons used to a Dewey-free system will have the skills necessary to navigate collections classified according to DDC or [[Library of Congress Classification]].&lt;ref name=metis /&gt;

Critics have also noted that using English words instead of numbers for all classification sends a message that libraries are only interested in serving English speakers.&lt;ref name=lj /&gt;

Following a management buy-out by Matt Davies in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rsmuk.com/news/completes-the-management-buyout-of-worlds-most-popular-online-ferry-ticket-provider-direct-ferries|title=Baker Tilly completes the management buyout of world’s most popular online ferry ticket provider, Direct Ferries|newspaper=RSM UK|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company has expanded its services to the [[Middle East]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Direct Ferries is the first European agent to work with NFC, and Oman based company offering high speed services, making ferry travel in [[Oman]] accessible to passengers around the world. In the US, the deal has been signed with some of the biggest ferry operators, as well as BC Ferries and Clipper Vacations in Canada.

'''''Dundee Farm Ltd. v. Bambury Holdings Ltd.''''' (1978) is a case involving the sale of a farm in [[Bombay, South Auckland]] and is notable as it is often cited in New Zealand on issues of mistake,&lt;ref name="Gerbic &amp; Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Commercial Law |edition=5th |last1=Gerbic |first1=Philippa |last2=Lawrence |first2=Martin |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71714-9|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reinforces the English case of [[Joscelyne v Nissen]] [1970] 2 QB 86 into NZ case law.

==Background==
The vendor's intention was to sell their {{convert|544|acre}} of farmland. Unfortunately, the subsequent sale agreement was complicated by the fact that the 544 acres was on numerous titles, and by mistake the vendor's solicitors included in the sale agreement a title for a {{convert|12|acre}} block, on the mistaken belief that these 12 acres were the south western corner of the farm.

It however transpired that these extra 12 acres were not only not the south western corner of the farm, it was not even near the farm, and was instead the vendor's residential lifestyle block {{convert|3|mi}} away in [[Pukekohe]].

When the vendor notified the purchaser of this mistake, the purchaser refused to settle on the sale contract, upon which the vendor brought an action for [[Rectification (law)|rectification]] and [[specific performance]].

==Held==
The [[High Court of New Zealand]] ruled that as it was a pure mistake that the extra title was included, and that the purchaser's position had not changed, they ruled in favour of both rectification and for specific performance.

'''eOTD''' is the acronym for the '''ECCMA Open Technical Dictionary'''. The dictionary is a language-independent database of [[concept]]s with associated terms, definitions and images used to unambiguously describe individuals, organizations, locations, goods, services, processes, rules, and regulations. The eOTD is maintained by the [[Electronic Commerce Code Management Association]] ([[ECCMA]]).

== History ==
The eOTD was developed with the support of the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) an agency of the US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The eOTD is the first dictionary to be compliant with [[ISO 22745]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (open technical dictionaries).

== Structure ==
The eOTD contains terms, definitions and images linked to concept identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; eOTD concept identifiers are used to create unambiguous language independent descriptions of individuals, organizations, locations, goods, services, processes, rules and regulations. The process of using concept identifiers from an external open technical dictionary is a form of semantic encoding compliant with the requirements of [[ISO 8000]]-110:2008, the international standard for the exchange of quality master data.

The eOTD concept identifiers are in the public domain. Using public domain identifiers as metadata creates portable data that can be legally separated from the software application that was used to create it. The dictionary contains concepts from international, national and industry standards including over 400,000 concepts of class (approved item name), property (attribute), units of measure, currency and common enumerated value (e.g., days of the week). The eOTD does not include a class hierarchy or class-property relationships.

== Use ==
Companies use the eOTD to create data requirement specifications as Identification Guides (IGs) or cataloging templates. These Identification Guides contain the class-property relationships and are used for cataloging, to measure data quality as well as to create requests for data or requests for data validation.

'''''Empire''''' is a British [[film magazine]] published monthly by [[Bauer Verlagsgruppe|Bauer Consumer Media]]  of [[Hamburg]] based [[Bauer Media Group]]. From the first issue in July 1989, the magazine was edited by [[Barry McIlheney]] and published by [[Emap]]. [[Bauer Verlagsgruppe|Bauer]] purchased [[Emap|Emap Consumer Media]] in early 2008. Published in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Empire'' organises the annual [[Empire Awards]] which were sponsored by [[Sony Ericsson]], and from 2009 sponsored by [[Jameson Irish Whiskey|Jameson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/awards2009/|title=Jameson Empire Awards 2009 website |website=Empireonline.com|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are voted for by readers of the magazine.

==Regular features==
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:empire1st.jpg|thumb|left|The first edition of Empire, July 1989]] --&gt;
''Empire'' reviews both mainstream films and [[art film]]s, but feature articles concentrate on the former.

As well as film news, previews, and reviews, ''Empire'' has some other regular features. Each issue (with the exception of issues 108–113) features a ''Classic Scene'', a transcript from a notable film scene. The first such classic scene to be featured was the "I could have been a contender" scene from ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.

The regular ''Top 10'' feature lists ''Empire''{{-'}}s choice of the top ten examples of something film-related. For example, ''10 Best Chase Scenes'' or ''10 Best Movie Gags in [[The Simpsons]]''.

The ''Re.View'' section covers Blu-ray and DVD news and releases. ''Kim Newman's Movie Dungeon'' is a regular feature in the ''Re.View'' section, in which critic [[Kim Newman]] reviews the most obscure releases, mostly low budget horror movies.

''How Much Is A Pint Of Milk?'' presents celebrities' answers to silly or unusual questions, including the question "How much is a pint of milk?" This is intended as a guide to the chosen celebrity's contact with reality, and as such can be more informative than a direct interview by reporting some surprising responses.

Each magazine includes a "Spine Quote", in which a relatively challenging quote is printed on the spine of the magazine. There are usually some obvious and obscure links from the quote to the main features of that month's edition. Readers are invited to identify the film source and the links to win a prize.

''My Movie Mastermind'' is another regular in which a celebrity is given questions about the films they were in or they directed. Celebrities range from [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Christopher Lee]] (who are at the top of the scoreboard) to [[John Carpenter]] and [[Michael Keaton]] (who are at the bottom of the scoreboard).

===The Empire Masterpiece===
A regular feature since issue 167, the Empire Masterpiece is a two-page essay on a film selected by Empire in the ''Re.View'' section. The selection of the films seem to be quite random and follow no specific pattern. Only a few issues since the first masterpiece feature have not featured one – 169, 179, 196, 197, 198 and 246. Issue 240 had director [[Frank Darabont]] select 223 masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Empire|issue=240|author=Darabont, Frank|authorlink=Frank Darabont|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/frank-darabonts-favourite-movies/|title=Frank Darabont's Greatest Movies Of All Time|date=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' was featured twice, once in issue 191 and again in issue 303.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5059">The '''Gazetteer of Australia''' is an index or dictionary of the location and spelling of geographical names across [[Australia]]. Geographic names include towns, suburbs and roads, plus geographical features such as hills, rivers, and lakes.

The index is compiled by the [[Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping]] (ICSM) from determinations made by state, territory, and [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] agencies. 

The authorities that work on geographic names in Australia are as follows:

'''Google News Archive''' is an extension of [[Google News]] providing free access to scanned [[archives]] of newspapers and links to other [[newspaper]] archives on the web, both free and paid.

Some of the news archives date back to 1700s. There is a timeline view available, to select news from various years.

==History==
The archive went live on June 6, 2006, after Google acquired  [[PaperofRecord.com]], originally created by [[Robert J. Huggins]] and his team at Cold North Wind, Inc. The acquisition was not publicly announced by Cold North Wind until 2008.

While the service initially provided a simple index of other web pages, on September 8, 2008, Google News began to offer indexed content from scanned newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Bringing history online, one newspaper at a time|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/bringing-history-online-one-newspaper.html |quote=Today, we're launching an initiative to make more old newspapers accessible and searchable online by partnering with newspaper publishers to digitize millions of pages of news archives.|publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The depth of chronological coverage varies. Since 2008, the entire content of ''[[The New York Times]]'' back to its founding in 1851 has been available.

Newspapers were thought to have escaped copyright obligations of news articles because of Google's method of publishing the archives as searchable image files of the actual newspaper pages, rather than as pure text of articles.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 2011, Google announced that it would no longer add content to the archive project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Google Ending Newspaper Archiving Project |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2385664,00.asp |quote=According to the Boston Phoenix, a paper that has been archived through the project, Google sent participants an email on Thursday informing them of its plans. Google told the paper it will shift its focus to "newer projects that help the industry, such as Google One Pass, a platform that enables publishers to sell content and subscriptions directly from their own sites." |newspaper=[[PC Magazine]] |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-20 |first=Leslie |last=Horn}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 2011, without notice, Google made the News Archives home page unavailable. Apparently, the service merged with [[Google News]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netforlawyers.com/content/google-news-archive-search-integrated-news-search-advanced-search-0032 "Google Integrates News Archive Search Into Current News Search, Weakens Archive Search"]. ''Internet for Lawyers''&lt;/ref&gt; Carly Carlioi, an editor at the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'', speculated that Google discontinued the project because they found it harder than expected, for newspapers were more difficult to index than books because of layout complexities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Atlantic]] |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/05/google-shuts-down-newspaper-archive-project/239239/ |title=Google Shuts Down Newspaper Archive Project |author=Jared Keller |date=May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause might have been that the project attracted a lesser audience than expected.

While archived newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers|title=Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are still available for browsing, keyword searching is not fully functional. On December 16, 2013, Google News employee [[Stacie Chan]] wrote in the [[Google Product Forums]] that Google News is "performing a much needed facelift on our News Archive search function", and that access to archived stories would be limited for several months while "this new system" is being built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stacie |last=C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Google News Archive update|url=https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/news/Gl23RwnTIlg/aAGakhzIe_cJ |publisher=[[Google Product Forums]] |date=December 16, 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reaffirmed on May 22 and July 30, 2014, when Chan wrote that Google is still "working on the archives to provide a better user experience",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stacie |last=C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Google News Archive Search update...|url=https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/news/d_ZWZCTSWfc/RFjemwjUIqwJ |publisher=[[Google Product Forums]] |date=May 22, 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "it's in the works",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stacie |last=C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Google News Archive Search update...|url=https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!searchin/news/archive$20timeline/news/LrLLBZ-jjFA/8Ox4-Kwt7LEJ |publisher=[[Google Product Forums]] |date=August 10, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again on December 18, 2014, when Chan wrote that Google "is currently working on creating a better experience on the Newspaper Archives that should be available in the near future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stacie |last=C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Google News Archive Search update...|url=https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/news/Fw2caKy67LM/YZHQD_37kT4J |publisher=[[Google Product Forums]] |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=2015-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some papers formerly included in the News Archive have been removed because of copyright issues. For instance, the archives of the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' disappeared on August 16, 2016, due to a contract between the paper's owner, the [[Gannett Company]], and [[NewsBank, inc.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanmilwaukee.com/2016/08/19/journal-sentinel-archive-disappears/|title=Journal Sentinel Archive Disappears|last=Takach|first=Michail|publisher=Urban Milwaukee|date=August 19, 2016|accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the archives were eventually restored.

'''Hut 6''' was a wartime section of the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]],  [[UK|Britain]], tasked with the solution of German Army and Air Force [[Enigma machine]] cyphers. [[Hut 8]], by contrast, attacked Naval Enigma. Hut 6 was established at the initiative of [[Gordon Welchman]], and was run initially by Welchman and fellow [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] mathematician [[John R.F. Jeffreys|John Jeffreys]].

Welchman's deputy, [[Stuart Milner-Barry]], succeeded Welchman as head of Hut 6 in September 1943, at which point over 450 people were working in the section.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;Ralph Erskine, ''Barry, Sir (Philip) Stuart Milner- (1906–1995)'', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hut 6 was partnered with [[Hut 3]], which handled the translation and intelligence analysis of the raw decrypts provided by Hut 6.

==Location==
Hut 6 was originally named after the building in which the section was located. Welchman says the hut was 20&amp;nbsp;yards (18m) long by 10&amp;nbsp;yards (9m) wide, with two large rooms at the far end – and no toilets. Staff had to go to another building. Irene Young recalled that she "worked in Room 82, though in typical Bletchley fashion there were not eighty-one rooms preceding it". She was glad to move from the Decoding Room "where all the operators were constantly having nervous breakdowns on account of the pace of work and the appalling noise" to the Registration Room which arranged intercepts according to callsign and frequency &lt;ref&gt;Young (1990) p 74&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of personnel increased, the section moved to additional buildings around Bletchley Park, but its name was retained, with each new location also being known as 'Hut 6'. The original building was then renamed 'Hut 16'.

==Personnel==
[[John R.F. Jeffreys|John Jeffreys]] was initially in charge of the Hut with [[Gordon Welchman]] until May 1940; Jeffreys was diagnosed ill in 1940, and died in 1944. Welchman became official head of section until autumn 1943, subsequently rising to Assistant Director of Mechanisation at Bletchley Park. [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], was a member February 1940 – March 1941 before moving to become head of [[Hut 8]]. [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] joined early 1940 and was in charge from autumn 1943 to the end of the war.

One codebreaker concerned with [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma]], [[John Herivel]], discovered what was soon dubbed the '''Herivel tip''' or '''Herivelismus'''. For a brief but critical few months from May 1940, the "tip", in conjunction with operating shortcomings or "[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|cillies]]", were the main techniques used to solve Enigma. The "tip" was an insight into the habits of the German machine operators allowing Hut 6 to easily deduce part of the daily [[key (cryptography)|key]].

In 1942, Welchman recruited  fellow [[Marlborough Collegers]], [[Bob Roseveare]] and Nigel Forward. Roseveare started in the ''Watch''  working on Luftwaffe messages before moving to the ''Quatch'', a small backroom group that decoded non-current messages.

In Hut 6 were the Machine Room, plus the Decoding Room and Registration Room with mainly female staff under Harold Fletcher, a school and university friend of Gordon Welchman.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (2011), p 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welchman (1982) p 103-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 one of these female staff, [[Mair Russell-Jones]], published a posthumous memoir of her work there.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Turner, [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mair-russell-jones-headhunted-bletchley-7509061 "Bletchley Park uncovered: The secret life of the Welsh World War II codebreaker"], Wales Online, July 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims of a ''coup'' attempt by Communists released pent-up communal hatreds; these were fanned by the [[Indonesian Army]], which quickly blamed the PKI. Communists were purged from political, social, and military life, and the PKI itself was disbanded and banned. The massacres began in October 1965, in the weeks following the ''coup'' attempt, and reached their peak over the remainder of the year before subsiding in the early months of 1966. They started in the capital, [[Jakarta]], and spread to [[Central Java|Central]] and [[East Java]], and later [[Bali]]. Thousands of local [[vigilante]]s and army units killed actual and alleged PKI members. Killings occurred across the country, with the worst in the PKI strongholds of Central Java, East Java, Bali, and northern [[Sumatra]]. It is possible that over one million people were imprisoned at one time or another.

Sukarno's balancing act of "[[Nasakom]]" ([[nationalism]], [[religion]] and [[communism]]) had unravelled. His most significant pillar of support, the PKI, was effectively eliminated by the other two pillars—the army and [[Islamism|political Islam]]; and the army was on the way to unchallenged power. In March 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his remaining power by Indonesia's provisional Parliament, and Suharto was named [[Acting Presidency of Suharto|Acting President]]. In March 1968, Suharto was formally elected president.

The killings are skipped over in most Indonesian history textbooks, and have received little introspection by Indonesians, due to their suppression under the Suharto regime. The search for satisfactory explanations for the scale and frenzy of the violence has challenged scholars from all ideological perspectives. The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the "New Order" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system. Vigilance and [[social stigma|stigma]] against a perceived communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's doctrine, and it is still in force even today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Varagur |first=Krithika |date=23 October 2017 |title=Indonesia Revives Its Communist Ghosts |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-23/indonesian-military-stirs-communist-fears-for-political-advantage |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |access-date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Suharto at funeral.jpg|thumb|right|Major General [[Suharto]] (''at right, foreground'') attends a funeral for generals assassinated on 5 October 1965]]
Support for [[Sukarno]]'s presidency under his "[[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy]]" depended on his forced and unstable "[[Nasakom]]" coalition between the military, religious groups, and communists. The rise in influence and increasing militancy of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI), and Sukarno's support for it, was a serious concern for [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslims]] and the military, and tension grew steadily in the early and mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1994), pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt; The third-largest communist party in the world,&lt;ref&gt;cf with Weiner (2007) p.259&lt;/ref&gt; the PKI had approximately 300,000 [[Leninism#The vanguard party|cadres]] and a full membership of around two million.&lt;ref&gt;Cribb (1990), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The party's assertive efforts to speed up land reform frightened those who controlled the land, and threatened the social position of Muslim clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1994), pp. 17, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Sukarno required government employees to study his Nasakom principles as well as Marxist theory. He had met with [[Zhou Enlai]], Premier of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and after this meeting had decided to create a militia, called a Fifth Force, which he intended to control personally. Sukarno ordered weapons from China to equip this Fifth Force. He declared in a speech that he favoured revolutionary groups whether they were nationalist, religious or communist, stating "I am a friend of the Communists because the Communists are revolutionary people."&lt;ref&gt;President Sukarno, speech on independence day, 17 August 1964&lt;/ref&gt; He said at a [[Non-Aligned Movement]] summit meeting in [[Cairo]] in October 1964 that his current purpose was to drive all of Indonesian politics to the left and thereby to neutralise the "reactionary" elements in the army that could be dangerous for the revolution.&lt;ref name="Andrew John Rotter p.273"&gt;Andrew John Rotter (Edt.), ''Light at the end of the tunnel'', p.273, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publ., 2010 ,{{ISBN|9780742561335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sukarno's international policies increasingly reflected his rhetoric.

As early as 1958, Western powers—in particular the US and the UK—pushed for policies that would encourage the Indonesian Army to act forcefully against the PKI and the Left, which included a covert propaganda campaign designed to damage the reputation of Sukarno and the PKI, and secret assurances along with military and financial support to anti-communist leaders within the army.&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|83}}

== 30 September ==
On the evening of 30 September 1965, a group of militants, known as the [[30 September Movement]], captured and executed six of Indonesia’s top military generals. The movement proclaimed itself as Sukarno’s protectors, issuing a pre-emptive strike to prevent a possible ''[[coup d'état|coup]]'' by the "anti-Sukarno", pro-Western Council of Generals.

After the execution of the generals, the movement’s forces occupied [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]] in [[Jakarta]] and the presidential palace. Shortly afterward, however, President Sukarno refused to commit to the movement, for it had captured and assassinated many of his top generals. As the night continued, the movement’s poor leadership began to show, starting with a series of incoherent radio messages. The movement mainly aimed to occupy the main telecommunications building; however, it ignored the east side of the square, which was the location of ''[[Kostrad]]'', the armed forces strategic reserve. At the time, Major General [[Suharto]] was in control of the reserve, and upon hearing the news of the takeover, he quickly capitalized on the movement’s weaknesses, regaining control of the square without resistance.&lt;ref name="John Roosa 2006 178-179"&gt;{{cite book |author=John Roosa |title=Pretext for Mass Murder: The September 30th Movement and Suharto's Coup D’État in Indonesia |year=2006 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the surrender, the movement’s troops did not take further action. At the same time, the Indonesian military slowly gained influence as Sukarno’s waned, and within days, the government was under the control of Suharto. He immediately deployed troops and dispersed the movement, while trumpeting the movement’s actions as a "danger" to the nation.

A military propaganda campaign to link the ''coup'' attempt with the PKI, masterminded by Suharto and the military, began to sweep the country on 5 October. Graphic images and descriptions of the murdered, tortured, and even castrated generals began to circulate the country. Despite falsified information, the campaign was successful, convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that the murders were a PKI attempt to undermine the Indonesian government under President Sukarno. Though the PKI denied involvement, pent-up tension and hatred that had built up over years were released.&lt;ref name="John Roosa 2006 178-179" /&gt;

Even though the 30 September Movement killed 12 people, Suharto ultimately presented it as a nationwide conspiracy to commit mass murder. Millions of people associated with the PKI, even illiterate peasants from remote villages, were presented as murderers and accomplices of the movement. In early 1966, two Indonesian specialists at [[Cornell University]], [[Benedict Anderson]] and Ruth McVey, observed in their [[Cornell Paper]] that Suharto's army began the anti-communist campaign well after the 30 September Movement had collapsed. Between the moment that the movement ended and the moment that the army's mass arrests began, three weeks had elapsed in which no violence or trace of civil war occurred, even according to the army itself. Sukarno constantly protested the purge, stating that the army was "burning down a house to kill a rat", but he was powerless as Suharto commanded a firm hold on the military.&lt;ref name="John Roosa 2006 22"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder: The September 30th Movement and Suharto's Coup D’État in Indonesia |first= |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |year=2006 |isbn= |location= |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jt7vU-7AhukC&amp;pg=PA81 81] |pages= |author=John Roosa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political purge ==
The army removed top civilian and military leaders it thought sympathetic to the PKI.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1994), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament]] and cabinet were purged of Sukarno loyalists. Leading PKI members were immediately arrested, some [[summary execution|summarily executed]].&lt;ref name="Vicker_157"&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Army leaders organised demonstrations in Jakarta&lt;ref name="Vicker_157" /&gt; during which on 8 October, the PKI Jakarta headquarters was burned down.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 157; Ricklefs (1991), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Communist youth groups were formed, including the army-backed Indonesian Students' Action Front ([[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]]), the Indonesian Youth and Students' Action Front (KAPPI), and the Indonesian University Alumni Action Front (KASI).&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287"&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jakarta and [[West Java]], over 10,000 PKI activists and leaders were arrested, including famed novelist [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]].&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287" /&gt;

The initial deaths occurred during organised clashes between the army and the PKI, including Indonesian armed forces units who were sympathetic to communism and were trying to forcibly resist General Suharto's crackdown. For example, much of the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Police [[Mobile Brigade Corps]] were infiltrated up to commander level by the PKI.&lt;ref name="Vittachi 1967, p. 138"&gt;Vittachi (1967), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In early October, forces of the Strategic Command (Suharto's ''Kostrad''), and the RPKAD paracommandos led by Colonel [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] were sent to Central Java, a region with strong Communist allegiances, while troops of uncertain loyalty were ordered out.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287" /&gt; At the same time, the [[Kodam III/Siliwangi|Siliwangi Division]] was deployed to guard Jakarta and [[West Java]], both of which, unlike Central and East Java, remained relatively immune to the mass killings.&lt;ref&gt;Vittachi (1967), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Early fighting in the Central Java highlands and around [[Madiun]] suggested the PKI might be able to establish a rival regime centred on these regions. However, widespread fears of a civil war, between factions supported by the United States and China respectively, quickly evaporated, as the forces sent by Suharto took control.&lt;ref name="Vittachi 1967, p. 138" /&gt; Many rebel commanders chose not to fight as Suharto-deployed forces arrived, although resistance came from some, like General [[Supardjo]], for a few more weeks.

As the Sukarno presidency began to unravel and Suharto began to assert control following the ''coup'' attempt, the PKI's upper national leadership was hunted and arrested with some summarily executed. In early October, PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had flown to [[Central Java]], where the ''coup'' attempt had been supported by leftist officers in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Salatiga]], and [[Semarang]].&lt;ref name="Vicker_157" /&gt; Fellow senior PKI leader [[Njoto]] was shot around 6 November, Aidit on 22 November, and First Deputy PKI Chairman [[M.H. Lukman]] was killed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Vickers (2005), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

== Massacres ==

The murder campaign became so brazen in parts of rural East Java, that Moslem bands placed the heads of victims on poles and paraded them through villages.

The killings started in October 1965 in Jakarta, spread to Central and East Java and later to Bali, and smaller outbreaks occurred in parts of other islands, including [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 20"&gt;Schwarz (1994), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cribb 1990, p. 3"&gt;Cribb (1990), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The communal tensions and hatreds that had built up were played upon by the Army leadership who characterised Communists as villains, and many Indonesian civilians took part in the killings.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The worst massacres were in Central and East Java&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), page 287; Schwarz (1994), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; where PKI support was at its strongest. The situation varied across the country, and the role of the Army has never been fully explained.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 21"&gt;Schwarz (1994), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas the Army organised, encouraged, trained, and supplied civilian groups and local militias.&lt;ref name="Cribb 1990, p. 3" /&gt; In other areas, communal vigilante action preceded the Army, although in most cases killings did not commence before military units had sanctioned violence by instruction or example.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), pages 158–159; Cribb (1990), pp. 3,21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the earlier stages of the killings that the army's direct involvement in clashes with the PKI occurred.&lt;ref name="Vittachi 1967, p. 138" /&gt; By the end of October, groups of devout Muslims joined the purge of Communists, claiming it was their duty to cleanse Indonesia of atheism.&lt;ref name="Vittachi 1967, p. 138" /&gt;

In some areas, civilian militia knew where to find known Communists and their sympathisers, while in others the Army demanded lists of Communists from village heads.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p.357/&lt;/ref&gt; PKI membership was not disguised and most suspects were easily identified within communities.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald (1980), page 52&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Embassy of the United States, Jakarta|US Embassy]] in Jakarta supplied the Indonesian military with lists of up to 5,000 suspected Communists.&lt;ref name="Kadane" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="CIA lists"&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 157; Friend (2003), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlexBellamy" /&gt; Although some PKI branches organised resistance and reprisal killings, most went passively to their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald (1980), p. 53; Friend (2003), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all victims were PKI members. Often the label "PKI" was used to include anyone to the left of the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI).&lt;ref name="Vickers_158"&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases victims were suspected or simply alleged Communists &lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287" /&gt; or were victims of grievance settling with little or no political motive.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1991, p. 288" /&gt; Anti-Communist killings were then instigated with youths, assisted by the Army.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287_299"&gt;Ricklefs (1991), pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the victims were not major political figures, and were largely among the poor and lower-middle class such as farmers, plantation laborers, factory workers, students, teachers, artists and civil servants. They were often targeted because they or someone they knew, such as a friend or family member, had joined the PKI or affiliated organizations.&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|122}}

With very few exceptions, the killings were not spontaneous but carried out with a high degree of organization. Most of the victims were also detainees of the Indonesian Army, making the killings [[summary execution]]s.&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|123}} The killings were done 'face to face' as in [[Rwandan genocide|Rwanda]] or [[Cambodian genocide|Cambodia]], unlike the mechanical methods of killing used by [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;Tom Allard Herald, [http://www.smh.com.au/world/indonesia-unwilling-to-tackle-legacy-of-massacres-20090612-c63h.html Indonesia unwilling to tackle legacy of massacres], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 13 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|123}} The methods of non-mechanised violence and killing included shooting, dismembering alive, stabbing, disembowelling, castration, impaling, strangling and beheading with Japanese-style [[Katana|samurai swords]].&lt;ref name="Blumenthal80" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovell |first=Julia |date=15 March 2018 |title=The Killing Season; The Army and the Indonesian Genocide reviews – the truth about one of the 20th century's worst massacres |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/15/killing-season-geoffrey-robinson-army-indonesian-genocide-jess-melvinreviews |work=The Guardian |access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tim Hannigan 2015 263"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tim Hannigan |title=A Brief History of Indonesia: Sultans, Spices, and Tsunamis: The Incredible Story of Southeast Asia's Largest Nation |year=2015 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abGHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA 263]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firearms and automatic weapons were used on a limited scale, with most of the killings being carried out with knives, sickles, machetes, swords, ice picks, bamboo spears, iron rods and other makeshift weapons.&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Islamic extremists often paraded severed heads on spikes.&lt;ref name="Oliver Stone, Peter Kuznick 2012 350"&gt;{{cite book |author=Oliver Stone, Peter Kuznick |title=The Untold History of the United States |year=2012 |publisher=Gallery Books |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbLrjA7zbMQC&amp;pg=PA350 350]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corpses were often thrown into rivers, and at one point officials complained to the Army that the rivers running into the city of [[Surabaya]] were clogged with bodies. In areas such as [[Kediri Regency|Kediri]] in East Java, Nahdlatul Ulama youth wing ([[Ansor Youth Movement]]) members lined up Communists, cut their throats and disposed of the bodies in rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 158; Schwarz (1994), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Rows of severed penises were often left behind as a reminder to the rest.&lt;ref name="Gerard DeGroot 2008 389"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerard DeGroot |title=The Sixties Unplugged: A Kaleidoscopic History of a Disorderly Decade |year=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Aa8qAIhxIO4C&amp;pg=PA389 389]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings left whole sections of villages empty, and the houses of victims or the interned were looted and often handed over to the military.&lt;ref name="Vickers_158" /&gt;

Local Chinese were killed in some areas, and their properties looted and burned as a result of anti-Chinese racism, on the excuse that [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit|D.N. Aidit]] had brought the PKI closer to China.&lt;ref name="Vickers_158" /&gt; In the predominantly Christian islands of [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Nusa Tenggara]], Christian clergy and teachers suffered at the hands of Muslim youth.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 21" /&gt;

Although there were occasional and isolated flare-ups until 1969, the killings largely subsided by March 1966,&lt;ref&gt;Cribb (1990), p. 3; Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; McDonald (1980), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; when either there were no more suspects, or authorities intervened.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 53"&gt;McDonald (1980), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Solo residents said that exceptionally high flooding in March 1966 of the [[Solo River]], considered mystical by the Javanese, signalled the end of the killings.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 53" /&gt;

=== Java ===
[[File:Certificate of Gratitude for Financial Loan for the Elimination of PKI, Sleman (dated 09-1969).jpg|thumb|A certificate of gratitude from the Regent of [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]] for financial donations to the elimination of the PKI]]
In [[Java]], much of the killing was along ''aliran'' (cultural stream) loyalties; the Army encouraged ''[[santri]]'' (more devout and orthodox Muslims) among the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to seek out PKI members among the ''[[abangan]]'' (less orthodox) Javanese.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1991, p. 288" /&gt; Conflict that had broken out in 1963, between the Muslim party [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] (NU) and the PKI, turned to killing in the second week of October.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_287" /&gt; The Muslim group [[Muhammadiyah]] proclaimed in early November 1965 that the extermination of "Gestapu/PKI" constituted Holy War ("Gestapu" being the military's name for the "30 September Movement"), a position that was supported by other Islamic groups in Java and Sumatra. For many youths, killing Communists became a religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Schwarz (1994), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Where there had been Communist centres in Central and East Java, Muslim groups portraying themselves as victims of Communist aggression justified the killings by evoking the [[Madiun Affair]] of 1948.&lt;ref name="Vickers_158" /&gt; [[Roman Catholicism in Indonesia|Roman Catholic]] students in the [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta region]] left their hostels at night to join in the execution of truckloads of arrested Communists.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 53" /&gt;

Although, for most of the country, the killings subsided in the first months of 1966, in parts of East Java the killings went on for years. In [[Blitar]], guerrilla action was maintained by surviving PKI members until they were defeated in 1967 and 1968.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, p. 159" /&gt; The mystic Mbah Suro, along with devotees of his Communist-infused traditional mysticism, built an army, but Suro and eighty of his followers were killed in a war of resistance against the Indonesian Army.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, p. 159"&gt;Vickers (2005), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bali ===
Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, the island of [[Bali]] saw conflict between supporters of the traditional [[Balinese caste system]], and those rejecting these traditional values, particularly the PKI. Communists were publicly accused of working towards the destruction of the island's culture, religion, and character, and the Balinese, like the Javanese, were urged to destroy the PKI. Government jobs, funds, business advantage and other spoils of office had gone to the Communists during the final years of Sukarno's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes over land and tenants' rights led to land seizures and killings when the PKI promoted "unilateral action".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 358; Robinson (1995), pp. 299–302.&lt;/ref&gt; As Indonesia's only Hindu-majority island, Bali did not have the Islamic forces involved in Java, and it was upper-caste PNI landlords who instigated the elimination of PKI members.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1991, p. 288"&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; High Hindu priests called for sacrifices to satisfy spirits angered by past sacrilege and social disruption.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 53" /&gt; Balinese Hindu leader [[Ida Bagus Oka]] told Hindus: "There can be no doubt [that] the enemies of our revolution are also the cruelest enemies of religion, and must be eliminated and destroyed down to the roots."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (1995), pp. 299–302.&lt;/ref&gt; Like parts of East Java, Bali experienced a state of near-[[civil war]] as Communists regrouped.&lt;ref name="Vickers_158" /&gt;

The balance of power was shifted in favour of anti-Communists in December 1965, when personnel from both the Army Para-commando Regiment and 5th Brawijaya Military Region units arrived in Bali after having carried out killings in Java. Led by Suharto's principal troubleshooter, Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, Javanese military commanders permitted Balinese squads to kill until reined in.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 359; Vickers (2005), p. 158; Vittachi (1967), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Central Java where the Army encouraged people to kill the "Gestapu", Bali's eagerness to kill was so great and spontaneous that, having initially provided logistic support, the Army eventually had to step in to prevent chaos.&lt;ref name="Friend 2003, p. 113"&gt;Friend (2003), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Sukarno's choice of Bali's provincial governor, Sutedja, was recalled from office and accused of preparing a communist uprising, and his relatives were tracked down and killed.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 358; Robinson (1995), pp. 299–302; Vittachi (1967), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; A series of killings similar to those in Central and East Java were led by black-shirted PNI youth. For several months, militia death squads went through villages capturing suspects and taking them away.&lt;ref name="Vickers_158" /&gt; Hundreds of houses belonging to communists and their relatives were burnt down within one week of the reprisal crusade, with occupants being butchered as they ran from their homes. An early estimate suggested that 50,000 people, including women and children, were killed in this operation alone. The population of several Balinese villages were halved in the last months of 1965.&lt;ref name="Vittachi 1967, p. 143"&gt;Vittachi (1967), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; All the [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] shops in the towns of [[Singaraja]] and [[Denpasar]] were destroyed and their owners killed after summary stand-up judgements found them to have financially supported the "Gestapu".&lt;ref name="Vittachi 1967, p. 143" /&gt; Between December 1965 and early 1966, an estimated 80,000 Balinese were killed, roughly five&amp;nbsp;percent of the island's population at the time, and proportionally more than anywhere else in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Friend (2003), p. 111; Taylor (2003), p. 358; Vickers (2005), p. 159; Robinson (1995), p. ch. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other islands ===
PKI-organised movements and campaigns against foreign businesses in [[Sumatra]]'s plantations provoked quick reprisals against Communists, following the coup attempt. In [[Aceh]], as many as 40,000 were killed, part of the possibly 200,000 deaths across Sumatra.&lt;ref name="Vicker_157" /&gt; The regional revolts of the late 1950s complicated events in Sumatra as many former rebels were forced to affiliate themselves with Communist organisations to prove their loyalty to the Indonesian Republic. The quelling of the 1950s revolts and 1965 killings were seen by most Sumatrans as a "Javanese occupation".&lt;ref name="Vicker_157" /&gt; In [[Lampung]], another factor in the killings seems to have been [[Transmigration program|Javanese immigration]].&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 21" /&gt; In [[West Kalimantan]], approximately 18 months after the killings in Java, indigenous pagan [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] expelled 45,000 ethnic Chinese from rural areas, killing up to 5,000.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 21" /&gt; The Chinese refused to fight back, since they considered themselves "a guest on other people's land" with the intention of trading only.&lt;ref name="John Braithwaite 2010 294"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OrdM8X7CBTAC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=In+1967,+Dayaks+had+expelled+Chinese+from+the+interior+of+West+Kalimantan.+In+this+Chinese+ethnic+cleansing,+Dayaks+were+coopted+by+the+military+who+wanted+to+remove+those+Chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201967%2C%20Dayaks%20had%20expelled%20Chinese%20from%20the%20interior%20of%20West%20Kalimantan.%20In%20this%20Chinese%20ethnic%20cleansing%2C%20Dayaks%20were%20coopted%20by%20the%20military%20who%20wanted%20to%20remove%20those%20Chinese&amp;f=false |title=Anomie and violence: non-truth and reconciliation in Indonesian peacebuilding |author=John Braithwaite |edition= |volume= |series= |year=2010 |location= |publisher=ANU E Press |language= |isbn=1-921666-22-6 |page=294 |pages= |accessdate=15 December 2011 |quote=In 1967, Dayaks had expelled Chinese from the interior of West Kalimantan. In this Chinese ethnic cleansing, Dayaks were co-opted by the military who wanted to remove those Chinese from the interior who they believed were supporting communists. The most certain way to accomplish this was to drive all Chinese out of the interior of West Kalimantan. Perhaps 2000–5000 people were massacred (Davidson 2002:158) and probably a greater number died from the conditions in overcrowded refugee camps, including 1500 Chinese children aged between one and eight who died of starvation in Pontianak camps (p. 173). The Chinese retreated permanently to the major towns...the Chinese in West Kalimantan rarely resisted (though they had in nineteenth-century conflict with the Dutch, and in 1914). Instead, they fled. One old Chinese man who fled to Pontianak in 1967 said that the Chinese did not even consider or discuss striking back at Dayaks as an option. This was because they were imbued with a philosophy of being a guest on other people's land to become a great trading diaspora.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EUDii8kvQYAC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=In+October+1967,+the+military,+with+the+help+of+the+former+Dayak+Governor+Oevaang+Oeray+and+his+Lasykar+Pangsuma+(Pangsuma+Militia)+instigated+and+facilitated+a+Dayak-led+slaughter+of+ethnic+Chinese.+Over+the+next+three+months#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20October%201967%2C%20the%20military%2C%20with%20the%20help%20of%20the%20former%20Dayak%20Governor%20Oevaang%20Oeray%20and%20his%20Lasykar%20Pangsuma%20(Pangsuma%20Militia)%20instigated%20and%20facilitated%20a%20Dayak-led%20slaughter%20of%20ethnic%20Chinese.%20Over%20the%20next%20three%20months&amp;f=false |title=Conflict, violence, and displacement in indonesia |author=Eva-Lotta E.

In Sumatra, youths massacred Javanese plantation labourers who made up the membership of the PKI in the province of North Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rRFo1zVGfl0C&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=abangan+bali+killed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwB2oVChMI7dqLnbOOxwIViRk-Ch0tdgxH#v=onepage&amp;q=abangan%20bali%20killed&amp;f=false Blank 1993], p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians|targeting of ethnic Chinese]] played an important role in the killings in Sumatra and Kalimantan, which have been called [[genocide]]. [[Charles Coppel|Charles A. Coppel]] is sharply critical of this characterisation, in which he sees a western media and academics unwilling to face the consequences of an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] agenda that they endorsed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UFNKQcvGNSAC&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Coppel 2008], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; instead scapegoating Indonesian racism and indulging in extravagant and false claims of hundreds of thousands or millions of Chinese killed.&lt;ref name="Coppel 2008"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UFNKQcvGNSAC&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Coppel 2008], p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Coppel wrote of the distorted coverage in an article titled: "A genocide that never was: explaining the myth of anti-Chinese massacres in Indonesia, 1965–66". Coppel sees the same bias in coverage of the [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|May 1998 riots]], where the Volunteer Team for Humanity noted non-Chinese looters made up the majority of those who were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UFNKQcvGNSAC&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Coppel 2008], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis continues to inspire debate.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin, Jess (2013), [http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jsaa/article/viewFile/708/706Why Not Genocide? Anti-Chinese Violence in Aceh, 1965–1966], in: ''[[Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs]]'', 32, 3, 63–91. {{ISSN|1868-4882}} (online), {{ISSN|1868-1034}} (print)&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimate is that around 2,000 Chinese Indonesians were killed (out of a total estimated death toll of between 400,000 and 3 million people), with documented massacres taking place in [[Makassar]] and [[Medan]] and on the island of [[Lombok]].{{sfn|Tan|2008|pp=240–242}} Robert Cribb and Charles A. Coppel noted that "relatively few" Chinese were actually killed during the purge while the majority of the dead were native Indonesians.{{sfn|Cribb|Coppel|2009}} The death toll of Chinese was in the thousands while the death toll of native Indonesians was in the hundreds of thousands. [[Balinese people|Balinese]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] made up the majority of people who were massacred.&lt;ref name="Coppel 2008" /&gt;

Indigenous, non-Muslim, pagan [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] expelled 45,000 ethnic Chinese from rural areas, killing 2,000–5,000.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 21"&gt;Schwarz (1994), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese refused to fight back, since they considered themselves "a guest on other people's land" with the intention of trading only.&lt;ref name="John Braithwaite 2010 294" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUDii8kvQYAC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Conflict, violence, and displacement in indonesia |author=Eva-Lotta E.

== Deaths and imprisonment ==
Although the general outline of events is known, much is unknown about the killings,&lt;ref name="Cribb 1990, p. 3" /&gt; and an accurate and verified count of the dead is unlikely to ever be known.&lt;ref&gt;Cribb (1990), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; There were few Western journalists or academics in Indonesia at the time, the military was one of the few sources of information, travel was difficult and dangerous, and the regime that approved and oversaw the killings remained in power for three decades.&lt;ref&gt;Cribb (1990), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian media at the time had been undermined by restrictions under "Guided Democracy" and by the "New Order's" takeover in October 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Crouch|Crouch]] (1978), pp. 65–66; Oey Hong Lee (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; With the killings occurring at the height of Western fears over [[Communism]] during the [[Cold War]], there was little investigation internationally, which would have risked complicating the West's preference for Suharto and the "New Order" over the PKI and the "Old Order".&lt;ref&gt;Cribb (1990), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first 20 years following the killings, 39 serious estimates of the death toll were attempted.&lt;ref name="Friend 2003, p. 113" /&gt; Before the killings had finished, the Indonesian army estimated 78,500 had been killed,&lt;ref&gt;Crouch (1978), cited in Cribb (1990). p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; while the PKI put the figure at 2 million.&lt;ref name="Friend 2003, p. 113" /&gt; The Indonesian army later{{when|date=April 2015}} estimated the number killed to be 1 million.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, p. 159" /&gt; In 1966, [[Benedict Anderson]] had set the death toll at 200,000. By 1985 he concluded that a total of 500,000 to 1 million people had been killed.&lt;ref name="Friend 2003, p. 113" /&gt; Most scholars now agree that at least half a million were killed,&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Friend (2003), p. 113; Vickers (2005), p. 159; {{cite journal |title=Unresolved Problems in the Indonesian Killings of 1965–1966 |author=Robert Cribb |journal=Asian Survey |volume=42 |issue=4 |year=2002 |pages=550–563 |doi=10.1525/as.2002.42.4.550}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus more than in any other event in Indonesian history.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1991, p. 288" /&gt; An armed forces security command{{which|date=April 2015}} estimate from December 1976 put the number at between 450,000 and 500,000.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 53" /&gt;

Arrests and imprisonment continued for ten years after the purge.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1991, p. 288" /&gt; A 1977 [[Amnesty International]] report suggested "about one million" PKI cadres and others identified or suspected of party involvement were detained.&lt;ref name="Friend 2003, p. 113" /&gt; Between 1981 and 1990, the Indonesian government estimated that there were between 1.6 and 1.8 million former prisoners "at large" in society.&lt;ref&gt;Friend (2003), pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that in the mid 1970s, 100,000 were still imprisoned without trial.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Vickers (2005), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that as many as 1.5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), pp. 159–60; Weiner (2007), p. 262; Friend (2003), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Those PKI members not killed or imprisoned went into hiding while others tried to hide their past.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1991, p. 288" /&gt; Those arrested included leading politicians, artists and writers such as [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]], and peasants and soldiers. Those incarcerated in the vast network of prisons and [[concentration camps]] faced "extraordinarily inhumane conditions."&lt;ref name="Blumenthal80" /&gt; Many did not survive this first period of detention, dying from malnutrition and beatings.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, p. 159" /&gt; As people revealed the names of underground Communists, often under [[torture]], the numbers imprisoned rose from 1966–68. Methods of torture included severe beatings with makeshift materials like electric cable and large pieces of wood, breaking fingers and crushing toes and feet under the legs of tables and chairs, pulling out fingernails, electric shocks, and burning with molten rubber or cigarettes. Detainees were sometimes forced to watch or listen to the torture of others, including relatives such as spouses or children. Both men and women were subjected to sexual violence while in detention, including rape and electric shocks to the genitals.&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|215–216}} Those released were often placed under [[house arrest]], had to regularly report to the military, or were banned from Government employment, as were their children.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2005, p. 159" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
=== Impact ===
Sukarno's balancing act of "Nasakom" (nationalism, religion, communism) had been unravelled. His most significant pillar of support, the PKI, had been effectively eliminated by the other two pillars—the army and political Islam; and the army was on the way to unchallenged power.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (1994), pp. 20, 22; Ricklefs (1991), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Muslims were no longer trusting of Sukarno, and by early 1966, Suharto began to openly defy Sukarno, a policy which had previously been avoided by army leaders. Sukarno attempted to cling to power and mitigate the new-found influence of the army, although he could not bring himself to blame the PKI for the coup as demanded by Suharto.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 22"&gt;Schwarz (1994), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to the rank of Lieutenant General.&lt;ref name="NYT_22FEB1966"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sukarno Removes His Defense Chief |work=The New York Times |date=22 February 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supersemar]] decree of 11 March 1966 transferred much of Sukarno's power over the parliament and army to Suharto,&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (2005), page 160&lt;/ref&gt; ostensibly allowing Suharto to do whatever was needed to restore order. On 12 March 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his remaining power by Indonesia's provisional Parliament, and Suharto named [[Acting Presidency of Suharto|Acting President]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (1994), page 2&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 1968, the [[People's Consultative Assembly|Provisional People's Consultative Assembly]] formally elected Suharto as president.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs (1991), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundred or thousand Indonesian leftists travelling abroad were unable to return to their homeland.{{sfn|Hill|2008|p=2}} [[Djawoto]], the ambassador to China, refused to be recalled and spent the rest of his life outside of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="EoJ"&gt;Encyclopedia of Jakarta. ''[http://www.jakarta.go.id/eng/encyclopedia/detail/410 Djawoto]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these exiles, writers by trade, continued writing. This [[Indonesian exile literature]] was full of hatred for the new government and written simply, for general consumption, but necessarily published internationally.{{sfn|Alham|2002|pp=93–94}}

In December 1965, the US embassy in Jakarta had sent a telegram to [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] stating that without the uprising, "removal of foreign oil companies would have been a certainty." In late 1968, the National Intelligence Estimate for Indonesia reported: "An essential part of the Suharto government's economic program ... has been to welcome foreign capital back to Indonesia. Already about 25 American and European firms have recovered control of mines, estates, and other enterprises nationalized under Sukarno. Liberal legislation has been enacted to attract new private foreign investment. ... There is substantial foreign investment in relatively untapped resources of nickel, copper, bauxite, and timber. The most promising industry ... is oil."&lt;ref name="Oliver Stone, Peter Kuznick 2012 352" /&gt;

The killings served as a direct precedent for the [[East Timor genocide|genocidal]] [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]] of [[East Timor]]. The same generals oversaw the killing in both situations, and encouraged equally brutal methods—with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, Kai (August/December 2012). "[http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&amp;context=gsp Foreshadowing Future Slaughter: From the Indonesian Killings of 1965–1966 to the 1974–1999 Genocide in East Timor]". ''Genocide Studies and Prevention'' Vol. 7, No. 2/3, pp. 204–222. "There were many parallels between the two mass killings committed by the New Order: the involvement of the same clique of generals; allegations of Communism; targeting of Chinese; gender and sexual violence; tactics like pagar betis and the delegation of violence to non-state actors; and a violent rhetoric of extermination, often couched in biological and genetic terms. Another common factor is that there has been no prosecution of the perpetrators in either case."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global reaction ===
To Western governments, the killings and purges were seen as a victory over Communism at the height of the [[Cold War]]. Western governments and much of the West's media preferred Suharto and the "New Order" to the PKI and the increasingly leftist "Old Order".&lt;ref&gt;Cribb (1990), p. 5; Schwarz (1994), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The British ambassador, [[Andrew Gilchrist]], wrote to London: "I never concealed from you my belief that a little shooting in Indonesia would be an essential preliminary to effective change."&lt;ref name="David Edwards 1998 142"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Edwards |title=The Compassionate Revolution: Radical Politics and Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFqNmPewRcwC |year=1998 |publisher=Green Books Ltd |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the massacre was carefully controlled by Western intelligence agencies. Journalists, prevented from entering Indonesia, relied on the official statements from Western embassies. The British embassy in Jakarta advised intelligence headquarters in Singapore on how the news should be presented: "Suitable [[propaganda]] themes might be: PKI brutality in murdering Generals, ... PKI subverting Indonesia as agents of foreign Communists. ... British participation should be carefully concealed."&lt;ref name="Gerard DeGroot 2008 390"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerard DeGroot |title=The Sixties Unplugged: A Kaleidoscopic History of a Disorderly Decade |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aa8qAIhxIO4C |year=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A headline in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' read: "Indonesia: Hope... where there was once none".&lt;ref&gt;''US News and World Report'', 6 June 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]] commented in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "With 500,000 to 1 million Communist sympathizers knocked off, I think it is safe to assume a reorientation has taken place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Raymont |first1=Henry |title=Holt Says U.S. Actions Protect All Non-Red Asia |work=The New York Times |date=6 July 1966 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|177}} The right-wing oilman [[H.

A ''New York Times'' journalist wrote an article titled "When a Nation Runs Amok" explaining that the killings were hardly surprising since they occurred in "violent Asia, where life is cheap."&lt;ref name="John Roosa 2006 27"&gt;{{cite book |author=John Roosa |title=Pretext for Mass Murder: The September 30th Movement and Suharto's Coup D’État in Indonesia |year=2006 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jt7vU-7AhukC&amp;pg=PA27 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recalling the attitudes of US government officials regarding the killings, State Department intelligence officer Howard Federspiel said that "no one cared, as long as they were Communists, that they were being butchered."&lt;ref&gt;Brad Simpson (Winter 2013).

Vol. 67, No. 2, pp. 10-13. Published by: [[University of California Press]]. Retrieved 9 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was one of the only prominent individuals to condemn the massacres. In January 1966 he said: "We have spoken out against the inhuman slaughters perpetrated by the Nazis and the Communists. But will we speak out also against the inhuman slaughter in Indonesia, where over 100,000 alleged Communists have not been perpetrators, but victims?"&lt;ref name="Bellamy"&gt;Bellamy, Alex J.

[[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s [[Andrei Sakharov]] called the killings a 'tragic event' and described it as "an extreme case of reaction, racism and militarism", but otherwise the Soviet response was relatively muted.&lt;ref name="Bellamy" /&gt; This was likely in response to the PKI siding with China in the [[Sino-Soviet split]].&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Other Communist states issued strong criticism of the killings. The Chinese government stated they were "heinous and diabolical crimes ... unprecedented in history."&lt;ref name="Bellamy" /&gt; China also offered refuge to Indonesian Leftists fleeing the violence.&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|185}} One Yugoslav diplomat commented that "even assuming the guilt of the politburo [PKI leadership], which I do not, does this justify genocide? Kill the Central Committee, but do not kill 100,000 people who do not know and had no part in it [the 30 September Plot]."&lt;ref name="Bellamy" /&gt; The Suharto government was condemned as a "military fascist regime" by the government of [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name="Bellamy" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] avoided commenting on the killings. When Suharto returned Indonesia to the UN, [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist Albania]] was the only member state to protest.&lt;ref name="Bellamy" /&gt;

There is now clear evidence that in the crucial six months after the alleged coup, Western powers encouraged the army to move forcefully against the Left, facilitated widespread violence including mass killings, and helped to consolidate the political power of the army, In doing so, they helped to bring about the political and physical destruction of the PKI and its affiliates, the removal of Sukarno and his closest associates from political power, their replacement by an army elite led by General Suharto, and a seismic shift in Indonesia's foreign policy towards the West and the capitalist model it advanced."&lt;ref name="Robinson2018" /&gt;{{rp|177}}}}

Of all countries, Swedish arms supplies seem to have been the most substantial.

Discussion of the killings was heavily tabooed in Indonesia and, if mentioned at all, usually called ''peristiwa enam lima'', the incident of '65.&lt;ref name=Zurbuchen2002&gt;Zurbuchen, Mary S.

Jailed and exiled members of the Sukarno regime, as well as ordinary people, told their stories in increasing numbers. Foreign researchers felt more empowered to publish on the topic, with the end of intimidation by the military regime.&lt;ref name=Zurbuchen2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadowplay"&gt;Friend (2003), p. 115; {{cite video |people=Chris Hilton (writer and director) |title=Shadowplay |medium=Television documentary |work=Vagabond Films and Hilton Cordell Productions |year=2001}}; Vickers (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supardjo#The Supardjo Document|Supardjo Document]] is a copy of the personal notes of [[Supardjo|General Supardjo]] regarding the 30 September Movement. It is one of the few primary sources of this event and gives insight into the movement from a military perspective, including Supardjo's opinion on what may have caused the movement to fail.

Satisfactory explanations for the scale and frenzy of the violence have challenged scholars from all ideological perspectives. One view attributes the communal hatreds behind the killings to the forcing of parliamentary democracy onto Indonesian society, claiming that such changes were culturally unsuitable and unnecessarily disruptive in the post-independence 1950s. A contrasting view is that when Sukarno and the military replaced the democratic process with authoritarianism, competing interests—i.e., the army, political Islam, and Communism—could not be openly debated, rather they were suppressed and could only be expressed through violence.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 22" /&gt; Conflict resolution methods have broken down, and Muslim groups and the military adopted an "us or them attitude", and that when the killings were over, many Indonesians dismissed as something the Communists had deserved.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 22" /&gt; The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the "New Order" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system.&lt;ref name="Schwarz 1994, p. 21" /&gt; Vigilance against a Communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's three-decade presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Friend (2003), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although largely unknown in the West compared to the [[Vietnam War]] and various [[United States involvement in regime change in Latin America|right-wing coups in Latin America]], the massacres and Suharto's rise to power are considered by historians to be a major turning point in the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic2017" /&gt; The massacres were also crucial to the expansion of [[capitalism]] in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farid |first=Hilmar |year=2005 |title=Indonesia’s original sin: mass killings and capitalist expansion, 1965–66 |journal=[[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=3–16 |doi=10.1080/1462394042000326879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given US foreign policy goals of stopping the spread of communism and bringing nations into its sphere of influence, the bloody purge which decimated the PKI, the third largest Communist party in the world at the time, was considered a huge victory. Historian John Roosa, after viewing declassified documents released in 2017, notes that much "of the U.S. foreign policy establishment viewed it as a great victory that they were able to sort of ‘flip’ Indonesia very quickly." He also asserts that the US did not simply "stand by" and allow the killings to happen, stating "it's easy for American commentators to fall into that approach, but the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI."&lt;ref name="Atlantic2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bevins |first=Vincent |date=20 October 2017 |title=What the United States Did in Indonesia |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/the-indonesia-documents-and-the-us-agenda/543534/ |work=The Atlantic |access-date=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Suharto’s regime, the media was heavily influenced and censored to show a ‘certain’ history of the 1965 incident: a history which purely and undoubtedly blamed the PKI for this political tragedy. However, in recent articles such as by ‘The Jakarta Post’, a more in-depth and complex story is recognized by the media offering conflicting views on who the blame should really fall on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pressreader.com/indonesia/the-jakarta-post/20150930/281672548754398/TextView |title=PressReader.com – Connecting People Through News |website=''pressreader.com'' |access-date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film supporting the New Order's version of events, ''[[Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI]]'' (''Betrayal of Indonesia Communist Party'') was broadcast annually on the government television station [[TVRI]] every 30 September. This version was the only one allowed in open discourse in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYk3kQLoJiMC |title=State Terrorism and Political Identity in Indonesia: Fatally Belonging |isbn=978-0-415-37152-0 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |author1=Heryanto |author-link=Ariel Heryanto |first1=Ariel |ref=harv |year=2006 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Suharto's removal from power, many people, including those involved, told other versions of the events in various books and films. One, the documentary film ''[[The Act of Killing]]'', included interviews with individuals who had participated in the mass killings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koran-jakarta.com/?856-sisi |title=Sisi Kelam Negara Indonesia |date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its companion piece ''[[The Look of Silence]]'' follows one grieving family trying to understand why it happened and exposes how those behind the Indonesian massacres still revel in their crimes 50 years on, including boasting on camera how they dismembered, eviscerated, castrated and beheaded alleged communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/07/joshua-oppenheimer-the-look-of-silence-interview-indonesia |title=Joshua Oppenheimer: why I returned to Indonesia’s killing fields |date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Atkinson (16 July 2015).

Retrieved 16 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'', based around events leading up to the killings, internationally released in 1982, was banned in Indonesia until 1999.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

=== Books and novels ===
The killings inspired many novelists to write their own rendition of the event, either on a more local, socio-cultural level, or on a national, political level. Books that were written in Indonesia during the time of the New Order often faced censorship of certain concepts, while books written and published abroad were banned from the country.

John Roosa's ''Pretext for Mass Murder'' traces a historical path through the 1965 event, painting a scenario of explanations for what preceded, caused and followed the coup. It focuses on several aspects of the coup such as the incoherence of facts and the incompetence of coup organizers to provide four main interpretations of the coup:(1) the movement as an attempted coup d’etat by the PKI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder |author1=John Roosa |pages=62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) the movement as a mutiny of junior officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder |author1=John Roosa |pages=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3) the movement as an alliance of army officers and the PKI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder |author1=John Roosa |pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (4) the movement as a frame-up of the PKI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder |author1=John Roosa |pages=75–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also looks at material previously left unexplored in traditional discussions of the incident to give a reconstruction of the chaos that surrounds this period of time in Indonesian history.

[[Ahmad Tohari]]'s trilogy novel ''The Dancer'' (Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk) depicts a village community caught in a revolution, giving readers a perspective less acknowledged in the more popular account of the massacres. By having its two main characters, Srintil and Rasus, on opposite ends of the revolution, the novel sketches not only the circumstances that could have drawn the greater rural public into communist practices, but also the mindset of the people who were tasked with carrying out the killings. As the novel was published in 1981, certain aspects were censored by the New Order, but all the same, the trilogy provides valuable insight into the grass-root level of the anti-communist coup and the tragedies that followed.

{{bquote|''The nights at the beginning of the dry season of 1966 were very cold, and there was widespread anxiety amongst the people. Wild dogs roamed the area, savage, aroused by the smell of blood and corpses that had not been buried properly. The southeasterly breeze carried the smell of rotting carrion. The stillness of the nights was broken by the sounds of the heavy footfalls of boots and the occasional reports of gunshots''.| Ahmad Tohari in his novel ''The Dancer'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dancer |author1=Ahmad Tohari |pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Eka Kurniawan]]'s ''Beauty is a Wound'' (2002) weaves history into satire, tragedy and the supernatural to depict the state of the nation before, during and after 1965. There is less focus on the military aspect of the coup, but a good deal of focus on the communists themselves through the form of interpersonal relationships and communist ghosts who could not find peace. Without meaning to, perhaps, the novel also gives readers a glimpse of the economy of Indonesia at the time using the example of a flourishing prostitute business and a temporary swimsuit business, among others. Kurniawan projects his feelings about the revolution and coup by constructing a story of theatrical characters around it and delivers a history of the nation all the way from Dutch occupation to Suharto.

[[Louise Doughty]] ''Black Water'' (2016) deals with the 1965 event by exploring them from a European viewpoint. Shifting between California and Indonesia as settings for the novel, the book is written from the perspective of a single man working as an operative for an international company. The novel focuses more on foreign reactions to the coup rather than the coup itself, especially from the foreign journalist community.

Chiu worked as an independent [[curator]] for several years at the beginning of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alumni High Achievers|url = http://www.westernsydney.edu.au/alumni/alumni_success_stories/alumni_high_achievers|website = www.westernsydney.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-11-07|first = Western Sydney University|last = Melissa Chiu}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1993-1996, she joined the University of Western Sydney Collection at the [[University of Western Sydney]] as a curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art Insight #6: Profile of Melissa Chiu|url = http://brand.hyundai.com/en/art/interview/art-insight-melissa-chiu.do|website = brand.hyundai.com|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996, Chiu collaborated with a group of [[Asian Australian]] artists, performers, filmmakers and writers to establish Gallery 4A, a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] contemporary art center devoted to promoting dialogue in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. Chiu was founding Director of Gallery 4A,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/chronicler-of-the-asianaustralian-experience-20090929-gazd.html?skin=text-only |title=Chronicler of the Asian-Australian experience |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; later renamed the 4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ARTAND, Melissa Chiu to lead Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|url = http://www.artandaustralia.com/news//melissa-chiu-to-lead-hirshhorn-museum-and-sculpture-garden|website = www.artandaustralia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Location One, Melissa Chiu talks with Richard Bell|url = http://www.location1.org/melissa-chiu-richard-bell/|website = www.location1.org|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 she was the curator during the Center's transition to a two-story city owned heritage building in [[Chinatown, Sydney|Sydney’s Chinatown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=smh&amp;kw=Melissa+Chiu&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=10years&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=news001027_0051_4653 |title=Gallery reincarnated with more space and just the right chi |publisher=smh.com.au - The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2000-10-27 |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiu was appointed Asia Society's Museum Director in 2004 after serving as the curator of contemporary Asian and Asian American art—the first curatorial post of its kind in an American museum. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} She initiated a number of initiatives at the Asia Society Museum, including the launch of a contemporary art collection to complement the museum's Rockefeller Collection of traditional Asian art.&lt;ref name="officers" /&gt;

Chiu has curated over thirty international exhibitions mainly focused on the art and artists of [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="bigthink" /&gt; Her major curatorial credits include ''Zhang Huan: Altered States'' (2006)&lt;ref name="artzinechina.com" /&gt; and ''Art and China's Revolution'' (2008)&lt;ref name="artzinechina.com" /&gt; with Zheng Shengtian, one of the first historical appraisals of Chinese art from the 1950s through 1970s and ''Nobody's Fool: Yoshitomo Nara'' (2010) with Miwako Tezuka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Upcoming Events Past Events |url=http://asiasociety.org/calendars/yoshitomo-nara-nobodys-fool |title=Yoshitomo Nara: Nobody's Fool &amp;#124; New York |publisher=Asia Society |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded a Getty Curatorial Research Fellowship in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artlog.com/people/15607-melissa-chiu |title=Artlog |publisher=Artlog |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314135547/http://artlog.com/people/15607-melissa-chiu |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hirshhorn Museum ===
Following her 2014 appointment as the first non-American to head the Hirshhorn, Chiu announced the hiring of New York-based Gianni Jetzer as curator-at-large.&lt;ref name="an.jetzer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/people/gianni-jetzer-to-be-hirshhorn-museums-curator-at-large-149729|title=Gianni Jetzer to Be Hirshhorn Museum's Curator at Large |publisher=Artnet.com |date=2014-10-30 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.gala"/&gt; Jetzer was allowed to maintain his position as a curator for [[Art Basel]], despite the appearance of a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="wcp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/visual-arts/2015/08/10/strike-two-for-melissa-chiu/ |title=Strike Two for Melissa Chiu? |publisher=Washingtoncitypaper.com |date=2014-08-10 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Chiu announced that the museum's 40th anniversary celebration would be held at [[4 World Trade Center]] in New York.&lt;ref name="nytimes.gala"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/arts/design/the-washington-hostess-who-nurtured-warhol.html?_r=0 |title=The Washington Hostess Who Nurtured Warhol
 |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Kennicott]], art and architecture critic of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', commented that the decision was "deeply troubling and raises concern about where Chiu is taking the organization".&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style-blog/wp/2015/08/07/new-director-of-hirshhorn-snubs-dc-to-hold-40th-anniversary-gala-in-new-york/ |title=New director of Hirshhorn snubs D.C. to hold 40th-anniversary gala in New York |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy of her decision to move the location of the 40th anniversary to New York from D.C. led to a concern of "missing out on the chance to cultivate critical donors"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/13047181/new-hirshhorn-chief-melissa-chiu-explains-why-new-york-matters|title="If we hadn't been part of the Smithsonian, we would've gone the way of the Corcoran.": Melissa Chiu takes over the Hirshhorn?.|date=18 September 2015|work=Washington City Paper|last1=Capps|first1=Kriston|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1229">The '''Naranjal mine''' (more commonly known as El Naranjal) is the name of a legendary [[Lost mines|lost gold mine]] in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Mountains]] of [[Mexico]].  Folklorist [[J. Frank Dobie]] devoted part of his book "Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver" to the story of this legendary lost mine.

The mine was supposedly located at the bottom of a [[canyon]], beside a river and an abandoned [[hacienda]]. Surrounding the site were groves of [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], hence the name El Naranjal, which means the orange grove in Spanish. Alternately, some legends point to orange-colored gold [[ore]] from the mine as a source of the name.

Unlike other lost or legendary mines in this area, there is little hard evidence it ever existed, and may be purely a [[legend]], taken from garbled accounts of the far more popular legendary lost mines of [[Tayopa]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2016}}
A '''one-hit wonder''' is any entity that achieves mainstream popularity, often for only one piece of work, and becomes known among the general public solely for that momentary success. The term is most commonly used in regard to [[musician|music performer]]s with only one top-40 [[hit single]] that overshadows their other work. Sometimes, artists dubbed "one-hit wonders" in a particular country have had great success in other countries.

==Music industry==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
In ''The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders,'' music journalist Wayne Jancik defines a one-hit wonder as "an act that has won a position on [the] national, pop, Top 40 [[record chart]] just once."

This formal definition can{{when|date=January 2018}} include acts with greater success outside their lone pop hit and who are not typically considered one-hit wonders, while at the same time excluding acts who have multiple hits which have been overshadowed by one [[signature song]], or those performers who never actually hit the top 40, but had exactly one song achieve mainstream popularity in some other fashion (that is, a "[[turntable hit]]" or a song that was ineligible for the top-40 charts).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} One-hit wonders are usually exclusive to a specific market, either a country or a genre; a performer may be a one-hit wonder in one such arena, but have multiple hits (or no hits) in another.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===VH1's list of "10 greatest one-hit wonders"===
In 2002, the American cable network [[VH1]] aired a countdown of the VH1's 100 Greatest One-hit Wonders, hosted by [[William Shatner]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} It listed musicians with only one American hit, regardless of international success. 

The top ten consisted of:

#"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]" – [[Los Del Rio]] (1996)
#"[[Tainted Love]]" – [[Soft Cell]] (1982)
#"[[Come on Eileen]]" – [[Dexys Midnight Runners]] (1982)
#"[[I'm Too Sexy]]" – [[Right Said Fred]] (1991)
#"[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]" – [[Toni Basil]] (1982)
#"[[Who Let the Dogs Out?]]" – [[Baha Men]] (2000)
#"[[Ice Ice Baby]]" – [[Vanilla Ice]] (1990)
#"[[Eye of the Tiger]]” - [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]] (1982) 
#"[[Rico Suave (song)|Rico Suave]]" – [[Gerardo Mejía|Gerardo]] (1990)
#"[[99 Luftballons]]" – [[Nena (band)|Nena]] (1984)

===Channel 4's "50 Greatest One Hit Wonders"===
A 2006 television poll, conducted by [[Channel 4]] in the UK, asked viewers to select their favourite one-hit wonder from a shortlist of 60. Respondents could also vote by e-mail to select a song that was not on the original list, if they so wished. The top 10 were: {{cn|date=November 2017}}

#"[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" – [[Carl Douglas]]
#"[[99 Luftballons|99 Red Balloons]]" – [[Nena (band)|Nena]]
#"[[Sugar, Sugar]]" – [[The Archies]]
#"[[Can You Dig It (song)|Can You Dig It?]]" – [[The Mock Turtles]]
#"[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]" – [[Monty Python]]
#"[[Spirit in the Sky]]" – [[Norman Greenbaum]]
#"[[Who Let the Dogs Out?]]" – [[Baha Men]]
#"[[The Safety Dance]]" – [[Men Without Hats]]
#"[[Take on Me]]" - [[A-ha]]
#"[[Splodgenessabounds|Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please]]" – [[Splodgenessabounds]]

==="20 to 1: One Hit Wonders"===
In 2006, the Australian series ''[[20 to 1]]'' aired the episode ''20 to 1: One Hit Wonders'', a list of songs that had been the only one by that artist to have success in Australia.

===C4's ''UChoose40'': One Hit Wonders===
In September 2006, [[New Zealand]]'s terrestrial music channel, [[C4 (New Zealand)|C4]], aired an episode dedicated to "One Hit Wonders" on the weekly theme-based chart show, ''UChoose40'', where the chart was ranked entirely by viewer's votes from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onehittwonders.blogspot.com/|title=One Hit Wonders|first=|last=Life|date=14 November 2009|website=onehittwonders.blogspot.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212232305/http://onehittwonders.blogspot.com/|archivedate=12 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&amp;id=42379 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407200017/http://www.australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&amp;id=42379 |archivedate=7 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top ten ranking are as follows:

# "[[Teenage Dirtbag]]" – [[Wheatus]] (2000)
# "[[How Bizarre (song)|How Bizarre]]" – [[OMC (band)|OMC]] (1996)
# "[[Because I Got High]]" – [[Afroman]] (2001)

# "[[I Touch Myself]]" – [[Divinyls]] (1991)

===Classical music one-hit wonders===
{{unsourced section|reason=Much of this is very obviously OR. These are composers who are famous NOW for only one or a few pieces, but that's not the same as having been one-hit wonders during their own lives. Most of the time (this is OR, mind you) it's quite the opposite -- the pieces that artists are remembered for are not the ones that were popular initially. This section needs sources, or it should be removed.|date=April 2017}}

[[Deutsche Grammophon]] and [[Vox Records]] have both released albums of classical one-hit wonders. Many of the works on the CDs are from composers who have two or more works that are popular in classical music circles, but have a single work that has become popular outside these circles. The two CDs differ, but the works common to both are:

# [[Johann Pachelbel]] – [[Canon in D]]
# [[Samuel Barber]] – [[Adagio for Strings]]
# attrib. [[Tomaso Albinoni]] – [[Adagio in G minor]] (this was actually written by [[Remo Giazotto]] and contains no Albinoni material)
# [[Jean-Joseph Mouret]] – ''[[Fanfare-Rondeau]]'' from Symphonies and Fanfares for the King's Supper (theme to ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece]]'', formerly ''Masterpiece Theatre'')
# [[Luigi Boccherini]] – minuet from [[String Quintet in E major, Op. 11, No. 5 (Boccherini)|String Quintet in E]]
# [[Jeremiah Clarke]] – "Trumpet Voluntary", more properly known as "[[Prince of Denmark's March]]"
# [[Jules Massenet]] – Meditation from his opera ''[[Thaïs (opera)|Thaïs]]''
# [[Pietro Mascagni]] – "[[Cavalleria rusticana]]"
# [[Léo Delibes]] – "[[The Flower Duet]]" from the opera ''[[Lakmé]]''
# [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]] – "[[Caucasian Sketches]]"
# [[Amilcare Ponchielli]] – "[[Dance of the Hours]]" from the opera ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]''
# [[Charles-Marie Widor]] – Toccata from [[Symphony for Organ No. 5 (Widor)|Symphony for Organ No. 5]]
# [[Aram Khachaturian]] – "[[Sabre Dance]]" from the ballet ''[[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]]''
# [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]] – [[Te Deum (Charpentier)|Te Deum]]
# [[Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska]] – [[Maiden's Prayer]]

Other examples of classical one-hit wonders are [[Vittorio Monti]]'s [[Csárdás (Monti)|Csárdás]], [[Enrico Toselli]]'s ''Serenata 'Rimpianto' Op.6 No.1'', popularly known as "Toselli's Serenade", and [[Jean Paul Egide Martini]]'s [[Plaisir d'Amour]].

==Outside of music==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
The term ''one-hit wonder'' is occasionally applied to other media.
&lt;!-- without a source, its OR/BS: 
The term ''one-hit wonder'' is often applied to either highly potent specific varieties of substances, such as certain strains of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] that require only one "hit" (a single inhalation of smoke), or a "hit" of [[LSD]] (a single dose), to achieve the desired [[psychoactive]] effects, or a person with a significantly low tolerance to such drugs that it only takes a single "hit" to achieve desired effects. --&gt;

===In sport===
In the sports world, there are several athletes known to casual sports fans for one event in their careers. Examples include [[Paul Henderson]], a Canadian [[ice hockey]] player who scored the deciding goal in the [[1972 Summit Series]]; [[Mike Jones (linebacker)|Mike Jones]], an American football player who tackled [[Kevin Dyson]] at the one-yard line on [[Final play of Super Bowl XXXIV|the final play]] of [[Super Bowl XXXIV]]; [[David Tyree]], a [[wide receiver]] who became famous for a [[Helmet Catch|helmet-assisted catch]] during the waning moments of [[Super Bowl XLII]]; [[Timmy Smith]] and [[Mark Rypien]], both [[Washington Redskins]] stars that ended up out of football shortly after winning Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]] and [[Super Bowl XXVI|XXVI]] respectively; [[Armando Galarraga]], a pitcher who is primarily known for [[Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game|one near-perfect game]] he played in June 2010. [[NASCAR]] driver [[Derrike Cope]], who won the [[1990 Daytona 500|1990]] [[Daytona 500]] in a surprise victory after [[Dale Earnhardt]] blew a tire on the last lap (though he later won a second [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] race that season at [[Dover International Speedway]]); [[Buster Douglas]], who was the first boxer to ever knock [[Mike Tyson]] out; and [[Jimmy Glass]], a [[Goalkeeper (association football)| goalkeeper]], who is remembered for scoring a goal in the last seconds of the final day of [[1998-99 in  football|1998–99]] [[Football League Third Division|English Third Division]] that kept [[Carlisle United F.C.|his club]] in [[English Football League|The Football League]]. His subsequently released biography was titled ''One-Hit Wonder''.

Some athletes have become remembered for a single mistake in their careers as opposed to a triumphant moment. Notable examples of such athletes include [[Buffalo Bills]] [[placekicker]] [[Scott Norwood]], who is infamous for [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|a missed 47-yard field goal]] that cost his team the [[Super Bowl XXV|Super Bowl]]; [[Bill Buckner]], who at the [[1986 World Series]] made a fielding error in which a baseball rolled through his legs; [[Steve Smith (ice hockey, born in Scotland)|Steve Smith]], who scored an own goal near the end of the third period in game 7 of the 1986 [[Stanley Cup]] Quarter Finals causing the [[Edmonton Oilers]] to lose to the [[Calgary Flames]]; and [[Jim Marshall (gridiron football)|Jim Marshall]], who, as part of the [[Minnesota Vikings]], ran 66 yards (mistakenly into his own end zone) and scored a safety for the [[San Francisco 49ers]].

In tennis, the term "one-slam wonder" can be referred towards players who have either won only one Grand Slam singles title during his or her career, or players who have currently only won one Grand Slam singles title but have the potential to win even more in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/news?slug=ycn-8096728|title=Tennis News, Photos, Stats, Scores, Schedule &amp; Videos|author=|date=|website=Yahoo Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Roddick]] is said to have enjoyed a successful tennis career, despite winning only one Grand Slam singles title – the [[2003 US Open (tennis)|2003 US Open]] – in his entire career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topnews.in/sports/tennis-star-roddick-confident-wiping-out-one-slam-wonder-tag-28854|title=Tennis star Roddick confident of wiping out "one-slam wonder" tag – TopNews|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other players who won only one Grand Slam singles title in their entire career include [[Carlos Moyá]], [[Petr Korda]], [[Gastón Gaudio]], [[Thomas Johansson]], [[Albert Costa]], [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]], [[Anastasia Myskina]], [[Yannick Noah]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]], [[Jana Novotná]], [[Andrés Gómez]], [[Conchita Martinez]] and [[Michael Chang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/tennis/players/ch/m/michael-chang.aspx|title=Players|work=ATP World Tour|accessdate=29 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511122556/http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Ch/M/Michael-Chang.aspx|archivedate=11 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[cup of coffee]]" is used to describe a baseball or ice hockey player who has only a short stint (i.e., long enough to drink a cup of coffee and not do much else) in [[Major League Baseball]] or the [[National Hockey League]] respectively and then spend the rest of their careers in the [[minor league]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2812">'''''Our Society, Your Life''''' is a 2007 policy statement for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]],&lt;ref name="Kelly2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Richard|title=Conservatism under Cameron: The new 'Third Way'|journal=Politics Review|date=February 2008|page=30|volume=17|issue=3|publisher=Philip Allan Updates}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched shortly after [[David Cameron]] became [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leader of the party]] – then [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|in Opposition]] – in 2005, following [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|a leadership election]] in that year.

It has been seen by some, such as Richard Kelly (head of politics at [[Manchester Grammar School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Richard|title=Richard Kelly: From Burke to burkhas – why it's time for Tory multiculturalism|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2013/12/richard-kelly-from-burke-to-burkhas-why-its-time-for-tory-multiculturalism.html|accessdate=8 March 2016|work=[[ConservativeHome]]|date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as a [[triangulation]] of Conservative ideology with that of [[New Labour]], and linking into the idea of the [[Third Way]]. Kelly says New Labour "sought to reconcile ... the embedded ideals of Labour with the effects of [[Thatcherism]]". Kelly also says that ''Our Society, Your Life'' "echoed [[Tony Blair|[Tony] Blair]]'s rejection of the Thatcherite view that there is 'no such thing' as society":&lt;ref name="Kelly2008" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the big idea on which we'll build our plan for government ... is [[social responsibility]]. The idea that there is such a thing as society, it's just not the same thing as the state. Social responsibility means that every time we see a problem, we don't just ask what government can do. We ask what people can do, what society can do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cameron|first1=David|authorlink1=David Cameron|title=DAVID CAMERON: WE WANT A BRITAIN OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY AND INDIVIDUAL OPPORTUNITY – OUR SOCIETY, YOUR LIFE|url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/files/totting_speech.pdf|website=[[ConservativeHome]]|page=2|format=PDF document}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead Cameron supported what Kelly describes as the [[Burkean]] "little platoons": the network of families, churches and voluntary organisations which supposedly bind a society together.&lt;ref name="Kelly2008" /&gt;

The '''Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures''' (Paradisec) is a cross-institutional project that supports work on endangered languages and cultures of the Pacific and the region around Australia. They digitise reel-to-reel field tapes, have a mass data store and use international standards for metadata description. Paradisec is part of the worldwide community of language archives (Delaman and the Open Language Archives Community). Paradisec's main motivation is to ensure that unique recordings of small languages are themselves preserved for the future, and that researchers consider the future accessibility to their materials from other researchers, community members, or anyone who has an interest in such materials.

==Vanishing Voices==
As the number of small languages in the world is reduced by many factors (urbanization, colonial policies, the speakers' desire to learn languages which give access to resources), the tapes which may be their only record become increasingly more valuable. Too many of these recordings are held in poor conditions and are not described in a public catalog. PARADISEC provides the infrastructure to deposit and locate these recordings.

==Archive==
The collection currently contains roughly 7,800 hours of archived audio materials representing more than 1,100 languages from around 100 countries. This is supplemented by significant numbers of images, videos and text objects. Altogether, the archive contains some 33.5 terabytes of data in more than 163,021 individual files (correct at September 2017).

The database of archived materials can be freely searched via the Open Languages Archives Community. Direct access to archived recordings requires registration and sometimes needs permission as specified by the depositor.

==File Types==
For the secure archival of audio files complete with metadata headers, PARADISEC uses the Quadriga system, developed by Cube-Tec, which conforms to the [[Broadcast Wave Format|BWF]] specifications of the European Broadcast Union (EBU). BWF files are archived with a digitally sealed 'header' comprising metadata exported from the Paradisec catalog. This sealed header also acts as a security device and prevents the archived BWF from any unauthorised edits, thus preserving the audio signal for posterity. It is also standard practice to produce smaller, more easily transported [[mp3]] copies of each BWF, for the purpose of access. These too, are archived with the master BWF copies.

==Digitisation==
A large part of the project is the digitisation of valuable analogue recordings of languages and cultures from the Pacific region that will otherwise deteriorate and become unreadable. Researchers whose materials are represented in these collections include [[Arthur Capell]], [[Stephen Wurm]], Clemens Voorhoeve and [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]]. These recordings may be stored on a variety of formats, but are mainly cassette tapes and reel-to-reel tapes.

Analogue recordings are digitised at the highest possible fidelity to ensure high-quality digital files result. The current international archive standard for [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio files is 24-bit resolution and a sample rate of 96&amp;nbsp;kHz. PARADISEC employs a standard  of 24-bit resolution and 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sample rate to ensure highest practicable fidelity digital copies are produced.

==Affiliations==
Paradisec is funded by a consortium of four Australian universities, including the Universities of [[Usyd|Sydney]] and [[Unimelb|Melbourne]] and the [[Australian National University]], as well as the Australian Research Council and Grangenet. Paradisec's main office and primary ingestion stations are located at the University of Sydney in the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]], and a secondary office, comprising further ingestion stations, is situated at the University of Melbourne. The archive is currently headed by Linda Barwick and [[Nicholas Thieberger]].

==Other information==
*Paradisec is actively involved in training and supporting language workers and regularly provides recording equipment and advice to researchers and students undertaking fieldwork. They have held a number of field recording and sustainable data workshops and conferences, in the interests of ensuring recordings are made with archival in mind.
*Paradisec is a  to digitise endangered ethnographic recordings.

[[File:Francesco Primaticcio 002.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''Odysseus and Penelope'' by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1563)]]
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', '''Penelope''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|l|ə|p|iː}} {{respell|pə|NEL|ə-pee}}; {{lang-el|Πηνελόπεια}}, ''Pēnelópeia'', or {{lang-el|Πηνελόπη}}, ''Pēnelópē'') is the wife of [[Odysseus]], who is known for her fidelity to Odysseus while he was absent, despite having many [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]]. Her name has therefore been traditionally associated with marital fidelity.

==Etymology==
The origin of her name is believed by [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] to be [[Pre-Greek]] and related to ''pēnelops'' (πηνέλοψ)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] | title = Etymological Dictionary of Greek | publisher = Brill | year = 2009 | page = 1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''pēnelōps'' (πηνέλωψ), [[gloss (annotation)|glossed]] by [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] as "some kind of bird"&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%93%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF543%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B9/%CE%A0 Γλῶσσαι].&lt;/ref&gt; (today arbitrarily identified with the [[Eurasian wigeon]], to which [[Linnaeus]] gave the binomial ''Anas penelope''), where ''-elōps'' (-έλωψ) is a common Pre-Greek suffix for predatory animals;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Pape-1880/A/%CF%87%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CE%BB%E1%BD%BD%CF%80%CE%B7%CE%BE Zeno.org lemma] relating πηνέλωψ (gen. πηνέλοπος) and [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%93%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B9/%CE%A7 &lt;χην(ά)λοπες&gt;· ὄρνεα (predators) ποιά. ὅπερ ἔνιοι &lt;χηναλώπεκες&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the semantic relation between the proper name and the gloss is not clear. In [[folk etymology]], ''Pēnelopē'' (Πηνελόπη) is usually understood to combine the Greek word ''pēnē'' (πήνη), "[[weft]]", and ''ōps'' (ὤψ), "face", which is considered the most appropriate for a cunning weaver whose motivation is hard to decipher.&lt;ref&gt;For the mythology of weaving, see [[Weaving (mythology)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the ''Odyssey''==

Penelope is the wife of the main character, the king of [[Ithaca]], [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses in Roman mythology), and daughter of [[Icarius of Sparta]] and his wife [[Periboea]]. She only has one son by Odysseus, [[Telemachus]], who was born just before Odysseus was called to fight in the [[Trojan War]]. She waits twenty years for the final return of her husband,&lt;ref&gt;Odysseus spends ten years in the Trojan War and ten years [[Nostos|travelling home]].&lt;/ref&gt; during which she devises various strategies to delay marrying one of the 108&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Odyssey,'' Book XVI, in ''The Iliad &amp; The Odyssey''. Trans. Samuel Butler. p. 628. {{ISBN|978-1-4351-1043-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]] (led by [[Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]] and including [[Agelaus]], [[Amphinomus]], Ctessippus, [[Demoptolemus]], [[Elatus]], Euryades, [[Eurymachus]] and [[Peisandros]]).

On Odysseus's return, disguised as an old beggar, he finds that Penelope has remained faithful. She has devised tricks to delay her suitors, one of which is to pretend to be weaving a burial shroud for Odysseus's elderly father [[Laertes]] and claiming that she will choose a suitor when she has finished. Every night for three years, she undoes part of the shroud, until [[Melantho]], one of twelve unfaithful serving women, discovers her chicanery and reveals it to the suitors.

Because of her efforts to put off remarriage, Penelope is often seen as a symbol of connubial fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Mackail, ''Penelope in the Odyssey'' (Cambridge University Press, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; But because [[Athena]] wants her "to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore", Penelope does eventually appear before the suitors (xviii.160–162). As Irene de Jong comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As so often, it is Athena who takes the initiative in giving the story a new direction ... Usually the motives of mortal and god coincide, here they do not: Athena wants Penelope to fan the Suitors’ desire for her and (thereby) make her more esteemed by her husband and son; Penelope has no real motive ... she simply feels an unprecedented impulse to meet the men she so loathes ... adding that she might take this opportunity to talk to [[Telemachus]] (which she will indeed do).&lt;ref&gt;Irene de Jong. (2001). ''A Narratological commentary on the Odyssey'', p.&amp;nbsp;445. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-46844-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Antoine Bourdelle - Pénélope 1912 - Montauban.jpg|thumb|left|''Penelope'', bronze by [[Emile-Antoine Bourdelle]]]]
She is ambivalent, variously asking [[Artemis]] to kill her and, apparently, considering marrying one of the suitors. When the disguised Odysseus returns, she announces in her long interview with the disguised hero that whoever can string Odysseus's rigid bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads may have her hand. "For the plot of the ''Odyssey'', of course, her decision is the turning point, the move that makes possible the long-predicted triumph of the returning hero".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Knox]]. (1996). ''Introduction to [[Robert Fagles]]'s translation of '''The Odyssey''''' p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to whether Penelope is aware that Odysseus is behind the disguise.  Penelope and the suitors know that Odysseus (were he in fact present) would easily surpass all in any test of masculine skill, so she may have intentionally started the contest as an opportunity for him to reveal his identity.  On the other hand, because Odysseus seems to be the only person (perhaps excepting Telemachus) who can actually use the bow, she could just be further delaying her marriage to one of the suitors.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

When the contest of the bow begins, none of the suitors are able to string the bow, but Odysseus does, and wins the contest. Having done so, he proceeds to slaughter the suitors—beginning with Antinous whom he finds drinking from Odysseus' cup—with help from Telemachus, Athena and two servants, [[Eumaeus]] the [[swineherd]] and [[Philoetius]] the [[Pastoral farming|cowherd]]. Odysseus has now revealed himself in all his glory (with a little makeover by Athena); yet Penelope cannot believe that her husband has really returned—she fears that it is perhaps some god in disguise, as in the story of [[Alcmene]]—and tests him by ordering her servant [[Euryclea|Eurycleia]] to move the bed in their bridal-chamber. Odysseus protests that this cannot be done since he made the bed himself and knows that one of its legs is a living [[olive tree]]. Penelope finally accepts that he truly is her husband, a moment that highlights their ''homophrosýnē'' (ὁμοφροσύνη, "like-mindedness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Norman|title=Archery at the Dark of the Moon: Poetic Problems in Homer's Odyssey|date=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homer implies, that from then on, Odysseus would live a long and happy life together with Penelope and Telemachus, wisely ruling his kingdom and enjoying wide respect and much success.&lt;ref&gt;Lawall, Thalman, Patterson, James, Spacks. "The Norton Anthology: Western Literature."[[The Odyssey]]". New York, London. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some early sources such as [[Pindar]], Pan's father is [[Apollo]] via Penelope.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Fr. 90 ([[Maurice Bowra|Bowra]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] (2.145), [[Cicero]] (''[[De Natura Deorum|ND]]'' 3.22.56), [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] (7.38) and [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] (''[[Fabulae]]'' 224) all make Hermes and Penelope his parents. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.12.5 records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to her husband, who banished her to Mantineia upon his return. 5th-century AD source ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' by [[Nonnus]] (14.92) names Penelope of [[Mantineia]] in Arcadia Pan's mother. Other sources ([[Duris of Samos]]; the Vergilian commentator [[Servius]]) report that Penelope slept with all 108 suitors in Odysseus' absence, and gave birth to Pan as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QKMNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA305 Footnote in the ''Library'' by Apollodorus (of Athens)], edited by E. Capps Ph.D, LL.D.; T. E. Page, Litt.D.; W. H. D. Rouse, Litt.d.; Webster Collection of Social Anthropology, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan's name (Πάν) with the Greek word for "all" (πᾶν).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Pan]] provides the earliest example of this wordplay, suggesting that Pan's name was born from the fact that he delighted "all" the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Ring Penelope CdM Luynes 515.jpg|thumb|upright|Gold [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] ring, Syria, last quarter of the 5th century BC ([[Louvre Museum]])]]

Penelope is recognizable in Greek and Roman works, from Attic vase-paintings—the Penelope Painter is recognized by his representations of her—to Roman sculpture copying or improvising upon classical Greek models, by her seated pose, by her reflective gesture of leaning her cheek on her hand, and by her protectively crossed knees, reflecting her long chastity in Odysseus' absence, an unusual pose in any other figure.&lt;ref&gt;But compare, for an unusual exception, the seated ''aulos'' player on the "[[Ludovisi Throne]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin tradition==
Latin references to Penelope revolved around the sexual loyalty to her absent husband. It suited the marital aspect of Roman society representing the tranquility of the worthy family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mactoux|first=Marie-Madeleine|title=Pénélope: Légende et Mythe|date=1975|publisher=Annales Litteraires de L'Universite de Basancon|location=Paris|pages=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is mentioned by various classical authors including [[Plautus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Paul|title=Plautus|date=1968|publisher=William Heinemann Ltd|location=London}} She is mentioned in the opening lines of the play Stychus&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Propertius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Propertius|title=Complete Elegies of Propertius|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton and Oxford}}see Elegies 2.6; 2.9 and 3.12. Propertius was one of the few Latin authors to mention Penelope's weaving ruse.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Martial]] and [[Statius]].  The use of Penelope in Latin texts provided a basis for her ongoing use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a representation of the chaste wife. This was reinforced by her being named by [[Saint Jerome]] among pagan women famed for their chastity.

The book was written and published by [[Petar Beron]] in 1824. It is one of the most significant secular works of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. It was the first secular publication in modern Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="penandsword"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pen and the Sword: Studies in Bulgarian history|last1=Clarke|first1=James F.|last2=Hupchick|first2=Dennis P.|publisher=East European Monographs|page=290|year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xxpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=beron+primer&amp;dq=beron+primer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5z6dT6mwKcbm4QTQqvmpDg&amp;redir_esc=y|isbn=0880331496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The primer was a result of the increasing number of secular schools appearing in [[Ottoman Bulgaria]], as well as Beron's own impressions of [[Western education|Western European systems of education]].&lt;ref name="Beron"/&gt; Until the [[late 18th century]], most schools in Bulgaria were attached to [[monasteries]] (so-called "Cell schools") and the curriculum virtually consisted of only a [[Book of Hours]], a [[psalter]] and the [[Bible]]. Students received their education in [[Old Church Slavonic]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], both of which were difficult to understand for those outside the [[clergy]]. Beron was aware that this type of education was inefficient, and modeled his ideas for the new Bulgarian schools along the [[monitorial system]] and education in [[natural sciences]]. The primer was designed as a children's encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="outline"/&gt; It was published in the [[Transylvania]]n city of Kronstadt in the [[Austrian Empire]] (now [[Brașov]], [[Romania]]).&lt;ref name="Beron"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Рибният буквар&amp;nbsp;– дело на Петър Берон, просветителя и реформатора на учебното дело в България|last=Argirova-Gerasimova|first=Mariya|publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The primer consists of ten sections: ''Foreword'', ''Primer'', ''Prayers'', ''Good advice'', ''Smart responses'', ''Fables'', ''Various stories'', ''Physical tales'' and ''Arithmetic''. All sections from ''Primer'' to ''Smart responses'' contain basic knowledge on language, religion and rhetoric; ''Fables'' includes most of [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's eponymous works]], and the remaining sections are a collection of famous events from ancient history, studies on plants and animals and mathematical science. Some of the animals are illustrated in a compendium section. The primer earned its nickname, ''Fish Primer'', since one of these illustrations, a [[whale]], appeared on the back of the original edition.&lt;ref name="penandsword"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Primer with Various Instructions|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/274|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname, however, was erroneous, since whales are [[mammals]], not fish.

The book had an enormous impact on the National Revival and played a key role in laying the foundations of a modern, secular Bulgarian education.&lt;ref name="Beron"/&gt;

A '''scale of one to ten''', or '''scale from one to ten''', is a general and largely vernacular concept used for rating things, people, places, ideas, and so on.&lt;ref name=Wim/&gt;&lt;ref name=HUD/&gt; The scale has [[10]] as a maximum score, as a denotation of exceptionally high quality or of another attribute, usually accompanying [[1]] as its minimum, although some common variants have a minimum of [[0]]. Such a scale is similar in function to other [[rating scale]]s, such as [[Star_(classification)|star ratings]] which are typically out of five.

Ratings below 1 or above 10 are common [[hyperbole]]. The "[[up to eleven]]" idiom is an example of this.

The [[Perfect_10_(gymnastics)|"Perfect 10" score in gymnastics]] is an example of 10 on such a scale being used to indicate perfection.

==Ownership==
The company was founded as SalesHound.com, LLC in March 1999, and was renamed CrossMedia Services, Inc. on July 30, 2001.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}
In 2004, TKG Holdings, in a [[joint venture]] equally owned by [[Gannett Company]], [[Knight Ridder]] (now owned by [[The McClatchy Company]]) and [[Tribune Company]], acquired CrossMedia Services for [[US$]]75 million. The venture investors in Crossmedia Services were Trident Capital, Gabriel Venture Partners and River Cites Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gannett.com/news/pressrelease/2004/pr050604.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306061941/http://www.gannett.com/news/pressrelease/2004/pr050604.htm |archivedate=2008-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, adjustments were made to ownership:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gannett.com/news/pressrelease/2006/pr080106.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228053857/http://www.gannett.com/news/pressrelease/2006/pr080106.htm |archivedate=2008-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gannett Company (42.5%), Tribune Company (42.5%),  The McClatchy Company (15%).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17241">'''Subject indexing''' is the act of describing or [[document classification|classifying]] a [[document]] by [[index term]]s or other symbols in order to indicate what the document is '''[[aboutness|about]],''' to summarize its [[content (media and publishing)|content]] or to increase its [[findability]]. In other words, it is about identifying and describing the '''[[Subject (documents)|subject]]''' of documents. Indexes are constructed, separately, on three distinct levels: terms in a document such as a book; objects in a collection such as a library; and documents (such as books and articles) within a field of knowledge.

Subject indexing is used in [[information retrieval]] especially to create [[bibliographic index]]es to retrieve documents on a particular subject. Examples of academic indexing services are [[Zentralblatt MATH]], [[Chemical Abstracts]] and [[PubMed]]. The index terms were mostly assigned by experts but author keywords are also common.

The process of indexing begins with any analysis of the subject of the document. The indexer must then identify terms which appropriately identify the subject either by extracting words directly from the document or assigning words from a [[controlled vocabulary]].&lt;ref name="Lancaster2003a"&gt;F. W. Lancaster (2003): "Indexing and abstracting in theory and practise". Third edition. London, Facet {{ISBN|1-85604-482-3}}. page 6&lt;/ref&gt; The terms in the index are then presented in a systematic order.

Indexers must decide how many terms to include and how specific the terms should be. Together this gives a depth of indexing.

== Subject analysis ==
The first step in indexing is to decide on the subject matter of the document. In manual indexing, the indexer would consider the subject matter in terms of answer to a set of questions such as "Does the document deal with a specific product, condition or phenomenon?".&lt;ref name="Chowdhury2004"&gt;G.G. Chowdhury (2004): "Introduction to modern information retrieval". Third Edition. London, Facet. {{ISBN|1-85604-480-7}}. page 71&lt;/ref&gt; As the analysis is influenced by the knowledge and experience of the indexer, it follows that two indexers may analyze the content differently and so come up with different index terms. This will impact on the success of retrieval.

=== Automatic vs. manual subject analysis ===
Automatic indexing follows set processes of analyzing frequencies of word patterns and comparing results to other documents in order to assign to subject categories. This requires no understanding of the material being indexed. This therefore leads to more uniform indexing but this is at the expense of the true meaning being interpreted. A computer program will not understand the meaning of statements and may therefore fail to assign some relevant terms or assign incorrectly. Human indexers focus their attention on certain parts of the document such as the title, abstract, summary and conclusions, as analyzing the full text in depth is costly and time consuming &lt;ref name="Lancaster2003b"&gt;F. W. Lancaster (2003): "Indexing and abstracting in theory and practice". Third edition. London, Facet {{ISBN|1-85604-482-3}}. page 24&lt;/ref&gt; An automated system takes away the time limit and allows the entire document to be analyzed, but also has the option to be directed to particular parts of the document.

== Term selection ==
The second stage of indexing involves the translation of the subject analysis into a set of [[keyword (search)|index terms]]. This can involve extracting from the document or assigning from a [[controlled vocabulary]]. With the ability to conduct a [[full text search]] widely available, many people have come to rely on their own expertise in conducting information searches and [[full text search]] has become very popular. Subject indexing and its experts, professional indexers, [[catalogers]], and [[librarians]], remains crucial to information organization and retrieval. These experts understand [[controlled vocabularies]] and are able to find information that cannot be located by [[full text search]]. The cost of expert analysis to create subject indexing is not easily compared to the cost of hardware, software and labor to manufacture a comparable set of full-text, fully searchable materials. With new web applications that allow every user to annotate documents, [[social tagging]] has gained popularity especially in the Web.&lt;ref name="Voss2007"&gt;{{cite conference
|last1=Voss |first1=Jakob
|title=Tagging, Folksonomy &amp; Co - Renaissance of Manual Indexing?
|booktitle=Proceedings of the International Symposium of Information Science
|pages=234–254
|year=2007
|arxiv=cs/0701072
|bibcode=2007cs........1072V
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One application of indexing, the [[Index (publishing)|book index]], remains relatively unchanged despite the information revolution.

=== Extraction/Derived indexing ===
Extraction indexing involves taking words directly from the document. It uses [[natural language]] and lends itself well to automated techniques where word frequencies are calculated and those with a frequency over a pre-determined threshold are used as index terms. A stop-list containing common words (such as "the", "and") would be referred to and such [[stop words]] would be excluded as index terms.

Automated extraction indexing may lead to loss of meaning of terms by indexing single words as opposed to phrases. Although it is possible to extract commonly occurring phrases, it becomes more difficult if key concepts are inconsistently worded in phrases. Automated extraction indexing also has the problem that, even with use of a stop-list to remove common words, some frequent words may not be useful for allowing discrimination between documents. For example, the term glucose is likely to occur frequently in any document related to diabetes. Therefore use of this term would likely return most or all the documents in the database. Post-co-ordinated indexing where terms are combined at the time of searching would reduce this effect but the onus would be on the searcher to link appropriate terms as opposed to the information professional. In addition terms that occur infrequently may be highly significant for example a new drug may be mentioned infrequently but the novelty of the subject makes any reference significant. One method for allowing rarer terms to be included and common words to be excluded by automated techniques would be a relative frequency approach where frequency of a word in a document is compared to frequency in the database as a whole. Therefore a term that occurs more often in a document than might be expected based on the rest of the database could then be used as an index term, and terms that occur equally frequently throughout will be excluded.
Another problem with automated extraction is that it does not recognise when a concept is discussed but is not identified in the text by an indexable keyword.&lt;ref name="Lamb2008"&gt;J. Lamb (2008): ''[http://www.indexers.org.uk/index.php?id=463 Human or computer produced indexes?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604193634/http://indexers.org.uk/index.php?id=463 |date=2014-06-04 }}'' [online] Sheffield, Society of Indexers. Accessed 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assignment indexing ===
An alternative is assignment indexing where index terms are taken from a controlled vocabulary. This has the advantage of controlling for [[synonym]]s as the preferred term is indexed and synonyms or related terms direct the user to the preferred term. This means the user can find articles regardless of the specific term used by the author and saves the user from having to know and check all possible synonyms.&lt;ref name="Tenopir"&gt;C. Tenopir (1999): "Human or automated, indexing is important". ''Library Journal'' '''124'''(18) pages 34-38.&lt;/ref&gt; It also removes any confusion caused by [[homograph]]s by inclusion of a qualifying term. A third advantage is that it allows the linking of related terms whether they are linked by hierarchy or association, e.g. an index entry for an oral medication may list other oral medications as related terms on the same level of the hierarchy but would also link to broader terms such as treatment. Assignment indexing is used in manual indexing to improve inter-indexer consistency as different indexers will have a controlled set of terms to choose from. Controlled vocabularies do not completely remove inconsistencies as two indexers may still interpret the subject differently.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury2004" /&gt;

== Index presentation ==
The final phase of indexing is to present the entries in a systematic order. This may involve linking entries. In a pre-coordinated index the indexer determines the order in which terms are linked in an entry by considering how a user may formulate their search. In a post-coordinated index, the entries are presented singly and the user can link the entries through searches, most commonly carried out by computer software. Post-coordination results in a loss of precision in comparison to pre-coordination &lt;ref name="Bodoff1998"&gt;D. Bodoff and A. Kambil, (1998): "Partial coordination. I. The best of pre-coordination and post-coordination." ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'', '''49'''(14), 1254-1269.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depth of Indexing ==
Indexers must make decisions about what entries should be included and how many entries an index should incorporate. The depth of indexing describes the thoroughness of the indexing process with reference to exhaustivity and specificity &lt;ref name="Cleveland2001"&gt;D.B. Cleveland and A.D. Cleveland (2001): "Introduction to indexing and abstracting". 3rd Ed. Englewood, libraries Unlimited, Inc. {{ISBN|1-56308-641-7}}. page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhaustivity ===
An exhaustive index is one which lists all possible index terms. Greater exhaustivity gives a higher [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], or more likelihood of all the relevant articles being retrieved, however, this occurs at the expense of [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]]. This means that the user may retrieve a larger number of irrelevant documents or documents which only deal with the subject in little depth. In a manual system a greater level of exhaustivity brings with it a greater cost as more man hours are required. The additional time taken in an automated system would be much less significant. At the other end of the scale, in a selective index only the most important aspects are covered.&lt;ref name="Weinberg1999"&gt;B.H. Weinberg (1990): "Exhaustivity of indexes: Books, journals, and electronic full texts; Summary of a workshop presented at the 1999 ASI Annual Conference". ''Key Words'', '''7'''(5), pages 1+.&lt;/ref&gt; Recall is reduced in a selective index as if an indexer does not include enough terms, a highly relevant article may be overlooked. Therefore indexers should strive for a balance and consider what the document may be used. They may also have to consider the implications of time and expense.

=== Specificity ===
The specificity describes how closely the index terms match the topics they represent &lt;ref name="Anderson1997"&gt;J.D. Anderson (1997): ''[http://www.niso.org/publications/tr/ Guidelines for indexes and related information retrieval devices]'' [online]. Bethesda, Maryland, Niso Press. 10 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An index is said to be specific if the indexer uses parallel descriptors to the concept of the document and reflects the concepts precisely.&lt;ref name="Cleveland2001b"&gt;D.B. Cleveland and A.D. Cleveland (2001): "Introduction to indexing and abstracting". 3rd Ed. Englewood, libraries Unlimited, Inc. {{ISBN|1-56308-641-7}}. page 106&lt;/ref&gt; Specificity tends to increase with exhaustivity as the more terms you include, the narrower those terms will be.

==Indexing theory==
[[Birger Hjørland|Hjørland]] (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2011). The Importance of Theories of Knowledge: Indexing and Information retrieval as an example. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 62(1,), 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt; found that theories of indexing is at the deepest level connected to different theories of knowledge:

'''Rationalist theories of indexing''' (such as Ranganathan's theory) suggest that subjects are constructed logically from a fundamental set of categories. The basic method of subject analysis is then "analytic-synthetic", to isolate a set of basic categories (=analysis) and then to construct the subject of any given document by combining those categories according to some rules (=synthesis). '''Empiricist theories of indexing''' are based on selecting similar documents based on their properties, in particular by applying numerical statistical techniques. '''Historicist and hermeneutical theories of indexing''' suggest that the subject of a given document is relative to a given discourse or domain, why the indexing should reflect the need of a particular discourse or domain. According to hermeneutics is a document always written and interpreted from particular horizon. The same is the case with systems of knowledge organization and with all users searching such systems. Any question put to such a system is put from a particular horizon. All those horizons may be more or less in consensus or in conflict. To index a document is to try to contribute to the retrieval of “relevant” documents by knowing about those different horizons. '''Pragmatic and critical theories of indexing''' (such as Hjørland, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (1997). Information Seeking and Subject Representation. An Activity-theoretical approach to Information Science. Westport &amp; London: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is in agreement with the historicist point of view that subjects are relative to specific discourses but emphasizes that subject analysis should support given goals and values and should consider the consequences of indexing one way or another. These theories believe that indexing cannot be neutral and that it is a wrong goal to try to index in a neutral way. Indexing is an act (and computer based indexing is acting according to the programmers intentions). Acts serve human goals. Libraries and information services also serve human goals, why their indexing should be done in a way that supports these goals as much as possible. At a first glance this looks strange because the goals of libraries and information services is to identify any document or piece of information. Nonetheless is any specific way of indexing always supporting some kind of uses at the expense of other. The documents to be indexed intend to serve some specific purposes in a community. Basically the indexing should intend serving the same purposes. Primary and secondary documents and information services are parts of the same overall social system. In such a system different theories, epistemologies, worldviews etc. may be at play and users need to be able to orient themselves and to navigate among those different views. This calls for a mapping of the different epistemologies in the field and classification of the single document into such a map. Excellent examples of such different paradigms and their consequences for indexing and classification systems are provided in the domain of art by Ørom (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Ørom, Anders (2003). Knowledge Organization in the domain of Art Studies - History, Transition and Conceptual Changes. Knowledge Organization. 30(3/4), 128-143.&lt;/ref&gt; and in music by Abrahamsen (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamsen, Knut T. (2003). Indexing of Musical Genres. An Epistemological Perspective. Knowledge Organization, 30(3/4), 144-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of indexing is, as stated by Rowley &amp; Farrow&lt;ref name=rowley2000&gt;Rowley, J. E. &amp; Farrow, J. (2000). Organizing Knowledge: An Introduction to Managing Access to Information. 3rd. Alderstot: Gower Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; to evaluate a papers contribution to knowledge and index it accordingly. Or, with the words of Hjørland (1992,&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (1992). The Concept of "Subject" in Information Science. Journal of Documentation. 48(2), 172-200. http://iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/1992JDOC%5FSubject.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; 1997) to index its informative potentials.

"In order to achieve good consistent indexing, the indexer must have a thorough appreciation of the structure of the subject and the nature of the contribution that the document is making to the advancement of knowledge." (Rowley &amp; Farrow, 2000,&lt;ref name=rowley2000/&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;99).

The '''Swiss Institute of Comparative Law''' ({{lang-fr|Institut suisse de droit comparé}} (ISDC), {{lang-de|Schweizerisches Institut für Rechtsvergleichung}}) is an agency of the [[federal administration of Switzerland]] charged with research and consultancy in [[comparative law]]. 

Its principal mission is to furnish opinions about foreign law to the administration, the courts and the public. It also operates a publicly accessible research library, which holds 360,000 volumes and served 6,000 visitors in 2008.

The institute was founded through federal statute in 1978. It is located on the campus of the [[University of Lausanne]] and is administratively attached to the [[Federal Department of Justice and Police]]. It employs a staff of about 30 researchers, librarians and clerical personnel.

'''''Test Site''''' was an [[Installation art|art installation]], that was displayed in the turbine hall of [[Tate Modern]] in [[London]], UK, between October 2006 and 9 April 2007. ''Test Site'' was designed like [[Carsten Höller]], and was the seventh commission of the series of works in the turbine hall sponsored by [[Unilever]] known as "The Unilever Series".

The exhibit consisted of a series of metal slides. There were a total of five slides, two starting on the second floor, and one on each floor after that up to the 5th floor. The slides were composed of metal and fibreglass, and covered all the way around.

Visitors could slide down the slides of the installation free, but timed entry tickets were required for all but the second floor slides.

'''''The Cure for Insomnia''''', directed by John Henry Timmis IV, is a 1987 [[experimental film]] which was, according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', the [[List of longest films by running time|longest running]] film at the time. This record has since been surpassed by several other films.&lt;ref&gt;"The Longest Movies Ever Made," ''[[Orange Coast Magazine]]'', May 1989, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; At 5,220 minutes long (87 hours, or 3 days and 15 hours) in length, the film has no plot, instead consisting of artist L. D. Groban reading his 4,080-page poem ''A Cure for Insomnia''&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Felton, ''What Were They Thinking?: Really Bad Ideas Throughout History'', The Lyons Press, 2003, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; over the course of three and a half days, spliced with occasional clips from [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[pornographic]] videos.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Belardes, ''A People's History of the Peculiar: A Freak Show of Facts, Random Obsessions and Astounding Truths'', Viva Editions, 2014, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first played in its entirety at [[Art Institute of Chicago|The School of the Art Institute]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], from January 31 to February 3, 1987, in one continuous showing. It has not been released on DVD or other home video formats and all known copies are considered as lost. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3130">'''Thomson Local''' is a local business [[telephone directory]], published up until 2016 in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Thomson Directories]] Ltd from its former head office at Thomson House in [[Farnborough, Hampshire]]. 

It is the principal rival (and for the 1980s and some of the 1990s the sole rival) to the [[Yellow Pages]] (published by Thomson as the Thomson Yellow Pages until it was sold off to the privatised [[BT Group|BT]]).

The printed directory was distributed without charge to households and businesses, reaching some 22 million homes and businesses at its peak.  

As of 2016 the company ceased the production and delivery of printed directories, opting instead to offer their services digitally. 

Thomson Local is a focused local area directory which has continually innovated with features such as colour and knock-out white advertisements.  It was the first such directory in the UK to contain added value features such as local maps, local guides, and additional useful information beyond the actual business listings themselves.

Thomson Directories Ltd was originally formed to publish the Thomson Local in 1980 by [[The Thomson Corporation]] (after it had sold off its Thomson Yellow Pages business) and [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]], in partnership.  After trials in several areas, the Thomson Local was first published throughout [[Great Britain]] in 1981.  It was owned by [[Seat Pagine Gialle]] S.p.A. of [[Italy]] until both companies fell into administration in August 2013. Thomson Local's assets were purchased by telephone data company Corporate Media Partners, preserving more than 300 jobs but with 170 redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/15/thomson-local-administration-redundancies&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the company expanded its operations to include its own online directory in the shape of [http://www.thomsonlocal.com thomsonlocal.com] and a range of partner implementations supplying classified and keyword based listings to companies such as MSN, StreetMap, Pipex and many others and many others.

In July 2010, Thomson Local signed a multi-year agreement to become the UK's first re-seller of adCenter, the pay-per-click platform for Microsoft's search engine [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]].&lt;ref&gt;Media Week, "Microsoft nets deal for Thomson Local to sell Bing ads"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doublespark.co.uk|title=White Hat Pay Per Click Advertisements|accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the company launched&lt;ref&gt;Mobile Marketing Magazine. "Thomsonlocal.com launches Local Business Search App" http://www.mobilemarketingmagazine.co.uk/content/thomsonlocalcom-launches-local-business-search-app&lt;/ref&gt; the thomsonlocal.com app for iPhone which has since been discontinued. 

As of 2017 Thomson Local operates from their new head office in the Templer building of Farnborough Business Park overlooking [[Farnborough Airport]].

A contract case, it discusses the impropriety of [[punitive damages]] and favoring the theory of [[efficient breach]].

==Case procedure and summary==
[[U.S. Naval Institute]], as the assignee for the book ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'', sued [[Charter Communications]] and [[Berkley Books|Berkley Publishing Group]] for breach of a licensing contract. The contract was an exclusive license to publish a paperback edition of the book, not sooner than October 1985.  The publishers breached this contract by initiating retail sales on September 15, 1985. Early sales were substantial enough to put the book near the top of paperback best seller lists before the end of September.

Naval lost its suit for a preliminary injunction to prevent these sales.  The District Court ruled that Berkeley had not breached the contract, because it was to ship before the agreed publication date, which was industry custom.  However, the Circuit court reversed this holding and determined that the contract was breached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States Naval Institute v. Charter Communications, Inc. |vol=875 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1044 |pinpoint= |court=[[2d Cir.]] |date=1989 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/875/1044/179312/ |accessdate=2018-06-14 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On remand, the trial court concluded that the damages Naval was entitled to not merely actual damages for copyright infringement, but also recovery of profits wrongfully received by Berkeley (in the month of September) for that infringement.

==Holding==
No.&lt;!--to what?--&gt;  Damages for breach of contract are supposed to compensate the injured party for the loss caused by the breach.  Those are measured by the plaintiff's actual loss.

*While defendant's profits are on occasion used to measure damages, this generally occurs when those profits help to define the plaintiff's loss.

The object behind contract remedies is to compensate, not to punish.  Punitive damages are only recoverable from a breach of contract if the conduct that constitutes the breach is also a tort [Subsection 355, Restatement (Second) of Contracts].

'''viXra''' is an electronic [[e-print]] archive set up by independent physicist Philip Gibbs as an alternative to the dominant [[arXiv]] service operated by [[Cornell University]].

==Description==
Although dominated by physics and mathematics submissions, viXra aims to cover topics across the whole scientific community. It accepts submissions without requiring authors to have an academic affiliation and without any threshold for quality.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://blogs.nature.com/news/2009/07/whats_arxiv_spelled_backwards.html What’s arXiv spelled backwards? A new place to publish]".

'''Walch's Tasmanian Almanac''' was an [[almanac]] produced in [[Hobart, Tasmania|Hobart]] by  J Walch and Sons from the 1850s until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Walch's Tasmanian almanac for | publication-date=1870 | publisher=J. Walch &amp; Sons | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9006481 | accessdate=5 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had a range of variant  titles in the time that it was published, but was commonly known as ''Walch's Almanac''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25912059 |title=Walch's Tasmanian Almanac |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]  |volume=CLV |issue=22,257  |location=Tasmania, Australia |date=31 March 1942 |accessdate=5 December 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also known as the 'red book',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25936659 |title=Walch s "Red Book" |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |volume=CLVII |issue=22,561 |location=Tasmania|date=23 March 1943 |accessdate=5 December 2016 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; included detailed information about [[Tasmania]] for the current year, and all regions and towns of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11371882 |title=AUSTRALIANA: GARNET WALCH |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]  |issue=30,654  |location=Melbourne |date=25 November 1944 |accessdate=5 December 2016 |page=7 (The Argus Week-end Magazine) |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a valuable resource of historical information about Tasmania.

Extensive use of the information has been collated and indexed by and for Genealogical societies.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.ancestry.com.au/search/db.aspx?dbid=30372 – Walch's Tasmanian Almanac, 1863–1904 on Ancestry dot com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">The '''''Zuqnin Chronicle''''' is a [[chronicle]] written in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] concerning the events from [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] to {{circa|775}} CE. The fourth, historiographically important, part of the chronicle provides a detailed account of life of non-Muslims in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], [[Medieval|Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)#Arab_Caliphate_rule_.28638.E2.80.931099_AD.29|Palestine]] during and after the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]]. It was most probably produced in the [[Zuqnin Monastery]] near [[Amida (Mesopotamia)|Amida]] (the modern Turkish city of [[Diyarbakır]]) on the upper [[Tigris]]. The work is preserved in a single handwritten manuscript, ''Cod. Vat.'' 162. This is now in the Vatican (shelf mark Vatican Syriac 162).

It consists of four parts. The first part&lt;ref&gt;edited by Tullberg, Upsala, 1850&lt;/ref&gt; reaches to the epoch of [[Constantine the Great]], and is in the main an epitome of the ''[[Eusebian Chronicle]]''. The second part reaches to [[Theodosius II]] and follows closely the ''Ecclesiastical History'' of [[Socrates of Constantinople]]; while the third, extending to [[Justin II]], reproduces the second part of the ''History'' of [[John of Ephesus]] (of interest because this part is lost elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;Harrak, 18-9&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth part is not, like the others, a compilation but the original work of the author and reaches to the year 774-775, apparently the date when he was writing.

The scholar Assemani ascribed it to [[Dionysius Telmaharensis|Dionysius of Tel Mahre]], another Syrian chronologist of the late eighth century (hence, "Chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysius"; a name now not generally accepted).&lt;ref&gt;Harrak&lt;/ref&gt; On the publication of the fourth part of the chronicle by  M Chabot, it was shown by [[Theodor Nöldeke]],&lt;ref&gt;''Vienna Oriental Journal'' X. 160-170&lt;/ref&gt; and Nau,&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin critique'', xvii. 321-327&lt;/ref&gt; that Assemani had been mistaken, and that the chronicle in question was the work of an earlier writer. This writer was most probably the [[stylite]] monk Joshua, at Zuqnin.&lt;ref&gt;Harrak&lt;/ref&gt;

The author was an amateur historian, and his aim was moral instruction, not history "as such". His work most clearly depended on earlier works, and has thus be accused of plagiarism. However all points to him being honest in what he recounted.&lt;ref&gt;Amir Harrak (1999), 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cod. Vat.'' 162 is the autograph, and in fact the first draft of the manuscript. No further recension, or copy, is known.&lt;ref&gt;Harrak, 12f.&lt;/ref&gt;
