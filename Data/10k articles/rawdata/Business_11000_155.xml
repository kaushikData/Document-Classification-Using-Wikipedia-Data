[[File:Abelardo Lafuente.jpg|thumb|Abelardo Lafuente the Spanish architect of Shanghai's Golden Era]]

'''Abelardo Lafuente Garcia-Rojo''' (Madrid 1871 – Shanghai 1931) was a Spanish architect&lt;ref name=podcast&gt;{{cite news|last=La Hora de Asia|title=Abelardo Lafuente: arquitectura española en Shanghai|url=http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/audios/la-hora-de-asia/hora-asia-abelardo-lafuente-arquitectura-espanola-shanghai-21-05-11/1107013/|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=Radio Nacional España|date=21 May 2011|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entrepreneur who had his own studio in colonial Shanghai.&lt;ref name="Cultural Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aldama|first=Zigor|title=Un español en el Shanghái precomunista|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2011/06/25/babelia/1308960770_850215.html|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=Babelia 1.022|date=25 June 2011|agency=El Pais|pages=24|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1913 and 1931 he was the only Spaniard to have an architect studio registered in the city; Lafuente collaborated with several contemporary architects. Lafuente blended the mozarab and moorish styles from Spain into Chinese architecture. In 2009, the Spanish architect Alvaro Leonardo Perez established the ''Lafuente Research Project''. The findings of this project were first presented at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010 in collaboration with the [[Instituto Cervantes]]. The Lafuente Research Project is ongoing.

== History ==
Lafuente's professional career began in [[Manila]]. His studio was named ''A. Lafuente Architect &amp; Contractor''. In 1913 Lafuente moved to Shanghai where he opened a new studio named ''A. Lafuente Garcia-Rojo, Architect &amp; Contractor''. Later, Lafuente joined American architect G. O. Wootten to form the ''Lafuente &amp; Wootten'' studio. The two architects worked together for several years, their most notable work being the ballroom at the [[Astor House Hotel (Shanghai)|Astor House Hotel]], built in 1917. After this period he maintained the studio on his own and called it ''A. Lafuente Gª Rojo Architect''. Afterwards he partnered with Russian architect A. J. Yaron, changing the studio's name once again to ''Lafuente &amp; Yaron''.

For the better part of the following 10 years Lafuente worked for the biggest hotel company in Asia at the time: the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels|Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd.]], rehabilitating and refurbishing their buildings. His most important work during this project was the Majestic Hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel Majestic, the most important company's hotel in Shanghai|url=http://www.hshgroup.com/en/~/media/Files/HSHGroup/Investor_Relations/Financial_Results/2010/Annual_Report/AR_2010_C08.ashx|publisher=HSH|accessdate=11 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112004259/http://www.hshgroup.com/en/~/media/Files/HSHGroup/Investor_Relations/Financial_Results/2010/Annual_Report/AR_2010_C08.ashx|archive-date=12 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1924) where he designed its new ballroom (the most luxurious in Asia at that time{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}). Some of his other projects included churches, mosques, private villas, apartment buildings, movie theaters, private clubs, and hospitals, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=EFE|first=Agency|title=Un arquitecto español trabajando en la belle époque china|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/12/20/cultura/1324375509.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=20 December 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The north China Herald|title=A Jewish Club for Shanghai|pages=29–30|date=6 July 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation in the Spanish colony is described in the book by Vicente Blasco Ibanez ''La vuelta al mundo de un novelista''. Spanish entrepreneur Antonio Ramos&lt;ref name=Magazine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revista de Occidente|author2=Juan Ignacio Toro Escudero|title=Sombras orientales: Antonio Ramos y el primer cine chino|date=June 2010|issue=349/350|url=http://www.ortegaygasset.edu/fog/ver/408/revista-de-occidente/junio-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was his most important influence during his time in China and his most outstanding client. Ramos brought motion pictures to China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Lafuente was commissioned to build some of Ramos' most important cinemas.

Lafuente also worked in North America. In Los Angeles and in [[Tijuana]] he built houses. During 1927–1930, Lafuente maintained operations in Shanghai while he developed his business in California and Mexico. At the end of this period, after being significantly affected by the [[Crash of 1929]], he decided to return to Shanghai and undertake more projects there. He died in Shanghai at the Shanghai General Hospital in 1931, aged 60.

'''Ali Ghandour''' (born 1931) is the president of ARAM Trading and Technology. He is a native of [[Lebanon]] and a [[Jordan]]ian citizen.

==Education and early life==
Ghandour grew up in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] where he spent most of his youth, he was admitted to [[International College, Beirut|IC]], a private co-educational preparatory school to the [[American University of Beirut]] which he graduated from later with Aerospace engineering degree. he also went for further education at [[New York University]] - [[United States]].
Gandour went back to Lebanon in 1954 and joined the [[Lebanese Civil Aviation Authority]] as an engineer and Head of aviation Safety.

Ghandour's political tendencies led him to join the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] (SSNP) whose members were chased after by the Lebanese government due to a failed coup which the party attempted in 1961. Despite the fact that Ghandour was in Paris on a training course during the coup, he was wanted by the Lebanese government and considered a fugitive. Thus, Gandour took [[Refugee|refuge]] at [[Paris]] then [[Côte d'Ivoire]] which he left later to [[Kuwait]].

Ghandour's refuge to Kuwait was accepted by the Kuwaiti authorities as long as no conviction was issued by the Lebanese government for his arrest. Ghandour remained and worked for the Directorate General of Civil Aviation in Kuwait not long before a death sentence [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] was issued by Lebanon which forced him to Leave immediately to [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aawsat.com/details.asp?section=53&amp;article=138010&amp;issueno=8763]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jordan==
Ghandour and colleagues from the (SSNP) went to meet up with [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] to thank him for Jordan's acceptance of refuge. The meeting was Ghandour's life turning point when King Hussein asked him about his future plans to which Ghandour's intentions were to travel back to [[West Africa]], King Hussein did not recommend Ghandour's plans, instead he offered him to remain in Jordan in order to establish a new national airline to which Ghandour accepted.

Gandour presented the [[Feasibility study]] to King Hussein which he liked and gave orders to commence the project backed up by a [[Decree|Royal decree]] in 1963 . A week later, a DCC plane were leased from [[Lebanese International Airways]] and were scheduled to fly to [[Jerusalem]] and Beirut. 2 more [[Handley Page Dart Herald|Dart Herald]] of [[Royal Jordanian Air Force]] were provided by King Hussein to convert into civilian planes for usage in the newly established airline.

Gandour's recommendation to name the new airline [[Royal Jordanian]] was approved by King Hussein, the name was also extended to ALIA after the king's eldest daughter [[Princess Alia bint Al Hussein|Princess Alia]]. (It is a common misconception that the airline was named after the King's third wife, [[Alia al-Hussein|Queen Alia]].

[[File:Demidov herb.jpg|thumb|Arms as [[Prince of San Donato]]]]
'''Count Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of [[Villa San Donato|San Donato]]''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Анатолий Николаевич Демидов}}; 5 April OS: 24 March 1813 &amp;ndash; 29 April 1870) was a Russian industrialist, diplomat and arts patron of the [[Demidov]] family.

==Life==

===Early life===
Born in [[Saint Petersburg]] or [[Moscow]], he was the second surviving son of Count [[Nikolai Nikitich Demidov]] and Baroness [[Elisabeta Alexandrovna Stroganova]]. He grew up in Paris, where his father was ambassador. He served briefly as a diplomat himself in Paris (living in the hôtel built by [[Charles de Wailly]] for the sculptor [[Augustin Pajou]], at 87 [[rue de la Pépinière]], now the [[rue La Boétie]]), Rome and [[Venice]]. Upon his father's death in 1828, Anatole settled for good in western Europe, returning to Russia as little as possible. This attitude alienated him from tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]], who always had an antipathy towards him.

===Scholarly endeavours===
In 1837–38, he organised a scientific expedition of 22 scholars, writers and artists (of which [[Auguste Raffet]] and the critic [[Jules Janin]] became Demidov's friends) to southern Russia and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], headed up by [[Frédéric Le Play]]. It cost 500,000 francs and its results were published as ''Voyage dans la Russie méridionale et la Crimée'' (4 vol., 1840–1842), with 100 original lithographs by [[Auguste Raffet|Raffet]] and dedicated to the tsar despite his not having taken any interest in the book (irritated as he was that most of the expedition's members had been French). Demidov also financed a trip to Russia by [[André Durand]] to relieve the peasants, the results of which were published as ''Voyage pittoresque et archéologique en Russie'' (1839).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shapero.com/images/Image/PDF/50FineBooks.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411094713/http://www.shapero.com/images/Image/PDF/50FineBooks.pdf |archive-date=2009-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, Demidov himself published a series of articles on Russia in the ''[[Journal des Débats]]'' – these were collected as ''Lettres sur l’Empire de Russie'' (1840) with the aim of fighting certain received French ideas about Russia. Nevertheless, these works irritated Nicholas I due to their description of Russia's feudal system. In 1847 Demidov made a trip to Spain with Raffet, publishing an account of it later as ''Etapes maritimes sur les côtes d’Espagne'' (1858). In 1842, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

===Art collector===

[[Image:La princesse Mathilde (1820-1904) par Dubufe en 1861.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Mathilde-Létizia Bonaparte|Mathilde Bonaparte]]]]

He also considerably expanded the [[Demidov collection]] assembled by his father at the [[Villa San Donato]] near [[Florence]], being particularly interested in [[Romanticism|Romantic art]]. In the [[Paris Salon]] of 1834 he acquired [[Paul Delaroche]]'s ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'' (now in the [[National Gallery, London]]). In 1833, he bought [[François Marius Granet]]'s ''The Death of Poussin'', which caused a sensation at the 1834 Salon. He commissioned paintings from [[Eugène Delacroix]] and watercolours from [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and [[Théodore Géricault]], as well as Briullov's ''[[The Last Day of Pompeii]]''. His collection was split up in public sales in Paris in 1863 and shortly before the prince's death in 1870.

===Marriage and separation===
Like his parents, Demidov was a great admirer of [[Napoleon I of France]]. He built a museum below the house of San Martino on [[Isle of Elba|Elba]], where Napoleon had lived during his first exile, and he caused a mass to be sung at [[Portoferraio]] every 5th of May (which is still sung today). In 1839, he was introduced by [[Jules Janin]] into the circle of [[Jérôme Bonaparte]], former king of Westphalia, who was living in exile at the [[Villa di Quarto]] in [[Florence]]. A plan to marry Jérôme's daughter princess [[Mathilde-Létizia Bonaparte]] to Demidov was quickly formed. It was agreed that she would receive a dowry of 50,000 francs in jewels (bought by Demidov for 1 million francs from Jérôme, always short of money) and 240,000 francs in money, payable in instalments. A decree of 20 October 1840 also made Demidov the [[Prince of San Donato]] to allow the princess to hold onto her title, though Demidov's princely title was never recognised in Russia. The marriage took place in [[Rome]] or [[Florence]] on 1 November 1840.

In March 1841, the couple went to Saint Petersburg, where the Tsar was full of attention for his cousin (through the Württembergs) the princess and losing no opportunity to humiliate Demidov by any means possible. In spite of this, Anatole began his own infidelities. On 17 August 1841, the couple arrived in Paris, where they lived at hôtel Demidoff at 109 [[rue Saint-Dominique]] until June 1842, when they moved to spend a year in Saint Petersburg before finally setting up home at the Villa San Donato. Their relationship soon soured, with the princess taking Count [[Émilien de Nieuwerkerke]] as a lover, and Demidov taking [[Valentine de Sainte-Aldegonde]], duchesse de Dino, as a mistress.

Mathilde made a violent scene with Valentine during a ball and in reply Demidov slapped her twice in public. Separated since 1843, in September 1846 Mathilde fled to Paris to take refuge with Nieuwerkerke, taking with her the jewels from her dowry. Even so, Demidov was condemned by a tribunal in Saint Petersburg to send Mathilde an annual pension of 200,000 francs and was never able to recover his jewels. In many ways, Demidov felt he deserved such punishment, and their separation was authorised in 1847 by a personal decision of tsar Nicholas I. Demidov's many other mistresses included [[Maria Calergis]], considered one of the most beautiful women of her era, [[Ernestine Duverger]], and Fanny de la Rochefoucauld (daughter of [[François XIII de La Rochefoucauld|Francois]], 8th duc de la Rochefoucauld, with whom he had an illegitimate son).

===Later life===
Demidov tried to repair the damage the separation had done to his social standing by increasing his charitable donations. He created hospitals, orphanages and started an international committee to aid prisoners of the [[Crimean War]], as well as giving 1 million roubles to finance that war (for which [[Alexander II of Russia]] made him chamberlain and councillor of state). In 1860, he, the [[Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, duc de Morny|duc de Morny]] and doctor Oliffe made up the consortium of investors which founded the bathing resort at [[Deauville]], and he took part in the famous [[Carnival de Paris]] (a painting at the [[musée Carnavalet]] shows his team taking part).

A bon viveur, two chicken dishes were named after him, including Chicken Demidoff (elaborately stuffed, smothered, tied up and garnished), and the Demidoff name is also applied to dishes of rissoles and red snapper. He died in 1870 of a pulmonary congestion in his hotel on rue Saint-Dominique in Paris. Dying without legitimate issue, his title of Prince of San Donato passed to his nephew [[Pavel Pavlovitch Demidov]].

The '''Bank of America Tower''' ('''BOAT''') at One Bryant Park is a {{convert|1,200|ft|m|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[skyscraper]] in the [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] area of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. It is located on [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Avenue of the Americas]], between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]] and 43rd Streets, opposite [[Bryant Park]].

The {{US$|1 billion}} project was designed by [[Cookfox|COOKFOX Architects]], and advertised to be one of the most efficient and ecologically friendly buildings in the world. It is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|fifth tallest building in New York City]], after [[One World Trade Center]], [[432 Park Avenue]], [[30 Hudson Yards]], and the [[Empire State Building]], and the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|seventh tallest building in the United States]]. Construction was completed in 2009.&lt;ref name="archrecord"&gt;{{cite news| title= New Skyscraper Stars in National Geographic Show| url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/081105skyscraper.asp| date=5 November 2008| work=Architectural Record| publisher=archrecord.construction.com| author=C.J.

The building's Urban Garden Room at 43rd Street and 6th Avenue  is open to the public.

The tower's architectural spire is {{convert|255.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} tall and was placed on December 15, 2007. The building is 55 stories high and contains {{convert|2100000|sqft|m2|0}} of office space, three escalators and a total of 52 elevators--50 to serve the offices and two leading to the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] below ground, for the [[42nd Street – Bryant Park / Fifth Avenue (New York City Subway)|42nd Street – Bryant Park / Fifth Avenue station]].&lt;ref name="vda"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vdassoc.com/projects/OFFICES-One.Bryant.Park.html| title=One Bryant Park| publisher=Van Deusen &amp; Associates| accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several buildings were demolished to make way for the tower. Among them was the [[Hotel Diplomat]], a 13-story structure which had occupied the site at 108 West 43rd Street since 1911,&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;{{cite news| title=An Aging Midtown Hotel That Will Not Go Gently| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/realestate/an-aging-midtown-hotel-that-will-not-go-gently.html| first=David W.| last=Dunlap| date=7 November 1993| work=[[The New York Times]]| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Sondheim Theatre|Henry Miller's Theatre]], which was rebuilt and reopened at its previous location. The building's tenants include [[Bank of America]] as the anchor tenant and [[Marathon Asset Management]], and the tower's platinum [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] rating and modern column-free office space has enticed tenants from all over the city. The Bank of America Tower is considered a worldwide model for green architecture in skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There’s been a boom in energy-efficient skyscraper construction|first= Tim |last=McDonnell |date=16 September 2015|url= http://grist.org/climate-energy/theres-been-a-boom-in-energy-efficient-skyscraper-construction/ |work=[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental features===

The design of the building makes it environmentally friendly, using technologies such as floor-to-ceiling [[insulated glazing]] to contain heat and maximize natural light, and an automatic daylight dimming system. The tower also features a [[greywater]] system, which captures [[rainwater]] for reuse. Bank of America states that the building is made largely of recycled and recyclable materials.&lt;ref name="boa"&gt;{{cite press release| title=Bank of America and The Durst Organization Break Ground On the Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park in New York City| publisher=Bank of America Corporation| date=2 August 2004| url=http://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=4405| accessdate=2007-10-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071023184724/http://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=4405| archivedate= 23 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air entering the building is filtered, as is common, but the air exhausted is cleaned as well.&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite journal| first1=Richard A.| last1=Cook| first2=Alice| last2=Hartley| title="What is Free?": How Sustainable Architecture Act and Interacts Differently| publisher=United Nations| date=6 June 2005| url=https://www.un.org/docs/ecosoc/meetings/2005/docs/Cook.pdf| accessdate=2007-10-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071128051308/http://www.un.org/docs/ecosoc/meetings/2005/docs/Cook.pdf| archivedate= 28 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bank of America Tower is the first skyscraper designed to attain a Platinum [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Certification.&lt;ref name="boa" /&gt;

The Bank of America Tower is constructed using a concrete manufactured with [[slag]], a byproduct of [[blast furnaces]]. The mixture used in the tower concrete is 55% cement and 45% slag. The use of slag cement reduces damage to the environment by decreasing the amount of cement needed for the building, which in turn lowers the amount of carbon dioxide [[greenhouse gas]] produced through the normal cement manufacturing process. Each ton of regular cement produced creates about one ton of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="usconcrete"&gt;{{cite web| title=EF Technology| publisher=U.S. Concrete, Inc| url=http://www.us-concrete.com/news/features.asp| accessdate=2007-11-08| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005014352/http://www.us-concrete.com/news/features.asp| archivedate=2007-10-05| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperature control and the production of some of its energy are accomplished in an environmentally friendly manner for the tower. Insulated glazing reduces thermal loss, lowering energy consumption and increasing transparency. Carbon dioxide sensors signal increased fresh air ventilation when elevated levels of carbon dioxide are detected in the building. Conditioned air for the occupants is provided by multiple air column units located in the tenant space that deliver 50&amp;nbsp;°F air into a raised access floor plenum. This underfloor air system provides users with the ability to control their own space temperature as well as improving the ventilation effectiveness. When building churn occurs, workstation moves can be performed more easily with lower cost and less product waste. The cooling system produces and stores ice during off-peak hours, and allows the ice to melt to help cool the building during [[peak load]], similar to the ice batteries in the 1995 [[Hotel New Otani Tokyo]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="otani"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice-cooling System Reduces Environmental Burden |work=The New Otani News |publisher=New Otani Co., Ltd. |date=28 June 2000 |url=http://www.newotani.co.jp/en/group/noc/news/05.htm |accessdate=2007-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007123108/http://www.newotani.co.jp/en/group/noc/news/05.htm |archivedate=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice batteries have been used since absorption chillers first made ice commercially available 150 years ago, before the invention of the electric light bulb.&lt;ref name="foley"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Gearoid |last1=Foley |first2=Robert |last2=DeVault |first3=Richard |last3=Sweetser |title=The Future of Absorption Technology in America |publisher=U.S. DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) |url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/de/pdfs/absorption_future.pdf |accessdate=2007-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128051310/http://www.eere.energy.gov/de/pdfs/absorption_future.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2007 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water conservation features in the tower include waterless [[urinals]], which are estimated to save {{convert|8000000|gal|l|abbr=on}} of water per year and reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by {{convert|144000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} per year (as calculated with the [[Pacific Institute]] water-to-air model).&lt;ref name="pac"&gt;{{cite web| author=Pacific Institute| title=Water to Air Models| url=http://www.pacinst.org/resources/water_to_air_models/| accessdate=2008-06-13| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211184707/http://www.pacinst.org/resources/water_to_air_models/| archive-date=2008-12-11| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower has a 4.6-megawatt [[cogeneration]] plant, which provides part of the base-load energy requirements.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported in August 2013 that the Bank of America Tower used twice as much energy overall as the [[Empire State Building]], due to the large energy usage in the Bank of America Tower and the comparatively small occupancy rate of the Empire State Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Walsh | first=Bryan | title=The Surprisingly Large Energy Footprint of the Digital Economy &amp;#91;UPDATE&amp;#93; | website=TIME.com | date=2013-08-14 | url=http://science.time.com/2013/08/14/power-drain-the-digital-cloud-is-using-more-energy-than-you-think/ | accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Broad Street''' is a narrow street located in the [[Financial District (Manhattan)|Financial District]] in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. It stretches from [[South Street (Manhattan)|South Street]] to [[Wall Street]].

Originally the Broad Canal in [[New Amsterdam]] drawing from the [[East River]],&lt;ref name=kadinksy/&gt; the canal was filled in 1676 after numerous fruit and vegetable vendors made it difficult for boats to enter the canal.&lt;ref name=streetbook/&gt;  Early establishments on Broad Street in the 1600s included the [[Fraunces Tavern]]&lt;ref name="Brentano"/&gt; and the [[Royal Exchange (New York)|Royal Exchange]].&lt;ref name=SCOTUS/&gt; Later on the area became the center of financial activity, and all smaller buildings in turn were replaced with grand banks and [[stock exchange]] buildings. Most of the structures that stand today date from the turn of the 20th century, along with more modern buildings constructed after the 1950s.

===1600s: New Amsterdam canal===
[[File:Old Dutch house on Broad Street (Manhattan).jpg|thumb|left|Old Dutch house on Broad Street, 1831]]
Broad Street in old [[New Amsterdam]] was named for the Broad Canal, which it replaced.

Broad Street was originally a [[canal]] first known as “Common Ditch” then later “The Prince’s Ditch”.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The canal was filled in 1676 because fruit and vegetable vendors, including [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s who came by canoe from [[Long Island]], left the area littered, and fewer and fewer water craft were small enough to use the canal.&lt;ref name=streetbook&gt;{{cite streetbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paths in front of the rows of houses by the canal were paved in 1676 as well.&lt;ref name=kadinksy&gt;Kadinsky, Sergey (2016) ''Hidden Waters of New York City'' Countryman Press.

Among the tenants of Broad Street in the 18th century was bookseller [[Garrat Noel]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Mercury'', November 13, 1752&lt;/ref&gt;

===1700s: Taverns and halls===
The city's first firehouse for the [[New York City Fire Department]] was built in 1736 in front of City Hall on Broad Street. A year later, on December 16, 1737, the colony's General Assembly created the Volunteer Fire Department of the City of New York.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/heroes/history1.html |title=Heroes of Ground Zero.

The Broad Street building for the [[Fraunces Tavern]] was bought in 1762 by [[Samuel Fraunces]], who converted the home into the popular tavern first named the Queen's Head. Before the [[American Revolution]], the building was one of the meeting places of the secret society, the [[Sons of Liberty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1768, the [[New York Chamber of Commerce]] was founded by a meeting in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana |wstitle=Fraunces' Tavern |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a rebuilt in 1752 that added a meeting hall on the upper story, the Royal Exchange building was the location of the Chamber of Commerce in the City of New York (later [[Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York]]) from 1770 until the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The [[United States District Court for the District of New York]] was one of the original 13 courts established by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], and it first sat at the Royal Exchange (Merchants Exchange) building on Broad Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.nysd.uscourts.gov/|title=Southern District of New York 225th Anniversary|author=|date=|website=history.nysd.uscourts.gov|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S386&gt;Asbury Dickens, ''A Synoptical Index to the Laws and Treaties of the United States of America'' (1852), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fjcny&gt;[http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_district_ny.html U.S. District Courts of New York, Legislative history], ''[[Federal Judicial Center]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''capitalization-weighted (or "cap-weighted") index''', also called a '''market-value-weighted index''' is a [[stock market index]] whose components are [[stock market index#Weighting|weighted]] according to the total [[market value]] of their [[Shares outstanding|outstanding shares]].  Every day an individual stock's price changes and thereby changes a stock index's value. The impact that individual stock's price change has on the index is proportional to the company's overall market value (the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares), in a capitalization-weighted index. In other types of indices, different ratios are used.

For example, the [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]] Composite Index (XAX) had more than 800 component stocks. The weighting of each stock constantly shifted with changes in the stock's price and the number of shares outstanding. The index fluctuates in line with the price move of the stocks.&lt;ref&gt;John Downes &amp; Jordan Elliot Goodman, ''Finance and Investment Terms'', Barrons Financial Guides, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Stock market indices are a type of [[Index (economics)|economic index]].

==Mathematical formula==

The formula underneath is a simple way of seeing the percent changes that your ETF (or any other shares of stock, for that matter) has gained (or lost). If an investor purchases 100 shares of AAPL at $1.00 and a month later the purchased AAPL is trading at $1.10, the investment yielded a 10% gain/return (($110/$100)-1=0.1, or 10%).

&lt;math&gt;\frac{ index_{\rm_{new}}}{ index_{\rm_{old}}} = \frac{ \sum {\# shares} \cdot price_{\rm_{new}}}{ \sum {\# shares} \cdot price_{\rm{old}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Free-float weighting==

A common version of capitalization weighting is the ''free-float'' weighting. With this method a ''float factor'' is assigned to each stock to account for the proportion of outstanding shares that are held by the general public, as opposed to "closely held" shares owned by the government, royalty, or company insiders (see [[Public float|float]]). For example, if for some stock 15% of shares are closely held, and the other 85% are publicly held, the float factor will be 0.85, by which the company's market capitalization will be multiplied before weighting its value against the rest of the index. In other words, the number of shares used for calculation is the number of shares "floating", rather than outstanding.

An index that is weighted in this manner is said to be "float-adjusted" or "float-weighted", in addition to being cap-weighted. For example, the [[S&amp;P 500|S&amp;P 500 index]] is both cap-weighted and float-adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinvest: How stock indices work|Market Cap calculations via Wikinvest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, in the United States, capitalization-weighted indices tended to use full weighting, i.e., all outstanding shares were included, while float-weighted indexing has been the norm in other countries, perhaps because of large cross-holdings or government ownership. More recently, many of the U.S. indices, such as the S&amp;P 500, have been changed to a [[Public float|float]]-adjusted weighting which makes their calculation more consistent with non-U.S. indices.

==Other types of indices==
An index may also be classified according to the method used to determine its price. In a [[price-weighted index]] such as the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], the price of each component stock is the only consideration when determining the value of the index. Thus, price movement of even a single security will heavily influence the value of the index even though the dollar shift is less significant in a relatively high-value name.  In a [[Fundamentally based indexes|fundamentally weighted]] index, stocks are weighted by fundamental factors like sales or book value.

[[File:FTC 3083 (6792597322).jpg|thumb|Modern day Dey Street]]
'''Dey Street''' is a short street in [[Lower Manhattan]], in [[New York City]]. It passes the west side of the [[World Trade Center site#New buildings|World Trade Center site]] and the [[World Trade Center Transportation Hub]]. It runs for one block between [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. It originally ran to [[West Side Highway|West Street]], but the western reaches were demolished to make way for the World Trade Center in the late 1960s. It now extends to [[Greenwich Street]]. 15 Dey Street is the site of the first transcontinental telephone call.

== History ==
The origins of the streets name are rather ambiguous. It is possible that it was named after John Dies, who was in charge of building a fleet of batteaux for use against the French in 1755.

According to estimations made by map makers, Dey Street did not exist in 1742. It appears in a map dated to 1767, documented as ‘Dyes Street’. It reached from Broadway to Greenwich Street, which ran along the edge of the [[Hudson River]] at that time. As the island was built outward with landfill, the street gradually lengthened.

'''Dey's or Dies Dock. '''(M-L18) On the Hudson River at Dey Street, built in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldstreets.com/index.asp?letter=D|title=streets of new york|last=|first=|date=|website=oldstreets.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Batteau or Battoe Street. '''(M-L18) The name refers to a type of boat used on inland waters. According to du Simitiere (1767), it was a commonly used name for what is now spelled Dey Street. In 1755 John Dies was in charge of building a fleet of batteaux for use against the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldstreets.com/index.asp?letter=B|title=streets of new york|last=|first=|date=|website=oldstreets.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the obligations of individual directors|the official duties of directors|Board of directors}}
'''Directors' duties''' are a series of statutory, common law and equitable obligations owed primarily by members of the [[board of directors]] to the [[corporation]] that employs them. It is a central part of [[corporate law]] and [[corporate governance]]. Directors' duties are analogous to duties owed by trustees to beneficiaries, and by agents to principals.

Among different jurisdictions, a number of similarities between the framework for directors' duties exist.

*directors owe duties to the corporation,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Percival v Wright]]'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt;  and not to individual shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite NZLII |litigants=[[Coleman v. Myers]] |year=1976 |court=NZHC |num=5 |parallelcite=[1977] 2 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 225 |courtname=auto}}, where the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that "depending upon all the surrounding circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder,"&lt;/ref&gt; employees or creditors outside exceptional circumstances
*directors' core duty is to remain loyal to the company, and avoid conflicts of interest
*directors are expected to display a high standard of care, skill or diligence
*directors are expected to act in [[good faith]] to promote the success of the corporation

== Australia ==

=== General Law ===
Directors have [[Fiduciary]] Duties under general law in Australia. They are:
*Duty to act in good faith and not to act contrary to the interest of the company
*Duty not to use power for an  improper purpose
*Duty to avoid conflicts of interest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1984|litigants=Chan v Zacharia |parallelcite=(1984) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 178 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|963|2007|litigants=ASIC v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Duty to retain discretion

===Statutory Duties===
Directors also have duties under [[Corporations Act 2001]]: 
*Section 181: Mirrors the general law duty to act in good faith, in the best interests of the company and for proper purpose.
*Section 182: Duty not to misuse position to gain advantage
*Section 183: Duty not to misuse information to gain advantage
*Section 184: Directors breach section 181, 182 and 183 for gain and where the conduct is reckless or intentionally dishonest. Criminal penalty will be applied to against director who breach 184.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quilter|first=Michael|title=The Company Law Notes|edition=4th|year=2010|publisher=Thomson Reuters|location=Pyrmont, NSW|pages=83–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breach of Duties===
There is an important distinction between the general law and statute in that there are different consequences when it comes for breach
*If a director is acting dishonestly or recklessly then there will be criminal liability imported under statute. But not in general law.
*At general law where a director breaches their duties the likely remedy will be equitable damages or statutory compensation or recission. But within context of statute it is not possible. If it is a statutory duty, ASIC will enforce statute.

==Canada==

===Tripartite Fiduciary Duty===
In Canada, a debate exists on the precise nature of directors' duties following the controversial landmark judgment in ''[[BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders]]''. This Supreme Court of Canada decision has raised questions as to the nature and extent to which directors owe a duty to non-shareholders. Scholarly literature has defined this as a "tripartite fiduciary duty", composed of (1) an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains two component duties — (2) a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and (3) a procedural duty of "fair treatment" for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the "best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen".&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Directors' duties in the United Kingdom}}

===Acting within powers===
*s.171 Companies Act 2006

Directors are also strictly charged to exercise their powers only for a proper purpose.  For instance, were a director to issue a large number of new shares, not for the purposes of raising capital but to defeat a potential takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|37|1968|litigants=[[Harlowe's Nominees Pty v. Woodside]] |parallelcite=(1968) 121 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 483 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions that would otherwise fall foul of this principle.  It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution.

Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith.  Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] decision of ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v. Ampol Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Howard Smith Ltd v. Ampol Ltd]] |year=1974 |court=UKPC |num=3 |parallelcite=[1974] {{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}} 832 |juris=NSW |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v. Cramphorn Ltd.]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt;  It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. The court rejected an argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital as too narrow, and held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teck Corporation v. Millar]]'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt;  If so, an incidental result (even desirable) that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the "proper purpose" duty as separate from the "good faith" duty however.&lt;ref&gt;This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''[[Teck Corporation v. Millar]]'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoting company success===
{{see also|Corporate benefit}}
*s.172 [[Companies Act 2006]], "to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole". It sets out six factors to which a director must have regards in fulfilling the duty to promote success. These are:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company’s employees
* the need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see e.g., s.309, which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but that could be enforced only by the shareholders, and not by the employees themselves. The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Directors must act honestly and in ''bona fide''. The test is a subjective one—the directors must act in "''[[good faith]]'' in what they consider—not what the court may consider—is in the interests of the company..." per Lord Greene MR.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Smith &amp; Fawcett Ltd]]'' [1942] Ch 304&lt;/ref&gt; However, the directors may still be held to have failed in this duty where they fail to direct their minds to the question of whether in fact a transaction was in the best interests of the company.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re W &amp; M Roith Ltd]]'' [1967] 1 WLR 432&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficult questions arise when treating the company too abstractly. For example, it may benefit a corporate group as a whole for a company to guarantee the debts of a "sister" company,&lt;ref&gt;a company with 100% the same shareholder&lt;/ref&gt; even if there is no "benefit" to the company giving the guarantee. Similarly, conceptually at least, there is no benefit to a company in returning profits to shareholders by way of dividend. However, the more pragmatic approach illustrated in the Australian case of ''[[Mills v. Mills]]'' normally prevails:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[directors are] not required by the law to live in an unreal region of detached altruism and to act in the vague mood of ideal abstraction from obvious facts which [sic] must be present to the mind of any honest and intelligent man when he exercises his powers as a director."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|4|1938|litigants=[[Mills v. Mills]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/4.pdf (1938) 60 CLR 178] |courtname=auto}} at p. 164 per Latham CJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Hutton v. West Cork Railway Co]]'' (1883) 23 Ch D 654, per [[Bowen LJ]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;"money which [sic] is not theirs but the company’s, if they are spending it for the purposes which are reasonably incidental to the carrying on of the business of the company. That is the general doctrine. Bona fides cannot be the sole test, otherwise you might have a lunatic conducting the affairs of the company, and paying away its money with both hands in a manner perfectly bona fide yet perfectly irrational… It is for the directors to judge, provided it is a matter which is reasonably incidental to the carrying on of the business of the company… The law does not say that there are to be no cakes and ale, but there are to be no cakes and ale except such as are required for the benefit of the company."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Boulting v Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians]]'' [1963] 2 QB 606

===Independent judgment===
*s.173 Companies Act 2006

Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''[[Clark v. Workman]]'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''[[Dawson International plc v. Coats Paton plc]]'' 1989 SLT 655&lt;/ref&gt;  This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract that binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

===Care and skill===
{{main|Duty of care (business associations)}}
Traditionally, the level of care and skill a director must demonstrate has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

:"a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience." (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

:"such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf."

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name="NormanGoddard"&gt;''[[Norman v. Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

*s.174, [[Companies Act 2006]]
*''[[Re Barings plc (No.5)]]'' [1999] 1 BCLC 433
*''[[Re D’Jan of London Ltd]]'' [1994] 1 BCLC 561

===Loyalty and conflicts of interest===
{{main|Duty of loyalty|Conflict of interest}}
Directors also owe strict duties not to permit any [[conflict of interest]] or conflict with their duty to act in the best interests of the company.  This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it.  In ''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting.  Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal.  And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*s.175 Companies Act 2006
*''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas. Ch.61
*''[[Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378
*''[[Cook v Deeks]]'' [1916] 1 AC 554
*''[[Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley]]'' [1972]
*''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498
*''[[In Plus Group Ltd v Pyke]]''
*''[[Foster Bryant Surveying Ltd v Bryant]]'' [2007] EWCA Civ 200
*''[[O'Donnell v Shanahan]]'' [2009] EWCA Civ 751

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

;Transactions with the company
By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution.

In many countries there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

;Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, opportunities, or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;In summary, the facts were as follows:  Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]].  They formed a new company ("Company B") to take the leases of the two new cinemas.  But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than £5,000 (a substantial sum at the time).  Company A was unable to subscribe for more than £2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends.  Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit.  The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B - the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.&lt;/ref&gt; held that:

:"(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves."

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

;Competing with the company
Directors cannot, clearly, compete directly with the company without a conflict of interests arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

*''[[Hogg v. Cramphorn Ltd.]]'' [1967] Ch 254

===Remedies for breach of duty===
As in most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

S 176 A Duty not to accept benefits from third parties.

A director must not accept financial or non financial benefits from third parties.

In addition, this international event is an opportunity to present Berlin as a vibrant location of political and economic debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Georgia participates in 3rd East Forum Berlin 2015|url = http://agenda.ge/news/33755/eng|website = agenda.ge|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
east forum Berlin 2016 took place during Germany's [[OSCE]] Chairmanship&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osce.org/cio&lt;/ref&gt; in the middle of new deadlocks and new dynamics that characterise the transforming economic and political realities in the region from Europe to Asia. The two opposing trends are embedded in new division lines leading to an unfamiliar status quo of alienation. Secondly, they are surrounded by recently formed alliances consisting of as yet poorly known stakeholders, which create new spheres of influence. These dynamics offer potential for [[economic growth|growth]] but also involve geopolitical and geo-economic challenges for all stakeholders in the region.

[[File:EconomicIntegrationEU.svg|thumb|International free trade and customs unions around the world.]]
'''Economic integration''' is the unification of economic policies between different states through the partial or full abolition of tariff and non-tariff restrictions on trade taking place among them prior to their integration.  This is meant in turn to lead to lower prices for distributors and consumers with the goal of increasing the level of welfare, while leading to an increase of economic productivity of the states.

The trade stimulation effects intended by means of economic integration are part of the contemporary economic [[Theory of the Second Best]]: where, in theory, the best option is [[free trade]], with [[free competition]] and no [[trade barriers]] whatsoever. Free trade is treated as an idealistic option, and although realized within certain developed states, economic integration has been thought of as the "second best" option for global trade where barriers to full free trade exist.

==Etymology==
In economics the word ''integration'' was first employed in industrial organisation to refer to combinations of business firms through economic agreements, cartels, concerns, trusts, and mergers—[[horizontal integration]] referring to combinations of competitors, [[vertical integration]] to combinations of suppliers with customers. In the current sense of combining separate economies into larger economic regions, the use of the word ''integration'' can be traced to the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fritz Machlup]] credits Eli Heckscher, Herbert Gaedicke and Gert von Eyern as the first users of the term ''economic integration'' in its current sense. According to Machlup, such usage first appears in the 1935 English translation of Hecksher's 1931 book ''Merkantilismen'' (''Mercantilism'' in English), and independently in Gaedicke's and von Eyern's 1933 two-volume study ''Die produktionswirtschaftliche Integration Europas: Eine Untersuchung über die Aussenhandelsverflechtung der europäischen Länder''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|pp=4–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective ==
There are economic as well as political reasons why nations pursue economic integration.  The economic rationale for the increase of trade between member states of economic unions rests on the supposed [[productivity]] gains from integration. This is one of the reasons for the development of economic integration on a global scale, a phenomenon now realized in continental [[trade bloc|economic blocs]] such as [[ASEAN]], [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], [[South American Community of Nations|SACN]], the [[European Union]], and the [[Eurasian Economic Community]]; and proposed for intercontinental economic blocks, such as the [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]] and the [[Transatlantic Free Trade Area]].

[[Comparative advantage]] refers to the ability of a person or a country to produce a particular good or service at a lower [[Marginal cost|marginal]] and [[opportunity cost]] over another. Comparative advantage was first described by [[David Ricardo]] who explained it in his 1817 book ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in an example involving England and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;The exact phrase is not found in [http://www.econlib.org/library/Ricardo/ricP.html an online version of that book].&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal it is possible to produce both [[wine]] and [[cloth]] with less labour than it would take to produce the same quantities in England.  However the relative costs of producing those two goods are different in the two countries.  In England it is very hard to produce wine, and only moderately difficult to produce cloth.  In Portugal both are easy to produce.  Therefore, while it is cheaper to produce cloth in Portugal than England, it is cheaper still for Portugal to produce excess wine, and trade that for English cloth. Conversely England benefits from this trade because its cost for producing cloth has not changed but it can now get wine at a lower price, closer to the cost of cloth. The conclusion drawn is that each country can gain by specializing in the good where it has comparative advantage, and trading that good for the other.

[[Economies of scale]] refers to the cost advantages that an enterprise obtains due to expansion. There are factors that cause a producer’s average cost per unit to fall as the scale of output is increased. Economies of scale is a long run concept and refers to reductions in unit cost as the size of a facility and the usage levels of other inputs increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A lone car maker may be profitable, however, if they export cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market.

Besides these economic reasons, the primary reasons why economic integration has been pursued in practise are largely political.  The ''[[Zollverein]]'' or German Customs Union of 1867 paved the way for [[German Question|partial German unification]] under Prussian leadership in 1871.  [[Imperial preference|"Imperial free trade"]] was (unsuccessfully) proposed in the late 19th century to strengthen the loosening ties within British Empire.  The [[European Economic Community]] was created to integrate France and Germany's economies to the point that they would find it impossible to go to war with each other.

The degree of economic integration can be categorized into seven stages:&lt;ref&gt;Page 2, Balassa, Bela. The Theory of Economic Integration (Routledge Revivals). Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Preferential trading area]]&lt;!-- this stage didn't show in Bela' book --&gt;
# [[Free trade area]]
# [[Customs union]]
# [[Common market]]
# [[Economic union]]
# [[Economic and monetary union]]
# [[Complete economic integration]]

These differ in the degree of unification of economic policies, with the highest one being the completed economic integration of the states, which would most likely involve political integration as well.

A "free trade area" (FTA) is formed when at least two states partially or fully abolish custom tariffs on their inner border. To exclude regional exploitation of zero tariffs within the FTA there is a rule of [[certificate of origin]] for the goods originating from the territory of a member state of an FTA.

A "customs union" introduces unified tariffs on the exterior borders of the union (CET, common external tariffs). A "monetary union" introduces a shared currency. A "common market" add to a FTA the free movement of services, capital and labor.

An "economic union" combines customs union with a common market. A "[[fiscal union]]" introduces a shared fiscal and budgetary policy. In order to be successful the more advanced integration steps are typically accompanied by unification of economic policies (tax, social welfare benefits, etc.), reductions in the rest of the [[trade barrier]]s, introduction of supranational bodies, and gradual moves towards the final stage, a "political union".

== Economic theory ==
The framework of the theory of economic integration was laid out by [[Jacob Viner]] (1950) who defined the [[trade creation]] and [[trade diversion]] effects, the terms introduced for the change of interregional flow of goods caused by changes in customs tariffs due to the creation of an economic union. He considered trade flows between two states prior and after their unification, and compared them with the rest of the world. His findings became and still are the foundation of the theory of economic integration. The next attempts to enlarge the static analysis towards three states+world (Lipsey, et al.) were not as successful.

The basics of the theory were summarized by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[economist]] [[Béla Balassa]] in the 1960s. As economic integration increases, the barriers of trade between markets diminish. Balassa believed that supranational common markets, with their free movement of economic factors across national borders, naturally generate demand for further integration, not only economically (via monetary unions) but also politically—and, thus, that economic communities naturally evolve into political unions over time.

The dynamic part of international economic integration theory, such as the dynamics of [[trade creation]] and [[trade diversion]] effects, the [[Pareto efficiency]] of factors (labor, capital) and value added, mathematically was introduced by Ravshanbek Dalimov. This provided an interdisciplinary approach to the previously static theory of international economic integration, showing what effects take place due to economic integration, as well as enabling the results of the non-linear sciences to be applied to the dynamics of international economic integration.

Equations describing:
# enforced oscillations of a pendulum with friction;
# predator-prey oscillations;
# heat and/or gas spatial dynamics (the [[heat equation]] and [[Navier-Stokes equations]])
were successfully applied towards:
# the dynamics of GDP;
# price-output dynamics and the dynamic matrix of the outputs of an economy;
# regional and inter-regional migration of labor income and value added, and to trade creation and trade diversion effects (inter-regional output flows).
The straightforward conclusion from the findings is that one may use the accumulated knowledge of the exact and natural sciences (physics, biodynamics, and chemical kinetics) and apply them towards the analysis and forecasting of economic dynamics.

Dynamic analysis has started with a new definition of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), as a difference between aggregate revenues of sectors and investment (a modification of the value added definition of the GDP). It was possible to analytically prove that all the states gain from economic unification, with larger states receiving less growth of GDP and productivity, and vice versa concerning the benefit to lesser states. Although this fact has been empirically known for decades, now it was also shown as being mathematically correct.

A qualitative finding of the dynamic method is the similarity of a coherence policy of economic integration and a mixture of previously separate liquids in a retort: they finally get one colour and become one liquid. Economic space (tax, insurance and financial policies, customs tariffs, etc.) all finally become the same along with the stages of economic integration.

Another important finding is a direct link between the dynamics of macro- and micro-economic parameters such as the evolution of industrial clusters and the GDP's temporal and spatial dynamics. Specifically, the dynamic approach analytically described the main features of the theory of competition summarized by [[Michael Porter]], stating that industrial clusters evolve from initial entities gradually expanding within their geographic proximity. It was analytically found that the geographic expansion of industrial clusters goes along with raising their productivity and technological innovation.

Domestic savings rates of the member states were observed to strive to one magnitude, and the dynamic method of forecasting this phenomenon has also been developed. Overall dynamic picture of economic integration has been found to look quite similar to unification of previously separate basins after opening intraboundary sluices, where instead of water the value added (revenues) of entities of member states interact.

== Success factors ==
Among the requirements for successful development of economic integration are "permanency" in its evolution (a gradual expansion and over time a higher degree of economic/political unification); "a formula for sharing joint revenues" (customs duties, licensing etc.) between member states (e.g., per capita); "a process for adopting decisions" both economically and politically; and "a will to make concessions" between developed and developing states of the union.

A "coherence" policy is a must for the permanent development of economic unions, being also a property of the economic integration process. Historically the success of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] opened a way for the formation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) which involved much more than just the two sectors in the ECSC. So a coherence policy was implemented to use a different speed of economic unification (coherence) applied both to economic sectors and economic policies. Implementation of the coherence principle in adjusting  economic policies in the member states of economic block causes [[economic integration effects]].

== Global economic integration ==

With economics crisis started in 2008 the global economy has started to realize quite a few initiatives on regional level.
It is unification between the EU and US, expansion of Eurasian Economic Community (now Eurasia Economic Union) by Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. It is also the creation of BRICS with the bank of its members, and notably high motivation of creating competitive economic structures within Shanghai Organization, also creating the bank with many multi-currency instruments applied. Engine for such fast and dramatic changes was insufficiency of global capital, while one has to mention obvious large political discrepancies witnessed in 2014-2015. Global economy has to overcome this by easing the moves of capital and labor, while this is impossible unless the states will find common point of views in resolving cultural and politic differences which pushed it so far as of now.

[[Globalization]] refers to the increasing global relationships of [[culture]], people, and economic activity.

'''Elias Elia''' is a [[Greek Cypriot]] businessman whose profile made headlines after multiple airlines across Europe collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aangirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/airline-goes-bust-mysterious-elias-elia.html|work=Analysis|accessdate=6 September 2012|title=Mysterious Elias Elia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the owner of [[E-Clear]], a $ billion company that handled payments mostly for the travel industry.

==Background==
Elias was successful in the travel payment industry. In an interview he said, "We're here today to expand on the collaborations with airlines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elias Elia, CEO, eClear|url=http://www.terrapinn.com/story.aspx?id=51|publisher=Terrapinn|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He tried to prop up another company after buying [[E-Clear]] back from its administrators. A report claimed that Elia bought a brand-new £135,000 Ferrari in the spring of 2008 and a £155,000 Rolls-Royce Phantom, in May of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/elias-eliarsquos-buyback-of-bits-of-collapsed-eclear-investigated-1986709.html|publisher=Independent|title=Elias Elia buys back bits of collapsed EClear | location=London|first=Simon|last=Evans|date=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Companies==
Links were found from Elias to Elian properties and the Allbury Travel Group, both of which also went into administration soon after E-Clear's demise.

'''Financial distress''' is a term in [[corporate finance]] used to indicate a condition when promises to [[creditors]] of a company are broken or honored with difficulty. If financial distress cannot be relieved, it can lead to [[bankruptcy]]. Financial distress is usually associated with some costs to the company; these are known as ''costs of financial distress''.

==Cost==
A common example of a cost of financial distress are bankruptcy costs. These direct costs include auditors' fees, legal fees, management fees and other payments. Cost of financial distress can occur even if bankruptcy is avoided (indirect costs).

Financial distress in companies requires management attention and might lead to reduced attention on the operations of the company.

Another source of indirect costs of financial distress are higher costs of capital as usually banks increase the interest rates if a state of financial distress occurs.

==Options for relieving financial distress==
If high debt burden is the cause of financial distress, the company can undergo a [[debt restructuring]]. If operational issues are the reason for the distress, the company can negotiate a payment holiday with its creditors and improve operations to be able to service its debt.

'''Ford Richardson Bryan''' (May 13, 1912 – May 14, 2004) was a member of the [[Ford family]] of [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], who provided authentic historical information about the Ford family based almost entirely the [[Ford Archives]] of [[Henry Ford Museum]] and associated Greenfield Village. 

Born in [[Crystal, Michigan]], Bryan graduated from [[Eastern Michigan University]] in 1934; he then received his master's degree from [[University of Michigan]] in 1941. From family [[bible]]s, family legend, correspondence, and the historical archives of Dearborn, he traced the family history from England to Ireland, then to America, and in 1832 to the wilderness of the Michigan Territory, much of which was included in his book ''The Fords of Dearborn'' ({{ISBN|978-0-9727843-1-3}}) includes genealogical tables and more than 125 illustrations depicting family members, their farms, homes, and their relationships. Bryan joined [[Ford Motor Company]] as a [[Spectrochemical Analysis|spectrochemical analyst]] following [[World War II]]. Over the course of thirty-three years, he would move on to the [[Ford]] [[Science|Scientific Laboratory]], publishing more than seventy technical papers on optical spectroscopy. Following his retirement from Ford, he became a volunteer at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] &amp; Greenfield Village. His yen for writing led him to the Ford Archives, where he found a [[gold mine]] of material about his own family and about his favorite subject, [[Henry Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalnet.lib.mi.us/henryford/docs/FordRBryanPapers_Accession1527.pdf Benson Ford Research Center-Ford Richardson Bryan papers]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Works==
Bryan wrote many books about Henry Ford including:
* ''Rouge: Pictured in Its Prime''
* ''Friends, Families &amp; Forays''
* ''Clara: Mrs. Henry Ford''
* ''Beyond the Model T: The Other Ventures of Henry Ford''
* ''Henry's Attic: Some Fascinating Gifts to Henry Ford and His Museum''
* ''Henry's Lieutenants''

Despite the increasing literature related to the topics of [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment(FDI)]] in manufacturing sector of European transitional economies, the ones related to FDI in the banking sector have received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;Voinea, L., and Mihaescu, M., (2006), “The Determinants of Foreign Banking Activity in South East Europe: Do FDI, Bilateral Trade and EU Policies Matter?”, Global Development Network Southeast Europe&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, over the past years numerous studies and theories have emerged in an attempt to explain the motives behind foreign bank entry in CEE countries. Although there is not a universally accepted theory explaining the motives behind a Banks decision to start it operations abroad several reasons are addressed in the existing literature.&lt;ref&gt;Buch, C.M., (2000), “Why do Banks go Abroad? - Evidence from German Data, "Financial Markets Institutions and Instruments" Vol. 9 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;).  Research has revealed factors like the degree of economic integration between the home and host country, market opportunities available and entry restrictions like the factors that affect a banks decision to start its operations on a foreign market.&lt;ref&gt;Bol, H. and R.Lensink, J.de Haan (2002), “Do Reforms in Transition Economies Affect Foreign Bank Entry?” CCSO Working Paper No. 05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lensink,. R and de Haan, J., (2002), “Do Reforms in Transition Economies Affect Foreign Bank Entry?” International Review of Finance, Vol. 3:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Follow the customer / level of integration between home and host country ==

One of the most important reason that affects a banks decision to entry a foreign market is to “follow the customer” also called the defensive hypothesis.  Foreign banks building upon the expertise in their home country they can differentiate themselves from their competitors in the host country by offering complex and specialized services to their home country corporate customers.  Years of long-lasting relationship have provided the banks with crucial information about the unique financial needs that their clients have, the knowledge of which is unavailable to host country institutions. In addition, through this relationship banks are able to develop a competitive advantage stemming through the lower marginal costs that those banks experience when dealing with loan renewals over their local competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, T. (2003): “Determinants of German Foreign Direct Investment in Latin American and Asian Emerging Markets in the 1990s”, Economic Research Centre of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Discussion Paper No. 11/03.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike manufacturing where knowledge can be protected through [[patterns]] and other means, commercial intelligence can be easily gained by any bank with an interest in starting its operations in specific market or industries. In addition, letting other [[financial institution]]s to develop a relationship with its existing corporate clients can result in the loss of market share in the banks home county.  In order to prevent this from happening banks are obliged to follow the client by opening an office (branch, subsidiary) abroad themselves in order to defend their unique bank client relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, T. (2003): “Determinants of German Foreign Direct Investment in Latin American and Asian Emerging Markets in the 1990s”, Economic Research Centre of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Discussion Paper No. 11/03.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attractiveness of the host country ==
The attractiveness of the host country is another motive that according to scholars drives foreign bank entry into a foreign market. According to this argument a number of factors like [[GDP]], size, distance, financial development, and profit opportunities are identified as the ones that shape the overall attractiveness of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Lensink,. R and de Haan, J., (2002), “Do Reforms in Transition Economies Affect Foreign Bank Entry?” International Review of Finance, Vol. 3:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Host country regulation ==
Foreign banks will to engage themselves in banking FDI may have long existed, however the ability to do so was restricted by barriers to entry that existed in many [[Emerging markets|Emerging Markets Economies]] until recently. Only after the authorities of those countries in the mid-1990s begun to actively pursue a policy aiming to the privatisation of their domestic banking institutions through the participation of foreign investors’ foreign bank entry was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa. F., (2004), “A Note on Banking FDI in Emerging Markets: Literature Review and Evidence from M&amp;A Data” International Finance Division, Bank of England&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of host country regulations on foreign bank entry are straightforward since restrictions on foreign bank present generally limits competition and protect inefficient domestic banks. Since the majority of those countries are now in a transition process towards a democratic market economy the degree to which the reform process has taken place (level of economic reforms, and political freedom) is an important consideration that foreign banks are taken into account before entering the country. Countries that have successfully introduced reforms aiming at establishing transparent and enforceable rules regarding their financial markets are the ones that considered more attractive for foreign banks.&lt;ref&gt;Lensink,. R and de Haan, J., (2002), “Do Reforms in Transition Economies Affect Foreign Bank Entry?” International Review of Finance, Vol. 3:3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, G., R. Cull, M. S. Martinez-Peria and S. M. SaÂnchez (2001), `Foreign Bank Entry: Experience, Implications for Developing Countries, and Agenda for Further Research' , World Bank paper, October.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Gurney du Pont''' (May 27, 1850 &amp;ndash; November 7, 1904&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delaware Vital Records, 1650-1974|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QK9R-JBF2|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the creator of [[smokeless powder|smokeless gunpowder]]. Du Pont served as superintendent of the Upper and [[Lower Hagley Yards]] and later as  general manager of [[Carney's Point, New Jersey]], in 1891. His invention was assisted by cousin [[Pierre S. du Pont]]. His son was [[E. Paul du Pont]], founder of [[Du Pont Motors]].

==Biography==
He was the youngest son of [[Alexis I. du Pont]] and the grandson of [[E. I. du Pont]].

Joining the firm as partner in 1873, he became one of the three vice presidents. Even with the death of [[Eugene du Pont]] in 1902, Francis Du Pont declined the presidency of the firm due to ill health. He wanted to sell the company to competitor [[Laflin &amp; Rand]]. A traditionalist, Du Pont mistrusted the modern business practices that he correctly believed the younger generation would implement at DuPont. He lost control to the company to [[Alfred I. du Pont]], [[T. Coleman du Pont]] and [[Pierre S. du Pont]] in 1902 with the formation of the [[E. I du Pont de Nemours Company]].

He died in 1904.

'''George N. Stonbely''' (born December 7, 1945) is an American advertising entrepreneur and civic leader known for his work and advocacy in New York's [[Times Square]].

Born in 1945 in [[Park Slope, Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], George N. Stonbely graduated from [[New York University]] in 1967. While still in college, he first volunteered then worked as a legislative researcher for Robert F. Kennedy, who was the United States Senator from New York at the time. Stonbely worked briefly in sales promotion and advertising for the ''New York Times'', then in 1975, he founded Spectacolor, Inc., an advertising company that pioneered the first full-color, computer-programmed, changeable message billboard. This groundbreaking innovation introduced the concept of selling ''time'' on billboards, rather than the customary practice of selling ''space'', a change that would pave the way for outdoor advertising to become a multibillion-dollar industry.

The first Spectacolor sign was installed at [[One Times Square]], the building from which the world-famous [[Times Square Ball]] is dropped every New Year's Eve. Eventually more than 60 Spectacolor signs (including static signs, video displays, and 3D spectacular signs) were installed in Times Square, along with more than 50 Spectacolor systems in 30 cities in [[Europe]], [[South America]], the [[Middle East]], and across the [[United States]]. In 1984, Spectacolor was chosen by the [[Marriott Corporation]] to develop the premiere signage on its new [[New York Marriott Marquis|Marriott Marquis Hotel]], the first of the developments that led to the rebirth of Times Square that began in the 1980s. The flagship sign, the [[Eastman Kodak Company]]'s "Kodarama" display, signaled the return of corporate America to Times Square for the first time since the end of World War II. Soon Kodak was joined by [[Hertz]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[JVC]], [[Chock Full o' Nuts]], [[Maxwell House]] Coffee Company, Planters Peanuts, and [[Wrigley Company|Wrigley]], to name a few of the iconic brands that helped reestablish a mainstream marketing presence in Times Square.

By 2000, Spectacolor was the world leader in spectacular advertising, operating in over 30 cities around the globe. That year, Stonbely partnered with Arizona entrepreneur [[Karl Eller]] and [[Clear Channel Communications]] to form Clear Channel Spectacolor, which he sold to Clear Channel in 2006.

A long-time Times Square advocate, Stonbely is a founding director of the Times Square Alliance and serves on the Mayor's Midtown Citizens Committee. He is also active in numerous international and local charitable organizations, including [[UNICEF]], [[Partnership for a Drug Free America]], and the Greater New York Boy Scouts. He serves on the Board of Directors of [[Inside Broadway]] and [[The Town Hall]].

Upon his death in 1999, legendary outdoor advertising designer [[Douglas Leigh]] willed Stonbely his famous lighted snowflake, which has been suspended above the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in [[Manhattan]] every holiday season since 1984. In 2001, Stonbely dedicated the snowflake to [[UNICEF]], for which more than $50 million has been raised since the UNICEF Snowflake Ball gala was launched in 2004.

'''F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: [[Pharmaceutical company|Pharmaceutical]]s and [[Roche Diagnostics|Diagnostics]]. Its [[holding company]], '''Roche Holding AG''', has bearer shares listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].

The company controls the American biotechnology company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2016 were 50.58 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,&lt;ref name="FR16" /&gt; or approximately US$51 billion. Roche is the third-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.&lt;ref name="pharmexec50"&gt;[http://www.pharmexec.com/pharm-execs-top-50-companies-2018 Pharm Exec's 2018 ranking of the top 50 pharma companies worldwide], www.pharmexec.com. Retrieved 21 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm [[Novartis]] owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2016 as the 30th consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/de/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2014-03-04.htm|title=Roche - Roche Annual General Meeting 2014|work=roche.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314234724/http://www.roche.com/de/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2014-03-04.htm|archivedate=14 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; F.

==History==
Founded in 1896 by [[Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche]], the company was early on known for producing various [[vitamin]] preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.

In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.&lt;ref name="fundingroche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981—2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to [[Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings]]).&lt;ref name="sec950515"&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/ds2yr.a4.htm Laboratory Corp of America Holdings · 10-Q · For 3/31/95], SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/15/95, SEC File 1-11353, Accession Number 920148-95-11&lt;/ref&gt; Roche acquired [[Syntex]] in 1994 and [[Chugai Pharmaceuticals]] in 2002.

[[Oseltamivir]] is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the [[H5N1|bird flu]]. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]].  Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.&lt;ref name="royalty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14507&amp;hed=Roche%2C+Gilead+End+Tamiflu+Feud
|work=[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]|title=Roche, Gilead End Tamiflu Feud|date=16 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1120533,00.html|title=Why Roche Released Tamiflu|accessdate=2008-05-22|last=Kher|first=Unmesh|date=2005-10-19|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to [[Afucosylated monoclonal antibodies|afucosylate antibodies]]; one of its products in development was [[obinutuzumab]], which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].&lt;ref name="roche"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205033013/http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2015 |title=Roche - Roche acquires Swiss based GlycArt Biotechnology to strengthen expertise in therapeutic antibody research |publisher=roche.com |accessdate=2015-04-29 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002757/https://ec.europa.eu/research/health/pdf/event04/joel-jean-mairet-31032011_en.pdf Presentation: GlycArt Biotechnology AG From Inception to trade sale – and what happened after...] by Dr. Joël Jean-Mairet.

[[Stanley Adams (whistleblower)|Stanley Adams]], Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking [[antitrust laws]], engaging in [[price fixing]] and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure&amp;nbsp;— an offence under Swiss law&amp;nbsp;— and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/nov/25/businessofresearch.research | title=Blowing the final whistle | last = Mathiason | first = Nick| work=[[The Observer]] | date=25 November 2001 | accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for [[vitamin supplement|vitamins]] sold in the US and globally.  Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/top100.html#Annotated Corporate Crime Reporter]. Corporate Crime Reporter.

An '''independent contractor''' is a [[natural person]], [[business]], or [[corporation]] that provides [[good (accounting)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] to another entity under terms specified in a [[contract]] or within a [[oral contract|verbal agreement]]. Unlike an [[employment#Employee|employee]], an independent contractor does not work regularly for an [[employer]] but works as and when required, during which time he or she may be subject to [[law of agency]]. Independent contractors are usually paid on a [[freelance]] basis. Contractors often work through a [[limited company]] or [[Franchising|franchise]], which they themselves own, or may work through an [[umbrella company]].

In the United States, any company or organization engaged in a trade or business that pays more than $600 to an independent contractor in one year is required to [[Tax information reporting|report]] this to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) as well as to the contractor, using [[Form 1099-MISC]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|26|6041}} and 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.6041-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099msc.pdf Sample form 1099-MISC]&lt;/ref&gt; This form is merely a report of the money paid; independent contractors do not have income taxes withheld like regular employees.

==Versus employee ==
{{Main|Misclassification of employees as independent contractors}}
The distinction between independent contractor and employee is an important one in the United States, as the costs for business owners to maintain employees are significantly higher than the costs associated with hiring independent contractors, due to federal and state requirements for employers to pay FICA ([[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes) and [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment]] taxes on received income for employees.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;  Likewise, employees are protected from being fired without cause, and if fired or let go for other reasons are entitled to unemployment benefits, whereas independent contractors have neither protection nor entitlement. Employees are also entitled to receive [[overtime]] pay for work performed over the 40-hour-per-week standard, whereas independent contractors may work any number of hours (including far above this standard) with no change in pay.

In the early 1990s, the IRS methodically began to look for employers who were misclassifying employees as independent contractors, and has since obtained billions of dollars in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] [[back taxes]].&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last = Brabec|first= Barbara|authorlink=|title=How to Maximize Schedule C Deductions &amp; Cut Self-Employment Taxes to the BONE -|publisher=Barbara Brabec Productions |date=November 26, 2014 |location=| pages=107|isbn= 978-0985633318|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, worker classification initiatives have been a top priority for the IRS, the Department of Labor, and state agencies. In 2011, the IRS and the Department of Labor entered into a [[memorandum of understanding]] in an effort to jointly increase worker misclassification audits.&lt;ref name="The National Law Review"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koch|first1=Matthew|title=The Tax Risks of Misclassifying Employees|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/tax-risks-misclassifying-employees|accessdate=June 14, 2014|work=The National Law Review|publisher=McBrayer, McGinnis, Leslie and Kirkland, PLLC|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Supreme Court]] has offered the following guidelines to distinguish employees from independent contractors:

{{Ordered list |The extent to which services are integral to the employer's business. Greater integration favors an employee-employer relationship. |The permanence of the relationship. More established relationships favor employee status.|The amount of investment in equipment. When a worker makes a significant investment in the equipment they use in working for someone else, this suggests an independent contractor relationship.|The degree of control by the principal. More control favors employee-employer status.|The amount of financial risk. More opportunity for profit or loss favors an independent contractor relationship.|The amount of initiative, judgment or foresight in open-market competition with others required for the success of the claimed independent enterprise. Entrepreneurial and distinctive work favors an independent contractor relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/financial-control|title=Financial Control|date=September 13, 2017|publisher=IRS|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The IRS, for federal income tax, applies a "right to control test" which considers the nature of the working relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McConville|first1=Timothy M.|title=Don't Misclassify Workers as Independent Contractors|journal=The National Law Review|date=May 20, 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/don-t-misclassify-workers-independent-contractors|accessdate=June 14, 2014|publisher=Odin, Feldman &amp; Pittleman, P.C.|issn=2161-3362}}&lt;/ref&gt; They highlight three general aspects of the employment arrangement:

#financial control 
#behavioral control
#relationship between the parties

In general, their criteria parallel those of the Supreme Court in sentiment. They include guidelines such as the amount of instruction, training, integration, use of assistants, length of professional relationship, regularity of work, location of work, payment schedule, source of funds for business expenditures, right to quit, and financial risk more typically seen with each work category. In their framework, independent contractors retain control over schedule and hours worked, jobs accepted, and performance monitoring. They also can have a major investment in equipment, furnish their own supplies, provide their own insurance, repairs, and other expenses related to their business. They may also perform a unique service that is not in the normal course of business of the employer. This contrasts with employees, who usually work at the schedule required by the employer, and whose performance the employer directly supervises. Independent contractors can also work for multiple firms, and offer their services to the general public.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

The distinction between independent contractors and employees is not always clear, and continues to evolve. For example, some independent contractors may work for a number of different organizations throughout the year, while others retain independent contractor status although they work for the same organization the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/faqs/faq-kw5.html IRS Frequently Asked Questions about form 1099-MISC]&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies, for example in the freight transport industry, specify the schedule for the independent contractor, require purchase of vehicles from the company and prohibit work for other companies.&lt;ref name="The National Law Review"/&gt;

In July 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor issued new guidelines on the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. "A worker who is economically dependent on an employer is suffered or permitted to work by the employer. Thus, applying the economic realities test in view of the expansive definition of "employ" under the Act, most workers are employees under the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]."&lt;ref name=Weil&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|... the economic realities of the relationship, and not the label an employer gives it, are determinative. Thus, an agreement between an employer and a worker designating or labeling the worker as an independent contractor is not indicative of the economic realities of the working relationship and is not relevant to the analysis of the worker's status.&lt;ref name = Weil /&gt;}}

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Independent contracting has both benefits and drawbacks to contractors.

===Advantages===
* Since they are rarely tied to an employer, they are free to set their own rules of business, limited only by [[bargaining power]].
* Since they usually develop a large network of clients, the loss of one or two often has a negligible effect.
* Many people simply like the idea of "[[Self-employment|being your own boss]]." Aside from materialistic benefits, many people simply enjoy not having to answer to a supervisor.
* As an artist/author of any tangible artwork, such as paintings, sculptures, photographs, or written works, a person is entitled to exclusive copyright ownership if they created the work as an independent contractor. If the person created such works while in the employ of another person or corporation, the rights belong to the employer (under most standard employment contracts).

Firms in the [[sharing economy]] such as [[Uber]] can gain substantial advantages via the [[misclassification of employees as independent contractors]].&lt;ref name=Medium42015&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lauren Smiley|title=What Strippers Can Teach Uber|url=https://medium.com/matter/what-strippers-can-teach-uber-1f5b15e5b427|accessdate=April 21, 2015|issue=Medium.com|date=April 20, 2015|quote=Many of these companies are built with workers who are not even considered workers at all. In a twist of business logic that drives much of the sharing economy, these delivery people, drivers, and maids aren't employees – they're entrepreneurs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* In the United States, an [[Internal Revenue Service]] computer algorithm matches individuals with [[Form 1099]]s to the company that pays them. If an independent contractor reports more than $10,000 of earnings, or majority of income from a single source, the IRS is likely to question the independence of the worker, and investigate the company that issued the Form 1099.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; 
* Employer [[misclassification of employees as independent contractors]] either inadvertently or to avoid taxation and regulation, is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/business/18workers.html "U.S. Cracks Down on ‘Contractors' as a Tax Dodge"] article by Steven Greenhouse in ''[[The New York Times]]'' February 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, contractorization has been used as an indirect form of [[union-busting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2012/04/25/taxes_for_union_busting/ Salon - Taxes for union busting]&lt;/ref&gt;
* An independent contractor can itself be a business with employees; however, in most cases in the United States independent contractors operate as a [[sole proprietorship]] or single-member [[limited liability company]]. This means the independent contractor, as a business owner, incurs its own expenses to provide the contracted service, must acquire its own equipment to perform the service, and is responsible for business filings such as income tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/124016/truck-drivers-to-lose-jobs Radio New Zealand - Truck drivers to lose jobs]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Independent contractors are responsible for their own [[Self-employment|self-employment tax]], which consists of both halves of the FICA tax amount.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/definitions/fica.htm definition of FICA Tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112124926/http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/definitions/fica.htm |date=January 12, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  An employee only pays the employee portion of the FICA tax.  Self-employment taxes are not withheld from the earnings of independent contractors who are required to voluntarily declare and pay [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/ch02.html estimated earnings taxes] to the IRS, which can lead to a trap for contractors who run into financial difficulty and become tempted to put off making the required estimated tax payments.
* There are several monetary incentives that are guaranteed to employees in the [[United States]], but not independent contractors.  Examples include [[worker's compensation]] and [[unemployment insurance]]; however, independent contractors are allowed to make [[Individual Retirement Account]] contributions.
* In many jurisdictions, [[occupational safety and health]] regulations are less comprehensive for independent contractors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.times-standard.com/localnews/ci_20077560 Times-Standard - Logger deaths highlight safety concerns; contractors exempt from state guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent contracting in tort==
The employer of an independent contractor is generally not held [[vicariously liable]] for the [[tort]]ious acts and omissions of the contractor, because the control and supervision found in an employer–employee or principal–agent relationship is lacking. However, vicarious liability will be imposed in some circumstances:
#where the contractor injures an [[invitee]] to the [[real property]] of the employer, 
#the contractor is involved in an ultra-hazardous activity (one likely to cause substantial injury, such as blasting with explosives), or
#the employer is [[estoppel|estopped]] from denying liability because he has held out the independent contractor as if he were simply an employee or agent.
#the employer is involved in an operation subject to obligations imposed by a public authority

==Alternatives==
Due to the higher expense of maintaining employees, many employers needing to transition from independent contractors to employees may find the switch difficult. There is a transitional status for employees as an alternative to independent contracting known as being a [[statutory employee]]. Statutory employees are less expensive to hire than classic employees because the employer does not have to pay unemployment tax. However, they are more expensive than independent contractors because [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes must be paid on wages. Similarly to independent contractors, statutory employees can deduct their trade or business expenses from their W2 earnings.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

===Dependent contractor===
A growing number of workers do not neatly fit the government's categorizations of independent contractors and statutory employees, and are increasingly being classified as dependent contractors. Some of these contingent workforce—independent contractors, temporary workers, and part-time workers, who work when and for how long they want, such as those who work for such companies as [[Uber]], Handybook, Inc., and [[CrowdFlower]]—have filed lawsuits that argue that companies that substantially control workers' work and behaviors while working (such as at Handybook, Inc.: when to knock on customers' doors vs. ring the doorbells, and how to use the customers' bathrooms) should be covered by minimum-wage and overtime rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as receive other traditional employee protections. Wilma Liebman, former chairperson of the National Labor Relations Board, has observed that Canada and Germany have such protections in place for contingent workers. And UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] has appointed an overseer for freelance workers in that country, to determine how the government should support freelance workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dependent Contractor?|url=https://aseonline.org/ArticleDetailsPage/tabid/7442/ArticleID/1112/The-Dependent-Contractor.aspx|author=DeSantis, Joe |date=   February 4, 2015 | website=American Society of Employers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-if-there-were-a-new-type-of-worker-dependent-contractor-1422405831|title=What if There Were a New Type of Worker?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">'''John E. Jeuck''' (October 17, 1916 - December 18, 2009) was an American professor of [[business]] and dean (1952-1955) of the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]]. He was best known for his work on business history and [[corporate strategy]], especially his profile of [[Sears]] in his 1950 book ''Catalogues and Counters: A History of Sears, Roebuck and Company'' with Boris Emmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Catalogues_and_Counters.html?id=E3-wAAAAIAAJ | title = Catalogues and Counters: A History of Sears, Roebuck and Company | author1 = Emmet | first1 = Boris | last2 = Jeuck | first2 = John E | year = 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received the national award of the [[American Marketing Association]] in 1951.

Jeuck spent most of his career at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving his Bachelor of Arts in 1937, MBA in 1938, and PhD in 1949. A veteran of the [[United States Navy]], he joined the University faculty three years before he received his PhD. As dean, he changed the school's curriculum and helped establish a downtown campus for part-time MBA students. Jeuck also increased faculty retention by eliminating a requirement that professors give their consulting fees to the school.&lt;ref name="articles.chicagotribune"&gt;Hopkins, Jared, "John E.

Purcell]] of [[Morgan Stanley]], [[J. William Uhrig]], and [[Peter G. Peterson]] of the [[Blackstone Group]]) helped him establish the Distinguished Fellows Program at the University, which provides five MBA students with a scholarship, stipend, and mentoring by [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/d/harry-l-davis Harry Davis], The University of Chicago Booth School of Business Roger L. and Rachel M.

He received the [[McKinsey Award for Excellence in Teaching]] in 1979 and retired from teaching in 1988.&lt;ref name="news.uchicago" /&gt; During his career, he served as a [[consultant]] to over a dozen companies, including [[Sears]], [[IBM]], and [[Coca-Cola]]. He also served as a director of [[The Walgreen Company]] and was a visiting professor at [[Stanford University]], [[Dartmouth College]], and the [[University of North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="gsbfellows" /&gt;

'''John Murdoch Harbert III''' (July 19, 1921 – March 31, 1995) was an American businessman. He is best known for building his international construction company, [[Harbert Corporation]], into one of the world's largest, along with creating a personal wealth of well over $1.7 billion. Harbert lived with his wife [[Marguerite Harbert|Marguerite]] in the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama suburb of [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]].

John is also the older brother of late Birmingham businessman [[Bill L. Harbert]], who was a co-founder of Harbert Corp. and who headed up the company's international operations. In 1993 Harbert Corp. sold its international construction division to Bill. Today the company's former international construction division is known as [[B.L. Harbert International]] and is run by Bill's son Billy.

==Life==
Mr. Harbert served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He received a degree in [[civil engineering]] from [[Auburn University]] in 1946. In 1949, he founded the Harbert Corporation. The company main business was its domestic and international construction unit, which at the time was one of the largest in the country. In the early 1990s the company sold its domestic construction operation. It also sold its international construction division around the same time to John's brother Bill L. Harbert, which today is known as B.L. Harbert International. Other company subsidiaries engaged in mining, [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] development, land development, [[limestone]] quarrying, road construction. Harbert projects are numerous in Alabama, but the company had many projects in the Middle East as well. In metro Birmingham, Harbert's best known projects include the Elton B. Stephens Expressway (also called the Red Mountain Expressway, [[U.S. Highway 280]]), the Riverchase planned community, the accompanying [[Riverchase Galleria]], the state's largest shopping center, and the [[Regions-Harbert Plaza]].

A lengthy section of [[Interstate 459]], the belt highway around the south side of metro Birmingham, is named for Harbert.

Harbert was a noted philanthropist, with numerous contributions to   Auburn University and to [[Birmingham-Southern College]], where a building bears his wife's name.

Harbert was married to the former [[Marguerite Harbert|Marguerite "Wita" Jones]]. The couple had three children, John Murdoch IV, Raymond, and Marguerite. John Harbert died on March 31, 1995. He was friends with [[T. Boone Pickens]], and at one time was his business partner. His company continues to this day under the leadership of his son Raymond and operates under the name [[Harbert Management Corporation]].

Born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], Lillie May Carroll Jackson was the seventh child of [[Methodist]] Minister Charles Henry Carroll (who claimed descent from [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]) and Amanda Bowen Carroll who was said to be the granddaughter of a free-born [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] chief named John Bowen. After completing her public school education and graduating from the Colored High School and Normal School in 1909, Jackson became a second-grade teacher at the old Biddle Street School.&lt;ref name=msa&gt;[http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/013500/013566/html/13566bio.html Lillie Carroll Jackson, MSA SC 3520-13566]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family history===
Jackson grew up singing soprano in the choir of the Sharp Street Baptist Church. On an occasion when the church was used to show religious motion pictures, she met Methodist [[Evangelism|evangelist]] Keiffer Albert Jackson of [[Carrollton, Mississippi]]. A promoter of religious films, Jackson requested that she sing a song entitled "The Holy City". Years later, in 1910, they were married. Once they were married they began to travel together, she sang while the silent pictures were shown and lectured wherever he showed his films.&lt;ref name=msa/&gt;

Upon the arrival of their first child, the Jackson family settled in Baltimore. In addition to her oldest child, Virginia, Mrs. Jackson gave birth to two other girls, [[Juanita Jackson Mitchell|Juanita Elizabeth]] (born January 2, 1913) and Marion, followed by one son, Bowen Keiffer.

During 1918 Jackson experienced a life changing crisis. She underwent emergency surgery for [[mastoiditis]]. The procedure was so extensive her doctor told her that he "had removed more decayed bone from her head than he thought possible to survive". As a result, the right side of her face was permanently disfigured. Most photos of her henceforth were taken from the left side to conceal her scars.&lt;ref name=moe&gt;[http://www.mdoe.org/jacksonlilliecarroll.html Jackson, Lillie M. Carroll (1889-1975) at the Maryland Online Encyclopedia], accessed November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was literally the mother of the civil rights movement. Her daughter [[Juanita Jackson Mitchell|Juanita]], the first African-American woman to practice law in Maryland, married [[Clarence Mitchell Jr.]] September 7, 1938.&lt;ref name=juanita&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/2147/Juanita_Mitchell_an_activist_for_life  Juanita Mitchell, an activist for life!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119063152/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/2147/Juanita_Mitchell_an_activist_for_life |date=2005-11-19 }}, accessed November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell's brother [[Parren Mitchell]] was the first African-American congressman from Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6neInMeRaEgC&amp;pg=PA778&amp;dq=Dr.+Lillie+May+Carroll+Jackson+juanita+mitchell&amp;ei=Ur80R975A5mepgLd9I3HDw&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=KgpA5OmqDy0y2LD-Kl_FkbIkvfU#PPA778,M1 The Papers of Clarence Mitchell, Jr.], Clarence Maurice Mitchell, Ohio University Press, 2005, p. 778.&lt;/ref&gt; Juanita and Clarence had four sons: [[Clarence M. Mitchell, III]] (a former [[Maryland State Senate|state senator]]), Michael Bowen Mitchell Sr.(former state senator and [[Baltimore City Council]] member), Keiffer Jackson Mitchell, [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], and George Davis Mitchell.&lt;ref name=juanita/&gt; Kieffer Mitchell's son, [[Keiffer J. Mitchell Jr.]] was a Baltimore City Council member (and is currently a delegate) and [[Clarence M. Mitchell, IV]] was a member of the Maryland State Senate.

==Civil rights activism==
As a successful owner of rental property, Jackson was free to engage in activities which led to community improvement. She sponsored the City-Wide Young Peoples forum with her daughter Juanita in the leadership in the early 1930s. The forum conducted a campaign to end racial segregation beginning with the [[grassroots]] "Buy Where You Can Work" campaign of 1931. Jackson and  her daughter Juanita along with the forums' members encouraged African-American residents of Baltimore to shop only at businesses where they could work, boycotting businesses with discriminatory hiring practices. The campaign's success led to similar protests in other cities around the country.

At one forum gathering, [[Charles Hamilton Houston]], informed the audience "we could sue [[Jim Crow]] out of Maryland". Subsequently, [[Carl Murphy]] of the ''[[Afro-American (newspaper)|Afro-American]]'' newspaper suggested that Lillie join forces with the NAACP. That was the beginning of her 35-year tenure with the NAACP, in a role as president of the Baltimore branch in 1935, a position she held until retirement in 1970. 1934 saw the beginning of [[Thurgood Marshall]]'s employment with the Baltimore NAACP branch. The next year he won a landmark case financed by the Baltimore NAACP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2200/sc2221/000011/000011/pdf/d007116a.pdf "Donald Gaines Murray dies at 72"], ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', April 10, 1986, accessed November 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray v. Pearson]], removing the color barrier from admissions to the [[University of Maryland School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naacpbaltimore.org/timeline.html NAACP Baltimore City Branch - Time Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627042951/http://www.naacpbaltimore.org/timeline.html |date=2007-06-27 }}, accessed November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 she founded the Maryland state conference of the NAACP &lt;ref name=moe/&gt; and was elected to the National Board of Directors in 1948.&lt;ref name=naacp&gt;[http://www.naacpbaltimore.org/bio-jackson.html NAACP Baltimore City Branch - Past Presidents - Dr. Lillie M. Carroll Jackson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629054214/http://www.naacpbaltimore.org/bio-jackson.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, accessed November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the NAACP won a historic legal challenge to racial barriers in publicly funded institutions. A court judgment overturned city policy assuring all Baltimore city school teachers received equal pay. Jackson's 1942 movement to register black voters began a shift in city politics. That same year she was named to Maryland's first Interracial Commission. She was also fundamental to Baltimore being the first Southern city to integrate its schools after the landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision.&lt;ref name=naacp/&gt; Baltimore's Fair Employment Practices law was passed in 1958. She was such a force in Maryland and Baltimore politics that Governor [[Theodore McKeldin]] was noted to have said of her, "I'd rather have the devil after me than Mrs. Jackson. Give her what she wants."

Ultimately, her efforts built the Baltimore NAACP into the largest branch of the organization in the [[United States]] with a peak membership of 17,600.&lt;ref name=naacp/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Jackson died from a [[myocardial infarction]] and was interred at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery (Baltimore, Maryland)|Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Baltimore.

Jackson's will called for the home she lived in for twenty-two years, 1320 Eutaw Place in Baltimore, to be turned into a museum. As the only museum named after a woman and the only civil rights museum in the state of Maryland, it serves as a repository of civil rights [[Cultural heritage|artifacts]] including documents, framed memorabilia and household furnishings. Prominent amongst these was a life-sized photo of Jackson with [[Rosa Parks]] just inside the building's entrance.

Upon its 1976 opening the museum enjoyed a modest flow of visitors. By mid 1990 its maintenance had become untenable to the extent that the structure was no longer viable as a museum. In 1997 [[Morgan State University]] took responsibility for the facility and as curators placed its contents in storage. The facility then became dormant, awaiting sufficient matching funds to put in use a grant which was received from the state of Maryland.  A re-opening of the museum is currently planned for June 2016.

In 1986, Jackson was posthumously inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame.

==List of Issues Papers==
The following list of AICPA Issues Papers have been compiled using the holdings of the University of Mississippi Libraries and the 2008 ''Technical Practice Aids'' section entitled "Issues papers of the Accounting Standards Division."  Issues Papers were originally intended to be an evenhanded discussion of topics that needed to be "addressed or clarified by the Financial Accounting Standards Board." &lt;ref&gt;American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. ''AICPA Technical Practice Aids as of June 1, 2008.'' (New York: The Institute, 2008). Pp. 28,00-28,004. &lt;/ref&gt; Issues Papers were the vehicle the AICPA's Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) used to present emerging practice problems to the FASB and accounting practitioners. Issues Papers generally followed a standard format: (1) background, (2) analysis of current practice, (3) review of the literature, (4) statement of issues needing resolution, and (5) advisory conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford, Dennis R. "Emerging Problems: How the Profession is Coping." ''Journal of Accountancy'', Vol. 151,Issue 2 (Feb. 1981), pp.57-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Issues Papers were never enforceable standards, they became recognized (prior to the creation of the FASB Codification in 2009) as the fifth or lowest level in the GAAP [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)]] hierarchy of standards &lt;ref&gt;Hardin, Stuart. "Significant Changes to the GAAP Hierarchy," ''Outlook,'' Vol. 60 Issue 1 (Spring 1992), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues Papers often offered guidance in areas too narrow for FASB's attention or when guidance was required in a more timely fashion than permitted by the formulation and issuance of a FASB statement.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford, Dennis R. "Emerging Problems: How the Profession is Coping." ''Journal of Accountancy'', Vol. 151 (Feb. 1981), pp.57-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues Papers then gained a level of authority as practitioners followed their guidance and different agencies accepted their recommendations.  The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared the 1984 Issues Paper, "Identification and Discussion of Certain financial Accounting and Reporting Issues Concerning LIFO Inventories," as authoritative in 1985. &lt;ref&gt;"SEC Staff says AICPA Issues Paper on Lifo Inventories Has Authority." ''Journal of Accountancy,'' Vol. 159, Issue 5 (May 1985), p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The method of handling stock transaction in the 1980 Issues Paper, Accounting in Consolidation for Issuances of a Subsidiary Stock, was also accepted in 1983 by the SEC as acceptable practice.&lt;ref&gt;Rue, Joseph C. and Ara Volken. "Accounting for Subsidiary Stock Transactions."''National Public Accountant,'' Vol. 39,Issue 7 (July 1994), pp. 32-34, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 Issues Paper, Accounting for Options, provided the "first definitive professional opinion on how to account for options. &lt;ref&gt;Rude, Charles D. "Guidelines on Accounting for Options." ''Practical Accountant,'' Vol. 25, Issue 2 (February 1992), pp. 23-27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis Osborne Coxe''' (April 15, 1918&amp;nbsp;– May 25, 1993) was an American poet, playwright, essayist, and professor who was recognized by the [[Academy of American Poets]] for his "long, powerful, quiet accomplishment, largely unrecognized, in lyric poetry." He was probably best known for his dramatic adaptation of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Billy Budd]]'', which opened on Broadway in 1951.

==Biography==
Born in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] in 1918 but raised in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] (where his family had lived since 1640), Coxe was educated at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]]. He graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1940, writing his senior thesis on [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]].

During [[World War II]], Coxe served in the [[United States Navy]], commanding the U.S.S. PC-549 in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific Theater]] during the Northern [[Solomon Islands campaign]] and the [[invasion of Guam]] and [[invasion of Saipan]]-Tinian (and later the U.S.S. PC-1195), an experience that would shape much of his poetry. After leaving active service in 1946, he married Edith Winsor, granddaughter of Boston financier [[Robert Winsor]], and began teaching at Princeton. He was Briggs-Copeland Fellow at [[Harvard University]] from 1948 to 1949, and from 1949 to 1955, he taught at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Coxe then moved to [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]] in 1956, where he remained (except for brief appointments at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ireland, and the [[University of Aix-Marseilles]], France) as head of the English department until his death in 1993 after 11 years suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].

Coxe received his largest critical recognition for his dramatic adaptation, with [[Robert H. Chapman (writer)|Robert Chapman]], of [[Herman Melville]]'s morality tale [[Billy Budd]], which opened to critical acclaim on Broadway in 1951, winning both the [[Donaldson Awards]] and the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for best play. The [[New York Times]]' [[Brooks Atkinson]] called it "extraordinarily well done," and said that "the tragic portions are written with taste, firmness and intelligence." Coxe was also credited with co-writing the screenplay for [[Peter Ustinov]]'s film version of the play. He wrote several other plays, most for local productions in Maine, one of which, "Decoration Day" (about Civil War general [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]]), was published as a book along with his long narrative poem "Nikal Seyn." He was also praised for his criticism, writing books on both [[Chaucer]] and [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]].

But Coxe's main focus was his poetry, which U.S. Poet Laureate [[Howard Nemerov]] called "terse, cryptic, almost savage in their beauty." Much of his work focused on his experience during World War II and the natural environment of his native New England. Several of his poems, reviews and essays appeared first in [[The New Yorker]], [[The New Republic]], [[Paris Review]], and [[Atlantic Monthly]]. In 1972 the [[Maine Arts Commission|Maine State Commission on the Arts and Humanities]] presented him with a Maine State Award for his significant contributions to the cultural life of Maine. He was named the 36th fellow of the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1977 and was awarded a creative writing grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] that same year. One of the last poems he published, "Nightsong" (1983), was featured in the anthology ''Fifty Years of American Poetry''.

'''MormonLeaks''' (formerly '''Mormon WikiLeaks''') is a [[whistleblowing]] organization inspired by [[WikiLeaks]], which focuses on exposing documents from the leadership of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). It began in October 2016 as a leaked series of videos on the [[YouTube]] channel '''Mormon Leaks'''. In total, 15 videos were initially leaked via the Mormon Leaks channel from meetings of high-ranking LDS leaders including the [[Quorum of the Twelve]]. They discussed topics including the "[[homosexual agenda]]", the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], and a debate over the [[sexual orientation]] of [[Chelsea Manning]]. Politicians featured in the videos included former Utah governor [[Mike Leavitt]] and former U.S. Senator from Oregon [[Gordon H. Smith]].

Ryan McKnight, founder of MormonLeaks, was interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' about his YouTube channel Mormon Leaks, and this led to contacts from [[Reddit]] who asked him for a secure way to send files. He set up a website to allow whistleblowers to protect their [[anonymity]]. The submission process ensures [[confidentiality]], including erasure of [[IP address|IP addresses]], asking leakers to use the privacy browser [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], sending documents via [[SecureDrop]], and additional [[encryption]] methods. Initial funding was raised through [[GoFundMe]], and an official [[Twitter]] account was set up. The site's intent is to increase transparency of LDS Church leadership, and would not leak names of lower-level employees, instead focusing on the Quorum of the Twelve and the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]].

[[University of Tampa]] professor Ryan Cragun said scholars were interested in finding out what documents would be revealed, noting there was a dearth of information available about the [[Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|finances of the LDS Church]]. He said active Mormons were unlikely to view the leaked materials, but the material would have a more significant impact on those who were questioning or had already resigned their membership status. Mormon scholar and columnist [[Jana Riess]] gave a mixed assessment, criticizing their tactics regarding privacy while saying it could help to increase LDS Church leadership transparency. Utah attorney and Mormon blogger Steve Evans said the practice of leaking was criminal publication of stolen property, and said LDS Church employees who leaked material were likely violating a [[non-disclosure agreements|non-disclosure agreement]].

McKnight decided to found MormonLeaks so whistleblowers could protect their [[anonymity]].&lt;ref name=valkenburg /&gt; Since his increased attention from the October videos and the November policy change leaks, McKnight has been contacted by 25 sources inside and outside of the LDS Church with potential material to release.&lt;ref name=exmormoncreates /&gt; McKnight and his team spent six months planning creation of the organization.&lt;ref name=exmormoncreates /&gt; He estimated approximately a potential for between hundreds to thousands of additional invididuals who may wish to leak information through the site.&lt;ref name=notapproval /&gt; The organization has no affiliation with [[Fred Karger#LDS Church|Fred Karger]] or his website [http://mormontips.com/ MormonTips.com], which also publicizes confidential documents from the LDS Church.&lt;ref name=exmormoncreates /&gt; MormonLeaks takes steps to protect [[confidentiality]] of their sources, including erasing all IP addresses from submissions and removing watermarks from submitted materials.&lt;ref name=exmormoncreates /&gt; The site asks users who wish to submit secret documents to use the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor privacy browser]] to protect themselves.&lt;ref name=alexjohnson /&gt; Users then send the documents to MormonLeaks via [[SecureDrop]].&lt;ref name=notapproval&gt;{{citation|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=December 20, 2016|url=http://gephardtdaily.com/local/mormonwikileaker-seeks-lds-church-transparency-not-approval/|work=Gephardt Daily|title=MormonWikiLeaker seeks LDS Church ‘transparency,’ not approval}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Encryption]] methods are further incorporated to mask the identity of the whistleblowers.&lt;ref name=tareqhaddad /&gt; The motivation behind the organization is to increase transparency of LDS Church leadership.&lt;ref name=sharesecret&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.kivitv.com/news/former-lds-member-starts-mormon-wikileaks-to-share-secret-church-documents|accessdate=December 21, 2016|date=December 20, 2016|title=Former LDS member starts Mormon Wikileaks to share secret church documents|work=[[KIVI-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sirinkale&gt;{{citation|first=Sirin|last=Kale|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/the-ex-mormon-exposing-the-lds-church-with-a-whistle-blowing-website|title=The Ex-Mormon Exposing the LDS Church With a Whistle-Blowing Website|date=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After MormonLeaks had posted a handful a number of LDS Church documents for four months, the Church sent a [[cease-and-desist letter]] alleging [[copyright infringement]] with regard to a leaked Church leadership [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] [[slide show|presentation]] published by MormonLeaks in February 2017. The PowerPoint discussed societal pressures that the Church felt had led some LDS members to apostasy, which included [[pornography]], the issues agitated for by [[Ordain Women]], and questions regarding [[Mormon history]] such as those promoted in books by lawyer&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;[[Fundamentalist Mormon]] [[Denver C.

MormonLeaks pulled the offending document for a short while, until its attorney, [[Marc Randazza]], sent the LDS Church a letter which said, "At this point, my client is willing to let bygones be bygones. If your client is willing to step back from the brink, and to cease efforts to censor this material, my client is willing to refrain from bringing a claim [of abusing copyright law]."&lt;ref name=mormonleaksreposts&gt;{{citation|access-date=June 16, 2017|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/lds/5056058-155/mormonleaks-reposts-lds-church-apostasy-presentation|title=MormonLeaks reposts LDS Church apostasy presentation, rebuffs faith’s copyright violation claim|first=Bob|last=Mims|date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enemieslist&gt;{{citation|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/03/17/mormonleaks-website-squares-off-with-mormon-church-posts-leaked-enemies-list/|title=MormonLeaks website squares off with Mormon Church, posts leaked ‘Enemies List’|access-date=June 16, 2017|date=March 17, 2017|first= Michael Alison |last=Chandler}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[WikiLeaks]] was aware of the foundation under the site's original name of MormonWikiLeaks, and sent them a message on Twitter asking them to change their name.&lt;ref name=mandyvelez /&gt; The founder stated he would retain the name as MormonWikiLeaks, and said a trademark application was pending.&lt;ref name=mandyvelez /&gt;

[[University of Tampa]] professor Ryan Cragun said academics were excited to discover more information about the economics behind the LDS Church, as members tithe 10 percent of their earnings and there was not much in the way of transparent documents available to research their holdings and finances.&lt;ref name=chandler /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cragun said it was unlikely active members of the LDS Church would end up viewing the leaked documents because they were "highly insulated".&lt;ref name=chandler /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he notes documents would have a greater impact on someone who is considering leaving the LDS Church: "For someone in the middle of a faith transition, such information is more fuel for the fire."&lt;ref name=chandler /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Editor-in-chief]] of ''The Nonprofit Quarterly'', Ruth McCambridge, wrote that the appearance of MormonLeaks was reflective of an increasing trend by individuals to use technology to force nonprofit organizations to be transparent and accountable to the public.&lt;ref name=npq&gt;{{citation|issn=1934-6050|oclc=46351191|publisher=Nonprofit Information Networking Association|location=[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]|date=December 21, 2016|journal=The Nonprofit Quarterly|first=Ruth|last=McCambridge|accessdate=December 22, 2016|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/12/21/forcing-nonprofit-transparency-mormon-church-ends-wikileaks/|archivedate=December 22, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222045913/https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/12/21/forcing-nonprofit-transparency-mormon-church-ends-wikileaks/|title=Forcing Nonprofit Transparency: Mormon Church Ends Up with Its Own Wikileaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; MormonLeaks has an attorney on staff, which McCambridge notes may be beneficial given the prior litigation history where the LDS Church made a copyright infringement assertion against WikiLeaks for publishing the church's ''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook of Instructions]]''.&lt;ref name=npq /&gt;

Mormon scholar and columnist [[Jana Riess]] was critical of the organization's tactics, stating: "I am very concerned about privacy in our culture more generally. People in the workplace have the right to expect that intraoffice communication and their emails will stay private."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt; She called MormonLeaks "disturbing" and said: "It is not good news for any of us."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt; On a positive note, Riess said it could motivate the upper LDS Church leadership to increase its transparency.&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt;

Utah attorney and Mormon blogger Steve Evans called MormonLeaks "a rebranding exercise of McKnight's existing practice of posting various confidential items."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt; Evans said MormonLeaks had "an added layer of cybersecurity, which won't necessarily protect the leakers, depending on their methods of obtaining the various stolen documents, videos, etc."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt; Evans was critical of McKnight's encouragement to those who choose to leak information to MormonLeaks: "the leakers are likely either church employees or consultants working for the church. In either of those situations, it's very likely that the leakers are violating their nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with the church. McKnight is now publicly encouraging people to violate these agreements."&lt;ref name=newwebsiteplans /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">The '''Mugar family''' of [[Greater Boston]], [[Massachusetts]],  is a prominent [[Armenian-American]] family in [[New England]] business and in philanthropy, both in the [[United States]] and in [[Armenia]]. The best known member of the family is [[Stephen P. Mugar]], (1901-1982), who founded the [[Star Market]] chain of super markets on which the family fortune was based. In its May, 2004, issue, [[Boston Magazine]] ranked the Mugar family sixth in its list of the 50 most influential Boston families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120203221013/http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/the_fifty_families_part_1 "The Fifty Families (Part 1)"], ''Boston Magazine'', November 2006 (archived 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family origin==
The first family members to arrive in Boston were brothers, Charles and Martin Mugar (shortened from ''Mugardichian''), who came from [[Kharpert]], [[Ottoman Empire]], in 1904. They were joined in 1906 by their brothers, Arthur, Gregory and Sarkis Mugar, along with Sarkis Mugar's wife and three children, one of whom was Stephen P. Mugar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arzo.com/arzo2/MIRROR_SPECTATOR%20February%2012,%201999.htm MIRROR_SPECTATOR February 12, 1999.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent family members==
*[[Stephen P. Mugar]], (1901-1982) founder of the [[Star Market]] chain
*[[John M. Mugar]], (1914-2007), son of Martin, President and Chairman of the Star Market chain. 
*[[David G. Mugar]], Stephen's son, also became a Star Market executive and is now a prominent businessman and philanthropist in his own right.
*[[Carolyn Mugar]] Stephen's daughter, activist, is founder of the [[Armenia Tree Project]], executive director of [[Farm Aid]] and is the president of the [[Armenian Assembly of America]].

==Philanthropies==
The major objects of Mugar family philanthropic giving have been:
*Greater Boston educational institutions, especially the so-called "subway" or "commuter" colleges and universities, because they were the first to welcome young Armenian-Americans and others with limited resources and social standing and because they lacked the vast endowments of schools such as [[Harvard]].
*Hospitals, in particular [[Cape Cod Hospital]], and
*Armenian causes  in the United States and overseas in Armenia and Lebanon.

The '''National Digital Newspaper Program''' is a joint project between the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to create and maintain a publicly available, online digital archive of historically significant newspapers published in the United States between 1836 and 1922.  Additionally, the program will make available bibliographic records and holdings information for some 140,000 newspaper titles from the 17th century to the present.  Further, it will include scope notes and encyclopedia-style entries discussing the historical significance of specific newspapers. Added content will also include contextually relevant historical information. "One organization within each U.S. state or territory will receive an award to collaborate with relevant state partners in this effort."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/ndnp.html National Digital Newspaper Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007 more than 226,000 pages of newspapers from California, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Utah, Virginia and the District of Columbia published between 1900 and 1910 were put online at a fully searchable site called "[[Chronicling America]]." [https://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/] As of December 2007, the total number of pages is about 413,000. This further expanded to be 1 million pages in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-123.html|title=Library of Congress, National Endowment for the Humanities Celebrate Millionth Page in Chronicling America Program|date=June 16, 2009 |publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding through the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] is carried out through their "We The People" initiative.

== Purpose ==
This project dovetails with the [[United States Newspaper Program]] which was a massive project to microfilm newspaper collections. The initiators of that earlier project asserted that the intellectual content of newspapers serves an important role for researchers as it is for all intents and purposes the first draft of history. Newspapers also provide unique access to "diverse geographic viewpoints at the community level."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlcnet.org/objects/rte/mediaupload/File/eventsdocs/events/05newspapers/05Sweeney-2_files/frame.htm The U.S. Newspaper Program – Scope, Achievement, and Progress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Problematically, since the middle of the 19th century this "first draft" has been recorded on poor quality [[newsprint]] which is decaying rapidly. This digitization project's purpose is to continue preserving newspaper and newspaper collections while addressing the inadequacies of the prior program. Through digitization, it is more likely that images will be copied with fidelity and that the records will be more richly searchable. This latter point is huge as newspapers traditionally posed a research challenge due to density of text and inadequate cataloging of content.

== History ==
On March 31, 2004, [[Bruce Cole]], the directory of the NEH, and [[James H. Billington|James Billington]], the Librarian of Congress, signed an agreement creating the National Digital Newspaper Program.  The NDNP follows in the footsteps of the successful [[United States Newspaper Program]], a several-decade effort to catalog and microfilm the bulk of America's historic newspapers. The program is broken down into two phases. Each successive phase will both increase the scope of the program and refine the requirements for data collection.

=== Phase 1 ===
In July 2004 the award guidelines were issued. Applications were due in October and awardees were announced the following March. The first phase took newspapers from a small subset of the states, limited to 1900 through 1910.  After using this phase to improve technical requirements and specifications, the program was opened to other awardees in [[#Phase 2|Phase 2]].

The awardees for Phase 1 are:
* [[University of California, Riverside]]
* [[University of Florida Digital Collections|University of Florida Libraries]], Gainesville
* [[University of Kentucky#Libraries|University of Kentucky Libraries]], Lexington
* [[New York Public Library]], New York City
* University of Utah, Salt Lake City [http://www.lib.utah.edu/digital/unews/]
* Library of Virginia, Richmond

The General-access Phase 1 website prototype was implemented in March 2007 and that May it was announced that phase 1 was completed.

=== Phase 2 ===
Phase 2 of NDNP expanded grants to an additional group of institutions. Awards granted in 2007 and 2008 included the following institutions:

* [[Arizona State Library, Archives and Records Management]]
* [[University of Hawaii]]
* [[Minnesota Historical Society]]
* [[University of Nebraska, Lincoln]]
* [[University of North Texas]]
* [[Ohio Historical Society]], Columbus
* [[Pennsylvania State University]]
* [[State Historical Society of Missouri]]
* [[Washington State Library]]

== Program Technology ==
Participants must follow the technical guidelines laid out in a 64-page PDF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/pdf/NDNP_200709TechNotes.pdf Ndnp: Technical Notes On Formats For Digital Reproductions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The technology for the NDNP digital repository is being built using largely [[Open-source software|open source]] software, including:
* [[Fedora (software)|Fedora]]
* [[Apache Cocoon]]
* [[Gentoo Linux]]
* [[Apache Lucene]]
Digital objects are stored in .TIFF 6.0, .JPEG 2000, and .PDF formats. Metadata is provided in the METS/MODS version of XML and XML provides the basis for larger hierarchical structures as well.

== Alternatives ==
The scanning efforts of the government entity has been dwarfed by the private efforts [[newspapers.com]] and [[newspaperarchive.com]] which as of March 2018 claim to each have scanned more than 350 million pages.  Publishers, libraries and historical organizations find the private sector faster, less complicated and cheaper than the National Digital Newspaper Program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Both private organizations charge readers to read, but do not charge publishers to scan items.&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/blog/2014/05/18/a-retiree-digitizes-27-million-old-newsp&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Biddle''' (January 8, 1786 – February 27, 1844) was an American [[financier]] who served as the third and last president of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] (chartered 1816–1836). He also served in the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]]. He is best known for his role in the [[Bank War]].

A member of the prominent [[Biddle family]] of [[Philadelphia]], Nicholas Biddle worked for prominent officials such as [[John Armstrong Jr.]] and [[James Monroe]] in his youth. After returning to Philadelphia, he won election to the state legislature. While serving in the legislature, he successfully lobbied Congress and President Monroe for the creation of a new [[History of central banking in the United States|central bank]], which became known as the Second Bank of the United States. In 1822, Monroe appointed Biddle as the third president of the bank. Biddle would continue to serve as the bank's president for several years, during which time he exercised power over the nation's money supply and interest rates, seeking to prevent economic crises. 

At the request of [[Henry Clay]] and other [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], Biddle asked [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Andrew Jackson]] to renew the bank's federal charter in 1832. Jackson, who held a deep hostility to many banks, declined to renew the charter, beginning a political debate known as the Bank War. When Jackson transferred the federal government's deposits to several state banks, Biddle raised interest rates, causing a mild economic recession. The federal charter expired in 1836, but the bank was re-chartered by Pennsylvania. Biddle continued to serve as president of the bank until 1839.

==Ancestry and early life==
Nicholas Biddle was born in [[Philadelphia]], in the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}} Ancestors of the [[Biddle family]] immigrated to [[Pennsylvania]] when the proprietor, [[William Penn]] (of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], or "[[Quaker]]s") visited,&lt;ref&gt;Lawmaking and Legislators in Pennsylvania, vol. 3, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; and fought in the pre-[[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary colonial struggles]]. His father, [[Charles Biddle (Pennsylvania statesman)|Charles]], was prominent in his devotion to the cause of [[American Revolution|American independence]]{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}} and served as [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Vice-Presidents of Council|Vice-President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania]], alongside [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|Council President]], the famous [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1705/06–1790).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

An uncle with the same name, [[Nicholas Biddle (naval officer)|Nicholas Biddle]] (1750–1778), whose residence was also in Philadelphia, was an early colonial and [[American Revolutionary War]] naval hero, who died during the rebellion. Another uncle, [[Edward Biddle]], was also a member of the [[First Continental Congress|First Continental Congress of 1774]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawmaking and Legislators in Pennsylvania, vol. 3, pp. 337–351&lt;/ref&gt; Young Nicholas's preparatory education was received at an academy in Philadelphia, where his progress was so rapid that he entered the class of 1799 in the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (formerly the "Academy", then the "College of Philadelphia" until 1791), and would have taken his degree at the age of thirteen had it not been deemed wise to keep him longer at his books. He was accordingly sent to [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (formerly the College of New Jersey), entered the sophomore class, and was graduated in 1801 as [[valedictorian]], dividing the first honor of the class with his only rival.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}} His younger brother [[Thomas Biddle]], a [[War of 1812]] hero who died in a duel, should not be confused with his cousin by the same name, who became a leading exchange broker in Philadelphia.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Biddle was offered an official position before he had even finished his law studies. As secretary to [[John Armstrong Jr.]] (a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] officer, delegate to the [[Continental Congress]], later a [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]], United States minister to [[France]], and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] under fourth President [[James Madison]] during the [[War of 1812]]),  he went abroad in 1804 and was in [[Paris]] in the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] at the time of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s coronation.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}  Afterward he participated in an [[audit]] related to the "[[Louisiana Purchase]]" by the United States of the territory west of the [[Mississippi River]], acquiring his first experience in financial affairs. Biddle traveled extensively through [[Europe]], returning to [[England]] to serve as secretary for [[James Monroe]], then United States minister to the [[Court of St. James's]] ([[Kingdom of Great Britain]]). At [[Cambridge University]], Biddle took part in a conversation with [[Cambridge]] professors involving comparison between modern Greek dialect and that of [[Homer]]; the incident captured Monroe's attention.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}

In 1807, Biddle returned home to Philadelphia. He practiced law and wrote, contributing papers to different publications on various subjects, but chiefly in the fine arts. He became associate editor of a magazine called ''[[Port Folio (magazine)|Port-Folio]]'', which was published from 1806–23. When editor [[Joseph Dennie]] died in 1812, Biddle took over the magazine and lived on 7th Street, near Spruce Street.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}

===Lewis and Clark===
Biddle also prepared western explorers [[Lewis and Clark]]'s report for publication of their exploratory expedition up the [[Missouri River]]{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}} through the newly acquired [[Louisiana Purchase]] from [[France]] (previously recently owned for generations by [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]), across the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Oregon Country]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] to the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] on the far [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast, and he encouraged third President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to write an introductory memoir of his former aide and private secretary, Captain [[Meriwether Lewis]], (1774–1809).{{sfn|Cutright|1982|p=34}} However, Biddle's name does not appear in the work, as he was elected to serve on the [[Pennsylvania]] state legislature (1810–1811) and was compelled to turn over the project to [[Paul Allen (editor)|Paul Allen]], (1775–1826), who then further supervised its publication.  With the consent of all parties, Allen was then recognized as the editor.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}{{sfn|Cutright|1982|p=34}}

===Pennsylvania General Assembly===
Biddle served in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] in 1810, and then in the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anb.org/articles/03/03-00039.html American National Biography-Nicholas Biddle]&lt;/ref&gt; He originated a bill favoring popular education almost a quarter of a century in advance of the times. Though the bill was initially defeated, it resurfaced repeatedly in different forms until, in 1836, the Pennsylvania [[public education|"common-school"]] system was inaugurated as an indirect result of his efforts.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}{{sfn|McGrane|1919|p={{page needed|date=May 2016}} }}

After Biddle moved to the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]], he lobbied for the rechartering of the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. It was on this subject that he made his first speech, which attracted general attention at the time, and was warmly commended by Chief-Justice Marshall and other leaders of public opinion.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}} 

The Bank had been revived and reorganized from the earlier [[First Bank of the United States]], established in 1791 under the administration of first President [[George Washington]], and after a chartered term of 20 years, expired in 1811 on the eve of the monetary pressures of the coming [[War of 1812]] era. After economic hardships and problems financing the Government and its war measures during the War of 1812 to 1815, and a period of dormancy, a newly revived and reorganized [[Second Bank of the United States]] was rechartered in 1816 under fifth President [[James Monroe]], who appointed Biddle as a Federal Government director and representative. When the Bank's president, [[Langdon Cheves]], resigned in 1822, Biddle became its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/nicholas_biddle|title= Nicholas Biddle|author= Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|date= &lt;!-- not stated--&gt;|website= www.federalreservehistory.org|publisher= Federal Reserve History|access-date= 17 November 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his association with the Bank, President Monroe, under authority from [[United States Congress|Congress]], directed him to prepare a "Commercial Digest" of the laws and trade regulations of the world and the various nations. For many years after, this Digest was regarded as an authority on the subject.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}} 

In late 1818, $4 million of interest payments on the bonds previously sold in 1803 to pay for the "[[Louisiana Purchase]]" was due, in either gold or silver, to European investors. The U.S. Government had to get its hands on additional amounts of ''[[Bullion coin|specie]]'', i.e., silver or gold. As the Government's fiscal agent, the Bank was required to make this payment on behalf of the Government. The Bank was forced to demand that the private commercial banks that had been lent money in the form of "fiat" paper must now repay in specie, which was then sent to [[Europe]] to pay the government's creditors. This rather sudden contraction of the country's monetary base after three currency and rampant speculation based on debt led to the financial [[Panic of 1819]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Meanwhile, in [[Tennessee]], General and future Presidential candidate, [[Andrew Jackson]] was hard-pressed to pay his debts during this period. He developed a lifelong hostility to all banks that were not completely backed by gold or silver deposits. This meant, above all, hostility to the new [[Second Bank of the United States]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

As Bank president, Biddle occasionally engaged in the newly-developing national techniques of "central banking" – controlling the nation's money supply, regulating interest rates, lending to state banks, and acting as the U.S. Government's fiscal agent. When state banks became excessive in their lending practices, Biddle's Bank acted as a restraint. In a few instances, he even rescued state banks to prevent the risk of "contagion" spreading. He was also important in the 1833 establishment of [[Girard College]], an early free private school for poor orphaned boys in [[Philadelphia]], under the provisions of the will of his friend and former legal client, [[Stephen Girard]] (1750–1831), one of the wealthiest men in America. Girard had been the original promoter of the revival and reorganization of the Second Bank and its largest investor.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Hepburn, A History of Currency in the United States (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1903; reprinted, August M. Kelly Publishers, 1967) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 1831, Biddle's brother, Thomas, a [[War of 1812]] veteran, was killed in a [[duel]] on [[Bloody Island (Mississippi River)|"Bloody Island"]] on the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis, Missouri]] with [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] (Congressman) [[Spencer Pettis]]. Thomas had taken offense to Pettis' criticizing Nicholas at the bank. After an exchange of letters to the editor of a newspaper, Biddle accosted an ill Pettis in his hotel room. After Pettis recovered, he then challenged Thomas to a duel, and both were killed when they exchanged shots from five feet apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/education/dueling/political-duels.asp Crack of the Pistol: Dueling in 19th Century Missouri – sos.mo.gov – Retrieved March 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bank War===
The [[Bank War]] began when seventh President Andrew Jackson began criticizing the Bank early in his first term. Biddle, at the urging of [[Henry Clay]] and other Bank supporters, upped the ante when he applied for the Bank's re-charter in January 1832.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}} This was four years before the charter was scheduled to expire at the end of two decades, and the hope was to force Jackson into making an unpopular decision that might cost him during an election year. But, once challenged, President Jackson decided to veto the bill anyway. Jackson, well known for his stubborn personality and steadfast leadership, still harbored ill-will toward [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]] from the earlier "[[Corrupt_bargain#Election_of_1824|Corrupt Bargain]]" accusation following the [[United States presidential election, 1824|Presidential Election of 1824]] which made him [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] when appointed by the administration of the winner, sixth President [[John Quincy Adams]]. 

At Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson in the [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832 election]]. Biddle was told that this would only give credence to Jackson's theory that the Bank interfered in the American political process, but chose to dismiss the warning.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=376}} Ultimately, Clay's strategy failed, and in November he lost to Jackson, who was reelected to a second term.

In early 1833, Jackson, despite opposition from some members of his cabinet, decided to withdraw the Government's funds from the Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/second_bank_of_the_us |title=The Second Bank of the United States (1816–1841) |last=Hill |first=Andrew T. |date=February 5, 2015 |website=Federal Reserve History |access-date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incumbent [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Louis McLane]], a member of Jackson's Cabinet, professed moderate support for the Bank. He therefore refused to withdraw the Federal funds directed by the President and would not resign, so Jackson then transferred him to the [[United States State Department|State Department]].{{sfn|Remini|1984|pp=57–58; 171}} McLane's successor, [[William J. Duane]], was also opposed to the Bank, but would not carry out Jackson's orders either. After waiting four months, President Jackson summarily dismissed Duane, replacing him with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Roger B. Taney]] as a [[recess appointment]] when [[United States Congress|Congress]] was out of session.{{sfn|Wilentz|2006|p=395}} In September 1833, Taney helped transfer the public deposits from the Bank to seven state-chartered banks. Faced with the loss of the Federal deposits, Biddle decided to raise interest rates and deliberately induce a [[recession]]. A mild [[financial panic]] ensued from late 1833 to mid-1834.{{sfn|Wilentz|2006|pp=396–400}} Intended to force Jackson into a compromise, the move backfired, increasing anti-Bank sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/second_bank_of_the_us |title=The Second Bank of the United States (1816–1841) |last=Hill |first=Andrew T. |date=February 5, 2015 |website=Federal Reserve History |access-date=July 8, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711064727/https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/second_bank_of_the_us |archivedate=July 11, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wilentz|2006|pp=396–400}} Meanwhile, Biddle and other Bank supporters attempted to renew the Bank's charter through the [[United States Congress|Congress]] on numerous occasions. All their attempts failed under the threat of a Jackson [[presidential veto]].{{sfn|Wilentz|2006|pp=396–400}}

===Demise of the bank===
Finally, after the requisite twenty-year term, the Bank's charter expired in April 1836, but the financial institution continued as a state-chartered bank under the laws of Pennsylvania for several more years.  As the Bank wound up its operations in the next five years, state-chartered banks in the West and South relaxed their lending standards, maintaining unsafe reserve ratios and contributing to the [[Panic of 1837]]. In 1839 Biddle resigned from his post as bank president, and in 1841, amidst the post-Panic recession, the Bank finally failed. Biddle was arrested and charged with fraud, but was acquitted.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He died soon after, on February 27, 1844,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} while still involved in the ensuing civil suits.

==Family==
In 1811 Biddle married Jane Margaret Craig (born 1792); the couple had six children including [[Charles John Biddle]], who served in the [[United States Army]] and in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/biddle.htm University of Delaware: Biddle family papers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pari passu''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that literally means "with an equal step" or "on equal footing". It is sometimes translated as "ranking equally",&lt;ref name="Harriman"&gt;{{cite book | title=Harriman's Financial Dictionary: Over 2,600 Essential Financial Terms | author=Briscoe, Simon | year=2007 | pages=348 | author2=Fuller, Jane | quote=Ranking equally, meaning literally 'with equal step'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; "hand-in-hand", "with equal force", or "moving together", and by extension, "fairly", "without partiality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pari passu|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/pari-passu.html|website=Business Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
:* ''[[Wiktionary:par#Inflection_2|pari]]'' is the [[ablative]] [[Singular number|singular]] [[masculine]] (since it must grammatically agree with ''passu'') of the [[adjective]] ''par'', "equal". If it were [[nominative]], "an equal step" it would be ''par passus''.
:* ''[[Wiktionary:passus#Inflection|passu]]'' is the [[ablative]] of the Latin noun ''passus'', "step".

This term is commonly used in law. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (8th ed., 2004) defines ''pari passu'' as "proportionally; at an equal pace; without preference". 

==Usage==
===In inheritance===
In inheritance, an ''in pari passu'' (''[[per capita]]'') distribution can be distinguished from a ''[[per stirpes]]'' (by family branch) distribution.&lt;ref name="per stirpes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black's Law Dictionary |url=http://thelawdictionary.org/per-stirpes/ |work=2nd Edition|publisher=West Publishing|accessdate=10 December 2012|author=Henry Campbell Black}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, suppose a [[testator]] had two children A and B. A has two children, and B has three. The testator leaves his entire estate to his grandchildren in equal shares ''in pari passu'', each grandchild would inherit one fifth of the estate. If the testator left his entire estate to his grandchildren ''per stirpes'' (by family branch), the children of A would share one half of the estate equally between the two of them, and the children of B would share one half of the estate equally amongst the three of them. 

The problem with a per capita ''in pari passu'' distribution in the example given is as follows. Assume A dies before B. On A's death a distribution could not be made to his or her children: they would have to await the death of B &amp;ndash; on the assumption that B could have additional children, and thereby consequently all grandchildren (of both A and B) would be entitled to less than one fifth each.

===In lending, bankruptcy and default===
This term is also often used in the [[lending]] area and in [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, where [[creditors]] are said to be paid ''pari passu'', or each creditor is paid ''[[pro rata]]'' in accordance with the amount of his claim. Here its meaning is "equally and without preference".
There have been cases where decisions were based on different interpretations of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Devi Sookun  Stop [[Vulture fund|Vulture Fund]] Lawsuits: A Handbook 2010 p34 2010 "The case succeeded because the court departed from the traditional meaning of the term pari passu. This section looks first at the original case of Elliott Associates v Republic of Peru."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's maritime and commercial law quarterly 1983 "Obviously Lord Scott, in leaving out the preferential creditors, does not use the term pari passu in its multi-layered sense. Instead, his Lordship was referring to pari passu in its orthodox meaning."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], as the result of the [[Greek government-debt crisis]], a retroactive [[Collective action clause]] passed by the Greek government with the support of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and [[IMF]], enabled the debtor (who also controlled the courts) to impose a 70% loss on the creditors, more than 75% of whom had voted in favour of the cut.  In this case, ''pari passu'' means that all private-sector investors are equally treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevis|first1=Matina|last2=Burne|first2=Katy|title=Greek Legal Maneuvers Raise Fears of Euro-Zone Debt Fallout|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/eurocrisis/2012/02/23/greek-legal-maneuvers-raise-fears-of-euro-zone-debt-fallout/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proteolix, Inc.''', was a private [[biotechnology]] company with headquarters in [[South San Francisco]], [[California]].  Proteolix was founded in 2003 based on technology developed by co-founders [[Craig M. Crews|Dr. Craig Crews]] (Yale University) and Dr. Raymond J. Deshaies (California Institute of Technology). Drs. Susan Molineaux and Phil Whitcome (deceased) joined Drs. Crews and Deshaies as co-founders. Proteolix was launched based on an $18.2 million A round comprising investments by Latterell Venture Partners, US Venture Partners, Advanced Technology Ventures, and The Vertical Group. Proteolix focused primarily on the [[proteasome]] as a therapeutic target.  Its lead product candidate, [[carfilzomib]] (PR-171), is a [[tetrapeptide]] [[epoxyketone]].  At the time of its sale (see below), the company had two earlier-stage programs, an orally-bioavailable proteasome inhibitor for oncology (PR-047), and an agent preferentially targeting the immuno form of the proteasome (PR-957), with potential utility in areas such as rheumatoid arthritis.  At the time of sale, Carfilzomib's route of administration was [[intravenous]], and the company was exploring its potential utility in [[multiple myeloma]], [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (NHL) and other cancers.  

Proteolix was acquired by [[Onyx Pharmaceuticals]] in 2009 for $810 million (nominal value).  Onyx renamed PR-047 to "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110523065128/http://www.onyx-pharm.com/clinical-development/onx-091 ONX 0912]" and PR-957 to "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110523065128/http://www.onyx-pharm.com/clinical-development/onx-091 ONX 0914]".

'''Richard Cassius Lee Moncure''' (December 11, 1805 – August 24, 1882) was a Virginia politician and jurist, serving for more than 25 years on what became the [[Virginia Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Virginia Biography vol. II (1905), available online at http://www.onlinebiographies.info/va/v2/moncure-rcl.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born at the family estate "Clermont" in [[Stafford County, Virginia]], in 1805 to one of the [[First Families of Virginia]], Richard Cassius Lee Moncure was the great grandson of Rev. John Moncure, a Scottish [[Huguenot]] immigrant and longtime rector of [[Aquia Church|Overwharton parish]] and friend of [[George Washington]], [[George Mason]] and other founding fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Representative Men of the South, p. 435 available at https://books.google.com/books?id=CA8yAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA435&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq&lt;/ref&gt; His father and grandfather were both named John Moncure and active in the affairs of what was renamed [[Aquia Church|Aquia Parish]]. His mother Alice Peachy Gaskins (1774-1860) bore ten children, of whom Richard Cassius Lee was the seventh child and fourth son. He received his early education in the local schools and read extensively. He married Mary Washington Conway (1807-1890) on December 29, 1825, and that year also bought Glencairne Farm, at which the couple lived the rest of their lives. They had thirteen children, eleven surviving to adulthood. At least three of their sons served as Confederate officers ([[John Conway Moncure]], Thomas Gascoigne Moncure and Walter Peyton Moncure) the eldest of whom became Speaker of the Louisiana house and judge in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Louise Peaquet du Bellet, Some Prominent Virginia Families (2005) p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Richard Henry Lee Chichester]] also became a justice of the Virginia Supreme Court.

After his admission to the bar in 1825, Moncure practiced in Fredericksburg and surrounding counties.  In 1849, he entered politics and won election to the legislature, which was then engaged in extensive revision of the state's legal code.  He was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] to replace [[Francis Taliaferro Brooke]] in 1851, but when the [[Virginia Constitution]] was changed that year, election to that court became required. Moncure was one of the  five judges elected under that new Constitution, and one of three judges elected under the Constitution of 1864, becoming that Court's President in 1865.

Active on the vestry of [[St. George's Episcopal Church (Fredericksburg, Virginia)]] and in the [[Diocese of Virginia]] for four decades, Moncure held seven slaves during the 1850 census and 14 slaves during the 1860 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=spot54&amp;id=I19541|title=RootsWeb's WorldConnect Project: Fonda Flax Carroll Genealogy in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and South Carolina|work=ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[American Civil War]], Moncure was a relative moderate on the appellate court, vehemently dissenting from the decisions in 'Bailey v. Poindexter's Executor,' 55 Va. 132, 14 Gratton 132 (1858) and 'Williamson v. Coalter,' 14 Gratton 394 (1858),&lt;ref&gt;[[Moncure Conway]], Autobiography pp. 38-39 available at google books&lt;/ref&gt;  both of which postdated the [[Dred Scott decision]] and declared testamentary manumissions void because a majority of Moncure's colleagues decided slaves were legally incapable of choosing freedom (although even preceding generations of Virginia judges, including [[John Marshall]] had used similar choice language in their wills).

His tenure of office was temporarily suspended, however, during the Reconstruction period, from 1866 to 1869, when Major General [[John Schofield]] enforced a federal law prohibiting men with a record of service to the [[Confederate States of America]] to hold public office. Judge Moncure was again elected to a twelve-year term in 1870 with the adoption of the new constitution and again became the Court's President.&lt;ref&gt;John Randolph Tucker, Reminiscences of Virginia Judges and Jurists, vol. 95, p.5, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg09AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
He remained on the Court of Appeals until his death at his home on August 26, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Memorial to Judges R.C.L.

==The Need for SBFC==

Family problems, such as marital discord, [[divorce]], financial difficulties, [[child abuse]] and neglect, life-threatening illness, sibling in a [[gang]], and poor [[parenting skills]] are associated with a wide variety of children's problems, e.g. [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]] attempts, and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henderson|first1=A.|last2=Sager|first2=T.|last3=Horne|first3=A.|title=Mothers and sons: A look at the relationship between child behavior problems, marital satisfaction, maternal depression, and family cohesion|journal=The Family Journal|date=2003|volume=11|issue=1|pages=33–41|doi=10.1177/1066480702238469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=E.|last2=Hawton|first2=K.|last3=Rodham|first3=K.|title=In what ways are adolescents who engage in self-harm or experience thoughts of self-harm different in terms of help-seeking, communication and coping strategies?|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=2005|volume=28|issue=4|pages=573–587|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=S.|last2=Davis-Kean|first2=P.|last3=Eccles|first3=J.|title=Parents, peers and problem behavior: A longitudinal investigation of the impact of relationship perceptions and characteristics on the development of adolescent problem behavior|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2005|volume=41|issue=2|pages=401–413|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.2.401|pmid=15769195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=C.|last2=Robinson|first2=L.|last3=Wilson|first3=S.|title=Adolescent perceptions of their family system, parents' behavior, self-esteem, and family life|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Substance Abuse|date=2004|volume=13|issue=2|pages=29–59|doi=10.1300/j029v13n02_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hacker |first1=K.|last2=Suglia |first2=S. |last3=Fried |first3=L. |last4=Rappaport |first4=N. |last5=Cabal |first5=H. |title=Developmental differences in risk factors for suicide attempts between ninth and eleventh graders|journal=Suicide and Life-threatening Behavior|date=2006|volume=36|issue=2|pages=154–166 |doi=10.1521/suli.2006.36.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBFC reduces the [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with therapy by emphasizing that counseling for family members has an educational goal: helping the student to succeed at school.

==Origins==
The earliest pioneer of SBFC was [[Alfred Adler]], the Austrian psychiatrist who developed 30 guidance clinics attached to schools in [[Vienna]] in the 1920s. Through these guidance clinics Adler and his colleagues counseled parents and teachers (often both together in large meetings where both groups were present) on how to help children overcome problems at home and school. This Adlerian home-school approach to counseling was strength-based with its emphasis on helping children develop Social Interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=A.|title=The education of children|date=1930|publisher=Gateway|location=Chicago, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=A.|title=A doctor remakes education|journal=Survey|date=1927|volume=58|pages=490–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansbacher|first1=H.|last2=Ansbacher|first2=R.|title=The individual psychology of Alfred Adler.|date=1956|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Developments==
With the advent of [[World War II]], the Vienna guidance clinics closed. The psychiatrist [[Rudolf Dreikurs]], who worked with Adler, emigrated to the USA in the 1930s and popularized the Adlerian approach to home-school intervention through books like: Children the Challenge (for parents), Maintaining Sanity in the Classroom (for teachers), and Discipline Without Tears (for parents and teachers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreikurs|first1=R.|title=Children the challenge.|date=1958|publisher=Norton|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreikurs|first1=R.|title=Maintaining sanity in the classroom.|date=1968|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreikurs|first1=R.|last2=Cassel|first2=P.|title=Discipline without tears.|date=1965|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, during the 1950s, 60's, and 70's the [[mental health professions]] developed somewhat independently of each other with the result that children having difficulty at school would typically be seen by a [[school counselor]] or [[school psychologist]]. Children having difficulty at home would typically be seen by a community-based [[mental health professional]]. Beginning in the 1970s the [[mental health]] literature begins to show an increasing emphasis on linking home and school interventions. By 2000 there existed a substantial literature on the integration of family and school counseling approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerrard|first1=B.|title=School-based family counseling: Overview, trends, and recommendations for future research|journal=International Journal for School-Based Family Counseling|date=2008|volume=1|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths of SBFC==

SBFC is a strength-based approach to counseling that emphasizes working with [[parents]] and [[Legal guardian|guardians]] as partners. It emphasizes integrating intervention (remedial) and [[Risk|prevention]] approaches at school and in the family. This emphasis on working collaboratively with parents and guardians in order to help their children succeed in school is appealing to families because of its educational focus. SBFC is a multiculturally sensitive counseling approach because it reduces the stigma associated with the [[mental health professions]]. This approach is practiced by many different [[mental health professionals]] and [[educators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soriano|first1=M.|last2=Hong|first2=G.|title=School-based family services: Administrative leadership for a caring model of effective education|journal=Journal for a Just and Caring Education|date=1997|volume=3|issue=2|pages=180–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=M.|last2=Evans|first2=W.|title=Urban school-based family counseling: Role definition, practice applications, and training implications|journal=[[Journal of Counseling and Development]]|date=1997|volume=75|issue=5|pages=366–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges for SBFC==

Most of the research supporting SBFC is descriptive and correlational. There is a need for rigorous [[randomized controlled trials]] of a variety of SBFC approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerrard|first1=B.|title=School-based family counseling: Overview, trends, and recommendations for future research|journal=[[International Journal for School-Based Family Counseling]]|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[mental health profession]] academic programs tend to emphasize interventions that focus on school intervention or family intervention, but not both. The development of SBFC programs requires both [[cross-disciplinary]] and [[cross-cultural]] thinking and a willingness to set aside mental health professional "turf" issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soriano|first1=M.|last2=Hong|first2=G.|title=School-based family services: Administrative leadership for a caring model of effective education|journal=[[Journal for a Just and Caring Education]]|date=1997|volume=3|issue=2|pages=180–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Sim Lee''' (October 29, 1745 – November 9, 1819) was an American planter and statesman of [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]], Maryland. Although not a signatory to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Articles of Confederation]] or the [[US Constitution]], he was an important participant in the process of their creation. Thomas Sim Lee was the second State Governor of Maryland, serving twice, from 1779 to 1783 and again from 1792 to 1794. Thomas Sim Lee also served as a delegate of Maryland in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1783 and was a member of the [[Maryland House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] in 1787. He worked closely with many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding fathers]] and played himself an important part in the birth of his state and the nation.

==Family==
Lee was born in 1745 in [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]] in the [[Province of Maryland]]. He was the son of Thomas (died 1749) and Christiana (Sim) Lee, a grandson of [[Philip Lee Sr.|Philip Lee]], and descended from the "[[Blenheim (Maryland)|Blenheim]]" Line of the [[Lee family]] of Virginia. [[Richard Lee I]] was his great-great-grandfather. His education was attained in the private schools of his native colony. On October 27, 1771, Thomas Sim Lee married [[Mary Digges]] (1745–1805), whose father was a prominent Maryland landowner. They had eight children;

==Public life==
During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], he backed the [[patriot cause]], and organized a [[local militia]] in which he served as [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. Lee entered politics in 1777, serving as a member of the Maryland Legislature, a position he held two years. The Maryland Legislature elected Lee governor in 1779. He was reelected in 1780 and 1781. During his first tenure, issues regarding the war effort were dealt with. He won wide praise for his logistical abilities as governor. Lee consistently procured fresh troops and supplies for the [[Continental Army]]. [[George Washington]] was Lee's friend, and learning of the plan to pin down [[General Cornwallis|Cornwallis]], Lee exerted all his energies to support the American troops. After completing his term, Lee left office on November 22, 1782. He then served in the Continental Congress in 1783 and 1784, and was a member of the State convention that ratified the U.S. Constitution in 1788. In 1792, Lee was again elected governor of Maryland. He was reelected to a second term in 1793, and to a third term in 1794. During his final tenure, the state militia was established, and the [[Whiskey rebellion]] was suppressed. Lee left office on November 14, 1794. Later that same year, he declined a seat in the U.S. Senate. He also declined a third tenure as governor in 1798.

==Leader in the struggle for independence==
Thomas Sim Lee was one of the participants of the [[Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)|Annapolis Convention]] in the mid-1770s, which produced a constitution for Maryland and transformed the colony into a state. On July 26, 1775 he was one of the signatories of the [[Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)|Declaration of the Association of the Freemen of Maryland]], an influential statement in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].

==Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union==
[[Image:Thomas Sim Lee Signature.JPG|thumb|235px|left|Signature of Governor Thomas Sim Lee on Act of Maryland legislature to ratify the Articles]]
As Governor of Maryland, Thomas Sim Lee signed the Act on February 2, 1781, whereby the [[Maryland State House|Maryland Legislature]] ratified the [[Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]]. As Maryland was the 13th and final state to ratify the Articles, the act established the ''requisite unanimous consent'' for the formation of a [[Perpetual Union]] of the states.

Prior to this event, Maryland had held out and refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded its [[western land claims]]. After Governor [[Thomas Jefferson]] signed the Act of the [[Virginia]] legislature on January 2, 1781 to grant these concessions the way forward for Maryland was cleared. On this second day of February, a Friday, as the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, "among engrossed Bills" was "signed and sealed by the Governor, in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses...an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation." The Senate then adjourned "to the first Monday in August next". The formal signing of the Articles by the Maryland delegates took place in [[Philadelphia]] at noon time on March 1, 1781. With these events, the Articles entered into force and the United States came into being as a united and [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] nation.

==Member of the Congress of the Confederation==
In his post-governor career, Thomas Sim Lee represented [[Maryland]] as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] in 1783 and 1784. He also was a member of the house of delegates in 1787. He declined the opportunity to serve in the convention that drafted the [[US Constitution|Constitution of the United States]], but served in the state convention that ratified the Constitution in 1788. Lee voted for Washington's second term as a Federalist presidential elector.

==The contribution of his wife==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mary Digges Lee.gif|thumb|250px|right|Mary Digges Lee (1745-1805)]] --&gt;
Governor Lee's wife, [[Mary Digges Lee]], responded to the need of the Revolutionary War troops from Maryland by rallying the women of Maryland to raise money in support of the war effort. She then established a correspondence with General [[George Washington]], asking how these resources could be put to best use. General Washington responded suggesting that the money raised be put toward the purchase of much-needed shirts and black neck clothes for the troops in the Southern army. He expressed gratitude to Mrs. Lee for the ''"patriotic exertions of the ladies of Maryland in favor of the army"''.

The couple was very active in patriotic activities during the Revolutionary War. They were also very committed to their religious and community ties. They founded the [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Petersville, Maryland)|St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Petersville, Maryland]].

After retiring from political life in 1794, Governor Lee focused his attention on his estate, Needwood, in [[Frederick County, Maryland]], where he owned some two hundred [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]].

Lee set up a winter home in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]], near the nation's capital. [[Federalists]] frequented the home, which became a meeting place for them.

Thomas Sim Lee was on the Board of directors of the [[Patowmack Canal]], which was intended by George Washington to connect the [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater]] near [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] with [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]]. The project, which started in 1785, was completed in 1802.

==Death==
Mary Digges Lee died on January 25, 1805 at the age of 60. Thomas Sim Lee remained a widower in Needwood until his death on November 9, 1819 at the age of 74 years. He was first buried at [[Melwood Park]], his wife's family home. In 1888 his and the Melwood Diggeses' graves were moved to a common grave in [[Mt. Carmel Roman Catholic Cemetery]] near [[Upper Marlboro, MD|Upper Marlboro, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="msa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/000800/000800/html/800bio.html|title=Thomas Sim Lee, MSA SC 3520-0800|publisher=|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribute==
A bronze plaque commemorating his life has been placed on a house he built in 1790 on 3001–3009 M Street (on the corner of [[M Street (Washington, D.C.)|M Street]] and [[30th Street (Washington D.C.)|30th Street]]) in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] section of Washington D.C.. The site is now referred to as the Thomas Sim Lee Corner.

==Military career==
After law school, both Rooney and his wife joined the U.S. Army JAG Corps. In 2001, Tom and Tara, along with their newborn son, were stationed at [[Fort Hood]] on [[9/11]]. Rooney spent over four years on Active Duty in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps (United States Army)|United States Army JAG Corps]]. He served as Special Assistant [[United States Attorney|U.S Attorney]] at Fort Hood in Texas, prosecuting all civilian crimes on post. Rooney also served in the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tomrooney.com/about.php |title=Values |work=Tom Rooney for Congress |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Rooney began teaching Constitutional and Criminal Law as an Asst. Prof. in the Dept. of Law at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westpoint.army.mil/about.asp |title=About The Academy |author= |date= |work=United States Military Academy |publisher=U.S. Army |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received two [[Army Commendation Medal]]s for his service.

==Early political career==
As his first job out of college, Tom Rooney worked for U.S. Senator [[Connie Mack III]], who had worked with Tom's father, Patrick J. Rooney Sr., at one time. Tom started in Senator Mack's mailroom: "We opened every letter and that's where I learned what people's issues were. It really helped shape a blank slate in my life."&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rathgeber|first=Bob|title=Connie Mack III mentor to many more than IV|url=http://www.news-press.com/article/20121024/NEWS0107/310240030/0/NEW0119/Connie-Mack-III-mentor-many-more-than-IV|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=News-Press|date=23 October 2012|quote=Rooney, R-Punta Gorda, who is trying to win his third term in Congress in District 17, said Mack is the reason he's a congressman today, planting his political seed two decades ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After getting his Masters, he returned to Florida, where he went to work as an Assistant Attorney General. While working as a criminal prosecutor for Attorney General [[Charlie Crist]],&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tom Rooney |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/campaign-2012/candidates/tom-rooney-59163/ |newspaper=Washington Times |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the Board of Directors with "The Children's Place at Home Safe," a Palm Beach County shelter that helps abused, neglected, and abandoned children. In 2005, Tom was named CEO of Home Safe and because of his work there, Governor [[Jeb Bush]] appointed Rooney to the Children's Services Council of Palm Beach County Board of Directors in January 2006. After his second year as director, Rooney returned to the Board of Directors of Children's Place and resumed his practice of law in [[Stuart, Florida]] with the law firm of Kramer, Sopko &amp; Levenstein, P.A.  He is a graduate of Leadership Palm Beach County.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2008: {{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2008#District 16}}
Rooney challenged Democratic incumbent [[Tim Mahoney]]. Mahoney had narrowly won the Republican-leaning district in 2006, after five-term incumbent [[Mark Foley]] abruptly resigned under a [[Mark Foley scandal|cloud of scandal]].&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; Since Foley resigned a little more than a month before the election, Florida election law required Foley's name to remain on the general election ballot, with votes for him being transferred to his replacement, State Representative [[Joe Negron]]. It was widely believed that this significantly undermined Negron's chances, as many voters would be reluctant to cast a ballot in Foley's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,217258,00.html GOP Picks Negron to Replace Foley on Florida Ballot] ''[[Fox News Channel|FOXnews]]'', October 3, 2006. The campaign used the slogan 'Punch Foley for Negron' as a means of educating the public about the ballot situation and as a means of differentiating the two men, making voting for Foley more palatable.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given Mahoney's narrow margin of victory, coupled with the unusual circumstances surrounding the 2006 election and this district's Republican bent, the 16th District was viewed as one of Republicans' best opportunities to take a congressional seat from the Democrats in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/may/03/no-surprises-as-qualifying-closes-for-races/ |title=No surprises as qualifying closes for Congressional races |first=Jim |last=Turner |date=3 May 2008 |work=TCPalm.com |publisher=Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers |accessdate=16 August 2012 |quote=Considered the only Democratic incumbent in South Florida who might have trouble, Mahoney has seemingly put himself in a good position with his mostly centrist legislative record, having become very accessible to his constituents, and, like other incumbents, bankrolling a sizeable early lead in fundraising among all the candidates.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republican Party primary, Rooney was endorsed by Florida's Governor, [[Charlie Crist]], and defeated State Representative [[Gayle Harrell]] and investment banker [[Hal Valeche]]. Mahoney, aided by incumbency and having burnished his image as a moderate [[Blue Dog Democrat]], consistently led Rooney in polls throughout the 2008 election cycle until mid-October 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama wins Florida en route to White House |first=Larry |last=Copeland |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/fl.htm |newspaper=USA Today |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |quote=Republican challenger Tom Rooney, a lawyer and former Army officer, had trailed early in the campaign until news broke last month about Mahoney's affairs.

Rooney ran unopposed in the Republican primary. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Jim Horn and write-in candidate William Dean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2010/nov/02/republican-tom-rooney-cruising-to-overwhelming/ |title=Republican Tom Rooney cruises to overwhelming win in District 16 U.S. House race |first=Jim |last=Turner |date=2 November 2010 |work=TCPalm.com |publisher=Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers |accessdate=16 August 2012 |quote=Given a choice of two fiscal conservatives, voters in Florida's 16th Congressional District overwhelmingly kept incumbent Republican Tom Rooney in Washington.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elections.msnbc.msn.com/ns/politics/2010/florida |title=Florida results |first=Jim |work=Decision 2010 |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2012: {{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012#District 17}}
For his first two terms, Rooney represented a district stretching from the [[Treasure Coast]] through the Everglades to [[Port Charlotte, Florida|Port Charlotte]] on the other side of the state.  Redistricting, however, saw the 16th renumbered as the [[Florida's 18th congressional district|18th District]] and made significantly more compact.  It lost most of its heavily Republican western portion to the new 17th District, which stretched from the Everglades to the outer suburbs of [[Tampa]].  Rooney opted to run for reelection in the 17th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Race Ratings: Handful of Seats for Grabs After Fla.

In the August 14 Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—Rooney faced Joe Arnold, a Republican state committeeman for Okeechobee County and member of the school board. Rooney defeated Arnold in a landslide, getting 74% of vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Incumbent Rooney wins GOP primary in landslide |first=Phil |last=Attinger |url=http://www.newschief.com/article/20120815/NEWS/120819960/ |newspaper=News Chief |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=15 August 2012 |quote=Rooney collected $930,249 in campaign donations through the last federal finance reporting period, which ended July 25, and had spent $798,006.

===Tenure===
One of the first bills Rooney introduced in the House was to prevent any money being spent to bring prisoners to Florida from the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. Another was a bill he co-sponsored to try to reduce the number of military veteran suicides by mandating mental health screenings for returning troops. Although that bill did not pass, the military eventually adopted the reforms Rooney asked for.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samples|first=Eve|title=Veterans suicide crisis defies party lines|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2012/sep/27/eve-samples-suicide-an-enemy-military-has-yet-to/|date=27 September 2012|work=TCPalm|publisher=The E.W.

Rooney sponsored a bill to name a federal courthouse under construction in [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]] in honor of a St. Lucie County [[Adams Ranch|rancher]], and former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice, Alto Lee Adams Sr.; Rooney's bill was approved by the House in September 2009, but was not passed by the Senate until September 2012, when the new courthouse had been open for eight months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2012/sep/22/us-senate-approves-naming-federal-courthouse-lee/|title=U.S. Senate approves naming federal courthouse after late Alto Lee Adams Sr.|date=22 September 2012|work=TCPalm.com |publisher=Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers |accessdate=25 September 2012 |quote=Supported in the Senate by Florida Democrat Bill Nelson, it passed unanimously Saturday and now heads to the president for his signature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Evans Crary Sr House, Downtown, Stuart, Florida 1021.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Stuart, Florida office of Congressman Tom Rooney]]
On the evening of February 19, 2012, a man crashed his pickup truck into Rooney's Stuart, Florida office. No one was inside the building at the time. The man claimed he tried to park in front of the building, but instead of pressing the brake, accidentally pressed the accelerator. The driver was cited for careless driving by the Stuart Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpbf.com/Pickup-Truck-Crashes-Into-Congressman-s-Stuart-Office/-/8789538/9243600/-/10mt32jz/-/index.html |title=Pickup Truck Crashes Into Congressman's Stuart Office |date=20 February 2012 |work=WPBF-TV |publisher=Hearst Television Inc |accessdate=8 August 2012 |quote=The truck went completely inside the building and had to be towed from the scene.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pickup Truck Crashes into U.S. Rep.

Rooney, as Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry, introduced The Defense of Environment and Property Act in March 2012. This act would make changes to federal water regulations and prevent some prosecutions of farmers and landowners by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3377|title=Rooney Introduces Defense of Environment and Property Act|date =30 March 2012|work=Press Release|publisher =Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an expansion of federal power to regulate wetlands in a 2011 EPA and Army Corps document that redefined "navigable waters," the Rooney bill defines navigable waters to exclude "wetlands without a continuous surface connection" to a body of water. The Rooney bill is a companion to a Senate bill introduced by Rand Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=VerBruggen|first=Robert|title=The Next Step for the Sacketts|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/294488/next-step-sacketts-robert-verbruggen|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=National Review Online|date=27 March 2012|quote=In a concurrence in last week's Supreme Court decision, Justice Samuel Alito took the somewhat unusual step of calling out Congress for its vague language, encouraging the legislative branch to clarify the Clean Water Act.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
A June 2011 bill to defund [[2011 military intervention in Libya|U.S. operations in Libya]] was written by Rooney, but defeated on the floor of the House because 89 Republicans voted against it. Rooney accepted responsibility for defeat of the bill, which was in competition with a non-binding resolution to deny President [[Barack Obama]] authority to wage war against Libya, saying "It was my bill. You can blame me. I think we tried to limit funds so our kids weren't in harm's way but not leave [[NATO]] on their own. People either wanted all or they wanted nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassata|first=Donna|title=Libya Resolution: House Rejects Measures To Authorize Libya Mission, Cut Off Funding|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/24/libya-resolution-authorization-house-vote_n_883946.html|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pergram|first=Chad|title=Rooney Takes Blame for Failed Vote to Defund Libya Operation|url=http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2011/06/24/rooney-takes-blame-failed-vote-defund-libya-operation|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=FOX News Network|date=24 June 2011|quote=It is rare on Capitol Hill for a lawmaker to concede something didn't go as planned.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2012, Rooney said that Obama should be blamed for [[2012 diplomatic missions attacks|attacks on U.S. embassies]] in the [[Middle East]] because the violence, and the deaths of four Americans in the [[U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi]], was foreseeable: "We supported the rebels without taking into account their individual values or motives, and without understanding their ability or plan to govern. We helped these individuals topple a dictator, but then stood on the sidelines as radical extremists assumed power. It should come as no surprise that these movements in the region have given way to violent, anti-American actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Jonathan|title=Tom Rooney blames Obama for Libya violence|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81180.html|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=13 September 2012|quote=Increasingly, Republicans have criticized Obama for what they portray as a failure to lead in the region, and Rooney's are among the harshest attacks yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====District switch with Allen West====
Although most of the voters in Rooney's old 16th District were in the new 18th District, in January 2012 Rooney announced that he would run for the neighboring 17th Congressional District seat, while Allen West declared in the new 18th.  Redistricting had made West's old 22nd District, which already had a modest Democratic lean, even more Democratic, and West wanted to run in a friendlier district.&lt;ref name="Share"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Allen West is walking on sunshine |first=Alex |last=Isenstadt |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/72247.html |newspaper=Politico |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |quote=The switch comes after a wave of conservative outrage at the proposed redistricting plan, with some accusing Republicans in the state Legislature of trying to push West, a bombastic freshman who has clashed with the party's leadership, out of Congress.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Florida: Anger, Confusion, Musical Chairs |first=Stuart |last=Rothenberg |url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_91/florida_anger_confusion_musical_chairs_allen_west_patrick_murphy-212166-1.html |newspaper=Roll Call |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As previously mentioned, Rooney's former district had been made somewhat friendlier to Democrats, and he opted to run in a more conservative district that included a large chunk of his old district's western portion.

In announcing his decision to run for reelection in Rooney's Congressional district, Allen West said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have always believed the state of Florida would be best served by having both Congressman Tom Rooney and myself in the House of Representatives working to solve our nation's most pressing problems.  I have never wavered from my vision; to work to create jobs, restrain federal government spending, reduce America's ever increasing national debt, and provide for a strong national defense to ensure a safer and more prosperous future for our children and grandchildren. Congressman Rooney is a statesman and has been an honorable public servant to the constituents of Florida's 16th Congressional district.  It is my goal to continue the success Congressman Rooney has had in Florida's 16th Congressional district in the newly proposed 18th district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West switching districts |first=David |last=Catanese |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/david-catanese/2012/01/west-switching-districts-113015.html |newspaper=Politico |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political positions==
Rooney has a score of 71% from [[Heritage Action for America]] regarding his conservative voting record, which is above the Republican House average.&lt;ref name="HAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Action Scorecard|url=https://www.heritageactionscorecard.com/members/member/R000583|website=Heritage Action Scorecard|publisher=Heritage Action for America|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney favors agricultural subsidies, including [[crop insurance]] and sugar price supports, so that food production in this country can better compete with other countries that provide government subsidies to their farmers. Rooney explained that "I don't want our country to depend on Mexico for our food, and I don't want Florida to lose agriculture jobs that we really need."&lt;ref name="Mattise"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samples|first=Eve|title=We all pay for sugar price supports—and the St. Lucie River pays, too|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2012/sep/30/eve-samples-we-all-pay-for-sugar-price-supports/|work=TCPalm.com|publisher=The E.W.

===F-35 alternative engine===
[[File:Sdd f136 006.jpg|thumb|GE/Rolls-Royce engine for F-35]]
Rooney fought to remove spending for an alternate engine program (built by [[GE Aviation]] and [[Rolls-Royce plc]]) for the [[F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]]. [[The Pentagon]] had already taken the position that having a single contractor ([[Pratt &amp; Whitney]]) will save money. "The Pentagon has said repeatedly that they do not want it and do not need it, and the American taxpayers certainly cannot afford it," Rooney said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/16/house-breaks-old-taboos-in-cutting-spree/ |title= House breaks old taboos in cutting spree |last= Dinan |first= Stephen |date= 16 February 2011 |newspaper= Washington Times |accessdate= 16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney sponsored an amendment to the 2012 House spending bill to end funding for the extra engine of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which passed with support from freshman members of the [[Tea Party Caucus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.defensepolicy.org/2011/congressman-tom-rooney/congressman-tom-rooney-defund-the-jsf-alternate-engine |title= Defund the JSF Alternate Engine |last= Rooney |first= Tom |date= 21 February 2011 |newspaper= DefensePolicy.org |accessdate= 29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Rooney (R-Fla.)|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tom-rooney-r-fla/gIQADjiUAP_topic.html|work=WP Politics|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=29 August 2012|first=Greg|last=Sargent|date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2011 GE abandoned self-funding to continue development of its alternate engine, finally ending the project. Rooney said that the decision by GE "will finally remove any risk that taxpayers may be saddled with the costs of sustaining an extra engine in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://finance.yahoo.com/news/GE-Aviation-ends-F-35-fighter-apf-3630210224.html |title= GE Aviation ends F-35 fighter engine development |last= Sewell |first= Dan |date= 2 December 2011 |newspaper= Yahoo!

===Terrorism===
Rooney criticised [[Justin Amash]] in May 2012, accusing the Michigan Republican of wanting to "coddle foreign enemy combatants" because he proposed an amendment to the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] (NDAA) to stop the military from indefinitely detaining suspected terrorists who were caught in the United States. Amash and Congressman [[Adam Smith (politician)|Adam Smith]] said they worried about civil liberties and the constitutionality of allowing indefinite detention of U.S. residents suspected of being terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://politics.heraldtribune.com/2012/05/17/area-congressman-debates-how-to-treat-suspected-terrorists/ |title= Area congressman debates how to treat suspected terrorists |last= Wallace |first= Jeremy |date= 17 May 2012 |newspaper= Sarasota Herald-Tribune |accessdate= 30 August 2012 |quote=Rooney later took to the House floor to argue in support of another amendment he proposed that would force suspected foreign terrorists and enemy combatants to be tried by a military commission in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba instead of in U.S. courts.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Rooney press release said that "the Amash amendment sacrifices our national security in order to coddle foreign enemy combatants. Never in our nation's history have we granted enemy combatants who attack our homeland during a time of war the same rights and privileges of American citizens, but that's exactly what the Amash amendment would do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.rollcall.com/news/tom_rooney_accuses_justin_amash_of_coddling_terrorists-214629-1.html |title= Tom Rooney Accuses Justin Amash of Coddling Terrorists |last= Stanton |first= John |date= 17 May 2012 |newspaper= Roll Call |accessdate= 16 August 2012 |quote=Rooney, a former military prosecutor, ripped into his colleague as the House prepared to debate Amash's bipartisan amendment to the defense reauthorization bill that would eliminate the authority of the military to indefinitely detain individuals suspected of being terrorists who were caught within the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3393 |title= Amash Amendment Rewards al Qaeda Attacks on U.S. Soil |date= 17 May 2012 |work= Press Release |publisher= Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website |accessdate= 30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney's press release was criticised in turn by a statement from [[Ron Paul]]'s [[Campaign for Liberty]] which accused Rooney of being "disgracefully dishonest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.campaignforliberty.org/profile/7786/blog/2012/05/17/disgracefully-dishonest |title= Representative Rooney's Disgracefully Dishonest Release |date= 17 May 2012 |work= Blog |publisher= Campaign for Liberty |accessdate= 30 August 2012 |quote=...Congressmen like Tom Rooney would seek to turn the judicial system on its head.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Rooney issued a statement of support for a competing amendment to the NDAA by congressmen [[Jeff Landry]], [[Louie Gohmert]] and [[Scott Rigell]]: "The Landry/Gohmert/Rigell amendment explicitly re-affirms and protects the constitutional rights of American citizens, and states clearly that no citizens' constitutional rights can be denied under the provisions of the defense bill... While it's critical that we protect the rights of American citizens, we should absolutely not exploit legitimate concerns in a misguided effort to extend our rights and privileges to foreign terrorists who attack our homeland." The Amash/Smith amendment was defeated and the  Landry/Gohmert/Rigell amendment was adopted, both by large margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/05/republicans-ndaa-detention-terrorist |title= House GOP Kills Proposal to Block Indefinite Detention of US Citizens |last= Drum |first= Kevin |date= 18 May 2012 |newspaper= Mother Jones |accessdate= 30 August 2012 |quote=...when Republicans like Rooney say that Smith and Amash want to "coddle terrorists," they're not necessarily talking about some heavily armed Al Qaeda fighter in Kandahar.

===Muslim Brotherhood controversy===
On June 13, 2012, Rooney was one of five members of Congress (including [[Michele Bachmann]], [[Trent Franks]], [[Louie Gohmert]] and [[Lynn Westmoreland]]) to send letters to the Inspectors General&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bachmann.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=303218 |title=House Members Seek National Security Answers|date=13 June 2012 |work= Press Release |publisher= Congresswoman Michele Bachmann Website |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Department of State seeking investigations into what they claimed was the U.S. government's involvement with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].

One of the letters in particular to Ambassador Harold W. Geisel, the Deputy [[Inspector General]] of the [[United States Department of State]], used the Department's Deputy [[Chief of Staff]], [[Huma Abedin]], as an example of the undue influence.

===Florida water quality===
[[File:Florida Algae Bloom 01.jpg|thumb|A Florida kayaker's paddles scoop up algae on the Santa Fe River, 2012]]
Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution provide nutrients that can cause [[Algal bloom|algae blooms]], which in turn produce toxins harmful to humans and animals across the state of Florida. Approximately 1,900 miles of rivers and streams in the state were impaired for nutrients in 2010, up from approximately 1,000 miles in 2008. Impaired acres of lakes in Florida were 378,000 in 2010, up from 350,000 acres in 2008.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Water Quality Standards for the State of Florida |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/florida_index.cfm |work=Water: Regulatory Information|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Background====
In 2008 the public interest law firm [[Earthjustice]] sued the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] on behalf of five environmental groups, claiming that delays by both state and federal governments in establishing quantitaive (rather than qualitative) limits for [[nutrient pollution]] of Florida's waters were unacceptable. In August 2009 the Obama administration settled the lawsuit by agreeing to begin the process of imposing enforceable EPA standards for nutrient levels in the public waters of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2009/epa-agrees-to-set-limits-on-fertilizer-and-animal-waste-pollution-in-florida |title=EPA Agrees to Set Limits on Fertilizer and Animal Waste Pollution in Florida |date=21 August 2009 |publisher=Earthjustice |accessdate=20 August 2012 |quote=Under the administration of President George W. Bush, the EPA let the states off the hook by allowing them to formulate plans without deadlines for action.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical nutrient level standards announced in November 2010 provoked the State of Florida to fight back by suing the EPA (enraging Earthjustice and environmentalists). Florida's outgoing ([[Bill McCollum]]) and incoming ([[Pam Bondi]]) Attorneys General, as well as the outgoing ([[Charles H. Bronson]]) and incoming ([[Adam Putnam]]) Agriculture Commissioners said that the EPA standards "are not based on scientifically sound methodology, and were adopted in an arbitrary and capricious manner just to settle a lawsuit." The EPA said that the regulations would not be implemented for 15 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Florida sues the EPA to block water pollution rules |first=Bill |last=Kaczor |url=http://www.tampabay.com/incoming/florida-sues-the-epa-to-block-water-pollution-rules/1138748 |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2012 |quote=The case was filed in the same Pensacola federal court where McCollum also is challenging President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://floridaindependent.com/16539/earthjustice-blasts-state-lawsuit-against-epa |title=Earthjustice blasts state lawsuit against EPA |first=Virginia |last=Chamlee |date=8 December 2010 |work=Florida Independent |publisher=American Independent News Network |accessdate=19 August 2012 |quote=David Guest, attorney for Earthjustice, released a statement following yesterday's announcement of the suit against the EPA. Calling the lawsuit a 'waste of taxpayer dollars,' Guest said that the state was using tax dollars to side with polluters rather than the environment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later, Earthjustice counterattacked by filing suit against the [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]] (FDEP) claiming that the state agency had failed to protect Floridians and tourists from toxic algae outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2011/earthjustice-files-suit-to-protect-floridians-right-to-clean-water |title= Earthjustice Files Suit to Protect Floridians' Right to Clean Water |date= 1 December 2011 |work= Press Release |publisher= Earthjustice |accessdate= 20 August 2012 |quote= The rule that the EPA set for Florida was a 'speed limit sign' that gave everyone fair notice of what specific level of pollution would be allowed in a particular water body.

====Rooney challenges EPA====
After the EPA said that it would establish numeric nutrient levels for waters in the state of Florida, as part of the 2009 consent decree with Earthjustice, Rooney led the state's congressional delegation by writing a letter asking the EPA to work with the state as it formulated rules for Florida. Rooney explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Florida has spent over $19 million and several years collecting the necessary data, sound science and community input to develop standards that are realistic and attainable for Florida. As the EPA begins to establish nutrient levels for Florida waters, it is important for the state to be a part of the decision process and to use the invaluable information that has been collected. This bipartisan letter signed by twenty-five members of our delegation simply asks EPA to work with Florida and utilize its data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3021 |title= Rooney Heads Florida Delegation Request to EPA |date= 2 December 2009 |work= Press Release |publisher= Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website |accessdate= 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Following the January 2010 publication of proposed EPA rules for Florida, Rooney said: "There are still too many questions that must be answered regarding the science used by the EPA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3007 |title= Rooney Statement on EPA Field Hearing |date= 18 February 2010 |work= Press Release |publisher= Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website |accessdate= 20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney and other members of Florida's Congressional delegation met with EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson in March, concerning the proposed Numeric Nutrient rules. At that meeting the agency agreed to extend the public comment period and to hold three more public meetings in Florida. Rooney also told Jackson that he was concerned, inasmuch as she had failed to meet personally with Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Michael Sole. Rooney said: "While there was progress in some areas the EPA proposal will have massive repercussions throughout our state. Therefore, this is something we cannot rush head-first into without knowing all the facts and science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3005 |title= Rooney Asks for Third Party EPA Review |date= 18 February 2010 |work= Press Release |publisher= Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website |accessdate= 21 August 2012 |quote=There has been great concern about the reliability and legitimacy of the science used by the EPA in setting the proposed numeric numbers. At this morning's meeting Rooney asked the EPA to help settle this dispute by having a third party study and review the science the agency used.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney pointed to studies concluding that the proposed rule would take $2 billion out of Florida's economy, and urged the EPA to do an economic analysis of the rule. He also called for the EPA to allow an independent, scientific review of the rule, which the EPA refused to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2011/feb/21/tom-rooney-untested-proposed-epa-regulations-not/ |title= Untested proposed EPA regulations might not clean Florida's water, but will dramatically drive up costs for residents and businesses |first= Tom |last= Rooney |date= 21 February 2011 |work= TCPalm.com |publisher= Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers |accessdate= 20 August 2012 |quote= I will not allow EPA to act tyrannically and dictatorially on this issue that affects every Floridian. Until the EPA is willing to consider Florida's unique needs and its economy, this regulation must not go into effect.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April, 2010 report by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, in conjunction with professors at the University of Florida Food and Resource Economics Department, and with Soil and Water Engineering Technology, Inc. concluded that compliance with the proposed numeric nutrient rule would subject 13.6 million acres of agriculture to direct costs of from $902 million to $1.605 billion annually, and indirect economic impacts of $1.148 billion per year to the state of Florida. "This report confirms what we have all feared. The economic ramifications of this proposed rule would be devastating to our state," Rooney said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2977 |title= Rooney: Proposed EPA Numeric Nutrient Rule "Devastating" for Florida Economy |date= 22 April 2010 |work= Press Release |publisher= Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website |accessdate= 21 August 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Rooney again called for delay of final federal rulemaking, pending the results of a third-party analysis, in a bipartisan letter from Florida's Congressional delegation to Lisa Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2911 |title= Rooney Calls for Independent Analysis of Numeric Nutrient Proposal |date= 1 August 2010 |work= Press Release |publisher= Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website |accessdate= 21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, a federal judge temporarily stopped the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from imposing federal water quality standards on former croplands in the Everglades, ruling that the Corps had changed its rules about water quality standards on former croplands without proper public notice and hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional/federal-judge-halts-army-corps-efforts-to-clean-up/nMBNQ/ |title= Federal judge halts Army Corps' efforts to clean up former cropland in Everglades |last= Stapleton |first= Christine |date= 29 September 2010 |newspaper= Palm Beach Post |accessdate= 3 September 2012 |quote=Nutrient standards—especially in the Everglades—have been especially controversial lately as two federal judges have ordered water managers and environmental officials to enforce nutrient standards and speed up the Everglades cleanup.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 2010, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum and Attorney General-elect Pam Bondi decided to file a lawsuit against the EPA regarding its proposed numeric nutrient rule. Rooney endorsed that decision, saying that "this lawsuit will put a stop to the EPA's misguided assaults on Florida's families and industries." Senator George LeMieux also endorsed the legal challenge to the EPA rule for Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3121|title= Rooney, LeMieux Support Florida Lawsuit against EPA|date= 7 December 2010|work= Press Release|publisher= Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website|accessdate= 21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cooperation, criticism and compromise====
After Lisa Jackson appeared before the House Agriculture Committee in March 2011, Rooney said: "In all the hearings I've attended as a member of Congress, I've never been to one like Lisa Jackson's appearance before the House Agriculture Committee. All the members of the committee—Republicans and Democrats—were up in arms over the EPA's agenda. I've never seen a witness from the administration get attacked like that from members of the president's own party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ward|first=Kenric|title=EPA Boss Lisa Jackson in Hot Water Over Job-Killing Policies Florida businesses, and even Democrats, challenge chief on science, economy|url=http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/epa-boss-lisa-jackson-hot-water-over-job-killing-policies|accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=Sunshine State News|date=27 June 2011|quote=Under the leadership of Lisa Jackson, the EPA has alternately antagonized and disappointed business leaders and environmentalists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooney sent a letter thanking Jackson for her promise that the EPA would cooperate with the state of Florida (and their Congressional delegation) to come up with reasonable nutrient levels, and for allowing both scientific review and economic analysis of the new regulations. Rooney's letter also asked the following questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3181 |title= Rooney Thanks EPA Administrator for Commitment to Work with Florida on Numeric Nutrient Compromise |date= 11 March 2011 |work= Press Release |publisher= Congressman Thomas J. Rooney Website |accessdate= 21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When will EPA begin to produce a complete economic analysis of the impact of the proposed regulation, and when does EPA expect that analysis to be complete?
* What methodology will EPA use in its economic analysis?
* Which third-party organization will EPA task with conducting a thorough review of the proposed rule?
* When will that third-party review commence, and when does EPA expect it to conclude?
* How will EPA adjust the proposed regulation to accommodate the findings of the third-party review and economic analysis?

Rooney and Senator Marco Rubio were criticised in the press for "siding with polluters" and "greedy business interests," leading Rooney and Rubio to co-author an article explaining that "half of the Democrats in Florida's House delegation supported our amendment to prevent the EPA from enforcing this new mandate until they complete an independent study of the science and a thorough economic analysis" and that Lisa Jackson had recently committed to having the EPA work with Florida's DEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2011/mar/18/editorial-rooney-and-rubio-join-forces-to-fight/ |title= Editorial: Rooney and Rubio join forces to fight EPA over clean water regulations for Florida |author= Editorial board |date= 18 March 2011 |work= TCPalm.com |publisher= Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers |accessdate= 21 August 2012}}

Rooney was criticized in an editorial for voting for a House bill sponsored by [[John Mica]] that would prohibit tightening water pollutant limits without a state's consent, a bill that the EPA protested would "overturn almost 40 years of federal legislation by preventing EPA from protecting public health and water quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2011/aug/01/editorial-proposal-in-us-senate-would-weaken-in/ |title= Editorial: Proposal in U.S. Senate would weaken efforts in Florida, nationwide to clean up waterways |author= Editorial board |date= 1 August 2011 |work= TCPalm.com |publisher= Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers |accessdate= 20 August 2012|quote=Rooney, citing multiple concerns, including those about the potential cost to business and agriculture, has actively supported legislation that would block the EPA from implementing numerical limits to nitrogen and phosphorus in state waters under the federal Clean Water Act. This is disconcerting given that Rooney also portrays himself as a champion of the St. Lucie River and Indian River Lagoon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2011 column, Rooney justified congressional review of EPA regulations, reduction of red tape and interference with new mandates as a means to "get the federal government off the backs of famers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www2.highlandstoday.com/news/agri-leader/2011/oct/12/LRNEWSO6-cutting-through-farm-red-tape-ar-303179/|title= Cutting through farm red tape|last=Rooney|first=Tom|date=12 October 2011|newspaper=Highlands Today|accessdate=21 August 2012|quote=...the high costs of excessive government regulation and red tape are threatening to drive farmers out of business. Small farmers, who have fewer resources to keep up with the growing number of federal mandates, are being hit especially hard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooney welcomed amended rules for numeric nutrient standards, approved in December by the [[Florida Environmental Regulation Commission]] and submitted to the EPA. After final approval by the EPA, the federal standards would then be withdrawn. The EPA acknowledged that "states have the primary role in establishing and implementing water quality standards for their waters."&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rooney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3318|title=Rooney Applauds Florida Environmental Commission Approval of Reasonable Numeric Nutrient Standards|date =8 December 2011|work=Press Release|publisher =Congressman Thomas J.

=== Tax reform ===

Rooney voted in favor of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].&lt;ref name="Almukhtar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Almukhtar|first1=Sarah|title=How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=24 December 2017|date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill includes disaster relief aid for Florida citrus growers who suffered loss due to [[Hurricane Irma]], which Rooney calls a "big win."&lt;ref name="FT121917"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tuesday's Daily Pulse|url=http://www.floridatrend.com/article/23604/tuesdays-daily-pulse|website=Florida Trend|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun policy===

Rooney characterizes himself as a "champion for [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights," saying that the right to bear arms is "one of our most sacred rights."&lt;ref name="Rooney 2016"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tomrooney.com/single-post/2016/03/01/Protecting-the-Second-Amendment| title=Protecting the Second Amendment| date=1 March 2016| website=tomrooney.com| publisher=Tom Rooney for Congress| access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2017, Rooney has an "A-" rating from the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]], indicating a voting record that is generally pro-gun rights.&lt;ref name="ISPY"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/107800/tom-rooney?categoryId=37&amp;type=V,S,R,E,F,P#.Wp7tQ-dG1PY| title=Tom Rooney's Political Summary on Issue: Guns| website=ISPY| publisher=Vote Smart| access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a Congressman, Rooney has voted in favor of several pieces of legislation to expand gun rights, including a yes vote on [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/38 H. R. 38] (the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act), which would enable [[Concealed carry in the United States#Reciprocity|concealed carry reciprocity]] among all States if and when it is signed into law.&lt;ref name="HR38"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll663.xml| title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 663| website=clerk.house.gov|publisher=U.S. Federal Government|date=6 December 2017| access-date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the Act, Rooney said, "Just as a driver's license would be recognized in another state, a person who is legally permitted to carry a concealed handgun for their or their loved ones' own protection should have that ability anywhere in our nation."&lt;ref name="Rooney 2017"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://rooney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rooney-house-pass-national-concealed-carry-reciprocity-act| title=Rooney, House Pass National Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act| website=Thomas J. Rooney| publisher=U. S. Federal Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2017, Rooney voted in favor of the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1181 Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act], which, if signed into law, will allow [[veteran]]s who are considered "mentally incompetent" to purchase ammunition and firearms unless declared a danger by a judge.&lt;ref name="HR 1181"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll169.xml| title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 169| website=clerk.house.gov|publisher=U.S. Federal Government|date=16 March 2017| access-date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rooney also voted in favor of [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/40 H.J.Res.40], which successfully used the [[Congressional Review Act]] to [[Repeal of the Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007|block implementation]] of an Obama-era Amendment to the [[NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007]] that was aimed at preventing the mentally-infirm from legally purchasing firearms.&lt;ref name="Clerk 2017"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll077.xml| website=clerk.house.gov|publisher=U. S. Federal Government| date=2 February 2017| access-date=6 March 2018| title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Rooney signed a letter to the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] objecting to a proposed ban of [[.223 Remington|a certain rifle cartridge]] due to its [[Armor-piercing shell#Small arms|armor-piercing]] capabilities.&lt;ref name="ATF 2015"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://woodall.house.gov/sites/woodall.house.gov/files/ATFLETTER.pdf| title=Letter to B. Todd Jones, Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - Ammunition Ban| date=4 March 2015| website=Congressman Rob Woodall| publisher=U. S. Federal Government| access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Date 2015"&gt;{{cite web| title=ATF Director B. Todd Jones Stepping Down After Nearly 4 Years on Job | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/atf-director-todd-jones-stepping-years-job/story?id=29779602| last1=Date| first1=Jack| last2=Levine| first2=Mike| date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the letter, it states that "the idea that Congress intended [https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/3132 LEOPA] to ban one of the preeminent rifle cartridges in use by Americans for legitimate purposes is preposterous."&lt;ref name="ATF 2015"/&gt;
The attempt to ban the cartridges was abandoned shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Date 2015"/&gt;

Rooney opened up more about his opinions on gun [[lobbying|lobbyist]] groups after his February 2018 announcement that he would not be seeking reelection.
Rooney stated that even supporting a [[Bump fire#Bump fire stocks|bump stock]] ban after the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] was akin to "political suicide" and that "the NRA has an extremely sophisticated ability to either help you or hurt you from being able to continue to call yourself 'Congressman.'"&lt;ref name="Cerabino 2018"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/cerabino-fla-congressman-reveals-nra-scorecard-not-the-whole-score/xCyiZ53GJ7uZCkMzwYsK5N/| title=Cerabino: Fla. Congressman reveals NRA scorecard not the whole score| last=Cerabino| first=Frank| work=Palm Beach Post| location=Palm Beach County, Florida| access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rooney also questioned the role of [[AR-15 style rifle]]s in society, saying "What is the purpose of that gun, especially one with a bump stock on it?"&lt;ref name="Cerabino 2018"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Tom Rooney is a grandson of Pittsburgh Steelers founder [[Art Rooney]] Sr.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/jan/18/are-you-ready-for-smashmouth-football/ Rep.

===Palm Beach Kennel Club===
Tom's grandfather, Art Rooney, bought the Palm Beach Kennel Club in West Palm Beach in 1969 and his father ran the business as president from 1984 until recently, when his brother, Patrick J. Rooney Jr., became president of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2008-08-16/news/0808150281_1_charlie-crist-gambling-interests-endorsement |title= Crist backs Rooney for Congress |first= Jim |last= Turner |date= 16 August 2008 |work= Sun Sentinel |publisher= Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers |accessdate= 2 September 2012 |quote=As part of the growing bitterness in the race, the Kennel Club's president, Pat Rooney Sr., the candidate's father, has threatened Valeche with a lawsuit over a newspaper editorial in which Valeche criticized the kennel club's proposal to expand gambling.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Family"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/sports/rooney-family-has-made-a-big-impact-in-palm-beach-/nLphQ/ |title= Rooney family has made a big impact in Palm Beach County |first= Brian |last= Biggane |date= 3 February 2011 |newspaper= Palm Beach Post |accessdate= 2 September 2012 |quote=PBKC remained the main family business here.

'''William Dawes Jr.''' (April 6, 1745 &amp;ndash; February 25, 1799) was one of several men and a woman&lt;ref&gt;''Paul Revere's Ride'' by David Hackett Fischer&lt;/ref&gt; in April 1775 who alerted [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial]] [[Minutemen (militia)|minutemen]] in Massachusetts of the approach of [[British army]] troops prior to the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] at the outset of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name="midnight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-midnight-ride-of-william-dawes?linkId=23506843|title=The Midniight Ride of William Dawes|last=Klein|first=Christopher|date=April 18, 2012|publisher=History.com|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some years, [[Paul Revere]] had the most renown for his ride of warning of this event.

==Early life==
Dawes was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 6, 1745, to William and Lydia Dawes ([[née]] Boone), and baptized at Boston's [[Old South Meeting House|Old South Church]]. He became a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] and was active in Boston's militia. On May 3, 1768, Dawes married Mehitable May, the daughter of Samuel and Catherine May (née Mears). The ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' noted that for his wedding, he wore a suit entirely made in North America. At the time, [[Radical Whigs|Whigs]] were trying to organize a boycott of British products to pressure [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] into repealing the [[Townshend Acts]].

==Role in Boston's militia==

On April 8, 1768, Dawes was elected as a member of the [[Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts]].  He was appointed as the Company's second sergeant in 1770.  When the Company was revived in 1786, after becoming dormant during the American Revolution, he was appointed as the Company clerk.  His father, William Dawes Sr., was also a member of the Company.

It is likely that in September 1774, Dawes was instrumental in helping Boston's militia artillery company secure its four small cannons from British army control. The [[Massachusetts]] [[Provincial Congress]] certainly sent word to him in February 1775 that it was time to move two of those weapons out of Boston.

===Midnight ride===
Dawes was assigned by Doctor [[Joseph Warren]] to ride from [[Boston]] to [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], on the night of April 18, 1775, when it became clear that a British column was going to march into the countryside. Dawes's mission was to warn [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]] that they were in danger of arrest. Dawes took the land route out of Boston through the [[Boston Neck]], leaving just before the British military sealed off the town.&lt;ref name="DWDWRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmdawes.org/ride.html|title=The Ride|publisher=The Descendants of William Dawes Who Rode Association|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also acting under Dr. Warren, [[Paul Revere]] arranged for another rider waiting across the Charles River in Charlestown to be told of the army's route with lanterns hung in [[Old North Church]].  To be certain the message would get through, Revere rowed across the river and started riding westward himself. Later, [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s historically inaccurate poem "[[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Paul Revere's Ride]]" would focus entirely on Revere, making him a composite of the many alarm riders that night.

Dawes and Revere arrived at the [[Hancock-Clarke House]] in Lexington about the same time, shortly after midnight. Revere arrived slightly earlier, despite having stopped to speak to militia officers in towns along the way, as his route was shorter and his horse faster.  After warning Adams and Hancock to leave, Revere and Dawes proceeded to [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] in case that was the British column's goal.  Revere no doubt knew that the Provincial Congress had stored munitions there, including the cannon which Dawes had helped to secure.  Along the way, the two men met [[Samuel Prescott]], a local young physician, who joined them.

A squad of mounted British officers awaited on the road between Lexington and Concord.  They had already arrested some riders heading west with news of the troops, and they called for Dawes, Revere, and Prescott to halt. The three men rode in different directions, hoping one would escape. Dawes, according to the story he told his children, rode into the yard of a house shouting that he had lured two officers there. Fearing an ambush, the officers stopped chasing him. Dawes's horse bucked him off, however, and he had to walk back to Lexington. He later said that in the morning, he returned to the same yard and found the watch that had fallen from his pocket. Otherwise, Dawes's activity during the Battle of Lexington and Concord remains unknown.&lt;!--but see the Prescott article--&gt;

Dawes and his companions' warnings allowed the town militias to muster a sufficient force for the first open battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the first colonial victory. The British troops did not find most of the weapons they had marched to destroy, and sustained serious losses during their retreat to Boston while under attack by the colonists.

===Service in the American Revolution===

On September 9, 1776 Dawes was commissioned second major of the Boston militia regiment.

Also during the war, Dawes worked as a quartermaster in central Massachusetts. British [[POW]]s from the [[Battle of Saratoga]] complained to [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] that he gave them short supplies; his family countered that Dawes believed that they were stealing from farmers while being marched to Boston &amp;ndash; as most armies on the march were prone to do.

==Later life and death==
[[File:William Dawes tomb Boston.jpg|thumb|right|280px|William Dawes tomb marker in [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]]]]
Dawes refused to join a punitive expedition against Indians ordered by Governor Phillip in December 1790.

Mehitable died in 1793,&lt;ref name=fletcher&gt;{{cite web

|date=2005-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he remarried (to Lydia) two years later. 

Dawes died in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]], on February 25, 1799. He was believed to have been buried in the [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]], but modern research points to his resting place now being in his first wife's family plot in [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] in [[Jamaica Plain]].&lt;ref name=fletcher/&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Main|Paul Revere#The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere}}
[[File:1510-Cambridge Common 095.jpg|thumbnail|Memorial: William Dawes to Lexington. Location: Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts]]
The poem by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], "[[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Paul Revere's Ride]]", has been criticized by modern historians for overstating the role of Revere in the night's events.  Revere's may have been a better story, but Dawes and Prescott were more successful in achieving their missions. In 1896 Helen F. Moore, dismayed that William Dawes had been forgotten, penned a parody of Longfellow's poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.paul-revere-heritage.com/midnight-ride-william-dawes.html | title = The Midnight Ride of William Dawes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:William Dawes plaque, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4611.JPG|thumbnail|left|William Dawes plaque showing the route his ride.  Near Cambridge Commons, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].]]

The difference in Revere's and Dawes's achievement and legacy is examined by [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book ''[[The Tipping Point]]'', where he concludes that Revere would be classified as a [[Connector (social)|connector]] whereas Dawes was an "ordinary man."

Dawes's ride is commemorated on a traffic island in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], heavily travelled by pedestrians, at the intersection of Garden Street and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in [[Harvard Square]], and known as ''Dawes Island''.  Dawes's passage through the area is represented by bronze horseshoes embedded in the sidewalk, as hoofprints, accompanied by an inscription giving his name and the date (inaccurately stated as April 19, 1775), and by historical displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmdawes.org/dawesisland.html|title=Dawes Island|publisher=The Descendants of William Dawes Who Rode Association|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The American Revolution Comes to Cambridge, Part II: Sounding the Warning: 18–19 April 1775", Note 3, {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507044401/http://www2.cambridgema.gov/Historic/april1.html |date=May 7, 2011 }} Retrieved 1 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'', the early events take place in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], at William Dawes Elementary School.

==Descendants==
William Dawes' great-grandson, [[Rufus Dawes]], was a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] military officer and congressman. Rufus Dawes' children included [[Charles G. Dawes]], who served as [[Vice President of the United States]] under [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Rufus C. Dawes]], a businessman, [[Beman Gates Dawes]], a businessman and congressman, and [[Henry M. Dawes]], a businessman and banker. Television personality [[Bill Schulz]] is another descendant of Dawes, as the grandson of Henry M. Dawes' daughter Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mary Dawes is Wed in Ceremony at Parents' Home | last=Cass | first=Judith | work=Chicago Sunday Tribune | date=September 24, 1933 | url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/tribune/trib09241933/trib09241933003.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Dawes was also a first cousin of [[Thomas Dawes]], who was a Revolutionary War colonel, a noted architect/builder, and held numerous government positions.

The '''Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation'''  was adopted by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) in 1999 as ILO Recommendation No 190.&lt;ref name="Recommendation R190"/&gt; The provisions of this Recommendation supplement those of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (Convention No 182, referred to below as ‘the Convention’) and should be applied in conjunction with them. This article should be read together with that on the Convention.

The provisions of the Recommendation include the following:&lt;ref name="Recommendation R190"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312528:NO|title=R190 - Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation, 1999 (No. 190)|work=[[International Labour Organization]]|date=17 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What programmes of action referred to in Article 6 of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] should aim at (Article I);
*What should be considered when ratifying countries determine in terms of Article 3(d) of the Convention what the [[Worst Forms of Hazards faced by Children at Work]] in those countries are (Article II);
*That detailed information and statistical data on the nature and extent of child labour should be compiled and kept up to date (Article III(5) to (7);
*That ratifying countries should establish or designate appropriate national mechanisms to monitor the implementation of national provisions for the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour (Article III(8));
*That ratifying countries should, in so far as it is compatible with national law, cooperate with international efforts aimed at the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour (Article III(11));
*That ratifying countries should provide that the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention#Predefined worst forms of child labour|pre-defined ''worst forms of child labour'']] are criminal offences and also provide for other criminal, civil or administrative remedies to ensure the effective enforcement of national provisions for the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour (Article III(12) to (14));
*A list of other measures that could be used to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labour (Article III(15));
*That enhanced international cooperation and/or assistance among ratifying countries for the prohibition and effective elimination of the worst forms of child labour should complement national efforts (Article III(16)).
