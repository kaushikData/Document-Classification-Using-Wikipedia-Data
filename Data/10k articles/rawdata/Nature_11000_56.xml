A '''bestiary''', or '''''bestiarum vocabulum''''', is a [[compendium]] of beasts. Originating in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], bestiaries were made popular in the [[Middle Ages]] in illustrated volumes that described various animals and even rocks. The [[natural history]] and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God, and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the [[pelican]], which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of [[Jesus]]. The bestiary, then, is also a reference to the [[symbol]]ic language of [[animals in Christian art|animals in Western Christian art]] and literature.

==History==
The earliest bestiary in the form in which it was later popularized was an anonymous 2nd century [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] volume called the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which itself summarized ancient knowledge and wisdom about animals in the writings of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' and various works by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Solinus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] and other naturalists.

Following the ''Physiologus'', Saint [[Isidore of Seville]] (Book XII of the ''[[Etymologiae]]'') and [[Saint Ambrose]] expanded the religious message with reference to passages from the [[Bible]] and the [[Septuagint]]. They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the [[Bird migration|migration]] of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era.

Medieval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat. Bestiaries were particularly popular in [[England]] and [[France]] around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts. The [[Aberdeen Bestiary]] is one of the best known of over 50 manuscript bestiaries surviving today.

Bestiaries influenced early [[heraldry]] in the Middle Ages, giving ideas for [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] and also for the artistic form. Bestiaries continue to give inspiration to coats of arms created in our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|year=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=0 906670 44 6|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two illuminated [[Psalter]]s, the [[Queen Mary Psalter]] ([[British Library]] Ms. Royal 2B, vii) and the [[Isabella Psalter]] (State Library, [[Munich]]), contain full Bestiary cycles. The bestiary in the Queen Mary Psalter is found in the "marginal" decorations that occupy about the bottom quarter of the page, and are unusually extensive and coherent in this work. In fact the bestiary has been expanded beyond the source in the Norman bestiary of Guillaume le Clerc to ninety animals. Some are placed in the text to make correspondences with the [[psalm]] they are illustrating.&lt;ref&gt;The Queen Mary psalter: a study of affect and audience By Anne Rudloff Stanton, p44ff, Diane Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also made his own bestiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Selections from the Bestiary of Leonardo da Vinci | first1=Oliver |last1=Evans |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=64 |number=254 |date=Oct–Dec 1951 |pages=393–396 |jstor=537007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''volucrary'' is a similar collection of the symbols of birds that is sometimes found in conjunction with bestiaries. The most widely known volucrary in the Renaissance was [[Johannes de Cuba]]'s ''Gart der Gesundheit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Cuba|first1=Jean|title=Garden Of Health|date=1501|publisher=Verard Antoine (Paris)|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b2100150b|archiveurl=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb386198123|archivedate=2007|language=French|format=758 scanned pages with black &amp; white illustrations}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes 122 birds and which was printed in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;''Hortus sanitatis deutsch.'' Mainz (Peter Schöffer) 1485; Neudrucke München 1924 and 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bestiary content==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Medieval bestiaries often contained detailed descriptions and illustrations of species native to Western Europe, exotic animals and what in modern times are considered to be imaginary animals. Descriptions of the animals included the physical characteristics associated with the creature, although these were often physiologically incorrect, along with the Christian morals that the animal represented. The description was then normally followed with an artistic illustration of the animal as described in the bestiary.

Bestiaries were organized in different ways based upon the text. The descriptions could be organized by animal groupings, such as terrestrial and marine creatures, or presented in an alphabetical manner. However, the texts gave no distinction between existing and imaginary animals. Descriptions of creatures such as [[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[basilisk]], [[griffin]] and [[caladrius]] were common in such works and found intermingled amongst accounts of bears, boars, deer, lions, and elephants.

This lack of separation has often been associated with the assumption that people during this time believed in what the modern period classifies as nonexistent or "[[imaginary creatures]]". However, this assumption is currently under debate, with various explanations being offered.

Some scholars, such as Pamela Gravestock, have written on the theory that medieval people did not actually think such creatures existed but instead focused on the belief in the importance of the Christian morals these creatures represented, and that the importance of the moral did not change regardless if the animal existed or not.

The contents of medieval bestiaries were often obtained and created from combining older textual sources and accounts of animals, such as the ''[[Physiologus]]'', with newer observations and writings. In this way, the content of such written works was constantly added to and built upon.

==Modern bestiaries==
In modern times, artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Saul Steinberg]] have produced their own bestiaries. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a contemporary bestiary of sorts, the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'', which collects imaginary beasts from bestiaries and fiction. Nicholas Christopher wrote a literary novel called "The Bestiary" (Dial, 2007) that describes a lonely young man's efforts to track down the world's most complete bestiary. [[John Henry Fleming]]'s ''Fearsome Creatures of Florida''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearsomecreatures.com |title=Fearsome Creatures of Florida by John Henry Fleming |website=Fearsomecreatures.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pocol Press, 2009) borrows from the medieval bestiary tradition to impart moral lessons about the environment. [[Caspar Henderson]]'s The Book of Barely Imagined Beings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barelyimaginedbeings.com |title=The Book of Barely Imagined Beings |website=Barelyimaginedbeings.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Granta]] 2012, [[Chicago University Press]] 2013), subtitled "A 21st Century Bestiary," explores how humans imagine animals in a time of rapid environmental change. In July 2014, Jonathan Scott wrote The Blessed Book of Beasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rna.org/news/184377/Beasts-from-the-East.htm |title=Religion News Association &amp; Foundation |website=Rna.org |date=2016-11-21 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Christian Publications, featuring 101 animals from the various translations of the Bible, in keeping with the tradition of the bestiary found in the writings of the Saints, including Saint John Chrysostom.

'''''Brian's Winter''''' also known as '''''Hatchet: Winter''''' is a [[1996 in literature|1996]] [[young adult novel]] by [[Gary Paulsen]]. It is the third novel in the ''Hatchet'' series, but second in terms of chronology as an [[alternate ending]] sequel to ''[[Hatchet (novel)|Hatchet]]''.

It was also released as ''Hatchet: Winter'' by Pan Macmillan on February 9, 1996.

==Background==
At the end of ''Hatchet'', thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson, who has been trapped in the [[Canada|Canadian]] wilderness after a plane accident, decides to dive for a "survival pack" from the submerged aircraft. He almost drowns trying to tear the plane open. He recovers, among other things, an [[Emergency position-indicating rescue beacon|emergency transmitter]].  Within hours, a pilot receives the beacon and rescues him. The book begins with a foreword that Brian, who learned wilderness [[survival skills|survival]] through trial and error, probably would not have survived the upcoming harsh winter on his own.

Paulsen says that many readers wrote to him, complaining about the [[deus ex machina]] ending.  In response, Paulsen wrote ''Brian's Winter'', which explores what would have happened if Brian had not activated the transmitter.

==Plot summary==
The story deals with Brian, still stranded at the L-shaped lake during the fall and winter, constructing a winter shelter, building [[snow shoes]], being confronted by a [[bear]], befriending and naming a [[skunk]] and learning how to make a [[Bow and arrow|bow]] more powerful.  Eventually, Brian meets a family of [[Cree]] [[animal trapping|trappers]], the Smallhorns, who help him return home.

==Continuity with series==
''Brian's Winter'' is followed chronologically by the two sequels, ''[[Brian's Return]]'' and ''[[Brian's Hunt]]'' as they recognize the book as a series canon. ''[[The River (Gary Paulsen novel)|The River]]'' does not and includes no mention that the events of ''Brian's Winter'' ever took place as Brian tells Derek Holtzer that he only spent fifty-four days in the wilderness. This is because ''The River'' was published in 1991, five years before the release of ''Brian's Winter''.

'''Buddhist atomism''' is a school of [[atomism|atomistic]] [[Buddhist]] philosophy that flourished on the [[Indian subcontinent]] during two major periods {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. During the first phase, which began to develop prior to the 6th century BCE&lt;ref name=reginaldray247&gt;Reginald Ray (1999), Buddhist Saints in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195134834}}, pages 237-240, 247-249&lt;/ref&gt;, Buddhist atomism had a very qualitative, [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]-style [[atomic theory]]. This form of atomism identifies four kinds of atoms, corresponding to the standard elements. Each of these elements has a specific property, such as solidity or motion, and performs a specific function in mixtures, such as providing support or causing growth.  Like the [[Hindu]]s and [[Jain]]s, the Buddhists were able to integrate a theory of atomism with their logical presuppositions. 

According to Noa Ronkin, this kind of atomism was developed in the [[Sarvastivada]] and [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantika]] schools for whom material reality can be: &lt;blockquote&gt;reduced to discrete momentary atoms, namely, the four primary elements. These momentary atoms, through their spatial arrangement and by their concatenation with prior and posterior atoms of the same type, create the illusion of persisting things as they appear in our everyday experience. Atomic reality is thus understood first and foremost as change, though not in the sense of a thing x transforming into y. That is, change itself is the very nature of atomic reality rather than its being made of enduring substances the qualities of which undergo change. Atoms that appear to endure are, in fact, a series of momentary events that ascend and fall in rapid succession and in accordance with causal relations. Unlike the atoms of the Vaifesika, the atoms of the Sarvastivada-Vaibhasika and the Sautrantika are not permanent: they come into being and cease from one moment to the next going through a process of birth, continuance, decay and destruction. Yet the material compounds that consist of these atoms are real, if only in the minimal, phenomenological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa, Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition (Routledge curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism) 2011, p. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The second phase of Buddhist atomism, which flourished in the 7th century CE, was very different from the first. Indian Buddhist philosophers, including [[Dharmakirti]] and [[Dignāga]], considered atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. In discussing Buddhist atomism, [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy|Stcherbatsky]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;(Stcherbatsky 1962 (1930). Vol. 1. p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
... The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... "Everything is evanescent," ... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff ... Both systems &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Samkhya|Sānkhya]] and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of Existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called "qualities" (guna-dharma) in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality, ... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called guna "quality", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive ... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called dharmas ("qualities").

[[File:Thunderstorm formation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Convective cloud's thickness, between its base and top, shown on the background scale at different stages of its life]]

The '''cloud height''', more commonly known as '''cloud thickness''' or '''depth''', is the distance between the [[cloud base]] and the [[cloud top]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Huschke|first=Ralph E.|origyear=1959|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Cloud_height| chapter=Cloud height|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|title=Glossary of Meteorology|place=[[Boston]]| edition=2nd| year=1970|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally expressed either in metres or as a [[pressure]] difference in [[hectopascal]] (hPa, equivalent to [[millibar]]). Sometimes, the expression ''cloud height'' is used instead of ''[[cloud base]]'', in which case the context has to clarify whether the intent is to designate the height of the base of the cloud or the size of it.

==Measurement==
''Cloud height'' is not measured directly but is derived from separate measurements of cloud base and cloud top altitudes.

==Weather and climate relevance==
Cloud height is often related to the intensity of [[precipitation]] generated by a [[cloud]]: deeper clouds tend to produce more intense [[rainfall]]. For instance, [[cumulonimbus cloud]]s can develop vertically through a substantial part of the [[troposphere]] and often result in [[thunderstorm]]s with [[lightning]] and heavy showers. By contrast, very thin clouds (such as [[cirrus clouds]]) do not generate any precipitation at the surface of the Earth.

For a synthetic discussion of the impact of clouds on the climate system, see the [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/index.htm IPCC Third Assessment Report], in particular chapter 7.2.

'''Cocos Island''' ({{lang-es|Isla del Coco}}) is an [[island]] designated as a [[National Parks of Costa Rica|National Park]] off the shore of [[Costa Rica]], that does not allow inhabitants other than Costa Rican Park Rangers. It constitutes the 11th&lt;ref name=islacoco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islacoco.com/es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=6|title=Isla Coco|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 13 districts of [[Puntarenas Canton]] of the province of Puntarenas.&lt;ref name=hacienda&gt;[http://www.hacienda.go.cr/centro/datos/Educacion%20ciudadana/Brochoure%20N%2021%20%20c%C3%B3digos%20tributarios.doc GUIA DE CODIGOS TRIBUTARIOS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929180153/http://www.hacienda.go.cr/centro/datos/Educacion%20ciudadana/Brochoure%20N%2021%20%20c%C3%B3digos%20tributarios.doc |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the [[Pacific Ocean]], approximately {{convert|550|km|mi nmi|0|abbr=on}} from the Pacific shore of Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;Hogue, C. and Miller, S. 1981. Entomofauna of Cocos Island, Costa Rica. Atoll Research Bulletin 250: 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt; With an area of approximately {{convert|23.85|km2|2|abbr=on}}, about {{convert|8|x|3|km|0|abbr=on}} and a perimeter of around {{convert|23.3|km|1|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Montoya, M. 2007.

It is the [[Extreme points of North America|southernmost point on the North American continent if outer islands are included]].

Surrounded by deep waters with [[Equatorial Counter Current|counter-currents]], Cocos Island is admired by [[Scuba set|scuba]] divers for its populations of [[hammerhead shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]], [[dolphins]] and other large marine species.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;White, E.R., Myers, M.C., Mills Flemming, J. and Julia K. Baum. 2015. Shifting elasmobranch community assemblage at Cocos Island—an isolated marine protected area. Conservation Biology, 29: 1186–1197. doi:10.1111/cobi.12478&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely wet climate and oceanic character give Cocos an ecological character that is not shared with either the [[Galápagos Islands|Galápagos Archipelago]] or any of the other islands (for example, [[Malpelo Island|Malpelo]], [[Gorgona, Colombia|Gorgona]] or [[Coiba]]) in this region of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall, L. and Jordal, B. 2006.

Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 89(4): 729–743.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present status and international distinctions==
Cocos Island was declared a Costa Rican National Park by means of Executive Decree in 1978. Cocos Island National Park was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1997. In 2002, the World Heritage Site designation was extended to include an expanded marine zone of {{convert|1997|km2|0|abbr=on}}. In addition, it is included in the list of "Wetlands of International Importance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/key_conv_e.htm|title=Ramsar Convention text in English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Ramsar.org|access-date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Cocos Island was short-listed as a candidate to be declared one of the [[New7Wonders of Nature]] of the world by the [[New7Wonders of the World]] Foundation, and ranked second in the islands category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/liveranking/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705105855/http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/liveranking/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 July 2009|title=New7Wonders: Live Ranking|date=5 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the breathtaking marine life in its waters (see Fauna section below), Cocos Island was named one of the best 10 scuba diving spots in the world by PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) and a "must do" according to diving experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20166937/|title=World's 10 best scuba spots|date=8 August 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many, the main attractions are the large [[pelagic fish]] species, which are very abundant in this unique meeting point between deep and shallow waters. The largest schools of hammerhead sharks in the World are consistently reported there. Encounters with dozens if not hundreds of these and other large animals are nearly certain in every dive. Smaller and colorful species are also abundant in one of the most extensive and rich reefs of the south eastern Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán, H. M. and Cortés, J. (1992). Cocos Island (Pacific of Costa Rica) coral reefs after the 2010-83 El Niño disturbance. Revista de Biología Tropical 40: 309–324.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous oceanographer [[Jacques Cousteau]] visited the island several times and in 1994 called it "the most beautiful island in the world". These numerous accolades highlight the urgent need to protect Cocos Island and surrounding waters from illegal large-scale fishing, poaching and other [[#Habitats threatened|threats]].

The only persons allowed to live on Cocos Island are Costa Rican Park Rangers, who have established two encampments, including one at English Bay. Tourists and ship crew members are allowed ashore only with permission of island rangers, and are not permitted to camp, stay overnight or collect any flora, fauna or minerals from the island.  Occasional [[amateur radio]] [[DXpedition]]s are allowed to visit.

This island is popular in pirate lore as well. It is said{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  that over 300 expeditions have gone in search of treasure such as the hoard of Benito Bonito, the [[Treasure of Lima]], and many others. Some incidents of small caches have been discovered,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} leading many to believe the stories of vast pirate treasures to be valid.

Treasure hunting is strictly prohibited by the Costa Rican government. Permits are not being issued.

Cocos Island is an oceanic island of both [[volcanic]] and tectonic origin. It is the only emergent island of the [[Cocos Plate]], one of the minor [[tectonic plates]]. [[Potassium-argon dating]] established the age of the oldest rocks between 1.91 and 2.44&amp;nbsp;million years (Late Pliocene)&lt;ref name="Castillo, P. 1414"&gt;Castillo, P., Batiza, R., Vanko, D., Malavassi, E., Barquero, J., and Fernandez, E. 1988. Anomalously young volcanoes on old hot-spot traces. I. Geology and petrology of Cocos Island. Geological Society of America Bulletin 100: 1400–1414.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is composed primarily of [[basalt]], which is formed by cooling lava.

The landscape is mountainous and irregular and the summit is Cerro Iglesias at {{convert|575.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Castillo, P. 1414"/&gt; In spite of its mountainous character, there are flatter areas between 200–260&amp;nbsp;m in elevation in the central part of the island, which are said to be a transitional stage of the geomorphological cycle of V-shaped valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Malavassi, E. 1982. Visita al Parque Nacional Isla del Coco. Revista Geográfica de América Central (15–16): 211–216.&lt;/ref&gt; With four bays, three of them in the north side (Wafer, Chatham and Weston), Cocos Island has a number of short rivers and streams that drain the abundant rainfall into them. Due to large, 300-foot cliffs that ring much of the island, the easiest point of entry is at Chatham Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Chatham Bay, Cocos Island|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/destinations/isla-de-coco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest rivers are the Genio and the Pittier, which drain their water into Wafer Bay. The mountainous landscape and the tropical climate combine to create over 200 waterfalls throughout the island. The island’s soils are classified as [[entisol]]s which are highly acidic and could be easily eroded by the island’s high rainfall on the steep slopes, were it not for the dense forest coverage.

==Climate==
The climate of the island is mostly determined by the latitudinal movement of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] which creates cloudiness and precipitation that is constant throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, W. 1984. Informe de campo. Gira realizada a la Isla del Coco con el objetivo de recabar información climatológica. San José, Servicio de Parques Nacionales, 6 p.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the climate in the island humid and tropical with an average annual temperature of {{convert|26.6|C|1}} and an average annual rainfall of over {{convert|7000|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is high throughout the year, although lower from January through March and slightly lower during late September and October.&lt;ref&gt;Sinergia 69. 2000. Volumen 2. Aspectos meteorológicos y climatológico del ACMIC y su área de influencia. San José, Proyecto GEF/PNUD Conocimiento y uso de la biodiversidad del ACMIC, 184 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous oceanic currents from the central [[Pacific Ocean]] that converge on the island also have an important influence.



==Ecology==
[[File:Isla del Coco-chatham beach.jpg|thumb|Chatham beach on Cocos Island]]
Cocos Island is home to dense [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forests]]. It is the only oceanic island in the eastern Pacific region with such rain forests and their characteristic types of flora and fauna. The [[cloud forest]]s at higher elevations are also unique in the eastern Pacific. The island was never linked to a continent, so the flora and fauna arrived via [[long distance dispersal]] from the [[Americas]]. The island has therefore a high proportion of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic species]].

===Flora===
The island has 235 known species of [[flowering plant]]s, of which 70, or nearly 30%, are endemic. A good comprehensive study on the flora of the island is provided in the journal ''Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;Trusty, J.L., Kesler, H.C. and Haug-Delgado, G. 2006. Vascular flora of Isla del Coco, Costa Rica. Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences (Fourth Series) 57(7): 247–355.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 74 species of [[fern]]s and [[fern allies]] ([[lycopodiophyte]]s and [[pteridophyte]]s, see&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, L.D. 1975. The Ferns and Fern-Allies of Cocos Island, Costa Rica. American Fern Journal 65 (4): 102–104.&lt;/ref&gt;), and 128 species of [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s ([[bryophyte]]s, see&lt;ref&gt;Dauphin G. 1999. Bryophytes of Cocos Island, Costa Rica: diversity, biogeography and ecology. Revista de Biología Tropical. 47:309–328&lt;/ref&gt;), 90 species of [[fungi]] and 41 species of slimemolds&lt;ref&gt;Rojas, C. and Stephenson, S.L. 2008. Myxomycete ecology along an elevation gradient on Cocos Island, Costa Rica. Fungal Diversity 29: 119–129.&lt;/ref&gt; have been reported. Nevertheless, more exhaustive investigations are expected to reveal many more species.

The island has three main plant communities. The coastal forests extend from the seacoast up to 50 meters elevation. Purple coral tree (''[[Erythrina fusca]]''), coconut palm (''[[Cocos nucifera]]''), and pond-apple (''[[Annona glabra]]'') are the predominant trees, with an understory of ferns, shrubs of the [[Rubiaceae]] and [[Solanaceae]] families, sedges and grasses, and herbaceous plants of the [[Leguminosae]] and [[Malvaceae]] families.

The inland forests extend from 50 to 500 meters elevation. "Palo de hierro" or huriki (''Sacoglottis holdridgei''), "avocado" (''[[Ocotea insularis]]'') and the endemic ''[[Cecropia pittieri]]'' are the most common canopy trees. The trees are festooned at all levels with [[epiphytic plant]]s, including [[orchid]]s, ferns, [[bromeliad]]s and mosses. The understory includes sedges such as ''Hypolitrum amplum'' and various species of ferns and [[tree fern]]s including ''[[Cyathea armata]]'' and ''[[Danaea]] media''. The endemic palm ''[[Rooseveltia frankliniana]]'' is also common.

Cloud forests are found at the highest elevations, over 500 meters. ''[[Melastoma]]'' spp. is predominant.

The general vegetation of Cocos Island has greatly changed since the island was first named and described by Europeans.  Captain Wafer, who visited the island in 1685 and whose name was given to the landing place, describes extensive coconut groves extending inland into the interior of the island.  [[Thor Heyerdahl]] posited that it was very unlikely that these groves developed naturally, and that pre-European man must once have cleared considerable areas in the ravine bottoms and interior plateaus and ridges, utilizing the clearings for coconut plantations of substantial extent. Heyerdahl theorized that these plantations were used to provide fresh liquid and food for pre-Columbian voyages ([[balsa]] [[raft]]s using ''guara'' navigation) between [[Guatemala]] and northwestern South America.  After the Spanish conquest and its consequences, these voyages ended and the tropical jungle recovered the land that had been laboriously cleared by early human hands.&lt;ref&gt;Heyerdahl, T. 1978. ''Early Man and the Ocean''. Doubleday &amp; Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===

====Land fauna====
The island has over 400 known species of insects, of which 65 (16%) are endemic. The greatest diversity is found among the [[Lepidoptera]] and [[Formicidae]]. Over 50 species of other arthropods have been described ([[spider]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[millipede]]s, and [[isopod]]s).

Two species of [[lizard]] are found on the island, an [[anole]] (''[[Anolis townsendii]]'') and a [[gecko]] (''[[Sphaerodactylus pacificus]]''); both are endemic. No [[amphibian]]s have been reported.

Nearly 90 bird species have been reported. The island and neighboring rocks are home to large nesting colonies of migratory [[seabird]]s, including the [[brown booby]] (''Sula leucogaster''), [[red-footed booby]] (''Sula sula''), [[great frigatebird]] (''Fregata minor''), [[white tern]] (''Gygis alba'') and [[brown noddy]] (''Anous stolidus''). Seven species of land birds inhabit the island, including three endemics: the [[Cocos cuckoo]] (''Coccyzus ferrugineus''), [[Cocos flycatcher]] (''Nesotriccus ridgwayi'') and [[Cocos finch]] (''Pinaroloxias inornata'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Endemic Birds of Cocos Island|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/destinations/isla-de-coco-costa-rica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island has five land [[mammal]] species:  pigs, deer, goats, cats, and rats. All these land mammals were introduced by humans. The Costa Rican government has vowed to control the populations of these animals, as they are harmful to the local ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/enero/13/aldea1372595.html|title=País en guerra contra especies invasoras de isla del Coco  - ALDEA GLOBAL - nacion.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marine fauna====
The rich coral reef, volcanic tunnels, caves, massifs and deeper waters surrounding Cocos Island are home to more than 30 species of coral, 60 species of crustaceans, 600 species of molluscs and over 300 species of fish. These include large populations of [[yellowfin tuna]] (''Thunnus albacares''), [[giant manta]]s (''Manta birostris''), [[sailfish]] (''Istiophorus platypterus'') and [[shark]]s, such as [[whitetip reef shark]] (''Triaenodon obesus'') and  [[scalloped hammerhead shark]] (''Sphyrna lewini''). &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The largest of all species of fish is also present, the [[whale shark]] (''Rhincodon typus''). In December 2017, a female [[tiger shark]] (a species that returned to the waters of Isla del Coco in 2012, after 30 years of not being seen in the area) killed New Yorker Rohina Bhandari while she was scuba diving in Manuelita in the Isla del Coco National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/american-tourist-killed-tiger-shark-costa-rica-authorities/story?id=51530072|title=American tourist killed by tiger shark in Costa Rica|first=A.

==History==

===Discovery and early cartography===
[[File:Map of Cocos from Pacific Islands, vol. 2 (Geographical Handbook Series, 1943).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cocos Island]]
The 16th-century historian [[Fernández de Oviedo|Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]] informs in his book ''Historia General y Natural de las Indias, Islas y Tierra Firme del Mar Océano'' (Seville, 1535) about the discovery of the island due to the Spanish navigator from [[Avilés]] [[Juan de Cabezas]] (also known as Juan de Grado) in 1526.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lines, ''Diario de Costa Rica'', May 12, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; D. Lievre, ''Una isla desierta en el Pacífico; la isla del Coco'' in ''Los viajes de Cockburn y Lievre por Costa Rica'' (1962: 134) tells that the first document with the name "Isle de Coques" is a map painted on [[parchment]], called that of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] that appeared in 1542 during the reign of [[Francis I of France]]. The [[planisphere]] of [[Nicolas Desliens]] (1556, Dieppe) places this ''Ysle de Coques'' about one and half degrees north of the [[Equator]]. (See also Mario A. Boza and Rolando Mendoza, ''Los parques nacionales de Costa Rica'', Madrid, 1981.) Blaeu's ''Grand Atlas'', originally published in 1662, has a colour world map on the back of its front cover which shows ''I. de Cocos'' right on the Equator. Frederik De Witt's ''Atlas, 1680'' shows it similarly. The ''[[Hondius]] Broadside map'' of 1590 shows ''I. de Cocos'' at the latitude of 2 degrees and 30 minutes northern latitude, while in 1596 [[Theodore de Bry]] shows the [[Galápagos Islands]] near [[6th parallel north|6 degrees north]] of the Equator. [[Emanuel Bowen]], ''A Complete system of Geography'', Volume II (London, 1747: 586) states that the Galápagos stretch [[5th parallel north|5 degrees north]] of the Equator.

===Administrative history===
[[File:Islote Manuelita en Isla del Coco.JPG|thumb|The islet Manuelita is a preferred site for diving and observing multiple marine species]]
The island became part of Costa Rica in 1832 by decree No. 54 of the Constitutional Assembly of the free state of Costa Rica.

[[Whaler]]s stopped at Cocos Island regularly until the mid-19th century, when inexpensive [[kerosene]] started to replace whale oil for lighting.

In October 1863 the ship ''Adelante'' dumped 426 [[Tonga]]n ex-slaves on the island when it was discovered that they were affected with [[smallpox]] and a danger to his crew. When they were saved by the ''Tumbes'', one month later, only 38 had survived, as the rest had perished from smallpox. (See: [[ʻAta ]]).

In 1897 the Costa Rican government named the German adventurer and treasure hunter [[August Gissler]] the first Governor of Cocos Island and allowed him to establish a short-lived colony there.

On May 12, 1970 the insular territory of Cocos Island was incorporated administratively into Central Canton of the Province of Puntarenas by means of Executive Decree No. 27, making it the Eleventh District of Central Canton.  The island's 33 residents, the Costa Rican park rangers, were allowed to vote for the first time in Costa Rica's February 5, 2006, election.

==Piracy and hidden treasures==
{{Disputed-section|date=July 2015}}
The first claims of treasure buried on the island came from a woman named Mary Welsh, who claimed 350 tons of gold (about $16 billion in today's money) raided from Spanish galleons had been buried on the island. She had been a member of a pirate crew led by Captain Bennett Graham, and was transported to an Australian penal colony for her crimes. She possessed a chart showing where Graham's treasure was supposed to be hidden. On her release she returned to the island with an expedition, which had no success in finding anything, with the points of reference in the chart having disappeared.&lt;ref name="Nova1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sharks/island/legends.html |title=Legends and Lore |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].org |accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pirate supposed to have buried treasure on the island was the Portuguese Benito Bonito.&lt;ref name="UM"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacInnis|first=Joe|authorlink=Joseph B. MacInnis|title=Underwater Man|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Dodd, Mead &amp; Company]]|year=1975|isbn=0-396-07142-2|oclc=1166443|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nova2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sharks/island/legends2.html |title=Legends and Lore (Part 2) |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].org |accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Bonito was hunted down and executed, his treasure was never retrieved.&lt;ref name="Nova2"/&gt;

The best known of the treasure legends tied to the island is that of the [[Treasure of Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgssamachupicchu.blogspot.com.au/2015/09/pirates-of-collection.html Pirates of the Collection: and the quest for the 'Treasure of Lima']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, with the army of [[José de San Martín]] approaching [[Lima]], Viceroy [[José de la Serna]] is supposed to have entrusted treasure from the city to British trader Captain William Thompson for safekeeping until the [[Spanish Empire|Spaniards]] could secure the country. Instead of waiting in the harbor as they were instructed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=103027136|work=The Daily News (Huntingdon, Pennsylvania)|date=29 October 1931|title=American Castaways Are Found On Tropical Island|quote=The ship had a slip-hawser on its anchor and instructions to await developments. But the captain and crew had ideas of their own.

All of the crew except Thompson and his first mate were executed for piracy. The two said they would show the Spaniards where they had hidden the treasure in return for their lives – but after landing on Cocos, they escaped into the forest.&lt;ref name="Nova2"/&gt;

Hundreds of attempts to find treasure on the island have failed.&lt;ref name="Nova2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Briton given permission to look for legendary treasure of Lima |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 July 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7910402/Briton-given-permission-to-look-for-legendary-treasure-of-Lima.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several early expeditions were mounted on the basis of claims by a man named Keating, who was supposed to have befriended Thompson.

=== Treasure of Lima: A Buried Exhibition ===
[[Treasure of Lima: A Buried Exhibition]] is an art project curated by [http://nadimsamman.com Nadim Samman] for [http://www.tba21academy.org Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary Academy] and commissioned by [[Francesca von Habsburg]]. Works by forty internationally celebrated artists were placed inside an exhibition architecture (that is, contemporary ‘treasure’ chest) designed by architects [http://arandalasch.com Aranda\Lasch] and then buried at a secret location on Cocos Island in May 2014. The [[GPS coordinates]] (or ‘map’) of the exhibition location were logged at the site of burial. These coordinates were then given to the Dutch artist [[Constant Dullaart]], who worked with a leading [[cryptographer]] to encode them. The resulting string of code was then made physical as a 3D printed steel cylinder and placed inside a second version of the chest. This chest will be auctioned to raise funds for a shark research and conservation initiative on Cocos Island. The buyer will not receive the decryption key.

Treasure of Lima: A Buried Exhibition brought artists, marine biologists, collectors, and sailors together to engage with conservation issues while exploring the history of piracy on Cocos, the politics of access and exclusion in the fields of art and natural heritage, as well as the limits of the exhibition format.

==Habitats threatened==
The mostly unperturbed habitats are, however, under growing human pressure. Illegal poaching of large marine species in and around its protected waters has become a main concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/neotropics/eco-exchange/2001/may01-2.html|title=Eco-Exchange - April-May 2001 - Modern-Day Pirates Plunder Saltwater Booty Near Costa Rica's Fabled Cocos Island]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714091826/http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/neotropics/eco-exchange/2001/may01-2.html|archivedate=14 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing local and worldwide demand for tuna, [[shark fin soup]] and other seafood is threatening the island's fragile ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061012-shark-fin.html|title=38 Million Sharks Killed for Fins Annually, Experts Estimate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[Costa Rica]] has been openly accused of passivity and even benefiting corruptly from illegal shark fin and other seafood trade to large markets, such as China and other Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0707/25/lkl.01.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com - Transcripts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has shown some willingness to protect the island's natural riches and prosecute poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2002/2002-02-04-01.asp|title=Costa Rica Court Rules for Sea Turtles, Jails Captain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, efforts to effectively patrol the waters and enforce environmental laws face big financial and bureaucratic difficulties, as well as being prone to the corruption of local, national and international authorities.

Recent events show that large-scale illegal poaching keeps happening. Despite initial hope in stopping and charging poachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/enero/30/pais1404145.html|title=Cae atunero con pesca ilegal en Isla del Coco - EL PAÍS - nacion.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|trans-title=|language=|website=Nacion.com|access-date=5 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203205044/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/enero/30/pais1404145.html|archivedate=3 February 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have been caught with abundant evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/febrero/01/pais1407267.html|title=El ‘Tiuna’ traía más de 280 toneladas de atún y explosivos - EL PAÍS - nacion.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|trans-title=|language=|website=Nacion.com|access-date=5 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529003723/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/febrero/01/pais1407267.html|archivedate=29 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have been quickly released under suspicious circumstances.&lt;ref name="nacion.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/febrero/14/pais1424902.html|title=Juez puntarenense levanta medidas cautelares a atuneros - EL PAÍS - nacion.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|trans-title=|language=|website=Nacion.com|access-date=5 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217213434/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/febrero/14/pais1424902.html|archivedate=17 February 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, efforts to raise funds for protection have been dwarfed.

==In fiction==
The book ''Desert Island''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson Crusoe Enterprises, North Vancouver, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the highly detailed theory that [[Daniel Defoe]] used the Isla del Coco as an accurate model for his descriptions of the island inhabited by the marooned [[Robinson Crusoe]]. However Defoe placed Crusoe's island not in the Pacific, but rather off the coast of Venezuela in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Talk:Cocos Island#The Robinson Crusoe connection theory|discussion page]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson's neighbouring ''[[wikt:terra firma|Terra Firma]]'' is shown on the colour map of [[Joannes Jansson]] (Amsterdam) depicting the northeastern corner of [[South America]], entitled ''Terra Firma et Novum Regnum Granatense et Popayan''. It belongs to the early group of plates printed by [[Willem Blaeu]] from 1630 onwards. The properly called Terra Firma was the Isthmus of Darien.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, 1747: 593, and [[Charles Theodore Middleton]], ''A new and Complete System of Geography'', Volume II, London, printed for J. Cooke, 1777–1778, page 448&lt;/ref&gt; Crusoe's two references to Mexico are against a South American island as well.

[[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' novel (and subsequent movies) takes place in the fictitious "Isla Nublar" of Costa Rica, which is modeled after Cocos Island. The video game ''[[Jurassic Park: Trespasser]]'', from 1998, uses a map of Cocos Island to illustrate the island.

The previous deglaciation took place between approximately 22ka until 11.5ka. This occurred when there was an annual mean atmospheric temperature on the earth that increased by roughly 5&amp;nbsp;°C, which was also accompanied by regional high-latitude warming that exceeded 10&amp;nbsp;°C. This was also followed by noteworthy deep-sea and tropical-sea warming, between about 1-2&amp;nbsp;°C (deep-sea) and 2-4&amp;nbsp;°C (tropical sea). Not only did this warming occur, but the global hydrological budget also experienced noticeable changes and regional precipitation patterns changed. As a result of all of this, the world's main ice sheets, including the ones located in Eurasia, North America and parts of the Antarctic melted. As a consequence, sea levels rose roughly 120 metres. These processes did not occur steadily, and they also did not occur at the same time.&lt;ref name=ClarkEtal&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/19/E1134.abstract|title=Global climate evolution during the last deglaciation|journal=PNAS|year=2011|doi=10.1073/pnas.1116619109|author=Clark|display-authors=etal|volume=109|pages=E1134–E1142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The process of deglaciation reflects a lack of balance between existing glacial extent and climatic conditions. As a result of net negative [[Glacier mass balance|mass balance]] over time, glaciers and ice sheets retreat. The repeated periods of increased and decreased extent of the global cryposhere (as deduced from observations of ice and rock cores, surface landforms, sub-surface geologic structures, the fossil record, and other methods of dating) reflect the cyclical nature of global and regional glaciology measured by ice ages and smaller periods known as [[Glacial period|glacials]] and [[interglacial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jiménez-Sánchez, M.|year=2013|title=A review of glacial geomorphology and chronology in northern Spain: Timing and regional variability during the last glacial cycle|volume=196|pages=50–64|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.06.009|display-authors=etal|journal=Geomorphology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley,2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bentley M.J. | year = 2009 | title = The Antarctic palaeo record and its role in improving predictions of future Antarctic Ice Sheet change | url = | journal = Journal of Quaternary Science | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 5–18 | doi = 10.1002/jqs.1287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Last glacial period]] about 12,000 years ago, ice sheets have retreated on a global scale, and Earth has been experiencing a relatively warm [[Holocene|interglacial period]] marked by only high-altitude alpine glaciers at most latitudes with larger ice sheet and sea ice at the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carlson A.E., Clark P.U. | year = 2012 | title = Ice sheet sources of sea level rise and freshwater discharge during the last deglaciation | url = | journal = Reviews of Geophysics | volume = 50 | issue = | page = 4 | doi = 10.1029/2011RG000371 | bibcode=2012RvGeo..50.4007C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], human activity has contributed to a rapid increase in the speed and scope of deglaciation globally.&lt;ref name="Hanna,2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hanna E.

===Greenland===
Research published in 2014 suggests that below [[Greenland]]'s [[Russell Glacier (Greenland)|Russell Glacier]]'s ice sheet, methanotrophs could serve as a biological methane sink for the subglacial ecosystem, and the region was at least during the sample time, a source of [[atmospheric methane]]. Based on dissolved methane in water samples, Greenland may represent a significant global methane source, and may contribute significantly more due to ongoing deglaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular and biogeochemical evidence for methane cycling beneath the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet|year=2014|author=Markus Dieser|author2=Erik L J E Broemsen|author3=Karen A Cameron|author4=Gary M King|author5=Amanda Achberger|author6=Kyla Choquette|author7=Birgit Hagedorn|author8=Ron Sletten|author9=Karen Junge|author10=Brent C Christner|last-author-amp=yes|url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v8/n11/full/ismej201459a.html|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=8|doi=10.1038/ismej.2014.59|pages=2305–2316|pmc=4992074}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2016 concluded based on past evidence, that below Greenland's and Antarctica's ice sheet may exist [[methane clathrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160107/ncomms10314/full/ncomms10314.html|title=Ice-sheet-driven methane storage and release in the Arctic|year=2016|journal=Nature Communications|author=Alexey Portnov|author2=Sunil Vadakkepuliyambatta|author3=Jürgen Mienert|author4=Alun Hubbard|last-author-amp=yes|doi=10.1038/ncomms10314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and effects==
{{See also|Sea level rise}}
At every scale, climate influences the condition of snow and ice on Earth's surface. In colder periods massive ice sheets may extend toward the [[Equator]], while in periods warmer than today, the Earth may be completely free of ice. A significant, empirically demonstrated, positive relationship exists between the surface temperature and concentration of [[Greenhouse gas]]es such as [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the [[atmosphere]]. The higher concentration, in turn, has a drastic negative impact on the global extent and stability of the cryosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lewis S.L., Maslin M.A. | year = 2015 | title = Defining the Anthropocene | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 519 | issue = | pages = 171–180 | doi = 10.1038/nature14258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sigman,2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sigman D.M., Hain M.P., Haug G.H. | year = 2010 | title = The polar ocean and glacial cycles in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = | pages = 47–55 | doi = 10.1038/nature09149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the millennial time scales of Pleistocene glacial and interglacial cycles, the pacemaker of glaciation onset and melting are changes in orbital parameters termed the [[Milankovitch cycles]]. Specifically, low summer insolation in the northern hemisphere permits growth of ice sheets, while high summer insolation causes more ablation than winter snow accumulation.

Human activities promoting [[climate change]], notably the extensive use of [[fossil fuel]]s over the last 150 years and the resulting increase in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, are the principal cause of the more rapid retreat of alpine glaciers and continental ice sheets all across the world.&lt;ref name="Hanna,2013"/&gt; For example, the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] has receded significantly, and is now contributing to a [[positive feedback]] loop that threatens further deglaciation or collapse. Newly exposed areas of the [[Southern Ocean]] contain long-sequestered stores of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which are now being emitted into the atmosphere and are continuing to impact glacial dynamics.&lt;ref name="Sigman,2010"/&gt;

The principle of [[isostasy]] applies directly to the process of deglaciation, especially [[post-glacial rebound]], which is one of main mechanisms through which isostasy is observed and studied. Post-glacial rebound refers to the increase in [[tectonic uplift]] activity immediately following glacial retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Árnadóttir T.

Periods of deglaciation are also caused in part by oceanic processes.&lt;ref name="Allen,2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allen C.S., Pike J., Pudsey C.J. | year = 2011 | title = Last glacial–interglacial sea-ice cover in the SW Atlantic and its potential role in global deglaciation | url = | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 19–20| pages = 2446–2458 | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2011.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, interruptions of the usual deep cold water circulation and penetration depths in the North Atlantic have feedbacks that promote further glacial retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alley R.B., Clark P.U. | year = 1999 | title = THE DEGLACIATION OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE: A Global Perspective | url = | journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 149–182 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deglaciation influences sea level because water previously held on land in solid form turns into liquid water and eventually drains into the ocean. The recent period of intense deglaciation has resulted in an average global sea level rise of 1.7&amp;nbsp;mm/year for the entire 20th century, and 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm/year over the past two decades, a very rapid increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meyssignac B., Cazenave A. | year = 2012 | title = Sea level: A review of present-day and recent-past changes and variability | url = | journal = Journal of Geodynamics | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 96–109 | doi = 10.1016/j.jog.2012.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical mechanisms by which deglaciation occurs include [[melting]], [[evaporation]], [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], [[ice calving|calving]], and [[aeolian processes]] such as wind scouring.

==Deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet==

Throughout the Pleistocene Epoch, the Laurentide Ice sheet covered large areas of northern North America, with over 5,000,000 square miles of coverage. The Laurentide ice sheet was 10,000 feet deep in some areas, and reached as far south as 37°N. Mapped extent of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during deglaciation has been prepared by Dyke et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deglaciation of North America|last=Dyke|first=A.S.|last2=Moore|first2=A.|last3=Robertson|first3=L.|publisher=Geological Survey of Canada, Open File 1574|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=|doi=10.4095/214399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cycles of deglaciation are driven by various factors, with the main driver being changes in incoming summer solar radiation, or insolation, in the Northern Hemisphere. But, as not all of the rises in insolation throughout time caused deglaciation, to the current ice volumes that we witness today. This leads to a different conclusion, one that suggests that there is a possible climatic threshold, in terms of ice sheets retreating, and eventually disappearing. As Laurentide was the largest mass ice sheet in the Northern Hemisphere, much study has been conducted regarding its disappearance, unloading energy balance models, atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, and surface energy balance models. These studies concluded that the Laurentide ice sheet presented a positive surface mass balance during almost the entirety of its deglaciation, which indicates that the loss of mass throughout its deglaciation was more than likely due to dynamic discharge. It was not until the early Holocene when the surface mass balance switched to become negative. This change to a negative surface mass balance suggested that surface ablation became the driver that resulted in the loss of mass of ice in the Laurentide ice sheet. It is concluded then that the Laurentide ice sheet only began to exhibit behaviours and patterns of deglaciation after radiative forcing and summer temperatures began to rise at the beginning of the Holocene.&lt;ref name=UllmanEtal &gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v8/n7/pdf/ngeo2463.pdf |title=Laurentide ice-sheet instability during the last deglaciation|journal=Nature Geoscience|year=2015|author=Ullman|display-authors=etal|volume=8|doi=10.1038/ngeo2463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Result of the deglaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet==

When the Laurentide ice sheet progressed through the process of deglaciation, it created many new landforms and had various effects of the land. First and foremost, as huge glaciers melt, there is a consequently large volume of meltwater. The volumes of meltwater created many features, including [[Proglacial lake|proglacial]] freshwater lakes, which can be sizable. Not only was there meltwater that formed lakes, there were also storms that blew over the inland freshwater. These storms created waves strong enough to erode the ice shores. Once ice cliffs were exposed, due to rising sea levels and erosion caused by waves, the ice bergs were split and shed (calved) off. Large lakes became prevalent, but so did smaller, shallower, relatively short-lived lakes. This appearance and disappearance of small, shallow lakes influenced much of the plant growth, spread and diversity that we see today. The lakes acted as barriers to plant migration, but when these lakes drained, the plants could migrate and spread very efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Ice Age|last=Pielou|first=E.C.|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0226668123|location=Chicago|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The last deglaciation==
[[File:Post-Glacial_Sea_Level.png|thumb|The Post-Glacial Sea Level]] 
The period between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] to the early [[Holocene]] (ca. 19k-11k years ago), shows changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and of the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] (AMOC), when sea-level rose by 80 meters.&lt;ref name="ClarkEtal" /&gt; Additionally, the last deglaciation is marked by three abrupt CO2 pulses,&lt;ref name=AbruptCO2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2014/oct/new-study-shows-three-abrupt-pulse-co2-during-last-deglaciation|title=New study shows three abrupt pulse of CO2 during last deglaciation|date=29 October 2014|publisher=Oregon State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and records of volcanic eruptions show that subaerial [[volcanism]] increased globally by two to six times above background levels between 12 ka and 7 ka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3659701/Huybers_FeedbackDeglaciation.pdf?sequence=1|title=Feedback between deglaciation, volcanism, and atmospheric CO2|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2009.07.014|author=Peter Huybers|author2=Charles Langmuir|bibcode=2009E&amp;PSL.286..479H|volume=286|pages=479–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between roughly 19ka, the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (or LGM) to 11ka, which was the early Holocene, the climate system experienced drastic transformation. Much of this change was occurring at an astonishing rate, as the earth was dealing with the end of the last ice age. Changes in insolation was the principal reason for this drastic global change in climate, as this was linked with several other changes globally, from the alteration of ice sheets, to the concentration of greenhouse gases fluctuating, and many other feedbacks that resulted in distinct responses, both globally and regionally. Not only were ice sheets and greenhouse gases experiencing alteration, but also additionally to this, there was sudden climate change, and many occurrences of fast, and sizeable rising of sea level. The melting of the ice sheets, along with the rising sea levels did not happen until after 11ka. Nonetheless, the globe had arrived at its present interglacial period, where climate is comparatively constant and stable, and greenhouse gas concentrations exhibit near pre-industrial levels. This data is all available due to studies and information gathered from proxy records, both from the terrestrial and ocean, which illustrates overall global patterns of changes in climate whilst in the period of Deglaciation. 
&lt;ref name="ClarkEtal" /&gt;

During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), there were apparent low atmospheric concentration of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), which was believed to be as a result of larger containment of carbon in the deep ocean, via the process of stratification within the Southern Ocean. These Southern Ocean deep waters contained the least δ13C, which consequently resulted in them being the location with the greatest density, and most salt content during the LGM. The discharge of such sequestered carbon was perhaps a direct outcome of the deep Southern Ocean overturning, driven by heightened wind-driven upwelling, and sea-ice retreat, which are directly correlated to the warming of the Antarctic, and also coinciding with the cold events, the Oldest and Younger Dryas, in the north.&lt;ref name="ClarkEtal" /&gt;

Throughout the LGM in North America, the east was populated by cold-tolerant conifer forests, while the southeast and northwest of the United States sustained open forests in locations that have closed forests today, which suggests that during the LGM temperatures were cooler and overall conditions were much drier than those that we experience today. There is also indication that the southwest of the United States was much wetter during the LGM compared to today, as there was open forest, where today we see desert and steppe. In the United States, the general variation of vegetation implies an overall fall in temperatures of (at minimum 5&amp;nbsp;°C), a shift of the westerly storm tracks to the south, and a very steep latitudinal temperature gradient.

==Landforms==
{{Main article|Glacial landform}}
Several landforms visible today are distinctive of the powerful erosional forces at play during, or immediately after, deglaciation. The distribution of such landforms helps to inform the understanding of the glacial dynamics and geologic periods of the past. Studying exposed landforms can also inform the understanding of the present and near future as glaciers all over the world retreat in the current period of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cowie N.M., Moore R.D., Hassan M.A. | year = 2013 | title = Effects of glacial retreat on proglacial streams and riparian zones in the Coast and North Cascade Mountains | url = | journal = [[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]] | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 351–365 | doi = 10.1002/esp.3453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, recently deglacialized landscapes are inherently unstable and will tend to move towards an equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ballantyne C.K. | year = 2002 | title = Paraglacial geomorphology | url = | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 21 | issue = 18–19| pages = 1935–2017 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(02)00005-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8623">'''Dissolved load''' is the portion of a [[River|stream]]'s total sediment load that is carried in [[solution]], especially [[ion]]s from [[Weathering#Chemical weathering|chemical weathering]]. It is a major contributor to the total amount of material removed from a river's [[drainage basin]], along with [[suspended load]] and [[bed load]]. The amount of material carried as dissolved load is typically much smaller than the [[suspended load]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexandrov|first=Yulia|last2=Cohen|first2=Hai|last3=Laronne|first3=Jonathan B.|last4=Reid|first4=Ian|date=2009|title=Suspended sediment load, bed load, and dissolved load yields from a semiarid drainage basin: A 15-year study|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008WR007314|journal=Water Resources Research|language=en|volume=45|issue=8|pages=|doi=10.1029/2008wr007314|issn=0043-1397|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though this is not always the case, particularly when the available river flow is mostly harnessed for purposes such as [[irrigation]] or industrial uses. Dissolved load comprises a significant portion of the total material flux out of a landscape, and its composition is important in regulating the chemistry and biology of the stream water.
[[File:Stream Load.gif|thumb|Dissolved load is one of three types of stream load, along with [[suspended load]] and [[bed load]].|alt=|600x600px]]
The dissolved load is primarily controlled by the rate of [[Weathering|chemical weathering]], which depends on [[climate]] and [[weather]] conditions such as [[moisture]] and [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grosbois|first=C.|last2=Négrel|first2=Ph.|last3=Fouillac|first3=C.|last4=Grimaud|first4=D.|date=2000|title=Dissolved load of the Loire River: chemical and isotopic characterization|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0009-2541(99)00247-8|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=170|issue=1-4|pages=179–201|doi=10.1016/s0009-2541(99)00247-8|issn=0009-2541|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissolved load has many useful applications within the field of [[geology]], including [[erosion]], [[denudation]], and reconstructing climate in the past.

== Measurement techniques ==
Dissolved load is typically measured by taking samples of water from a river and running various scientific tests on them. First, the [[pH]], [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]], and [[bicarbonate]] [[alkalinity]] of the sample are measured. Next, samples are filtered to remove any suspended [[Sediment|sediments]] and preserved with [[chloroform]] to prevent growth of [[Microorganism|microorganisms]], while the others are acidified with [[hydrochloric acid]] added to keep dissolved ions from [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitating]] out of solution. Then, various chemical tests were applied to determine the concentration of each [[solute]]. For example, the concentrations of [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] ions can be determined by [[flame photometer|flame photometry]], while the [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] ion concentrations can be determined by [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|atomic absorption spectrophotometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grove|first=T.|date=1972-08-01|title=The dissolved and solid load carried by some West African rivers: Senegal, Niger, Benue and Shari|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169472901333|journal=Journal of Hydrology|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=277–300|doi=10.1016/0022-1694(72)90133-3|issn=0022-1694|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Reconstructing climate ===
Dissolved load can provide valuable information about the rate of [[soil formation]] and other processes of chemical [[erosion]]. In particular, the mass balance between the dissolved load and solid phase is helpful in determining surface dynamics. In addition, dissolved load can be used to reconstruct the [[Paleoclimatology|climate of the Earth in the past]]. This is because chemical weathering is the major contributor to the dissolved load of a stream. The chemical weathering of [[Silicate minerals|silicate rocks]] is the primary sink for [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere, because atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted into [[Carbonate rock|carbonate rocks]] in the [[carbonate–silicate cycle]]. [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|Carbon dioxide concentrations]] are the primary control of the [[greenhouse effect]], which determines the temperature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chetelat|first=B.|last2=Liu|first2=C.-Q.|last3=Zhao|first3=Z.Q.|last4=Wang|first4=Q.L.|last5=Li|first5=S.L.|last6=Li|first6=J.|last7=Wang|first7=B.L.|date=2008|title=Geochemistry of the dissolved load of the Changjiang Basin rivers: Anthropogenic impacts and chemical weathering|url=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2008.06.013|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=72|issue=17|pages=4254–4277|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2008.06.013|issn=0016-7037|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denudation ===
[[Denudation]] is the process of wearing away the top layers of Earth's [[landscape]]. Because the rate of denudation is normally too small to directly measure, it can be indirectly determined by measuring the [[sediment load]] of the streams that drain the area in question. This is possible because any material that passes through a certain point on a stream is guaranteed to have come from somewhere in the stream's [[drainage basin]] upstream of that point. As [[Terrain|topographic relief]] increases, the dissolved load's contribution to the total stream load decreases due to the fact that on steeper surfaces, rain is less likely to [[infiltrate]] the rocks, leading to less chemical weathering, which decreases the dissolved load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judson|first=Sheldon|last2=Ritter|first2=Dale F.|date=1964-08-15|title=Rates of regional denudation in the United States|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ069i016p03395|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|language=en|volume=69|issue=16|pages=3395–3401|doi=10.1029/jz069i016p03395|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salt export===
The process of carrying [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] by water to the sea or a [[Endorheic basin|land-locked lake]] from a river basin is called salt export. When adequate salt export is not occurring, the river basin area gradually converts into [[Soil salinity control|saline soils]] and/or [[alkali soil]]s, particularly in lower reaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/IWMI_Research_Reports/PDF/pub056/Report56.pdf|title=Hydronomic Zones for Developing Basin Water Conservation Strategies|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duricrust''' is  a hard layer on or near the surface of [[soil]]. Duricrusts can range in thickness from  a few millimeters or centimeters to several meters.

It is a general term (not to be confused with [[duripan]]) for a zone of chemical [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and hardening formed at or near the surface of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] bodies through [[pedogenic]] and (or) non-pedogenic processes. It is typically formed by the accumulation of [[soluble]] [[minerals]] deposited by mineral-bearing waters that move upward, downward, or laterally by [[capillary action]], commonly assisted in arid settings by [[evaporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woolnough, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NADMSC SLTT, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Minerals often found in duricrust include [[silica]], [[iron]], [[calcium]], and [[gypsum]].

Duricrusts need to be formed in absolute accumulation, therefore they must have a source, transfer and precipitation.  Duricrust is often studied during missions to Mars  because it may help prove the planet once had more [[water]]. Duricrust was found on [[Mars]] at the [[Viking 2]] landing site, and a similar structure, nicknamed "Snow Queen," was found under the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]] landing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An electric '''battery''' is a device consisting of one or more [[electrochemical cell]]s with external connections provided to power electrical devices  such as [[flashlight]]s, [[smartphone]]s, and [[electric car]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Battery Reference Book|edition=third|last=Crompton|first=T.

[[Primary battery|Primary]] (single-use or "disposable") batteries are used once and discarded; the [[electrode]] materials are irreversibly changed during discharge. Common examples are the [[alkaline battery]] used for [[flashlight]]s and a multitude of portable electronic devices. [[Rechargeable battery|Secondary (rechargeable) batteries]] can be discharged and recharged multiple times using an applied electric current; the original composition of the electrodes can be restored by reverse current. Examples include the [[lead-acid batteries]] used in vehicles and [[lithium-ion]] batteries used for portable electronics such as [[laptop]]s and [[smartphone]]s.

Batteries come in many shapes and sizes, from miniature cells used to power [[hearing aid]]s and wristwatches to small, thin cells used in [[smartphone]]s, to large [[lead acid battery|lead acid batteries]] used in cars and trucks, and at the largest extreme, huge battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby or emergency power for [[telephone exchange]]s and computer [[data center]]s.

According to a 2005 estimate, the worldwide battery industry generates US$48 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in sales each year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfj.com/cgi-bin/artman/publish/article_141.shtml Power Shift: DFJ on the lookout for more power source investments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201015849/http://www.dfj.com/cgi-bin/artman/publish/article_141.shtml |date=1 December 2005 }}.''Draper Fisher Jurvetson''. Retrieved 20 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; with 6% annual growth.

Batteries have much lower [[specific energy]] (energy per unit mass) than common [[fuel]]s such as gasoline. In automobiles, this is somewhat offset by the higher efficiency of electric motors in converting chemical energy to mechanical work, compared to combustion engines.

The usage of "battery" to describe a group of electrical devices dates to [[Benjamin Franklin]], who in 1748 described multiple [[Leyden jar]]s by analogy to a [[artillery battery|battery of cannon]]&lt;ref&gt;Bellis, Mary. [http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blbattery.htm History of the Electric Battery]. ''About.com''.

Italian physicist [[Alessandro Volta]] built and described the first electrochemical battery, the [[voltaic pile]], in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Bellis, Mary.

''The Great Idea Finder''. Retrieved 11 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although early batteries were of great value for experimental purposes, in practice their voltages fluctuated and they could not provide a large current for a sustained period. The [[Daniell cell]], invented in 1836 by British chemist [[John Frederic Daniell]], was the first practical source of electricity, becoming an industry standard and seeing widespread adoption as a power source for [[electrical telegraph]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htm#daniell Battery History, Technology, Applications and Development].

These wet cells used liquid electrolytes, which were prone to leakage and spillage if not handled correctly. Many used glass jars to hold their components, which made them fragile and potentially dangerous. These characteristics made wet cells unsuitable for portable appliances. Near the end of the nineteenth century, the invention of [[dry cell|dry cell batteries]], which replaced the liquid electrolyte with a paste, made portable electrical devices practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/drycellbattery/index.htm |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130223055026/http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/drycellbattery/index.htm |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 23 February 2013 |title = Columbia Dry Cell Battery |publisher = American Chemical Society |work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks |accessdate = 25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of operation ==
{{Main|Electrochemical cell}}
[[File:ElectrochemCell.png|thumb|A voltaic cell for demonstration purposes. In this example the two half-cells are linked by a [[salt bridge]] that permits the transfer of ions.]]

Batteries convert [[chemical energy]] directly to [[electrical energy]]. In many cases, the electrical energy released is the difference in the cohesive &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title = Solid State Physics
 | last = Ashcroft | first = N. W. 
 | author2 = Mermin | others = N. D.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or bond energies of the metals, oxides, or molecules undergoing the electrochemical reaction.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 18"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, energy can be stored in Zn or Li, which are high-energy metals because they are not stabilized by d-electron bonding, unlike [[transition metals]]. Batteries are designed such that the energetically favorable [[redox]] reaction can occur only if electrons move through the external part of the circuit.

A battery consists of some number of [[voltaic cell]]s. Each cell consists of two [[half-cell]]s connected in series by a conductive [[electrolyte]] containing metal ''cations''. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the negative electrode, the electrode to which [[Ion#Anions and cations|anions]] (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the positive electrode, to which [[Ion#Anions and cations|cations]] (positively charged [[ion]]s) migrate. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode, while metal atoms are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode.&lt;ref&gt;Dingrando 665.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell; then a separator is used to prevent mixing of the electrolytes while allowing ions to flow between half-cells to complete the electrical circuit.

Each half-cell has an [[electromotive force]] (''emf'', measured in volts) relative to a [[Standard hydrogen electrode|standard]]. The net emf of the cell is the difference between the emfs of its half-cells.&lt;ref name="Saslow 338"&gt; Saslow 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if the electrodes have emfs &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_2&lt;/math&gt;, then the net emf is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_{2}-\mathcal{E}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, the net emf is the difference between the [[reduction potential]]s of the [[half-reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dingrando 666.&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrical driving force or &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\Delta V_{bat}}&lt;/math&gt; across the [[battery terminal|terminals]] of a cell is known as the ''terminal voltage (difference)'' and is measured in [[volt]]s.&lt;ref name="pse943"&gt;Knight 943.&lt;/ref&gt; The terminal voltage of a cell that is neither charging nor discharging is called the [[open-circuit voltage]] and equals the emf of the cell. Because of internal resistance,&lt;ref name="pse976"&gt;Knight 976.&lt;/ref&gt; the terminal voltage of a cell that is discharging is smaller in magnitude than the open-circuit voltage and the terminal voltage of a cell that is charging exceeds the open-circuit voltage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0030399.html Terminal Voltage – Tiscali Reference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411120602/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0030399.html |date=11 April 2008 }}. Originally from ''Hutchinson Encyclopaedia''. Retrieved 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal cell has negligible internal resistance, so it would maintain a constant terminal voltage of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; until exhausted, then dropping to zero. If such a cell maintained 1.5 volts and produce a charge of one [[coulomb]] then on complete discharge it would have performed 1.5 [[joule]]s of work.&lt;ref name="pse943" /&gt; In actual cells, the internal resistance increases under discharge&lt;ref name="pse976" /&gt; and the open-circuit voltage also decreases under discharge. If the voltage and resistance are plotted against time, the resulting graphs typically are a curve; the shape of the curve varies according to the chemistry and internal arrangement employed.

The [[voltage]] developed across a cell's terminals depends on the energy release of the chemical reactions of its electrodes and electrolyte. [[Alkaline battery|Alkaline]] and [[Zinc–carbon battery|zinc–carbon]] cells have different chemistries, but approximately the same emf of 1.5 volts; likewise [[Nickel–cadmium battery|NiCd]] and [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|NiMH]] cells have different chemistries, but approximately the same emf of 1.2 volts.&lt;ref&gt;Dingrando 674.&lt;/ref&gt; The high electrochemical potential changes in the reactions of [[lithium]] compounds give lithium cells emfs of 3 volts or more.&lt;ref&gt;Dingrando 677. &lt;/ref&gt;

Batteries are classified into primary and secondary forms:

* ''Primary'' batteries are designed to be used until exhausted of energy then discarded.  Their chemical reactions are generally not reversible, so they cannot be recharged. When the supply of reactants in the battery is exhausted, the battery stops producing current and is useless.&lt;ref&gt;Dingrando 675.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Secondary'' batteries can be recharged; that is, they can have their chemical reactions reversed by applying [[electric current]] to the cell.  This regenerates the original chemical reactants, so they can be used, recharged, and used again multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;Fink, Ch. 11, Sec. "Batteries and Fuel Cells."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of primary batteries used, for example, for [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] circuits, were restored to operation by replacing the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franklin Leonard Pope]], ''Modern Practice of the Electric Telegraph 15th Edition'', D. Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1899, pages 7–11. Available on the [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary batteries are not indefinitely rechargeable due to dissipation of the active materials, loss of electrolyte and internal corrosion.

=== Primary ===
{{Main|Primary cell}}

Primary batteries, or [[primary cell]]s, can produce current immediately on assembly. These are most commonly used in portable devices that have low current drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells.&lt;ref name="durcar"&gt;[http://www.duracell.com/care_disposal/care.asp Duracell: Battery Care]. Retrieved 10 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these have higher [[energy densities]] than rechargeable batteries,&lt;ref name="enralk"&gt;[http://data.energizer.com/PDFs/alkaline_appman.pdf Alkaline Manganese Dioxide Handbook and Application Manual] (PDF). ''Energizer''. Retrieved 25 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with [[electrical load|loads]] under 75 [[ohm]]s (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include [[zinc–carbon batteries]] and [[alkaline batteries]].

=== Secondary  ===
{{Main|Rechargeable battery}}

Secondary batteries, also known as ''secondary cells'', or ''rechargeable batteries'', must be charged before first use; they are usually assembled with active materials in the discharged state. Rechargeable batteries are (re)charged by applying electric current, which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during discharge/use. Devices to supply the appropriate current are called chargers.

The oldest form of rechargeable battery is the [[lead–acid battery]], which are widely used in [[automotive]] and [[boating]] applications. This technology contains liquid electrolyte in an unsealed container, requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the [[hydrogen]] gas it produces during overcharging. The lead–acid battery is relatively heavy for the amount of electrical energy it can supply. Its low manufacturing cost and its high surge current levels make it common where its capacity (over approximately 10 Ah) is more important than weight and handling issues. A common application is the modern [[car battery]], which can, in general, deliver a peak current of 450 [[ampere]]s.

The sealed [[valve regulated lead–acid battery]] (VRLA battery) is popular in the automotive industry as a replacement for the lead–acid wet cell. The VRLA battery uses an immobilized [[sulfuric acid]] electrolyte, reducing the chance of leakage and extending [[shelf life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdtechno.com/custserv/pdf/7327.pdf Dynasty VRLA Batteries and Their Application] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206105937/http://www.cdtechno.com/custserv/pdf/7327.pdf |date=6 February 2009 }}. ''C&amp;D Technologies, Inc.'' Retrieved 26 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; VRLA batteries immobilize the electrolyte. The two types are:

* ''[[Gel batteries]]'' (or "gel cell") use a semi-solid electrolyte.
* ''[[Absorbed Glass Mat]]'' (AGM) batteries absorb the electrolyte in a special fiberglass matting.

Other portable rechargeable batteries include several sealed "dry cell" types, that are useful in applications such as mobile phones and [[Laptop|laptop computers]]. Cells of this type (in order of increasing [[power density]] and cost) include [[Nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] (NiCd), [[Nickel–zinc battery|nickel–zinc]] (NiZn), [[Nickel metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride]] (NiMH), and [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] (Li-ion) cells. Li-ion has by far the highest share of the dry cell rechargeable market. NiMH has replaced NiCd in most applications due to its higher capacity, but NiCd remains in use in [[power tool]]s, [[two-way radio]]s, and [[medical equipment]].

In the 2000s, developments include batteries with embedded electronics such as [[USBCELL]], which allows charging an AA battery through a [[USB]] connector,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbcell.com/ USBCELL – Revolutionary rechargeable USB battery that can charge from any USB port]. Retrieved 6 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[nanoball batteries]] that allow for a discharge rate about 100x greater than current batteries,  and [[smart battery]] packs with state-of-charge monitors and battery protection circuits that prevent damage on over-discharge. [[Low self-discharge NiMH battery|Low self-discharge]] (LSD) allows secondary cells to be charged prior to shipping.

=== Cell types ===
Many types of electrochemical cells have been produced, with varying chemical processes and designs, including [[galvanic cell]]s, [[electrolytic cell]]s, [[fuel cell]]s, [[flow battery|flow cells]] and voltaic piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pspb.org/e21/media/Compare_pvfc_v108_TN.pdf |title=Spotlight on Photovoltaics &amp; Fuel Cells: A Web-based Study &amp; Comparison |accessdate=14 March 2007 |format=PDF |pages=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wet cell ====
A ''wet cell'' battery has a liquid [[electrolyte]]. Other names are ''flooded cell'', since the liquid covers all internal parts, or ''vented cell'', since gases produced during operation can escape to the air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for [[electrochemistry]]. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as [[beaker (glassware)|beakers]], for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a [[concentration cell]] is important in understanding [[corrosion]]. Wet cells may be [[primary cell]]s (non-rechargeable) or [[secondary cell]]s (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the [[Daniell cell]] were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the [[Leclanche cell]], [[Grove cell]], [[Bunsen cell]], [[Chromic acid cell]], [[Clark cell]], and [[Weston cell]]. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in [[car battery|automobile batteries]] and in industry for standby power for [[switchgear]], telecommunication or large [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], but in many places batteries with [[gel cell]]s have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or [[Nickel–cadmium battery (vented cell type)|nickel–cadmium]] cells.

==== Dry cell ====
{{Further|Dry cell}}
[[File:Dry cell (PSF).png|thumb|upright|Line art drawing of a dry cell: &lt;br /&gt; 1. brass cap, 2. plastic seal, 3. expansion space, 4. porous cardboard, 5. zinc can, 6. carbon rod, 7. chemical mixture]]

A ''dry cell'' uses a paste electrolyte, with only enough moisture to allow current to flow. Unlike a wet cell, a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage. Lead–acid batteries did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until the development of the [[gel battery]].

A common dry cell is the [[zinc–carbon battery]], sometimes called the dry [[Leclanché cell]], with a nominal voltage of 1.5 [[volt]]s, the same as the [[alkaline battery]] (since both use the same [[zinc]]–[[manganese dioxide]] combination). A standard dry cell comprises a [[zinc]] anode, usually in the form of a cylindrical pot, with a [[carbon]] cathode in the form of a central rod. The electrolyte is [[ammonium chloride]] in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide, the latter acting as a [[depolariser]]. In some designs, the ammonium chloride is replaced by [[zinc chloride]].

==== Molten salt ====
[[Molten salt battery|Molten salt batteries]] are primary or secondary batteries that use a molten salt as electrolyte. They operate at high temperatures and must be well insulated to retain heat.

==== Reserve ====
A [[reserve battery]] can be stored unassembled (unactivated and supplying no power) for a long period (perhaps years).  When the battery is needed, then it is assembled (e.g., by adding electrolyte); once assembled, the battery is charged and ready to work.  For example, a battery for an electronic artillery [[fuze]] might be activated by the impact of firing a gun. The acceleration breaks a capsule of electrolyte that activates the battery and powers the fuze's circuits. Reserve batteries are usually designed for a short service life (seconds or minutes) after long storage (years). A [[water-activated battery]] for oceanographic instruments or military applications becomes activated on immersion in water.

=== Cell performance ===
A battery's characteristics may vary over load cycle, over [[charge cycle]], and over lifetime due to many factors including internal chemistry, [[Electric current|current]] drain, and temperature. At low temperatures, a battery cannot deliver as much power. As such, in cold climates, some car owners install battery warmers, which are small electric heating pads that keep the car battery warm.

== Capacity and discharge ==
[[File:Battery checker.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A device to check battery voltage]]

A battery's ''capacity'' is the amount of [[electric charge]] it can deliver at the rated voltage. The more electrode material contained in the cell the greater its capacity. A small cell has less capacity than a larger cell with the same chemistry, although they develop the same open-circuit voltage.&lt;ref name=aappc /&gt; Capacity is measured in units such as [[amp-hour]] (A·h). The rated capacity of a battery is usually expressed as the product of 20 hours multiplied by the current that a new battery can consistently supply for 20 hours at {{convert|68|F|C}}, while remaining above a specified terminal voltage per cell. For example, a battery rated at 100 A·h can deliver 5 A over a 20-hour period at [[room temperature]]. The fraction of the stored charge that a battery can deliver depends on multiple factors, including battery chemistry, the rate at which the charge is delivered (current), the required terminal voltage, the storage period, ambient temperature and other factors.&lt;ref name="aappc"&gt;[http://www.aaportablepower.com/BatteryKnowledge/BatteryKnowledge.asp Battery Knowledge&amp;nbsp;– AA Portable Power Corp. Retrieved 16 April 2007.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523105752/http://www.aaportablepower.com/BatteryKnowledge/BatteryKnowledge.asp |date=23 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher the discharge rate, the lower the capacity.&lt;ref name="techlib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techlib.com/reference/batteries.html|title=Battery Capacity|work=techlib.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between current, discharge time and capacity for a lead acid battery is approximated (over a typical range of current values) by [[Peukert's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac {Q_P} {I^k}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;Q_P&lt;/math&gt; is the capacity when discharged at a rate of 1 amp.
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the current drawn from battery ([[Amperes|A]]).
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of time (in hours) that a battery can sustain.
:&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant around 1.3.

Batteries that are stored for a long period or that are discharged at a small fraction of the capacity lose capacity due to the presence of generally irreversible ''side reactions'' that consume charge carriers without producing current. This phenomenon is known as internal self-discharge. Further, when batteries are recharged, additional side reactions can occur, reducing capacity for subsequent discharges. After enough recharges, in essence all capacity is lost and the battery stops producing power.

Internal energy losses and limitations on the rate that ions pass through the electrolyte cause battery [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] to vary. Above a minimum threshold, discharging at a low rate delivers more of the battery's capacity than at a higher rate. Installing batteries with varying A·h ratings does not affect device operation (although it may affect the operation interval) rated for a specific voltage unless load limits are exceeded. High-drain loads such as [[digital camera]]s can reduce total capacity, as happens with alkaline batteries. For example, a battery rated at 2&amp;nbsp;A·h for a 10- or 20-hour discharge would not sustain a current of 1&amp;nbsp;A for a full two hours as its stated capacity implies.

=== C rate ===
{{seealso|Battery charger#C-rates}}
The C-rate is a measure of the rate at which a battery is being charged or discharged. It is defined as the current through the battery divided by the theoretical current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_battery_specifications.pdf A Guide to Understanding Battery Specifications], MIT Electric Vehicle Team, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A 1C discharge rate would deliver the battery's rated capacity in 1 hour.  A 2C discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C discharge rate on a 1.6 Ah battery means a discharge current of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer [[uninterruptible power supply]], may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.

The C-rate presents a dimensional error: C is in ampere-hours and not amperes, and one can not express a current in ampere-hours.  For this reason the concept I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; was introduced by the international standard IEC61434&lt;ref&gt;IEC61434:1996&lt;/ref&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; being equal to the capacity C divided by one hour, hence allowing a mathematically correct method of current designation. The figures used for expressing the discharge rate remain the same: one can speak of "2 I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; rate" instead of the dimensionally incorrect "2 C rate".

== {{Anchor|LIFETIME|Battery_lifetime}}Lifetime ==
Battery life (and its synonym battery lifetime) has two meanings for rechargeable batteries but only one for non-chargeables. For rechargeables, it can mean either the length of time a device can run on a fully charged battery or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) Available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the [[Zamboni pile]], invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.

=== Self-discharge ===
Disposable batteries typically lose 8 to 20 percent of their original charge per year when stored at room temperature (20–30&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Batteries/self-compare.htm Self discharge of batteries – Corrosion Doctors]. Retrieved 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the "self-discharge" rate, and is due to non-current-producing "side" chemical reactions that occur within the cell even when no load is applied. The rate of side reactions is reduced for batteries stored at lower temperatures, although some can be damaged by freezing.

Old rechargeable batteries self-discharge more rapidly than disposable alkaline batteries, especially nickel-based batteries; a freshly charged nickel cadmium (NiCd) battery loses 10% of its charge in the first 24 hours, and thereafter discharges at a rate of about 10% a month. However, newer [[Low self-discharge NiMH battery|low self-discharge nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries]] and modern lithium designs display a lower self-discharge rate (but still higher than for primary batteries).

=== Corrosion ===
Internal parts may corrode and fail, or the active materials may be slowly converted to inactive forms.

=== Physical component changes ===
The active material on the battery plates changes chemical composition on each charge and discharge cycle; active material may be lost due to physical changes of volume, further limiting the number of times the battery can be recharged. Most nickel-based batteries are partially discharged when purchased, and must be charged before first use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energizer.com/products/hightech-batteries/rechargeables/faq/Pages/faq.aspx Energizer Rechargeable Batteries and Chargers: Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209174717/http://energizer.com/products/hightech-batteries/rechargeables/faq/Pages/faq.aspx |date=9 February 2009 }}.

Some deterioration occurs on each charge–discharge cycle. Degradation usually occurs because electrolyte migrates away from the electrodes or because active material detaches from the electrodes. Low-capacity NiMH batteries (1,700–2,000&amp;nbsp;mA·h) can be charged some 1,000 times, whereas high-capacity NiMH batteries (above 2,500&amp;nbsp;mA·h) last about 500 cycles.&lt;ref name="tomdistr"&gt;[http://www.nimhbattery.com/batteries-rechargeable-tips-win.htm Rechargeable battery Tips – NIMH Technology Information].

=== Charge/discharge speed ===
Fast charging increases component changes, shortening battery lifespan.&lt;ref name=tomdistr /&gt;

=== Overcharging ===
If a charger cannot detect when the battery is fully charged then overcharging is likely, damaging it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbatteries.com/batterymyths.html#Quick battery myths vs battery facts – free information to help you learn the difference]. Retrieved 10 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these stresses and [[Lead–acid battery#Sulfation|sulfation]] of their lead plates, few automotive batteries last beyond six years of regular use.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Vincent (1994).

=== Storage ===
Battery life can be extended by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a [[refrigerator]] or [[freezer]], which slows the side reactions. Such storage can extend the life of alkaline batteries by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20011219.html Ask Yahoo: Does putting batteries in the freezer make them last longer?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427025118/http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20011219.html |date=27 April 2006 }}.

== Hazards ==

=== {{anchor|Explosion}}Explosion ===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
{{See also|Safety of electronic cigarettes#Fires, explosions, and other battery-related malfunctions}}
A battery explosion is generally caused by misuse or malfunction, such as attempting to recharge a primary (non-rechargeable) battery, or a [[short circuit]].

When a battery is recharged at an excessive rate, an explosive gas mixture of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] may be produced faster than it can escape from within the battery (e.g. through a built-in vent), leading to pressure build-up and eventual bursting of the battery case. In extreme cases, battery chemicals may spray violently from the casing and cause injury. Overcharging - that is, attempting to charge a battery beyond its electrical capacity - can also lead to a battery explosion, in addition to leakage or irreversible damage. It may also cause damage to the charger or device in which the overcharged battery is later used.

Car batteries are most likely to explode when a short-circuit generates very large currents. Such batteries produce [[hydrogen]], which is very explosive, when they are overcharged (because of [[electrolysis]] of the water in the electrolyte). During normal use, the amount of overcharging is usually very small and generates little hydrogen, which dissipates quickly. However, when "jump starting" a car, the high current can cause the rapid release of large volumes of hydrogen, which can be ignited explosively by a nearby spark, e.g. when disconnecting a [[jumper cable]].

Disposing of a battery via incineration may cause an explosion as steam builds up within the sealed case.

Recalls of devices using Lithium-ion batteries have become more common in recent years.

=== Leakage ===
[[File:LeakedBattery 2701a.jpg|thumb|right|Leak-damaged alkaline battery]]

Many battery chemicals are corrosive, poisonous or both. If leakage occurs, either spontaneously or through accident, the chemicals released may be dangerous. For example, disposable batteries often use a zinc "can" both as a reactant and as the container to hold the other reagents. If this kind of battery is over-discharged, the reagents can emerge through the cardboard and plastic that form the remainder of the container. The active chemical leakage can then damage or disable the equipment that the batteries power. For this reason, many electronic device manufacturers recommend removing the batteries from devices that will not be used for extended periods of time.

=== Toxic materials ===
Many types of batteries employ toxic materials such as lead, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[cadmium]] as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epr/products/batteries.htm Batteries – Product Stewardship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929214808/http://www.epa.gov/epr/products/batteries.htm |date=29 September 2006 }}. ''EPA''. Retrieved 11 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Batteries are one form of [[electronic waste]] (e-waste). E-waste [[recycling]] services recover toxic substances, which can then be used for new batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth911.org/recycling/battery-recycling Battery Recycling » Earth 911]. Retrieved 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the United States, about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country.&lt;ref&gt;"San Francisco Supervisor Takes Aim at Toxic Battery Waste". ''Environmental News Network'' (11 July 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act]] of 1996 banned the sale of mercury-containing batteries, enacted uniform labeling requirements for rechargeable batteries and required that rechargeable batteries be easily removable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/laws-regs/state/policy/p1104.pdf Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206225601/http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/laws-regs/state/policy/p1104.pdf |date=6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; California and New York City prohibit the disposal of rechargeable batteries in solid waste, and along with Maine require recycling of cell phones.&lt;ref name="rbrc"&gt;[http://www.rbrc.org/consumer/howitallworks_faq.shtml?PHPSESSID=ad1e142bcdd99cd67418f2171794d892]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rechargeable battery industry operates nationwide recycling programs in the United States and Canada, with dropoff points at local retailers.&lt;ref name="rbrc" /&gt;

The [[Battery Directive]] of the European Union has similar requirements, in addition to requiring increased recycling of batteries and promoting research on improved [[battery recycling]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/waste_management/l21202_en.htm Disposal of spent batteries and accumulators]. ''European Union''. Retrieved 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with this directive all batteries to be sold within the EU must be marked with the "collection symbol" (a crossed-out wheeled bin). This must cover at least 3% of the surface of prismatic batteries and 1.5% of the surface of cylindrical batteries. All packaging must be marked likewise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epbaeurope.net/documents/Newmarkingguidelines_final8March2011.pdf Guidelines on Portable Batteries Marking Requirements in the European Union 2008 – EPBA-EU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007014932/http://www.epbaeurope.net/documents/Newmarkingguidelines_final8March2011.pdf |date=7 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ingestion ===
Batteries may be harmful or fatal if [[swallowing|swallowed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.energizer.com/PDFs/carbonzinc_psds.pdf Product Safety DataSheet – Energizer] (p. 2). Retrieved 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Small [[button cell]]s can be swallowed, in particular by young children. While in the digestive tract, the battery's electrical discharge may lead to tissue damage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poison.org/battery/ |title=Swallowed a Button Battery? &amp;#124; Battery in the Nose or Ear? |publisher=Poison.org |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816183602/http://www.poison.org/battery/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such damage is occasionally serious and can lead to death. Ingested disk batteries do not usually cause problems unless they become lodged in the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. The most common place for disk batteries to become lodged is the esophagus, resulting in clinical sequelae. Batteries that successfully traverse the esophagus are unlikely to lodge elsewhere. The likelihood that a disk battery will lodge in the esophagus is a function of the patient's age and battery size. Disk batteries of 16&amp;nbsp;mm have become lodged in the esophagi of 2 children younger than 1 year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} &lt;!-- or is this in Langkau et al below? --&gt; Older children do not have problems with batteries smaller than 21–23&amp;nbsp;mm. Liquefaction necrosis may occur because sodium hydroxide is generated by the current produced by the battery (usually at the anode). Perforation has occurred as rapidly as 6 hours after ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/774838-overview|title=Disk Battery Ingestion: Background, Pathophysiology, Epidemiology|publisher=|via=eMedicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solid state batteries ==
On 28 February 2017, The [[University of Texas]] at Austin issued a press release about a new type of [[solid-state battery]], developed by a team led by Lithium-ion (Li-Ion) inventor [[John Goodenough]], "that could lead to safer, faster-charging, longer-lasting rechargeable batteries for handheld mobile devices, electric cars and stationary energy storage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.utexas.edu/2017/02/28/goodenough-introduces-new-battery-technology |title=Lithium-Ion Battery Inventor Introduces New Technology for Fast-Charging, Noncombustible Batteries |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=28 February 2017 |website=University of Texas at Austin  |publisher=University of Texas |access-date=15 March 2017 |quote=...first all-solid-state battery cells that could lead to safer, faster-charging, longer-lasting rechargeable batteries for handheld mobile devices, electric cars and stationary energy storage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
More specifics about the new technology were published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal [[Energy &amp; Environmental Science]].

Independent reviews of the technology discuss the risk of fire and explosion from Lithium-ion batteries under certain conditions because they use liquid electrolytes. The newly developed battery should be safer since it uses glass electrolytes, that should eliminate short circuits. The solid-state battery is also said to have "three times the energy density" increasing its useful life in electric vehicles, for example. It should also be more ecologically sound since the technology uses less expensive, earth-friendly materials such as sodium extracted from seawater. They also have much longer life; ("the cells have demonstrated more than 1,200 cycles with low cell resistance"). The research and prototypes are not expected to lead to a commercially viable product in the near future, if ever, according to Chris Robinson of LUX Research. "This will have no tangible effect on electric vehicle adoption in the next 15 years, if it does at all. A key hurdle that many solid-state electrolytes face is lack of a scalable and cost-effective manufacturing process," he told The American Energy News in an e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;

== Homemade cells ==
Almost any liquid or moist object that has enough ions to be electrically conductive can serve as the electrolyte for a cell. As a novelty or science demonstration, it is possible to insert two electrodes made of different metals into a [[lemon battery|lemon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ushistory.org/franklin/fun/lemon.htm ushistory.org: The Lemon Battery]. Accessed 10 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; potato,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pbskids.org/zoom/activities/phenom/potatobattery.html ZOOM activities: phenom Potato Battery]. Accessed 10 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; etc. and generate small amounts of electricity. "Two-potato clocks" are also widely available in hobby and toy stores; they consist of a pair of cells, each consisting of a potato (lemon, et cetera) with two electrodes inserted into it, wired in series to form a battery with enough voltage to power a digital clock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencekit.com/category.asp_Q_c_E_756000&amp;cr=1220 Two-Potato Clock – Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed 10 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Homemade cells of this kind are of no practical use.

A voltaic pile can be made from two coins (such as a nickel and a [[penny]]) and a piece of [[paper towel]] dipped in [[saline water|salt water]]. Such a pile generates a very low voltage but, when many are stacked in [[series circuit|series]], they can replace normal batteries for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/battery1.htm Howstuffworks "Battery Experiments: Voltaic Pile"]. Accessed 10 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sony]] has developed a [[biological battery]] that generates electricity from sugar in a way that is similar to the processes observed in living organisms. The battery generates electricity through the use of enzymes that break down carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201802311 Sony Develops A Bio Battery Powered By Sugar]. Accessed 24 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead acid cells can easily be manufactured at home, but a tedious charge/discharge cycle is needed to 'form' the plates. This is a process in which lead sulfate forms on the plates, and during charge is converted to lead dioxide (positive plate) and pure lead (negative plate). Repeating this process results in a microscopically rough surface, increasing the surface area, increasing the current the cell can deliver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windpower.org.za/batteries/batteries.html |title=Home made lead acid batteries |publisher=Windpower.org.za |date=16 September 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniell cell]]s are easy to make at home. [[Aluminium–air batteries]] can be produced with high-purity aluminium. [[Aluminium foil]] batteries will produce some electricity, but are not efficient, in part because a significant amount of (combustible) [[hydrogen]] gas is produced.

The '''Energy Exchange Austria (EXAA)''' is a Central European energy exchange headquartered in Vienna. Currently, the EXAA Market encompasses trading areas in the entire of Austria and Germany.

==History==
EXAA was founded 2001 and started day-ahead spot market trading of electric energy on March 21, 2002. Since then, EXAA has developed into a major platform for efficient trading that makes use of the possibilities offered by a liberalized energy market in Central Europe. In June 2005, trading started in European CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions allowances (EUAs) in the market segment for environmental products, which resulted in 2011 into a joint effort with the Greenmarket environmental exchange.

==Role of Power Exchanges==
[[File:Palais Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Offices of EXAA and CISMO in Palais Liechtenstein, Vienna.]]
Energy exchanges have become an established part of the liberalized energy markets in Europe. They serve as an important supplement to short-term OTC trading and also function as an independent price indicator for electric energy on the wholesale market.

While the energy markets in Central Europe often involve a single electricity producer, or multiple electricity producers that auction their energy in tranches, or via long-term bilateral supply contracts,
an energy exchange contributes to increasing price efficiency and allows electric utilities to react flexibly when facing a changing demand/supply structure. Ultimately, an energy exchange can reduce dramatically the price risk related to short-term spikes in load profiles.

EXAA was founded as a public limited company and the shareholders are [[Wiener Börse]] AG (25.1%) and the APCS AG (34.5%), as well as a number of different companies from the Austrian energy sector holding smaller shares (April 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exaa.at/en/about_exaa/shareholder-structure|title=Shareholders of EXAA Energy Exchange Austria |date= |work= |publisher=EXAA |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2005 '''EXAA''' forms part of the '''CISMOgroup''', a group comprising a number of different service providers for the energy sector.

The CISMOgroup covers a broad range of specialized services for the electricity markets, such as clearing and settlement of the electricity market, capacity allocation and auctioning, international consulting for projects related to electricity markets,
as well as the regulation and management of feed-in tariffs for green energy in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cismo.com/en/cismo/cismo/tasks |title=CISMO Tasks |date= |work= |publisher=EXAA |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Members===
As of the April, 2013, more than 70 companies from 14 different countries were trading at the EXAA electricity spot market.

===The electricity market – EXAA spot&lt;ref name="EXAA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exaa.at/en/spotmarket-energy/marketplace |title=Marketplace|publisher=EXAA |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
[[File:BlockproductsEXAAspot.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[http://www.exaa.at/en/spotmarket-energy/marketplace/products Block products] traded on the EXAA Spot.]] EXAA operates a day-ahead electricity spot market, with a single daily auction point at 10:15&amp;nbsp;AM. Traders place closed buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders for electric energy, to be physically delivered the following day, until 10:12&amp;nbsp;AM when the orderbook closes. Traders can place bids and asks for electric power in individual hours, as well as in standardized blocks (comprising several hours).&lt;ref name="EXAA Concept"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exaa.at/en/spotmarket-energy/marketplace/trading-concept |title=Trading concept |date= |work= |publisher=EXAA |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matching algorithm then evaluates the orders and sets a market clearing price (MCP) for each hour and product to maximize the traded volume. At 10:15&amp;nbsp;AM all exchange members are notified of their allocations. Orders are evaluated according to specific rules of precedence, where market orders are always fulfilled before block orders and lastly single hour orders. The surplus (non-matched) grey power volume is then offered for sale again at the MCP during a short 3 minute period from 10:16 to 10:19&amp;nbsp;AM called the '''post-trading'''.&lt;ref name="EXAA Concept" /&gt;

In post-trading, the prices for all hours are already known (the MCP being determined during the auction before) and the surplus volumes are sold and bought on a first-come, first-served basis, offering the traders a last-minute opportunity to sell or buy volumes at a known price.

Trading at EXAA takes place 5 days a week, from Monday to Friday, with the volumes for Saturday, Sunday and Monday being traded together on the Friday before. This set-up has its advantages as well as its disadvantages. It is often not possible for utilities to correctly predict their required electricity volumes two days ahead in order to cover their requirements on Friday. Additionally, some trading companies whose main objective is arbitrage (trading for profit without physical procurement or delivery), may miss out on potential trading opportunities that arise over the weekend. On the other hand, a 5-day trading week reflects the reality of smaller utilities that usually cannot or do not want to staff their trading department seven days a week. Another important factor is that even at the big trading floors, the head traders capable of leveraging sudden market developments are usually not present seven days a week. The trading itself is conducted by means of the EXAA online trading system, accessible from any standard internet browser supporting SSL encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exaa.at/en/spotmarket-energy/marketplace/technical-requirements |title=Technical requirements |date= |work= |publisher=EXAA |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The security of the system is guaranteed by means of RSA key fobs and the EXAA market operations team that continuously monitors every auction.

===Price Volatility===
[[File:Vola2011.png|thumb|400px|right|Comparison of market price volatility on electricity spot markets. (EXAA,EPEX DE,EPEX FR,APX)]]
Price volatility on the electricity markets is an important factor in the decision-making process of all involved stakeholders. In general, increased price volatility increases also the risk involved in trading for all parties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Volatility (finance)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Price volatility on the electricity market is influenced mainly by unexpected changes in the supply-demand structure on the markets, which are mainly caused by unpredictable weather patterns (especially due to wind), as well as by unplanned power plant outages.

On the supply side (distribution), the electric utilities are bound to adapt to consumer load profiles, in order to keep the electricity grid balanced. These load-profiles are statistically planned in advance and usually covered by long-term supply contracts, or own production of electric energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Load profile]]&lt;/ref&gt; Often however, irregularities in the long-term prognosis occur and the utilities are obliged to procure, or sell the outstanding quantities of electric energy on the market. The irregularities on the demand side are usually determined by the varying consumption of electric power by households and the industry, which depend again mostly on the changing weather conditions.
In the recent years, the European markets have witnessed a steady rise of price volatility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was caused among other factors, by the augmented use of renewable energy sources - which can be explained by the fact that a larger portion of the overall electricity production in Europe depends nowadays on weather, especially wind power plants.

====Sources of volatility on the European electricity market====
All electricity producing installations have to adhere to their declared schedule (a production plan specifying the volume of their electricity production for every hour of the day). It is the responsibility of the electric utilities that own the power plants to match their production and the consumption. The electricity consumption is calculated from historic data ([[load profile]] of the electric consumption in the given area and serves as the lead indicator for the future volumes that will be required to cover the demand. The Electric utility faces a number of options how to procure the necessary volumes of electric energy. If the company owns its own power plants, which is usually the case, it produces a part of the electricity itself. Depending on the production capacity of the company, a major part of the outstanding volume is acquired, or sold via long-term bilateral contracts. The rest can be obtained via the OTC market and the short-term demand is covered via day-ahead, or even intra-day trading. The relative rigidity of the production, which cannot be flexibly adjusted and the relative uncertainty about the actual consumption, which depends on a number of factors such as weather, industrial production levels etc., are bound to create unpredicted spikes in electricity prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apg.at/en/market/grid-losses/procurement-concept |title=Procurement Basis of a Common Concept to Cover Grid Losses |date= |work= |publisher=APG |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one major factor that had a dramatic influence on the electricity spot prices in the recent years, which is the wind. The portion of the wind energy in the overall electricity production increased significantly in the last couple of years in many European countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/58dfb090-4fef-11e1-8c9a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2CQBLB4Zh |title=Europe sees surge in clean power |author=Pilita Clark |date= |work= |publisher=Financial Times |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to heavily subsidized governmental programs favoring investments into renewable energy sources. In some countries such as Germany, the wind power installations are required by law to make full use of the prevailing weather conditions and always produce the maximum possible amount of electric energy.
Firstly it has to be stated that the wind is a completely flexible energy source per se, since the head of the wind turbine can be rotated, thereby stopping to turn and to produce electric energy. However, this flexibility is taken away by the prevailing environmental and energy laws in order to maximize the share of renewable energy in the production portfolio to the fullest extent possible.&lt;ref&gt;Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) 2012, Germany, http://www.bmu.de/files/english/pdf/application/pdf/eeg_2012_en_bf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, wind is a highly unpredictable factor and the schedules for wind installations are often far off, despite major efforts to statistically predict the short-term wind conditions.
The two above mentioned factors combined introduce a new source of volatility into an already volatile system that gives rise to electricity prices.

While the measures aiming at increasing the electricity production of renewable energy sources can be considered highly effective and successful, they lead to price distortions and exerted increased pressure on the markets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on the electricity grid.

===Clearing and Settlement===
[[File:Clearing and Settlement EXAA Spot.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Clearing and Settlement at the EXAA]] In order to start trading at the EXAA, companies can become either a direct clearing member, or employ the services of a broker and become a non-clearing member. Before being accepted as a direct clearing member, companies have to complete the membership procedure and provide a security deposit to back their future transactions. Companies that don’t necessarily require a full membership can nevertheless participate in electricity trading via a broker.

The broker (agent clearing member) provides the necessary collaterals and acquires/sells the required electricity volumes for its clients, in return for a small brokerage fee. In either case, EXAA functions as a central counter-party to every trading transaction, which means that EXAA guarantees the physical fulfillment of every trade.

===teem - Training for Energy and Environmental Markets===
Besides its function as a marketplace for spot electricity, EXAA also supports regional initiatives related to electricity markets and provides a training program - teem, for electric utilities and different stakeholders from the energy industry.
The [http://www.exaa.at/de/teem/ Training for Energy and Environmental Markets] was developed by EXAA in cooperation with experts from the CISMO Group and from different strategic partners covering all segments of the energy sector. The goal was to develop a training with focus on the practical aspects of the electricity industry, using the newest data to analyze trends and market developments and provide a wide range of professionals with insights from market practitioners. The transparent and coherent energy insights as well as current developments are not only interesting for energy newcomers but also for employees who want to broaden and update their knowledge. 
teem has already achieved the position of market leader in the energy training segment as it convinces delegates with its up-to-date and compact contentcs as well as its great value for money.

===Price stiffness===
Price stiffness could be considered the "opposite" of the price elasticity function. While the price elasticity is a measure indicating the change of the demand or supply given a certain change in the price, the "price stiffness" used by EXAA is set out to determine the '''impact of a change in the supply and demand structure on the market clearing price'''.
The reason behind investigating such a measure is to assess the influence of bids (especially market orders) on the market clearing price (the price for each product calculated during the auction).
Traders are often forced to enter bids as market orders (a bid specifying only the required quantity, not limited by a certain price) in order to have a certainty of being able to procure the necessary volumes to close their positions. Market orders can potentially have a major impact on the outcome of the auction since particularly significant bid/s can cause a dramatic shift in the aggregated demand, or in the aggregated supply curve leading to unwanted price spikes. (Note: While a certain number of significant price spikes is bound to occur due to extreme market conditions, one of the characteristics of a stable market is how well does it absorb single bids and what are the usual levels of volatility on average.) This aspect resents a potential risk in smaller markets, where large market orders might cause a dramatic price shift. The price stiffness analysis is based on a simulation, which replays past auctions, while injecting additional market orders of differing magnitude into the auction, thus obtaining a virtual price for multiple critical scenarios.
A central part of EXAA publications is the Daily Spotlight, which is a brief summary of the recent trends in price and volume development at the EXAA. It is compiled on a daily basis and made publicly available at the EXAA website.

'''Ferberite''' is the [[iron]] [[endmember]] of the [[manganese]] - iron [[wolframite]] [[solid solution]] series. The manganese endmember is [[hübnerite]]. Ferberite is a black [[monoclinic]] mineral composed of [[iron]](II) [[tungstate]], [[iron|Fe]][[tungsten|W]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Ferberite and hübnerite often contain both divalent cations of iron and manganese, with [[wolframite]] as the intermediate species for which the solid solution series is named.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-4305.html Wolframite on Mindat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferberite occurs as granular masses and as slender prismatic crystals. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 4.5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 7.4 to 7.5.  Ferberite typically occurs in [[pegmatite]]s, [[granitic]] [[greisen]]s, and high temperature [[hydrothermal]] deposits.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; It is a minor ore of [[tungsten]].

Ferberite was discovered in 1863 in Sierra Almagrera, [[Spain]], and named after the German [[mineralogist]] Moritz Rudolph Ferber (1805–1875).&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

'''Geophysical signal analysis''' is concerned with the detection and a subsequent processing of signals. Any signal which is varying conveys valuable information. Hence to understand the information embedded in such signals, we need to 'detect' and 'extract data' from such quantities. Geophysical signals are of extreme importance to us as they are information bearing signals which carry data related to petroleum deposits beneath the surface and [[seismic]] data. Analysis of geophysical signals also offers us a qualitative insight into the possibility of occurrence of a natural calamity such as [[earthquake]]s or [[volcanic eruption]]s.

[[Gravity of Earth|Gravitational]] and [[magnetic field]]s are detected using extremely sensitive gravitometers and magnetometers respectively. The gravitational field changes are measured using devices such as atom interferometers.&lt;ref name ="abc"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chiba|first1=J.|last2=Obata|first2=Tsunehiro|title=Gravitational field sensor for prediction of big seismic waves|journal=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 1992 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology, 1992.

After detection, the data from these signals is extracted by performing [[Spectral density#Explanation|spectral analysis]], [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] and [[beamforming]] techniques. These techniques can be used in oil exploration to estimate the position of underground objects,&lt;ref name = "muravchik" /&gt; harnessing [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref name = "def" /&gt;

== Background ==

The position of underground objects can be determined by measuring the gradient in Earth's gravitational field.&lt;ref name ="muravchik"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Muravchik|first1=C.H.|last2=Nehorai|first2=Arye|title=Localizing and identifying underground objects using gravitational measurements|journal=1994 Conference Record of the Twenty-Eighth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, 1994|date=1994-10-01|volume=2|pages=760–764|doi=10.1109/ACSSC.1994.471564|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=471564|accessdate=7 November 2015|isbn=978-0-8186-6405-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that an object with heavier mass “attracts” other objects of a considerably lower value of mass.  This force of attraction is explained by understanding the following topics.

===Spatial and temporal frequency===

Temporal frequency is the number of occurrences of an event in unit "time". It is defined relative to time. Frequency of a wave can be X cycles per second. Spatial frequency on the other hand is the characteristic of any entity that periodically varies in space.

====Digitizing in time and space domain====

Digitizing of any signal has two aspects : "digitizing in time domain" and "digitizing in space domain". These concepts pertain to the signals varying in space, time or both.

* Time domain digitization is the process of measuring the amplitude of signal in discrete time intervals.
*Space domain digitization is the process of measuring the amplitude of signal in discrete spatial domain. Ex: Measuring intensity of electromagnetic field at various spatial intervals.

====Tensor====

To explain the concept of a [[tensor]], consider the definition of a vector: “Vector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction. Vectors are tensors with rank 1”. There is only basis vector for a component. Ex: Velocity is represented as Ai + Bj + Ck where i,j,k are unit vectors in the x,y,z directions respectively. We can see that there is a one-one mapping between the basis vector and its component.

[[File:Vel vector.JPG|thumbnail|right]]

Tensor, on the other hand has rank greater than one. Gravitational field is an example for a tensor.

[[File:Tensor representation.JPG|thumbnail|left|This figure describes the i component of Area vector and the i,j,k components of gravitational filed vector.]]

[[File:Tensors1.JPG|thumbnail|left|3-d  gravitational field vector components acting on the 'j' component of area vector.]]

[[File:Tensors2.JPG|thumbnail|left|3-d  gravitational field vector components acting on the 'k' component of area vector]]

The set of figures on the left represent the various components of the gravitational field. These components fully characterize all the forces acting on a body. These can be represented in a matrix form as follows:

[[File:Matrix tensor.JPG|thumbnail|center|Representation of all the components of the gravitational gradient vector]]

Now that we are familiar with the concepts of gravity and tensors, a qualitative discussion of gravity and its significance in geophysical analysis can be done. A certain mass distribution creates a gravitational force field around it, In other words, the object under consideration has a finite mass ‘M’ and hence bends the space around it. The gravitational field gradient is given by the divergence of the gravitational field.&lt;ref name = "muravchik" /&gt;

== Existing approaches in geophysical signal recognition and analysis ==

=== Estimating the positions of the underground objects by measuring gravitational measurements ===

The method being discussed here assumes that the mass distribution of the underground objects of interest is already known and hence the problem of estimating their location boils down to parametric localisation. Since the mass distribution of objects of interest is already known, say underground objects with center of masses(CM&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, CM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;…CM&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are located under the earth and at positions p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. The gravity gradient(components of the gravity field) is measured using a spinning wheel with accelerometers also called as the gravity gradiometer.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Metzger, “Development Experience of Gravity Gradiometer System” , IEEE Plans Meeting,1982&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is positioned in different orientations to measure the respective component of gravitational field. The values of gravitational gradient tensors are calculated and analyzed. The analysis includes observing the contribution of each object under consideration. A maximum likelihood procedure is followed and [[Cramér–Rao bound]] (CRB) is computed to assess the quality of location estimate.

=== Measurement of Earth’s magnetic fields ===

Magnetometers are used to measure the magnetic fields, magnetic anomalies in the earth. The sensitivity of magnetometers depends upon the requirement. Ex, the variations in the geomagnetic fields can be to the order of several aT where 1aT = 10^-18T . In such cases, specialized magnetometers such as a [[superconducting quantum interference device]] (SQUID) are used.

Jim Zimmerman co-developed the superconducting quantum interference device during his tenure at Ford research lab.&lt;ref name = "jim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kautz|first1=R.L.|title=Jim Zimmerman and the SQUID|journal=IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity|date=2001-03-01|volume=11|issue=1|page=1026|doi=10.1109/77.919524|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=919524|accessdate=7 November 2015|bibcode=2001ITAS...11.1026K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, events leading to the invention of squid were in fact, serendipitous. John Lambe,&lt;ref name ="jim" /&gt; during his experiments on [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] noticed that the electrical properties of [[indium]] varied due to a change in the magnetic field of the order of few [[Tesla (unit)|nT]]. But, Lambe was not able to fully recognise the utility of SQUID.

SQUIDs have the capability to detect magnetic fields of extremely low magnitude. This is due to the virtue of [[Josephson junction]]s. Jim Zimmerman pioneered the development of SQUID by proposing a new approach to making the Josephson junctions. He made use of [[niobium]] wires and niobium ribbons to form two Josephson junctions connected in parallel. The ribbons act as the interruptions to the superconducting current flowing through the wires. The junctions are very sensitive to the magnetic fields and hence are very useful in measuring fields of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|T]].

=== Measurement of seismic waves ===

==== Background ====

The motion of any mass is affected by the gravitational field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ann|last=Parker |title=Gravity Detector Applies Outside-the-Box Thinking to Show What’s Inside the Box|newspaper=Science &amp; Technology Review |publisher=Lawrence Livermore Laboratory|date=September 2013 |url=https://str.llnl.gov/september-2013/libby|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion of planets is affected by the Sun's enormous gravitational field. Likewise, a heavier object will influence the motion of other objects of smaller mass in its vicinity. However, this change in the motion is very small compared to the motion of heavenly bodies. Hence, special instruments are required to measure such a minute change.

====Atom interferometer====

[[File:Atominterferometer.jpg|thumbnail|right|Describes the atom interferometer principle]]

[[Atom interferometer]]s work on the principle of [[diffraction]].  The diffraction gratings are nano fabricated materials with a separation of a quarter wavelength of light. When a beam of atoms pass through a diffraction grating, due the inherent wave nature of atoms, they split and form interference fringes on the screen. An atom interferometer is very sensitive to the changes in the positions of atoms.  As heavier objects shifts the position of the atoms nearby, displacement of the atoms can be measured by detecting a shift in the interference fringes.

=== Analysis of geophysical signals ===

Any signal conveys information in two ways :

* Temporal and spatial variation of the data
* Frequency variation of the data.

==== Spectral analysis ====

===== Fourier representation =====

The Fourier expansion of a time domain signal is the representation of the signal as a sum of its frequency components, specifically sum of sines and cosines. [[Fourier series#Example 2: Fourier.27s motivation|Joseph Fourier]] came up with the Fourier representation to estimate the heat distribution of a body. The same approach can be followed to analyse the multi-dimensional signals such as electromagnetic waves.

The 4d - Fourier representation of such signals is given by:
             
S(K, ω) =    ∫  ∫  s(x,t) exp [-j(ωt- k'x)] dx dt
            
* ω represents temporal frequency and k represents spatial frequency.
* s(x,t) is a 4-dimensional space time signal which can be imagined as travelling plane waves. The plane of propagation is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of an electromagnetic wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |first=E. J. |last=Kelley, Jr. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=6 March 1964 |title=The representation of seismic waves in frequency-wave number space |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/433611.pdf |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory |page= |docket=Group report 1964-15 |accessdate=16 November 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Filtering =====

Simply put, space time signal filtering problem&lt;ref name=filter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halpeny|first1=O.S|last2=Childers|first2=Donald G.|title=Composite wavefront decomposition via multidimensional digital filtering of array data|journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems|date=1975-06-01|volume=22|issue=6|pages=552–563|doi=10.1109/TCS.1975.1084081|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1084081}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be thought as localizing the speed and direction of a particular signal.&lt;ref name = "dan"&gt;Dan E. Dudgeon, Russell M. Mersereau, “Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing”, Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series, {{ISBN|0136049591}},pp. 291-294, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The design of filters for spacetime signals follows a similar approach as that of 1-D signals. The filters for 1-D signals are designed in such a way that if the requirement of the filter is to extract frequency components in a particular non-zero range of frequencies, a [[band-pass filter]] with appropriate passband and stop band frequencies in determined. Similarly, in the case of multi-dimensional systems, the wavenumber-frequency response of filters is designed in such a way thatit is unity in the designed region of (k, ω) a.k.a. wavenumber - frequency and zero elsewhere.&lt;ref name = "dan"/&gt;

====Beamforming====

This approach is applied for filtering spacetime signals.&lt;ref name = "dan" /&gt;  It is designed to isolate signals travelling in a particular direction. One of the simplest filters is weighted delay and sum beamformer. The output is the average of the linear combination of delayed signals. In other words, the beamformer output is formed by averaging weighted and delayed versions of receiver signals. The delay is chosen such that the passband of beamformer is directed to a specific direction in the space.&lt;ref name = "dan"/&gt;

[[File:PhasedArrayRepresentation.JPG|thumbnail|right|Spatial distribution of phased arrays to filter geophysical signals]]

====Upward continuation in analyzing magnetic fields====

This method can be used to estimate the depth of the magnetic materials beneath the earth. The magnetic data is processed by the spectral methods such as Fourier transforms. The FFT algorithm makes the spectral analysis of signals fast, easy and efficient.The FFT computations can be performed in the machines which allow us to perform [[Contour line|contour mapping.]] The upward continuation method attenuates the wave number anomalies associated with the shallow magnetic sources. Thus the signal components contain the information about the objects situated deep beneath the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ganiyu|first1=S. A.|last2=Badmus|first2=B. S.|last3=Awoyemi|first3=M. O.|last4=Akinyemi|first4=O. D.|last5=Olurin|first5=Oluwaseun T.|title=Upward Continuation and Reduction to Pole Process on Aeromagnetic Data of Ibadan Area, South-Western Nigeria|journal=Earth Science Research|date=7 September 2012|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.5539/esr.v2n1p66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

=== Geothermal energy mapping===

The gravity data is collected from a detailed geographical surveys. The gravitational field intensity is measured using the gravimeter. Also, the elevations have to measured to account for the height corrections.&lt;ref name = "def "/&gt;  The [[Bouguer anomaly|Bouguer anomalies]] in the gravity data are analysed. The Bouguer anomaly is a correction of the gravitational data which takes into account the heights of different terrains.

The Bouguer data is coupled with other magnetic and seismic measurements of the region. This data is instrumental in revealing the tectonic and structural geography that area.&lt;ref name= "def"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Zaid|first1=Adnan I.O.|last2=El-Isa|first2=Zuhair H.|last3=El-Kilani|first3=Radwan J.|title=Utilization of geothermal energy in Jordan|journal=Power Generation System and Renewable Energy Technologies (PGSRET), 2015|date=2015-06-01|pages = 1–9|doi=10.1109/PGSRET.2015.7312220|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7312220|isbn=978-1-4673-6812-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the data is obtained, some of the observations from the Bouguer data indicate the following:

* The Bouguer anomaly data is directly related to the subsurface topology of the region.
* The positive Bouguer anomalies indicate [[igneous intrusion]]s in the sub-surface.&lt;ref name = "def"/&gt;
* The gravity studies also indicate the presence of sub-surface [[aquifer]]s. Hence, it can be guessed that the water circulation in the region of igneous intrusions can be a source of geothermal energy.

=== Oil exploration===

The process of oil exploration] starts with finding a layer of impermeable substance under which oil is buried. Until a well is drilled, one can't accurately determine the presence of oil. However, by the efficient use of geothermal techniques, we can detect a layer beneath which oil may be trapped.

There are several approaches to detect the "oil traps"

* The presence of flowing oil can cause minute changes in the gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth. These small changes in gravitational and magnetic fields can be picked up by sensitive gravimeters and magnetometers respectively.
* In another approach, shock waves are sent beneath the surface. As the waves travel through the earth, they are reflected by various rock layers. The sensors mounted at the surface measure the time of arrival of the reflected waves. The presence/absence of oil can be ascertained by analyzing these readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freudenrich |first=Craig |last2=Jonathan |first2=Strickland |title=How Oil Drilling Works |date=2 April 2001 |publisher=howstuffworks |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/oil-drilling.htm |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reflection seismology|Seismic reflection]] techniques can provide reasonable accurate information over a larger area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3743">[[File:Iron cycle.svg|thumb|This one briefly describes the iron cycle in the environment.]]

In [[ecology]] or [[geoscience]], the '''iron cycle''' ''(Fe)'' is the [[biogeochemical cycle]] of [[iron]] through [[landform]]s, the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and [[ocean]]s. The iron cycle affects [[dust]] deposition and [[Particulate|aerosol]] iron [[bioavailability]].

== Overview ==
Iron ranges in oxidation states from -2 to +7; however, in Earth's crust it is predominantly in its +2 (ferrous) or +3 (ferric) redox state. The cycling of iron between its ferrous and ferric oxidation states is referred to as the iron cycle. This process can be entirely abiotic, or facilitated by microorganisms. Some examples of this include the rusting of iron-bearing metals (in this case Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is abiotically oxidized to Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) by oxygen, and the abiotic reduction of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by iron-sulfide minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ionescu|first=Danny|last2=Heim|first2=Christine|last3=Polerecky|first3=Lubos|last4=Thiel|first4=Volker|last5=Beer|first5=Dirk de|date=2015-03-16|title=Biotic and abiotic oxidation and reduction of iron at circumneutral pH are inseparable processes under natural conditions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2014.887393|journal=Geomicrobiology Journal|volume=32|issue=3-4|pages=221–230|doi=10.1080/01490451.2014.887393|issn=0149-0451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iron cycle can also be facilitated by microorganisms, such as by [[Iron-oxidizing bacteria|Fe-oxidizing bacteria]], which can oxidize Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, extracting one electron in the process for energy. [[Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria|Fe-reducing bacteria]] can reduce Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; back to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by utilizing it as a terminal electron acceptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Liang|last2=Dong|first2=Hailiang|last3=Reguera|first3=Gemma|last4=Beyenal|first4=Haluk|last5=Lu|first5=Anhuai|last6=Liu|first6=Juan|last7=Yu|first7=Han-Qing|last8=Fredrickson|first8=James K.|date=10 2016|title=Extracellular electron transfer mechanisms between microorganisms and minerals|journal=Nature Reviews.

Iron is an important element on earth. It is 4th in abundance in the crust, and is an essential [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|co-factor]] in many biological enzymes. Due to the high reactivity of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with oxygen and low solubility of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, iron is a limiting nutrient to [[phytoplankton]], the photosynthetic primary producers in the ocean. Thus, the iron cycle is intrinsically linked to the cycling of other biologically-important elements.

== History of Iron Cycling on Earth ==
In the early earth, when atmospheric oxygen levels were 0.001% of those present today, dissolved iron was thought to have been a lot more abundant in the oceans, and thus more bioavailable to microbial life present in that era. At this time, before the onset of oxygenic photosynthesis, primary production may have been dominated by photoferrotrophs, which would obtain energy from sunlight, and use the electrons from Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to fix carbon.[citation needed]

}}'''Kathleen Meyer''' (born 7 December 1942) is a contemporary [[United States of America|American]] [[nature writer]]&lt;ref&gt;Books by Kathleen Meyer. Amazon.com. https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B000APBWUC&lt;/ref&gt; whose first work, ''How To Shit in the Woods'' was published in 1989. Her writing is characterized by the use of [[humor]] and irreverence. She has only two published works in print: ''How to Shit in the Woods'' and ''Barefoot Hearted''.

== ''How to Shit in the Woods'' ==
''How to Shit in the Woods'' was published by [[Ten Speed Press]] in 1989. This first book by Meyer does, indeed, revolve around the many strategies she has noticed for defecating where there is no modern toilet and running water. As one reads the book, it quickly becomes obvious that Meyer's concern is not so much for the comfort of the camper or hiker, but for the impact that human waste leaves on pristine natural ecosystems. She talks about digging "environmentally sound" holes, locating the high water line, so as not to inadvertently pollute a stream or ground water source, and what types of soil facilitate quickest decomposition without risk of environmental contamination. The damage to humans and wildlife from carelessly disposed human waste comes in many forms including [[giardia]], [[diarrhea]], and [[intestinal]] diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Kathleen|title=How to shit in the woods : an environmentally sound approach to a lost art|year=1989|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0-89815-319-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition of the book was issued in 1994 and a third edition in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Kathleen|title=How to shit in the woods : an environmentally sound approach to a lost art|year=1994|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-0-89815-627-0|edition=2nd ed. rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer holds humans uniquely responsible for the spread of giardia in the wilderness areas of the United States: "Until 1970, there were no reports in the United States of waterborne outbreaks of giardia. The first .  .  .  occurred in Aspen, Colorado, in 1970. Over the next four years, many cases were documented in travelers returning from .  .  .  Leningrad  .  .  . The Soviet Union became more open to visitation by Westerners at about this time and Leningrad's municipal water supply was full of Giardia cysts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Kathleen|title=How to shit in the woods : an environmentally sound approach to a lost art|year=1989|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0-89815-319-0|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its various editions, the book has been reviewed by ''[[Audubon Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="How to Shit in the Woods" editorial reviews|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1580083633|work=website|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Dominion Post,&lt;ref group="Lexis Nexis"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurdy|first=Diana|title=Nature Calls|newspaper=The Dominion Post (Wellington)|date=January 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Globe and Mail&lt;ref group="Lexis Nexis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Trillin|first=Calvin|title=Summertime, but the reading isn't always easy|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=15 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audubon magazine writer Frank Graham wrote “Kathleen Meyer has contributed to environmental awareness while lending a grand old English word the respectability it hasn’t had since Chaucer’s day.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Reviews--How to Shit in the Woods, 3rd edition|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product-description/1580083633|work=web page|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Barefoot-Hearted'' ==
In ''Barefoot-Hearted'', published by [[Random House]] in 2001, Meyer writes about renovating a dilapidated barn in which to live with her new boyfriend. Her book explores the many adversities of trying to live in a barn, not the least of which is how the smell of resident skunks under the floor permeates and resides in her clothes and hair and how the barn is infested with flies and mice. In the manner of nature writers who often use a small animal or plant as a symbol of an ecological principle, Meyer explains that she doesn't feel guilty about trapping and killing mice, because they are abundant and their population ever growing. By contrast, she notes the comparative frailty of bears who often stumble upon human habitations looking for food. When the humans get scared, the bear is often removed and killed. In the same book, Meyer also chronicles her adventure riding a horse and buggy across a large region of northwest America. ''Barefoot Hearted'' was widely reviewed, though not always with great affection. ''Kirkus Reviews'' found it an "annoying saga about a house full of pests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barefoot Hearted|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/kathleen-meyer/barefoot-hearted/#review|work=website|publisher=Kirkus Reviews.|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Reviews|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product-description/B000FUO0H4|work=website|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Meyer lives in [[Victor, Montana]] where she has an editing business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wapiti-waters.com/blog/tag/montana/page/4/ Montana | A Montana Fly Fishing Blog with Wapiti Waters and Jack Mauer] Retrieved 2017-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Beyşehir National Park''' ({{lang-tr|Beyşehir Gölü Milli Parkı}}), established in 1993, is a [[national park]] in [[Konya Province]], central Turkey.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;

==Geography==
The national park is located within the districts [[Beyşehir]] and [[Hüyük]] of Konya Province. It is bordered by the [[Lake Beyşehir]] in the west, [[Beyşehir]] in the south and [[Hüyük, Konya|Hüyük]] in the north. The national park has an elevation of {{convert|1100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Lake Beyşehir is Turkey's third biggest lake, and the biggest freshwater lake.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt; As of covered area, the national park with {{convert|86855|ha|abbr=on}} was the largestof the country until 2004 when [[Mount Ararat National Park]] was established.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hbr1"/&gt;

==Ecosystem==
===Flora===
The national park habitats 85 [[family (biology)|families]], 305 [[genus|genera]], 545 [[species]], 54 [[subspecies]] and 140 [[variety (botany)|varieties]] within its boundaries. 88 of the 560 [[taxon|taxa]] in the park area are [[endemic]]. Some plants spread in and around the protected area are Turkish cedar, (''[[Cedrus libani]]''), common juniper (''[[Juniperus communis]]''), Phoenicean juniper (''[[Juniperus phoenicea]]''), fir (''[[Abies]]''), pine (''[[Pinus]]''), kermes oak (''[[Quercus coccifera]]''), ash tree (''[[Fraxinus]]''), walnut tree (''[[Juglans]]''), mulberry (''[[Morus (plant)|Morus]]''), male fern (''[[Dryopteris filix-mas]]''), windflower (''[[Anemone nemorosa]]''), poppy (''[[Papaver somniferum]]''), dyer's madder (''[[Rubia tinctorum]]''), sage (''[[Salvia]]''), snowdrop (''[[Galanthus]]'') and ''[[cyclamen]]''.&lt;ref name="mpfl"/&gt;

===Fauna===
Lake Beyşehir and its creeks are habitat for 16 [[freshwater fish]] species including [[zander]], [[carp]] and [[Vimba vimba|zarte]].&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mpfa"/&gt;

The lake is quite important for [[water bird]]s. There are 153 bird species in the park area. Bird species such as [[coot]], [[pelican]], [[heron]], [[grebe]], [[mallard]], [[little grebe]] and [[tufted duck]] are observed on the [[islet]]s and the shallow banks of the lake.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mpfa"/&gt;

The area around the lake is also rich in species of [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[mammal]]s. It is habitat for three amphibian, 14 reptile and 34 mammal species.&lt;ref name="mpfa"/&gt;

==Facilities and recreation==
The national park offers opportunities for diverse recreational outdoor activities such as [[backpacking (wilderness)|trekking]], [[hiking]] and [[mountain biking]].&lt;ref name="mpk"/&gt; There is also possibility of boat ride on the lake.&lt;ref name="mpz"/&gt;

There are [[picnic area]]s, [[off-road park]], [[campground]]s for tent and [[campervan|camper]] in the park.&lt;ref name="mpr"/&gt;  The park has no lodging facilities. The nearby town Beyşehir provides hotels, motels and hostels to stay.&lt;ref name="mpk"/&gt;

Best time to perform recreational activities in the national park is between May and October.&lt;ref name="mpr"/&gt;

==Access==
State highway {{TUR-D|350}} between [[Konya]] and [[Isparta]] runs through the national par. The park is in a distance of {{convert|94|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Konya, and is {{convert|105|km|mi|abbr=on}} far from Isparta.&lt;ref name="mpz"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3481">This article attempts to list [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific inventions]] wherein common [[water]] is used to either augment or generate a fuel to power an engine, boiler or other source of power. This is not to be confused with legitimate inventions (such as [[hydroelectricity]]) in which the kinetic energy of flowing water is used for power.

== Electrolysis ==
The [[electrolysis of water]] splits water into [[oxyhydrogen|hydrogen and oxygen]], producing a usable fuel. However, the energy required for electrolysis is greater than the energy released by burning this fuel, so this is not a viable way to manufacture energy. Nonetheless, several people have claimed to create devices that do exactly this.

*[[Stanley Meyer]], who claimed to run a car on water in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2007/07/08/hydroman.ART_ART_07-08-07_A1_4V77MOK.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214190405/http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2007/07/08/hydroman.ART_ART_07-08-07_A1_4V77MOK.html |archivedate=2008-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patent, Meyer" &gt;{{cite patent|us|4936961}} Meyer water cell&lt;/ref&gt;
*Charles Frazer, an inventor from Ohio who, in 1918 patented a hydrogen booster which claimed to use electrolysis to increase vehicle power and fuel efficiency while greatly reducing exhaust emissions.&lt;ref name="Patent, Frazer" &gt;{{cite patent|us|1262034}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Daniel Dingel]], a Filipino engineer who has been involved in water fuel research since 1968. A video interview showed Dingel's Toyota Corolla with an on-board hydrogen water fuel generator.&lt;ref name="Dingel" &gt;http://www.wasserauto.de/html/inquirer_article.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVhXrvCCILw&lt;/ref&gt; This research career may be curtailed by his recent 20-year sentence for fraud.&lt;ref name="Dingel, Fraud sentence"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Submerged gasification ==
*[[Ruggero Maria Santilli]]'s "Magnegas" recyclers, which use an underwater carbon arc to gasify bio-contaminated liquid into a clean-burning gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/video/fortune/2010/09/22/f_bsg_magnegas_natural_gas.fortune/ | work=CNN | title=From trash to gas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transformative claims ==
Water is claimed to be transformed into a fuel itself, by the addition of some ingredient. This may be either a highly concentrated addition, or a catalyst (i.e. not consumed in use).
*[[Hongcheng Magic Liquid]]
*[[Gasoline pill]]

'''Loiyangalani–Suswa High Voltage Power Line''' is a [[high voltage]] electricity power line under construction in [[Kenya]], connecting the high voltage [[Electrical substation|substation]] at [[Loyangalani]], in [[Marsabit County]], to another high voltage substation at [[Suswa]], in [[Narok County]].&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=27 February 2018 | url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001265401/turkana-wind-power-line-70-percent-finished-to-be-complete-by-june |title=Turkana power line to move electricity from Loiyangalani to Suswa |date=9 January 2018 |newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)| East African Standard]] Quoting [[Reuters]] |author=Reuters | location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The power line starts at the {{convert|310|MW|0}} [[Lake Turkana Wind Power Station]] in Loiyangalani, Marsabit County and runs in a southerly direction for approximately {{convert|428|km|0|}} to end at the [[Kenya Electricity Transmission Company]] electricity substation, at Suswa, in [[Narok County]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=27 February 2018 | url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Kenya_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Loiyangalani%2C%20Kenya&amp;toplace=Ketraco%20Suswa%20substation%2C%20Kenya&amp;dt1=ChIJUZZ_qRk2mhcRstJfBeIR8pY&amp;dt2=ChIJERO2S9HOLhgRSnrJkywkOO8 |title=Straight Line Distance between Loiyangalani, Kenya and Ketraco Suswa Substation, Kenya |last=Globefeed.com |date=27 February 2018 |
publisher=Globefeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The 400kV power line is intended to evacuate the electricity generated at the Turkana Wind Power Station, to the Ketraco substation at Suswa. The [[government of Spain|Government of Spain]] is lending the [[government of Kenya|Kenyan government]] a total of €142 million (approx. US$174.6 million), to have this line constructed. The contract between Isolux and Ketraco is for a construction price of US$208.1 million. The government of Kenya will provide the balance of approximately US$33.5 million as equity in the power line, along with any associated land acquisition costs.&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mwende | url=http://www.constructionkenya.com/2107/isolux-to-build-400-kv-transmission-line-in-kenya/ |title=Isolux to build 400 kilo-Volt power line in Kenya |access-date=27 February 2018 | date=13 June 2011 |publisher=Constructionkenya.com |location=Nairobi | first=Judy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
In 2011, the [[Spain|Spanish]] company, [[Isolux Corsán|Isolux Ingeniera SA]] won the contract to construct this power line.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web| access-date=27 February 2018 | url=https://www.nation.co.ke/business/996-3864548-ilgrwtz/index.html |title=Taxpayer billions to bail out Spanish power line builder |first=David | last=Herbling |date=25 March 2017 |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] | location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a prolonged land acquisition process, work did not actually start until November 2015.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt; Sixteen months into construction, on a project allocated 24 months, the parent company of the main contractor, Isolux Corsán, ran out of money and filed [[bankruptcy]] in Spain. In August 2017, Ketraco terminated the contract with Isolux, with about 30 percent of the work completed.&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;{{cite web|date=3 September 2017 |url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/corporate/companies/Spanish-firm-sues-to-salvage-Sh17bn-Turkana-power-line-deal/4003102-4081358-1x9fq0z/index.html |title=Spanish firm sues to salvage Sh17 billion Turkana power line deal |access-date=27 February 2018 |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |location=Nairobi |
first=Brian |last=Wasuna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the Kenya government, through Ketraco,  contracted a [[consortium]] of [[China|Chinese]] firms at a cost of US$96 million, to complete the work left pending by Isolux. Work is expected to conclude in August 2018. The consortium, comprising ''NARI Group Corporation'' and ''Power China Guizhou Engineering Company'', has committed in writing to pay US$10 million in fines, for every month the work goes beyond the 31 August 2018 deadline.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://constructionreviewonline.com/2018/02/chinese-firms-get-us-96m-turkana-power-line-tender/ |title=Chinese firms get US $ 96m Lake Turkana Wind Power line tender |access-date=27 February 2018 |author=Construction Review Online |date=2 February 2018 |publisher=Constructionreviewonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, [[Reuters]] reported that construction of the power station was complete and was awaiting testing and commissioning.&lt;ref name="77R"&gt;{{cite web|date=5 September 2018 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/kenya-energy/kenya-428-km-power-line-complete-to-add-310-mw-to-grid-by-december-idUSL8N1VJ3MJ |access-date=5 September 2018 |last=Thomas Mukoya | 
first=and George Obulutsa |publisher=[[Reuters|Thomson Reuters]] |title=Kenya 428 km power line complete, to add 310 MW to grid by December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capacity charge==
In January 2017, the owners of [[Lake Turkana Wind Power Station]] started to bill the Kenya Power Company a monthly "capacity charge" of KSh700 million (approx. US$7 million), for power produced by the power station that cannot be evacuated due to lack a high voltage line to transmit it to the substation at Suswa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| access-date=27 February 2017 | url=http://www.nation.co.ke/business/Kenya-Power-billed-for-idle-wind-farm/996-4075132-ikk598z/index.html | title=Kenya Power billed for idle wind farm |date=29 August 2017 |location=Nairobi  |first=Neville |last=Otuki |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following negotiations, in September 2017, the [[government of Kenya]] agreed to pay the developers of Lake Turkana Wind Power Station, a total of Sh5.7 billion (approx. US$55.83 million), in monthly installments, spread over a six year period. The monthly payment will amount to Sh78,600,000 (approx. US$769,833). The monthly surcharge will be passed on to the consumers, beginning in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=27 February 2018 |  url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/economy/Consumers-to-pay-Sh5-7bn-for-wind-power-line-delays/3946234-4110524-132a2sj/index.html | title=Consumers to pay Sh5.7bn for wind power line delays |date=24 September 2017 |location=Nairobi |

In this example the crop has a salt tolerance (threshold) of ECe&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Pb&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;dS/m beyond which the yield diminishes.]]

The '''Maas–Hoffman model''' is a mathematical tool to characterize the relation between [[crop production]] and [[soil salinity]]. It describes the crop response by a broken line of which the first part is horizontal and the second is sloping downward.&lt;ref&gt;Maas EV, Hoffman GJ, 1977. ''Crop salt tolerance-current assessment''. Journal of the Irrigation and Drainage Division, American Society of Civil Engineers 103: 115-134.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''breakpoint'' (Pb) or ''threshold'' is also called ''tolerance'' because up to that point the yield is unaffected by the salinity, so the salt is tolerated, while at greater salinity values the crops are affected negatively and the yield goes down.

==Mathematics==

Mathematically the two lines are represented by the equations:

: ''Y'' = ''C'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [''X''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Pb]
: ''Y'' = ''AX'' + ''B'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  [''X''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pb]

where ''Y''&amp;nbsp;= crop production or yield, ''C''&amp;nbsp;= maximum yield, ''X''&amp;nbsp;= soil salinity, ''A''&amp;nbsp;= slope (regression coefficient) of the descending line, and ''B''&amp;nbsp;= regression constant of that line.

In the example of the figure: ''C'' = 1.2, ''A'' = —0.10, Pb = 7.0

The value of Pb is to be found by [[regression analysis]] and [[optimization]] so that the [[goodness of fit]] of the data to the model is maximum.

The Maas–Hoffman model is used in [[Crop tolerance to seawater#Modeling|crop tolerance to seawater]].
[[File:Maas-Hoffman model inverted.png|thumb|350px|Inverted Maas-Hoffman model for the relation between crop yield and depth of the watertable]]

==Inverted model==

For growth factors, like the depth of the [[watertable]], that affect crop production negatively at low values while there is no effect at high values, the inverted Maas–Hoffman model can be used.

{{Other uses|Off the grid (disambiguation)}}

'''Off-the-grid''' is a system and lifestyle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vanini|first1=Phillip|title=Off the Grid: Re-Assembling Domestic Life|date=2014|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to help people function without the support of remote [[infrastructure]], such as an [[electrical grid]]. In electricity, off-grid can be [[stand-alone power system]] or [[mini-grid]]s typically to provide a smaller community with electricity.

''Off-grid electrification'' is an approach to access electricity used in countries and areas with little access to electricity, due to scattered or distant population. The term '''off-the-grid''' ('''OTG''') can refer to living in a [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] manner without reliance on one or more [[public utility|public utilities]]. Namely the electrical grid. People who adopt this lifestyle are called ''off-gridders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adey|first1=Peter|title=The Routledge Handbook of Mobilities|date=2014|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-the-grid homes aim to achieve [[autonomy]]; they do not rely on one or more of municipal [[water supply]], [[sanitary sewer|sewer]], [[Natural gas|gas]], electrical power grid, or similar utility services. A common misconception is that a true off-grid house is able to operate completely independently of all traditional [[public utility]] services. Although this is not the case. The term "off the grid" traditionally refers to the electrical grid only.

== In popular culture ==
The idea has been recently popularized by certain celebrities including [[Ed Begley, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therenewableplanet.com/green/celebs/ed-begley-jr.aspx TheRenewablePlanet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; who stars in the ''[[Living with Ed]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingwithed.net/ livingwithed.net]&lt;/ref&gt; television show on the [[HGTV|Home &amp; Garden Television]] (HGTV) network. Actress [[Daryl Hannah]] promotes off-grid living and constructed her home in Colorado according to those principles, as does survival expert and ''[[Dual Survival]]'' co-star [[Cody Lundin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.off-grid.net/index.php?p=313 off-grid.net]&lt;/ref&gt; who lives in a self-designed, [[passive solar building design|passive solar]] [[earth house]] in the high-desert wilderness of [[Northern Arizona]], collecting rainwater, composting waste, and paying nothing for utilities.&lt;ref name=stanley2007&gt;{{cite news |author=Stanley, John |date=November 1, 2007 |url=http://www.azcentral.com/travel/arizona/features/articles/1101cody1102.html |title=Survival guide aimed at complacent urbanites |publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]] |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lundin, Cody |title=About Cody Lundin |url=http://www.codylundin.com/bio.html |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrical power==
[[File:CableFree Solar Battery Powered Radio Base Site installed in Greece .jpg|thumb|A CableFree Off-Grid Solar plus Battery Powered Radio Base Site installed in Greece]]
[[Electric power|Electrical power]] can be generated on-site with [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[solar power|solar]] (particularly with [[photovoltaics]]), [[wind power|wind]], [[micro hydro]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]]; with a [[Engine-generator|generator]] or [[Micro combined heat and power]] with adequate fuel reserves. Such a system is called a [[stand-alone power system]] or sometimes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2011|title=The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693|journal=Sibirca|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–20|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as a [[Hybrid power]] system. In addition, it is possible to simply eliminate electric power such as in [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] and [[Old Order Mennonite]] communities.

Remote locations that are expensive to connect to main electricity grids are particularly suited for off-grid renewable energy developments, for example remote islands or tundra locations.

==Water and sanitation==
[[Self-supply of water and sanitation]] is possible to be independent of municipal [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] services.

On-site [[water]] sources can include a [[Water well|well]], stream, tank, or lake. These sources may require pumps or filtration. [[Rainwater harvesting|Rainwater]] can also be harvested. Filters can be advanced running off an energy source of boiling and storage.

Off-the-grid houses are not connected to a [[Sewerage|sewer system]], but may instead rely on various types of [[dry toilet]]s, such as [[composting toilet]]s or [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s.

==Popularity==
On 13 April 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that there were "some 180,000 families living off-grid, a figure that has jumped 33% a year for a decade," and cited Richard Perez, publisher of [[Home Power Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homepower.com/home/ Home Power Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; as the source.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/1020707911.html?dids=1020707911:1020707911&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Apr+13%2C+2006&amp;author=Paul+Davidson&amp;pub=USA+TODAY&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.1&amp;desc=Off+the+grid+or+on%2C+solar+and+wind+power+gain+%3B+Incentives%2C+savings+push+more+families+to+renewable+energy USA Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the same rate of growth, there would be a quarter million off-grid households in the United States by late 2007. Because many [[Third World]] citizens have never had the chance to go on the grid, current estimates are that 1.7 billion people live off-grid worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernghana.com/news/164812/1/17bn-people-live-in-darkness.html Modern Ghana News]&lt;/ref&gt; A wave of TV shows and articles came out after the publication of "Off the Grid, Inside the Movement for More Space, Less Government and True Independence in Modern America" by Nick Rosen in 2010.&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosen|first1=Nick|title=Off the Grid: Inside the Movement for More Space, Less Government, and True Independence|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0143117384|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==
[[File:Off Grid Community Concept.jpg|thumb|right|Off Grid Community Concept by Eric Wichman]] The concept of a sustainable off-grid [[community]] must take into consideration the basic needs of all who live in the [[community]]. To become truly [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]], the [[community]] would need to provide all of its own [[Electric power|electrical power]], food, shelter and [[water]]. Using [[renewable energy]], an on-site [[water]] source, [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[vertical farming]] techniques is paramount in taking a community off the grid. A recent concept design by Eric Wichman shows a multi-family community, which combines all of these technologies into one [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] neighborhood. To grow the community you simply add neighborhoods using the same model as the first. A self-sustained community reduces its impact on the environment by controlling its [[waste]] and [[carbon footprint]].

==Environmental impact==
The State of California is encouraging [[Solar power|solar]] and [[Wind power|wind]] power generation that is connected to the electrical grid to avoid the use of toxic lead acid batteries for night time storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondoilsolar.com/carebate.htm California Solar Energy (PV) Rebate Information: The New California Solar Initiative Program]&lt;/ref&gt; Grid-tie systems are generally less expensive than off-grid systems due to the lack of additional equipment like [[charge controller]]s and the batteries. However, some systems may mitigate this difference by using old [[car battery|car batteries]] that can no longer supply enough current to start a car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/02/african-town-gets-wind-power-and-knowledge-51394 African Town Gets Wind Power and Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often done to residential buildings only occasionally occupied, such as vacation cabins, to avoid high initial costs of traditional utility connections. Other persons choose to live in houses where the cost of outside utilities is prohibitive, or such a distance away as to be impractical. In his book ''How to live off-grid'' [[Nick Rosen]] lists seven reasons for going off-grid. The top two are saving money, and reducing the carbon footprint. Others include [[Survivalism|survivalists]], preparing for the collapse of the [[peak oil|oil economy]] and bringing life back to the countryside.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;

===Environmental concerns in Canadian off-grid communities===
Canada has about 175 aboriginal and northern off-grid communities, defined as "a community that is neither connected to the North American electrical grid nor to the piped natural gas network; it is permanent or long-term (5 years or more), and the settlements have at least 10 permanent buildings."&lt;ref name = "DevelopmentCanada"&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Off-Grid Communities
| website = Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada
| accessdate = 2012-11-08
| date = 2012-05-01
| url = http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1314295992771/1314296121126
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]] lists the following environmental concerns for these off-grid communities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Burning large amounts of diesel produces substantial [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.  This contributes to climate change which negatively affects communities.
* Fuel must be transported long distances by airplane, truck or barge, leading to a greater risk of fuel spills.
* The transportation of fuel by trucks on winter roads impacts the environment negatively through high greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicles.
* Fuel spills may take place while the fuel is being transported and stored, posing environmental risks.  Fuel tank leaks contaminate soil and groundwater ...
* Generators can be [[Noise pollution|noisy and disruptive]], especially in quiet, remote communities.
* Emissions from diesel generators could contribute to health problems in community members.&lt;ref name = "DevelopmentCanada"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Economic consideration==
In situations where [[grid parity]] has been reached, it becomes cheaper to generate one's own electricity rather than purchasing it from the grid. This depends on equipment costs, the availability of renewable energy sources ([[wind power|wind]], [[solar power|sun]]), and the cost of a grid connection. For example, in certain remote areas a grid connection would be prohibitively expensive, resulting in grid parity being reached immediately.

==Off-grid photovoltaic==
The [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] off-grid market has been researched by international institutes, universities and market research companies. The cumulative installed PV capacity is estimated in 2010 between 1 and 2 GW&lt;ref name="IEA PV Roadmap"&gt;{{cite web|title=IEA PV Roadmap|url=http://www.iea.org/papers/2010/pv_roadmap.pdf|publisher=IEA|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  depending on the source. The market research company Infinergia has gone further by mapping national cumulative installed off-grid PV capacity on 100 countries worldwide.&lt;ref name="Infinergia off-grid map"&gt;{{cite web|title=Photovoltaic off-grid map|url=http://www.infinergia.com/en/node/105|publisher=Infinergia Consulting|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
In [[Africa]], small and inexpensive [[pico solar]] electric lights and solar home systems are becoming readily available. Inexpensive solar panels, lithium ion batteries and high-efficiency [[LED light]]s make the systems affordable.

== Theory ==
An atom or a molecule can absorb light and undergo a transition from
one quantum state to another.

The oscillator strength &lt;math&gt;f_{12}&lt;/math&gt; of a transition from a lower state
&lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to an upper state &lt;math&gt;|2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; may be defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
  f_{12} = \frac{2 }{3}\frac{m_e}{\hbar^2}(E_2 - E_1) \sum_{\alpha=x,y,z}
 | \langle 1 m_1 | R_\alpha | 2 m_2 \rangle |^2,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of an electron and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is
the [[reduced Planck constant]]. The [[quantum state]]s &lt;math&gt;|n\rangle, n=&lt;/math&gt; 1,2, are assumed to have several
degenerate sub-states, which are labeled by &lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt;. "Degenerate" means
that they all have the same energy &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;.
The operator &lt;math&gt;R_x&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the x-coordinates &lt;math&gt;r_{i,x}&lt;/math&gt;
of all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; electrons in the system, etc.:
:&lt;math&gt;
  R_\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^N r_{i,\alpha}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The oscillator strength is the same for each sub-state &lt;math&gt;|n m_n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

== Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn sum rule ==

To make equations of the previous section applicable to the states belonging to the continuum spectrum, they should be rewritten in terms of matrix elements of the momentum &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{p}&lt;/math&gt;. In absence of magnetic field, the Hamiltonian can be written as &lt;math&gt;H=\frac{1}{2m}\boldsymbol{p}^2+V(\boldsymbol{r})&lt;/math&gt;, and calculating a commutator &lt;math&gt;[H,x]&lt;/math&gt; in the basis of eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; results in the relation between matrix elements
:&lt;math&gt;
  x_{nk}=-\frac{i\hbar/m}{E_n-E_k}(p_x)_{nk}.
&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, calculating matrix elements of a commutator &lt;math&gt;[p_x,x]&lt;/math&gt; in the same basis and eliminating matrix elements of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at
:&lt;math&gt;
  \langle n|[p_x,x]|n\rangle=\frac{2i\hbar}{m}\sum_{k\neq n} \frac{|\langle n|p_x|k\rangle|^2}{E_n-E_k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;[p_x,x]=-i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, the above expression results in a sum rule
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum_{k\neq n}f_{nk}=1,\,\,\,\,\,f_{nk}=-\frac{2}{m}\frac{|\langle n|p_x|k\rangle|^2}{E_n-E_k},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_{nk}&lt;/math&gt; are oscillator strengths for quantum transitions between the states &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. This is the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule, and the term with &lt;math&gt;k=n&lt;/math&gt; has been omitted because in confined systems such as atoms or molecules the diagonal matrix element &lt;math&gt;\langle n|p_x|n\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; due to the time inversion symmetry of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Excluding this term eliminates divergency because of the vanishing denominator.&lt;ref name="CondonShortley1951"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Uhler Condon|author2=G. H. Shortley|title=The Theory of Atomic Spectra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hPyD-Nc_YmgC|accessdate=26 July 2013|year=1951|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-09209-8|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sum rule and electron effective mass in crystals ==

In crystals, energy spectrum of electrons has a [[band structure]] &lt;math&gt;E_n(\boldsymbol{p})&lt;/math&gt;. Near the minimum of an isotropic energy band, electron energy can be expanded in powers of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{p}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;E_n(\boldsymbol{p})=\boldsymbol{p}^2/2m^*&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; is the electron [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]. It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.97.869|title=Motion of Electrons and Holes in Perturbed Periodic Fields|journal=Physical Review|volume=97|issue=4|pages=869|year=1955|last1=Luttinger|first1=J. M.|last2=Kohn|first2=W.|bibcode=1955PhRv...97..869L}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it satisfies the equation
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{2}{m}\sum_{k\neq n}\frac{|\langle n|p_x|k\rangle|^2}{E_k-E_n}+\frac{m}{m^*}=1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the sum runs over all bands with &lt;math&gt;k\neq n&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the ratio &lt;math&gt;m/m^*&lt;/math&gt; of the free electron mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to its effective mass &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; in a crystal can be considered as the oscillator strength for the transition of an electron from the quantum state at the bottom of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; band into the same state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-91116-3_3| chapter=Elektronentheorie der Metalle| title=Aufbau Der Zusammenhängenden Materie| pages=333| year=1933| last1=Sommerfeld| first1=A.| last2=Bethe| first2=H.| isbn=978-3-642-89260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Peter Crawford''' is a [[British people|British]] award-winning, freelance film-maker, author and lecturer. 

Peter Crawford is perhaps best known for his [[natural history]] [[documentary films]] and TV series in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] including, in 1990, the first television series to attempt to comprehensively document North America's wildlife, ''Land of the Eagle'' ([[WNET]] New York) and in 1999; ''Living Britain'' ([[BBC Two|BBC 2]]), a series of ten 30 minute films which portrayed the natural history of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. ''Living Britain'' was accompanied by a book written by Peter Crawford which became a Number 1 Best Seller for BBC Books.

==Career==
Although Peter Crawford is now freelance and specialises in lecturing and writing on Polynesia and the people and wildlife of the [[Pacific Ocean]], he spent most of his career working in the world-renowned [[BBC Natural History Unit]]. Whilst there he was instrumental in bringing, via the television screen, a new-found interest in environmentalism and the relationship of people and the natural world to the living rooms of the United Kingdom.

He pioneered new ways of bringing natural history and environmental issues to wide audiences.  'World Safari' and 'Global Sunrise' highlighted his ambitious style of presentation.

Peter Crawford studied Zoology and Marine Biology at the [[University of Exeter]] in [[England]] and made further studies in Anthropology at the [[University of Mainz]] in [[Germany]]. In 2008, he was appointed Honorary Visiting Professor at his Alma Mater - Exeter University.

[[File:Rae - Water Nymphs (color).png|right|300px|thumb|Potamides with a shepherd, painting by [[Henrietta Rae]], 1909.]]

'''Potamides''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|oʊ|ˈ|t|æ|m|ɪ|ˌ|d|iː|z}};&lt;ref name="Falck-Lebahn"&gt;Falck-Lebahn, Carl (1854);  p 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek: Ποταμίδες)&lt;ref name="SirSmith"&gt;Smith, William (1849); pp 1216-1217.&lt;/ref&gt; were a type of [[water nymph]]s of [[Greco-Roman mythology]]. They were assigned as a class of nymphs of fresh water known as [[naiads]], and as such belonged to a category that presided over rivers and streams.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Black, Charles (1858); p 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and abode==
Potamides were identified by the names associated with the rivers of their origin such as the ''[[Anigrides]]'', ''Ismenides'', ''Amnisiades'', the ''Pactolides'' from the [[Pactolus|Pactolus river]], and the ''Acheloides'' from the [[Achelous river]].&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; However they had their individual names&lt;ref name="SirSmith"/&gt; and also sometimes could be distinguished  by the name of the country in which they inhabited.&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, George (1833).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, J. (1829); pp 581-582.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivers were the domains of potamides as well as of the nymphs ''Fluviales''.&lt;ref name="Carr"&gt;Carr, Thomas Swinburne (1846); pp 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Every creek had its potamide,&lt;ref&gt;Making of America Project (1851); p 393.&lt;/ref&gt; who as local divinities, and like all the naiads,&lt;ref name="SirSmith"/&gt; were daughters of the gods of rivers,&lt;ref name="Heck"&gt;Heck, Johann Georg (1852); p 345.&lt;/ref&gt; also called ''[[Potamoi]]'' deities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Herbert J. (1957); p 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the rivers of the marshy regions are described as having their nymphs; hence no exception was made to the waters of [[Greek underworld]] ruled by god [[Hades]], as was quoted in Latin: "Nymphae infernae paludis and Avernales", which means "swampy ''Avernales'', the infernal nymphs".&lt;ref name="SirSmith"/&gt; And many of these hellish potamides, the ''Avernales'', were believed to be owners of prophetic ability, and to express that gift to their chosen men.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

[[File:Nymphs_Bathing_Place_by_Poynter.jpg|left|upright|thumb| ''The Nymph's Bathing Place'' by [[Edward John Poynter|Edward Poynter]], 1904.]]

==Characteristics and worship==
Like any nymph, potamides were considered subject to mortality but with a long life.&lt;ref name="Falck-Lebahn"/&gt; For the Greek historian [[Plutarch]] their term of life reached about 9720 years,&lt;ref&gt;Lemprière, John (1832); p 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Greek poet [[Hesiod]] there were about three thousand nymphs wandering on the world, and their lives lasted several thousand years.&lt;ref name="Agnes"&gt;Smith, Agnes (1851); p 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potamides showed themselves very favorably inclined to young girls, and gently removed the freckles from all who bathed in their streams. On the other hand, they had an aggressive behavior directed at young men coming near their watery territories, whom they dragged down to their abodes.&lt;ref name="Heck"/&gt; It was believed by the ancients that they carried water for their river parents,&lt;ref name="Heck"/&gt; as was quoted: "In the lonely hour of noon the naiads sat with their water-pitcher at the spring-sending forth from it the warbling brook."&lt;ref name="Carr"/&gt;

Regarded as a profuse class of minor female divinities,&lt;ref&gt;Black, Charles (1858); p 1261.&lt;/ref&gt; they were believed to inspire those that drank of their waters. Thus potamides, and nymphs in general, were conceived to be endowed with oracular power, to inspire men with the same prophetic gift, and to bestow upon them the natural talent of poetry. Hence, as water is a necessity to all the creation, the water nymphs, along with the gods [[Dionysus]] and [[Demeter]], were also worshipped as providing life and blessings to all existing beings, and this attribute is manifested by a diversity of epithets.&lt;ref name="SirSmith"/&gt;

[[File:Nymphes au Bain by Auguste Gaspard Louis Desnoyers.jpg|right|thumb|Potamides in a river. ''Nymphes au bain'' by [[Auguste Gaspard Louis Desnoyers|Auguste G. L. Desnoyers]], 1830.]]

Accordingly, in many parts of Greece, offerings of honey, oil, milk, but never of wine, and sometimes sacrifices of a lamb or goat&lt;ref name="SirSmith"/&gt; were presented to these divinities. In Sicily was commemorated an annual celebration in their honor. Although they had no temples,&lt;ref name="Agnes"/&gt; the most beautiful spots in forests, gardens and so forth, were regarded as the favorite places of nymphs and invisible spirits, and thus esteemed with special veneration.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;

'''Qu Yuan''' ({{circa|lk=no|340}}&amp;ndash;278 BC)&lt;ref name=yfw205/&gt;{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=745}}{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=76}} was a Chinese poet and minister who lived during the [[Warring States period]] of ancient China. He is known for his patriotism and contributions to [[Classical Chinese poetry|classical poetry and verses]], especially through the poems of the ''[[Chu Ci]]'' anthology (also known as ''The Songs of the South'' or ''Songs of Chu''): a volume of poems attributed to or considered to be inspired by his [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] writing. Together with the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'', the ''Chu Ci'' is one of the two greatest collections of ancient Chinese verse. He is also remembered in connection to the supposed origin of the [[Dragon Boat Festival]].

Historical details about Qu Yuan's life are few, and his authorship of many ''Chu Ci'' poems has been questioned at length.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao Kuifu 趙逵夫, "''Riben xin de ''Qu Yuan fouding lun'' Chansheng de Lishi Beijing yu Sixiang Genyuan Chutan''" 日本新的 “屈原否定論” 產生的歷史背景與思想根源初探, in ''Fuyin Baokan Ziliao, Zhongguo Gudai Jindai Wenxue Yanjiu'' 複印報刊資料，中國古代近代文學研究, (1995: 10): 89–93.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is widely accepted to have written ''[[Li Sao]]'', the most well-known of the ''Chu Ci'' poems. The first known reference to Qu Yuan appears in a poem written in 174 BC by [[Jia Yi]], an official from [[Luoyang]] who was slandered by jealous officials and banished to [[Changsha]] by [[Emperor Wen of Han]]. While traveling, he wrote a poem describing the similar fate of a previous "Qu Yuan."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Ban Gu]]'s ''Book of Han'' biography of Jia Yi 《漢書·賈誼傳》, also appears in ''[[Wen Xuan|Wenxuan]]'', "Diào Qū Yuán fù" 弔屈原賦.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty years later, the first known biography of Qu Yuan's life appeared in [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', though it contains a number of contradictory details.{{sfnp|Hawkes|1959|p=52}}

{{anchor|Biography|Legend|History}}
==Life==
[[Sima Qian]]'s biography of Qu Yuan in the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji)]]'', though circumstantial and probably influenced greatly by Sima's own identification with Qu,&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes (1959), 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; is the only source of information on Qu's life.{{sfnp|Hartman|1986|p=352}} Sima wrote that Qu was a member of the [[Mi (surname)|Chu royal clan]] and served as an official under [[King Huai of Chu]] (reigned 328–299 BC).

During the early days of King Huai's reign, Qu Yuan was serving the State of Chu as its Left Minister.&lt;ref name=yfw205&gt;{{harvp|CUHK|2007|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA205 205]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, King Huai exiled Qu Yuan to the region north of the [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]], because corrupt ministers slandered him and influenced the king.&lt;ref name=yfw205/&gt; Eventually, Qu Yuan was reinstated and sent on a diplomatic mission to the State of Qi.&lt;ref name=yfw206&gt;{{harvp|CUHK|2007|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA206 206]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to resume relations between Chu and Qi, which King Huai had broken under the false pretense of [[King Huiwen of Qin|King Hui of Qin]] to cede territory near Shangyu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|CUHK|2007|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&amp;pg=PA205 205–6]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[King Qingxiang of Chu|King Qingxiang]]'s reign, Prime Minister Zilan slandered Qu Yuan.&lt;ref name=yfw206 /&gt; This caused Qu Yuan's exile to the regions south of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]].&lt;ref name=yfw206/&gt; It is said that Qu Yuan returned first to his home town. In his [[exile]], he spent much of this time collecting legends and rearranging folk odes while traveling the countryside. Furthermore, he wrote some of the greatest poetry in [[Chinese literature]] and expressed deep concerns about his state.&lt;ref name=yfw206/&gt; According to legend, his anxiety brought him to an increasingly troubled state of health. During his depression, he would often take walks near a certain well to look upon his thin and gaunt reflection in the water. This well became known as the "Face Reflection Well." On a hillside in Xiangluping (at present-day [[Zigui County]], [[Hubei]] Province), there is a well that is considered to be the original well from the time of Qu Yuan.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

In 278 BC, learning of the capture of his country's capital, [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]], by General [[Bai Qi]] of the [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]], Qu Yuan is said to have collected folktales and written the lengthy poem of lamentation called "[[Lament for Ying]]". Eventually, he [[suicide in China|committed suicide]] by wading into the [[Miluo River]] in today's [[Hubei]] Province while holding a rock. The reason why he took his life remained controversial and was argued by Chinese scholars for centuries. Typical explanations including martyrdom for his deeply beloved but falling motherland, which was suggested by the philosopher [[Zhu Xi]] of Song Dynasty, or feeling extreme despair to the situation of the politics in Chu while his lifelong political dream would never be realized. But according to [[Yu Fu]], widely considered to be written by Qu himself or at least, a person who was very familiar with Qu, his suicide was an ultimate way to protect his innocence and life principles.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

==Legacy==
[[File:元 佚名 倣趙孟頫 九歌圖 冊-Nine Songs MET DP375119.jpg|thumb|Qu Yuan as depicted in the ''[[Jiu Ge|Nine Songs]]'', imprint of presumably the 14th century]]
Qu Yuan is regarded as the first author of verse in China to have his name associated to his work, since prior to that time, poetic works were not attributed to any specific authors. He is considered to have initiated the so-called ''sao'' style of verse, which is named after his work ''[[Li Sao]]'', in which he abandoned the classic four-character verses used in poems of ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' and adopted verses with varying lengths. This resulted in poems with more rhythm and latitude in expression. Qu Yuan is also regarded as one of the most prominent figures of [[Romanticism]] in Chinese classical literature, and his masterpieces influenced some of the greatest Romanticist poets in Tang Dynasty such as [[Li Bai]]. During the [[Han Dynasty]], Qu Yuan became established as a heroic example of how a scholar and official who was denied public recognition suitable to their worth should behave.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Davis, xlvii&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Chu Ci''===
{{Main|Chu Ci}}
Chu was located in what is now the [[Yangtze|Yangzi River]] area of central [[China]]. At this time, Chu represented the southern fringe of the Chinese cultural area, having for a time been part of both the [[Shang dynasty]] and the [[Zhou dynasty]] empires; however, the Chu culture also retained certain characteristics of local traditions such as [[shamanism]], the influence of which can be seen in the ''Chu Ci''.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chu Ci'' was compiled and annotated by Wang Yi (died AD 158), which is the source of transmission of these poems and any reliable information about them to subsequent times; thus, the role which Qu Yuan had in the authoring, editing, or retouching of these works remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Yip, 54&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chu Ci'' poems are important as being direct precursors of the ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu style]]'' of Han Dynasty literature.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, xlviii&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chu Ci'', as a preservation of early literature, has provided invaluable data for linguistic research into the history of the Chinese language, from [[Chen Di]] on.

===Religion===
Following his suicide, Qu Yuan was sometimes revered as a [[List of water deities|water god]], including by [[Religion in Taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[Taoism|Taoists]], who number him among the [[Shuixian Zunwang|Kings of the Water Immortals]].&lt;ref name=grandma&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.tainanmazu.org.tw/grand_shuexian.html |contribution=Shuexian Deities |url=http://www.tainanmazu.org.tw/ |title=''Official site'' |location=Tainan |publisher=[[Grand Matsu Temple]] |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patriotism===

Qu Yuan began to be treated in a [[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] way as "China's first [[patriotism|patriotic]] poet" during [[Second Sino-Japanese War|World War II]].&lt;ref name=hawkeye&gt;{{harvp|Hawkes|1974|p=[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=wvrnFgUnn-MC&amp;pg=PA42 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wen Yiduo]]—a socialist poet and scholar later executed by the [[Kuomintang|KMT]]—wrote in his ''Mythology &amp; Poetry'' that, "although Qu Yuan did not write about the life of the people or voice their sufferings, he may truthfully be said to have acted as the leader of a people's revolution and to have struck a blow to avenge them. Qu Yuan is the only person in the whole of Chinese history who is fully entitled to be called 'the people's poet'."{{sfnp|Wen|1956}} [[Guo Moruo]]'s 1942 [[Theatre of China|play]] ''Qu Yuan''{{sfnp|Guo|1952}} gave him similar treatment, drawing parallels to ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref name=hawkeye/&gt; Their view of Qu's social idealism and unbending patriotism became canonical under the [[People's Republic of China]] after the 1949 [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=hawkeye/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; For example, one high-school Chinese textbook from 1957 began with the sentence "Qu Yuan was the first great patriotic poet in the history of our country's literature".{{sfnp|Zhang|1957}} This cult status increased Qu Yuan's position within China's literary canon, seeing him placed on [[Postage stamps and postal history of China|postage stamps]] since the 1950s{{fact|date=December 2017}} and the [[Dragon Boat Festival]] elevated to a [[Public holidays in China|national holiday]] in 2005. It has, however, come at the expense of more the critical scholarly appraisals of Qu Yuan's historicity and alleged body of work that had developed during the late [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] and [[Republic of China (1911-1949)|early Republic]].&lt;ref name=hawkeye/&gt;

===Dragon Boat Festival===
[[File:VM 3852 Singapore - Qu Yuan in a dragon boat.jpg|thumb|Statue of Qu Yuan on a [[dragon boat]], on display for the [[Dragon Boat Festival]], in [[Singapore]]]]
{{main|Dragon Boat Festival}}
Popular legend has it that villagers carried their dumplings and boats to the middle of the river and desperately tried to save Qu Yuan after he immersed himself in the Miluo but were too late to do so. However, in order to keep fish and evil spirits away from his body, they beat drums and splashed the water with their paddles, and they also threw rice into the water both as a food offering to Qu Yuan's spirit and also to distract the fish away from his body. However, the legend continues, that late one night, the spirit of Qu Yuan appeared before his friends and told them that he died because he had taken himself under the river. Then, he asked his friends to wrap their rice into three-cornered silk packages to ward off the dragon.

These packages became a traditional food known as ''[[zongzi]]'', although the lumps of rice are now wrapped in leaves instead of silk. The act of racing to search for his body in boats gradually became the cultural tradition of [[dragon boat]] racing, held on the anniversary of his death every year. Today, people still eat ''zongzi'' and participate in dragon boat races to commemorate Qu Yuan's sacrifice on the fifth day of the fifth month of the traditional lunisolar [[Chinese calendar]]. The countries around China, such as Vietnam and Korea, also celebrate variations of this [[Dragon Boat Festival]] as part of their [[East Asian cultural sphere|shared cultural heritage]].{{fact|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5455">The '''Ramsauer–Townsend effect''', also sometimes called the '''Ramsauer effect''' or the '''Townsend effect''', is a physical phenomenon involving the [[scattering]] of low-energy [[electron]]s by [[atom]]s of a [[noble gas]]. Since its explanation requires the [[Wave–particle duality|wave theory]] of [[quantum mechanics]], it demonstrates the need for physical theories more sophisticated than those of [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]].

== Definitions ==
When an electron moves through a gas, its interactions with the gas atoms cause scattering to occur. These interactions are classified as ''[[Elasticity (physics)|inelastic]]'' if they cause [[excited state|excitation]] or [[ion]]ization of the atom to occur and ''elastic'' if they do not.

The ''probability of scattering'' in such a system is defined as the number of electrons scattered, per unit electron current, per unit path length, per unit pressure at 0&amp;nbsp;°C, per unit [[solid angle]]. The ''number of collisions'' equals the total number of electrons scattered elastically and inelastically in all angles, and the ''probability of collision'' is the total number of collisions, per unit electron current, per unit path length, per unit pressure at 0&amp;nbsp;°C.

Because noble gas atoms have a relatively high [[Ionization energy|first ionization energy]] and the electrons do not carry enough energy to cause excited electronic states, ionization and excitation of the atom are unlikely, and the probability of elastic scattering over all angles is approximately equal to the probability of collision.

== Description ==
The effect is named for [[Carl Ramsauer]] (1879-1955) and [[John Sealy Townsend]] (1868-1957), who each independently studied the collisions between atoms and low-energy electrons in the early 1920s.

If one tries to predict the probability of collision with a classical model that treats the electron and atom as hard spheres, one finds that the probability of collision should be independent of the incident electron energy (see Kukolich). However, Ramsauer and Townsend observed that for slow-moving electrons in argon, krypton, or xenon, the probability of collision between the electrons and gas atoms obtains a minimum value for electrons with a certain amount of kinetic energy (about 1 electron volts for xenon gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramsauer-Townsend effect|url=http://www.hep.wisc.edu/~prepost/407/ramsauer/ramsauer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This is the Ramsauer–Townsend effect.

No good explanation for the phenomenon existed until the introduction of quantum mechanics, which explains that the effect results from the wave-like properties of the electron. A simple model of the collision that makes use of wave theory can predict the existence of the Ramsauer-Townsend minimum. Bohm presents one such model that considers the atom as a finite square [[potential well]].

Predicting from theory the kinetic energy that will produce a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum is quite complicated since the problem involves understanding the wave nature of particles. However, the problem has been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically and is well understood (see Johnson and Guet).

In 1970 Gryzinski has proposed classical explanation of Ramsauer effect&lt;ref name=Gryz&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.24.45 M. Gryziński, ''Ramsauer Effect as a Result of the Dynamic Structure of the Atomic Shell''], Phys. Rev. Lett., 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; using effective picture of atom as oscillating multipole of electric field (dipole, quadrupole, octupole), which was a consequence of his [[free-fall atomic model]].

The '''shadow blister effect''' is a visual effect whereby adjacent [[shadow]]s appear to bulge (or blister) towards one another when cast by one or more non-point light sources.  It is the result of overlapping shadow [[penumbra]] on the surface and the perception by the brain of a contrast barrier formed by the merging of the penumbra.  The visual effect is proportionate to the distance of the obstructions to the shadow surface (as the [[penumbras]] become larger), as well as the angular diameter of the light source(s).  Penumbras can be easily demonstrated using Ray Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApOpt..38.1573L - Ray Theory Analysis of the Shadow Blister Effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect is commonly visible on Earth by shadows cast by the sun.  A common example is the shadows of leaves on the ground which are fuzzy and seem to bulge to one another, however any two objects held at an average human's height from the ground can produce this effect.

The appearance of the shadow blister may be more striking as the mind perceives a contrast line within the linear distribution of light within the penumbra (the shadow's blister).

'''Silly Putty''' is a [[toy]] based on [[silicone]] [[polymer]]s that have unusual physical properties. It bounces, but it breaks when given a sharp blow, and it can also flow like a liquid. It contains a [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] liquid silicone, a type of [[non-Newtonian fluid]], which makes it act as a viscous liquid over a long time period but as an elastic solid over a short time period. It was originally created during research into potential [[natural rubber|rubber]] substitutes for use by the United States in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=A Successful Failure|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=2015|volume=1|issue=2|pages=8–9|publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]]|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/a-successful-failure|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Earl L.

==Description==
[[File:Sillyputty.ogv|thumb|right|250px|Video showing Silly Putty bouncing]]

As a bouncing [[putty]], Silly Putty is noted for its unusual characteristics: it bounces but breaks when given a sharp blow; it can also float in a liquid and will form a [[puddle]] given enough time. Silly Putty and most other retail putty products have [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] agents added to reduce the flow and enable the putty to hold its shape.&lt;ref name=Thayer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thayer|first1=Ann|title=What's That Stuff?

The original coral-colored Silly Putty is composed of 65% [[Siloxane|dimethylsiloxane]] ([[hydroxyl|hydroxy]]-terminated polymers with [[boric acid]]), 17% [[silicon dioxide|silica]] (crystalline quartz), 9% Thixatrol ST ([[castor oil]] derivative), 4% [[polydimethylsiloxane]], 1% decamethyl [[cyclopentasiloxane]], 1% [[glycerol|glycerine]], and 1% [[titanium dioxide]].&lt;ref name=Bouncing&gt;{{cite web|title=The Synthesis of Bouncing Putty|url=http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/ch462/BouncingPutty.htm|publisher=[[Western Oregon University]]|accessdate=27 February 2015|quote=See patent pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silly putty dripping.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Silly Putty flowing through a hole]]

Silly Putty's unusual flow characteristics are due to the ingredient [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS), a [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] substance. Viscoelasticity is a type of [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian flow]], characterizing material that acts as a [[viscosity|viscous]] [[liquid]] over a long time period but as an [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[solid]] over a short time period.&lt;ref name=Clegg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clegg|first1=Brian|title=Polydimethylsiloxane|journal=Chemistry World|date=22 July 2015 |url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2015/07/polydimethylsiloxane-pdms-silly-putty-podcast|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because its apparent viscosity increases directly with respect to the amount of force applied, Silly Putty can be characterized as a [[dilatant]] fluid.&lt;ref name=Thayer/&gt;

Silly [[Putty]] is also a fairly good [[adhesive]]. When [[newspaper]] ink was petroleum based, Silly Putty could be used to transfer newspaper images to other surfaces, providing amusement by distorting the transferred image afterwards. Newer papers with soy-based inks are more resistant to this process.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holmes|first1=Owen|title=Silly Putty Doesn't Work Anymore|url=http://www.altweeklies.com/aan/silly-putty-doesnt-work-anymore/Story?oid=168408|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=Folio Weekly|date=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, Silly Putty is difficult to remove from textured items such as hair and clothing. Hand sanitizers containing alcohol are often helpful. Silly Putty will dissolve when in contact with an alcohol; after the alcohol evaporates, the material will not exhibit its original properties.&lt;ref name=HowStuffWorks&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Get Silly Putty Out Of Clothes|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/how-to-get-silly-putty-out-of-clothes.htm|accessdate=30 September 2015|website=HowStuffWorks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maker, Crayola, suggests [[WD-40]].&lt;ref name=Crayola&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you have stain removal information for Silly Putty on fabric?|url=http://www.crayola.com/faq/stain-removal-tips/do-you-have-stain-removal-information-for-silly-putty-on-fabric/|website=Crayola|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Silly Putty is submerged in warm or hot water, it will become softer and thus "melt" much faster. It also becomes harder to remove small amounts of it from surfaces. After a long period of time, it will return to its original viscosity.&lt;ref name=Bouncing/&gt;

Silly Putty is sold as a {{Convert|13|g|oz|adj=on|abbr=on}} piece of clay inside an egg-shaped plastic container. The Silly Putty brand is owned by Crayola LLC (formerly the Binney &amp; Smith company). {{As of|July 2009}}, twenty thousand eggs of Silly Putty are sold daily. Since 1950, more than 300 million eggs of Silly Putty (approximately {{Convert|4500|ST|t|disp=or}}) have been sold.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Silly Putty History|url=http://www2.crayola.com/mediacenter/index.cfm?display=press_release&amp;news_id=164|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603053016/http://www.crayola.com/mediacenter/index.cfm?display=press_release&amp;news_id=164|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 3, 2008|publisher=Crayola LLC|accessdate=March 28, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in various colors, including [[Phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] and metallic. Other brands offer similar materials, sometimes in larger-sized containers, and in a similarly wide variety of colors or with different properties, such as magnetism and [[iridescence]].

==History==
During World War II, [[Japan]] invaded rubber-producing countries as it expanded its [[sphere of influence]] in the [[Pacific Rim]]. Rubber was vital for the production of [[raft]]s, [[tire]]s, [[Automobile|vehicle]] and [[aircraft]] parts, [[gas mask]]s, and [[boot]]s. In the US, all rubber products were rationed; citizens were encouraged to make their rubber products last until the end of the war and to donate spare tires, boots, and coats. Meanwhile, the government funded research into synthetic rubber compounds to attempt to solve this shortage.&lt;ref name="official history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sillyputty.com/history_101/timeline/timeline.htm|title=Silly Putty Timeline|publisher=Binney &amp; Smith |accessdate= 2009-10-21 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422021613/http://www.sillyputty.com/history_101/timeline/timeline.htm |archivedate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-toxic putty would bounce when dropped, could stretch farther than regular rubber, would not go moldy, and had a very high melting temperature. However, the substance did not have all the properties needed to replace rubber.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

In 1949, toy store owner Ruth Fallgatter came across the putty. She contacted marketing consultant Peter C.L. Hodgson (1912–1976).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sillyputtyhistory.blogspot.com/2011/01/blog-post.html sillyputtyhistory.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The two decided to market the bouncing putty by selling it in a clear case. Although it sold well, Fallgatter did not pursue it further. However, Hodgson saw its potential.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;&lt;ref name= Thayer /&gt;

Already US$12,000 in debt, Hodgson borrowed US$147 to buy a batch of the putty to pack {{Convert|1|oz|g|adj=on|abbr=on}} portions into plastic eggs for US$1, calling it Silly Putty. Initially, sales were poor, but after a ''New Yorker'' article mentioned it, Hodgson sold over 250,000 eggs of silly putty in three days.&lt;ref name=Thayer/&gt; However, Hodgson was almost put out of business in 1951 by the [[Korean War]]. Silicone, the main ingredient in silly putty, was put on ration, harming his business. A year later, the restriction on silicone was lifted and the production of Silly Putty resumed.&lt;ref name=Nowak&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nowak|first1=Peter|title=Sex, bombs, and burgers : how war, pornography, and fast food have shaped modern technology| date= 2011| publisher=Lyons Press|location=Guilford, Connecticut|isbn=9780762772742|pages=115–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9uRQzJRRcEC&amp;pg=PA115|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603121954/https://books.google.com/books?id=h9uRQzJRRcEC&amp;pg=PA115|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-06-03|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Initially, it was primarily targeted towards adults. However, by 1955, the majority of its customers were aged 6 to 12. In 1957, Hodgson produced the first televised commercial for Silly Putty, which aired during the ''[[Howdy Doody|Howdy Doody Show]]''.&lt;ref name=Sunshine&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sunshine|first1=Linda|title=101 uses for Silly Putty |date= 1990| publisher= Andrews and McMeel|location=Kansas City|isbn=9780836218633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Silly Putty went worldwide, becoming a hit in the [[Soviet Union]] and Europe. In 1968, it was taken into [[lunar orbit]] by the [[Apollo 8]] astronauts.&lt;ref name=Nowak/&gt;

Peter Hodgson died in 1976. A year later, Binney &amp; Smith, the makers of Crayola products, acquired the rights to Silly Putty. {{As of|2005}}, annual Silly Putty sales exceeded six million eggs.&lt;ref name=Sterngass&gt;{{cite book |last1 =Sterngass| first1= Jon| last2= Kachur| first2= Matthew |title= Plastics|date=2005|publisher=World Almanac Library|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin |isbn= 978-0836858785| pages= 33–34| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYkfVfNXIGIC&amp;pg=PA34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
In addition to its success as a toy, other uses for the putty have been found. In the home, it can be used to remove substances such as dirt, lint, pet hair, or ink from various surfaces. The material's unique properties have found niche use in medical and scientific applications.

{{Earthquakes}}
A '''submarine''', '''undersea''', or '''underwater earthquake''' is an [[earthquake]] that occurs [[underwater]] at the [[seabed|bottom]] of a [[body of water]], especially an [[ocean]]. They are the leading cause of [[tsunami]]s. The magnitude can be measured scientifically by the use of the [[moment magnitude scale]] and the intensity can be assigned using the [[Mercalli intensity scale]].

Understanding [[plate tectonics]] helps to explain the cause of submarine earthquakes. The Earth's surface or [[lithosphere]] comprises tectonic plates which average approximately 50 miles in thickness, and are continuously moving very slowly upon a bed of magma in the [[asthenosphere]] and inner [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. The plates converge upon one another, and one subducts below the other, or, where there is only shear stress, move horizontally past each other (see [[#Transform plate boundary|transform plate boundary]] below). Little movements called  [[fault creep]] are minor and not measurable. The plates meet with each other, and if rough spots cause the movement to stop at the edges, the motion of the plates continue. When the rough spots can no longer hold, the sudden release of the built-up motion releases, and the sudden movement under the sea floor causes a submarine earthquake. This area of slippage both horizontally and vertically is called the [[epicenter]], and has the highest magnitude, and causes the greatest damage.

As with a [[continent]]al earthquake the severity of the damage is not often caused by the earthquake at the rift zone, but rather by events which are triggered by the earthquake. Where a continental earthquake will cause damage and loss of life on land from fires, damaged structures, and flying objects; a submarine earthquake alters the [[seabed]], resulting in a series of waves, and depending on the length and magnitude of the earthquake, [[tsunami]], which bear down on coastal cities causing property damage and loss of life.

Submarine earthquakes can also damage [[submarine communications cable]]s, leading to widespread disruption of the [[Internet]] and [[PSTN|international telephone network]] in those areas. This is particularly common in Asia, where many submarine links cross submarine earthquake zones such as the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

==Tectonic plate boundaries==

[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|Tectonic plate boundaries, showing the directions of plate movements.]]
[[Image:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|Different kinds of boundaries]]
The different ways in which tectonic plates rub against each other under the ocean or sea floor to create submarine earthquakes. The type of friction created may be due to the characteristic of the [[Fault (geology)|geologic fault]] or the plate boundary as follows. Some of the main areas of large tsunami producing submarine earthquakes are the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] and the [[Great Sumatran fault]].

===Convergent plate boundary===
{{main article|Convergent boundary}}
The older, and denser plate moves below the lighter plate. The further down it moves, the hotter it becomes, until finally melting altogether at the [[asthenosphere]] and inner mantle and the crust is actually destroyed. The location where the two oceanic plates [[Convergent boundary|actually meet]] become deeper and deeper creating trenches with each successive action. There is an interplay of various densities of lithosphere rock, asthenosphere magma, cooling ocean water and plate movement for example the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Therefore, the site of the sub [[oceanic trench]] will be a site of submarine earthquakes; for example the [[Mariana Trench]], [[Puerto Rico Trench]], and the [[volcanic arc]] along the [[Great Sumatran fault]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/nsta/convergent-plate-boundaries.shtml Convergent Plate Boundaries - Convergent Boundary - Geology.com] URL accessed January 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transform plate boundary===
{{main article|Transform fault}}
A transform-fault boundary, or simply a [[transform boundary]] is where two plates will slide past each other, and the irregular pattern of their edges may catch on each other. The lithosphere is neither added to from the asthenosphere nor is it destroyed as in convergent plate action. For example, along the [[San Andreas fault]] [[Geologic fault#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] fault zone, the Pacific Tectonic Plate has been moving along at about 5&amp;nbsp;cm/yr in a northwesterly direction, whereas the North American Plate is moving south-easterly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html Understanding plate motions [This Dynamic Earth, USGS]URL accessed January 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divergent plate boundary===
{{main article|Divergent boundary}}
Rising convection currents occur where two plates are moving away from each other. In the [[Seafloor spreading|gap]], thus produced hot magma rises up, meets the cooler sea water, cools, and solidifies, attaching to either or both tectonic plate edges creating an [[oceanic spreading ridge]]. When the fissure again appears, again magma will rise up, and form new lithosphere crust. If the weakness between the two plates allows the heat and pressure of the asthenosphere to build over a large amount of time, a large quantity of magma will be released pushing up on the plate edges and the magma will solidify under the newly raised plate edges, see formation of a [[submarine volcano]]. If the fissure is able to come apart because of the two plates moving apart, in a sudden movement, an earthquake tremor may be felt for example at the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] between [[North America]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/nsta/divergent-plate-boundaries.shtml Divergent Plate Boundaries - Divergent Boundary - Geology.com] URL accessed January 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3271">A '''Sverdrup wave''' (also known as Poincaré wave, or rotational gravity wave &lt;ref name="kundu"&gt;Kundu, P. K., and L. M. Cohen. "Fluid mechanics, 638 pp." Academic, Calif (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a wave in the ocean, which is affected by gravity and Earth's rotation (see [[Coriolis effect]]).

For a non-rotating fluid, shallow water waves are affected only by gravity (see [[Gravity wave]]), where the [[phase velocity]] of shallow water gravity wave (''c'') can be noted as 
: &lt;math&gt;c = (gH)^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;

and the group velocity (''c''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) of shallow water gravity wave can be noted as
: &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm{g}=(gH)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;c=c_\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is gravity, ''λ'' is the [[wavelength]] and ''H'' is the total depth.

== Derivation ==
When the fluid is rotating, gravity waves with a long enough wavelength (discussed below) will also be affected by rotational forces. The linearized, shallow-water equations with a constant rotation rate, ''f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', are &lt;ref name="vallis"&gt;Vallis, Geoffrey K. Atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics: fundamentals and large-scale circulation. Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - f_0v = -g\frac{\partial h}{\partial x},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + f_0u = -g\frac{\partial h}{\partial y},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + H(u_x+v_y) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' and ''v'' are the horizontal velocities and ''h'' is the instantaneous height of the free surface. Using Fourier analysis, these equations can be combined to find the [[dispersion relation]] for Sverdrup waves:
: &lt;math&gt; \omega^2 = f_0^2 + gH(k^2 + l^2), &lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' and ''l'' are the wavenumbers associated with the horizontal and vertical directions, and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of oscillation.

== Limiting Cases ==
There are two primary modes of interest when considering Poincaré waves:&lt;ref name="kundu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vallis" /&gt;
* Short wave limit
: &lt;math&gt; (k^2 + l^2) \gg \frac{f_0^2}{gH} \qquad \textrm{or} \qquad (k^2+l^2) \gg L_D^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt; L_D  = \frac{(gH)^{1/2}}{f_0} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Rossby radius of deformation]]. In this limit, the dispersion relation reduces to the solution for a non-rotating gravity wave.
* Long wave limit
: &lt;math&gt; (k^2 + l^2) \ll \frac{f_0^2}{gH} \qquad \textrm{or} \qquad (k^2+l^2) \ll L_D^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;
which looks like inertial oscillations driven purely by rotational forces.

=== Solution for the one-dimensional case ===
For a wave traveling in one direction (&lt;math&gt; l = 0 &lt;/math&gt;), the horizontal velocities are found to be equal to
: &lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\omega}{kH}H_0cos(kx-\omega t) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; v = \frac{f_0}{kH}H_0sin(kx-\omega t). &lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the inclusion of rotation will cause the wave to develop oscillations at 90° to the wave propagation at the opposite phase. In general, these are elliptical orbits that depend on the relative strength of gravity and rotation. In the long wave limit, these are circular orbits characterized by inertial oscillations.

'''The Breadknife''' is a [[Dike (geology)|volcanic dyke]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia. It is nearly 90&amp;nbsp;metres high,&lt;ref name="wac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/travel/destinations/2014/05/warrumbungles-a-climbers-paradise |title=Warrumbungles: a climber's paradise |author=Ken Eastwood |date=9 May 2014 |work=Australian Geographic |publisher= |accessdate=25 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but often is only 4&amp;nbsp;m wide, which is particularly rare. The Breadknife was part of a large [[shield volcano]], that first erupted about 17&amp;nbsp;million years ago and stopped about 13&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="goa"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Geology of Australia |last=David |first=Johnson |year=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521767415 |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSIbLENyT2wC |accessdate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of [[Peralkaline rock|peralkaline]] [[trachyte]].&lt;ref name="ivieaanz"/&gt;

Nearby volcanic remnants include the Belougery Spire, Belougery Split Rock, Crater Bluff, Bluff Mountain and Mount Exmouth. A network of walking tracks are used to access the steep mountains and ridges surrounding the dyke. The shortest walk completely around the Breadknife is hard and steep, taking roughly five&amp;nbsp;hours to complete.

==Origins==
A huge shield-shaped volcano formed as volcanic explosions occurred over millions of years.  This shield volcano rose about 1,000&amp;nbsp;m and is now largely eroded, forming the [[Warrumbungles]].&lt;ref name="ivieaanz"&gt;{{cite book |title=Intraplate Volcanism in Eastern Australia and New Zealand |last=Duggan |first=M B |chapter=Northern New South Wales: Warrumbungle |year=1989 |editor1-last=Johnson |editor1-first=R.

When the magma solidified and became harder than the soft rock, erosion exposed a dyke.  

==In popular culture==
The village in the Animated series [[Adventures of the Little Koala]] took place within the shadow of the Breadknife.

'''The budgetary rule'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftenbladet.no/energi/aenergy/Record-oil-revenues-2558183.html#.Ufei3m08l8o&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-no|handlingsregelen}}) is a rule concerning the usage of [[capital gain]]s from [[The Government Pension Fund of Norway#The Government Pension Fund – Global|The Government Pension Fund - Global]] of [[Norway]]. The rule states that a maximum of 3% of the fund's value should be allocated to the yearly [[government budget]]. Its main stated justification is to avoid the [[Dutch disease]] in the Norwegian economy due to the large influx of oil-sourced revenue. 

The rule was introduced in 2001 during the [[First cabinet Stoltenberg|First cabinet]] [[Jens Stoltenberg|Stoltenberg]], and has a broad cross-party support. 

The rule was last changed from 4% to 3% february 2017. Every party in the parliament was in favour of the change, except the right wing [[Progress Party (Norway)]].

'''Trindade and Martin Vaz'''&lt;ref&gt;National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Web: http://geonames.nga.mil/namesgaz/&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-pt|Trindade e Martim Vaz}}, {{IPA-pt|tɾĩˈdadʒi i mɐʁˈtʃĩ ˈvas|pron}}) is an [[archipelago]] located in the Southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] about {{convert|1,100|km|mi|abbr=off}} east of the coast of [[Espírito Santo]], [[Brazil]], which it constitutes a part of. The archipelago has a total area of {{convert|10.4|km2|1|abbr=off}} and a population of 32 ([[Brazilian Navy]] personnel).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The archipelago consists of five islands and several rocks and stacks; Trindade is the largest island, with an area of {{convert|10.1|km2|1|abbr=off}}; about {{convert|49|km|mi|abbr=off}} east of it are the tiny Martin Vaz islets, with a total area of {{convert|0.3|km2|ha|1|lk=out|abbr=off}}  .

The islands are of [[Volcano|volcanic]] origin and have rugged terrain. They are largely barren, except for the southern part of Trindade. They were discovered in 1502 by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Estêvão da Gama (c. 1470)|Estêvão da Gama]] and stayed Portuguese until they became part of Brazil at its [[Independence of Brazil|independence in 1822]]. From 1895 to 1896, Trindade was occupied by the [[United Kingdom]] until an agreement with Brazil was reached. During the period of British occupation, Trindade was known as "South Trinidad."

The islands are situated some {{convert|2,100|km|mi|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Ascension Island]] and {{convert|2,550|km|mi|abbr=off}} west of [[Saint Helena]], while the distance to the west coast of [[Africa]] is {{convert|4,270|km|mi|abbr=off}}.

==Geography==
The individual islands with their respective locations are given in the following:

*'''Ilha da Trindade''' (Portuguese for "Trinity Island") ({{coord|20|31|30|S|29|19|30|W|region:BR-ES_type:isle}})
*'''Ilhas de Martim Vaz''' ({{coord|20|30|00|S|28|51|00|W|region:BR-ES_type:isle}})
**'''Ilha do Norte''' ("North Island"), {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=off}} north-northwest of Ilha da Racha, {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=off}} high. ({{coord|20|30|00|S|28|51|00|W|region:BR-ES_type:isle}})
**'''Ilha da Racha''' ("Crack Island") or '''Ilha Martim Vaz''', the largest, {{convert|175|m|ft|abbr=off}} high near the northwest end. The shores are strewn with boulders. ({{coord|20|30|18|S|29|20|42|W|region:BR-ES_type:isle}})
**'''Rochedo da Agulha''' ("Needle Rock"), a flat circular rock {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=off}} northwest of Ilha da Racha, is {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off}} high.
**'''Ilha do Sul''' ("South Island"), {{convert|1,600|m|ft|abbr=off}} south of Ilha da Racha, is a rocky pinnacle. Ilha do Sul is the easternmost point of Brazil. ({{coord|20|31|00|S|28|51|00|W|region:BR-ES_type:isle}})

=== Trindade ===
[[File:Martin Vaz.png|thumb|left|NASA satellite imagery of Martin Vaz Islands in [[False-color|pseudo-color]].]]
The small island of '''Trindade''', with an area of 10.3&amp;nbsp;km², lies at the eastern end of an E-W-trending chain of [[submarine volcanoes]] and [[guyot]]s extending about 1,000&amp;nbsp;km (620&amp;nbsp;mi) from the continental shelf off the Brazilian coast. The island lies more than halfway between Brazil and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] near the eastern end of the submarine [[Vitória-Trindade Ridge]].

Trindade is a mountainous, desiccated volcanic island with numerous phonolitic lava domes and steep-sided volcanic plugs. The highest summit is Pico Desejado, near the center, {{convert|620|m|ft|abbr=off}} high. Nearby to the northwest are Pico da Trindade ({{convert|590|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and Pico Bonifácio ({{convert|570|m|ft|abbr=on}}). Pico Monumento, a remarkable peak in the form of a slightly inclined cylinder, rises from the west coast to {{convert|270|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The youngest volcanism, at Vulcão do Paredão ({{convert|217|m|ft|abbr=on}}) on the southeast tip of the island, constructed a [[pyroclastic flows|pyroclastic]] cone with lava flows that are no older than the [[Holocene]] (Almeida, 1961). Remnants of the crater of the {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} cinder cone are still preserved. Lava flows traveled from the cone to the north, where they formed an irregular shoreline and offshore islands. Smaller volcanic centers of the latest volcanic stage are found in the Morro Vermelho ({{convert|515|m|ft|abbr=on}}) area in the south-central part of the island.

Until 1850, the island was covered 85% of its length by a forest of ''[[Colubrina]] glandulosa'' trees, 15m in height and 40 cm trunk diameter. The introduction of non-native animals like goats, pigs, sheep, etc. and the indiscriminate cutting of trees led to total [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of the same, causing heavy erosion throughout the island with a loss of about 1 to 2 meter of fertile soils. The effect of this devastation impaired the flow of water streams, with the depletion of several springs.

There is a small settlement in the north on the shore of a cove called Enseada dos Portugueses, supporting a garrison of the Brazilian Navy, 32 strong.

The archipelago is the main nesting site of the [[green sea turtle]] in Brazil. There are also large numbers of breeding seabirds, including the endemic subspecies of the [[Great frigatebird]] (''Fregata minor nicolli'') and [[Lesser frigatebird]] (''F. ariel trinitatis''), and it is only Atlantic breeding site for the [[Trindade petrel]].&lt;ref&gt;Fund, W. 2014.

== History ==
{{ref-improve|date=June 2017}}
=== 16th to 18th century ===
The Trindade and Martin Vaz Islands were discovered in 1502 by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigators led by [[Estêvão da Gama (c.1470)|Estêvão da Gama]], and, along with Brazil, became part of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

Many visitors have been to Martin Vaz, the most famous of whom was the English astronomer [[Edmund Halley]], who took possession of the island on behalf of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarchy]] in 1700. Wild goats and hogs, descendants of ones set free by Halley, were still found on Martin Vaz in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Magazine annotated map of Atlantic Ocean, dated July 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

{{HMS|Rattlesnake|1777|6}}, a 198-ton, 12-gun [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]-rigged [[sloop]], was wrecked on Trindade on 21 October 1781, shortly after Commander [[Philippe d'Auvergne]] had taken over command. ''Rattlesnake'' had been ordered to survey the island to ascertain whether it would make a useful base for outward-bound [[Indiamen]]. She anchored, but that evening the wind increased and by seven o’clock she was dragging. Two hours later the first cable parted and Commander d’Auvergne [[Anchor#Club hauling|club-hauled]] his way out, setting main and fore sails, and using the remaining anchor cable as a spring. This successfully put ''Rattlesnake''’s head to seaward. The remaining cable was then cut, and the sloop wore round and stood out to sea. However the ground now shallowed quite rapidly and suddenly ''Rattlesnake'' struck a submerged rock. She started filling with water, so, in order to preserve the lives of the crew, d'Auvergne ran her ashore. [[George Johnstone (Royal Navy officer)|Commodore Johnstone]] on board {{HMS|Jupiter|1778|6}} had previously wished to colonise the island and claim it for Britain, so d'Auvergne agreed to stay on the tiny island with 30 sailors, 20 captured French sailors, one French woman, some animals and supplies. They were resupplied by another ship in January 1782, then they appear to have been forgotten, as they lived on the tiny island for a year until {{HMS|Bristol|1775|6}} and a convoy of Indiamen, which fortuitously called there, rescued them in late December 1782.&lt;ref name="JAitES"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Ashelford |title=In the English Service: The Life of Philippe D'Auvergne |publisher=Jersey Heritage Trust |ISBN=978-0955250880}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–45}}

Captain [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|La Pérouse]] stopped there at the outset of his 1785 voyage to the Pacific.

=== 19th to 20th century ===
In 1889, [[Edward Frederick Knight]] went treasure hunting on the island. He was unsuccessful but he wrote a detailed description of the island and his expedition, titled ''[[The Cruise of the Alerte]]''.

In 1893 another American, [[James Harden-Hickey]], claimed the island and declared himself as James I, Prince of [[Principality of Trinidad|Trinidad]].&lt;ref&gt;"To Be Prince of Trinidad: He Is Baron Harden-Hickey", ''[[New York Tribune]]'', November 5, 1893, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypress.com/15/50/news&amp;columns/oldsmoke.cfm Bryk, William, "News &amp; Columns", ''New York Press'', v 15 no 50 (December 10, 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430105931/http://www.nypress.com/15/50/news%26columns/oldsmoke.cfm |date=April 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1894/06/10/archives/principality-of-trinidad-john-h-flaglera-soninlaw-is-its-sovereign.html "Principality of Trinidad: John H.

Despite his plans, his idea was ridiculed or ignored by the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1895/08/01/archives/trinidads-prince-awake-an-appeal-to-washington-against-brazil-and.html "Trinidad's Prince Awake: An Appeal to Washington Against Brazil and Great Britain", ''New York Times'', August 1, 1895, p 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1895/08/02/archives/grand-chancellor-of-trinidad-significant-phases-in-the-ascent-of.html "Grand Chancellor of Trinidad: Significant Phases in the Ascent of Male Comte de la Boissiere to His Elevated Diplomatic Post", ''New York Times'', August 2, 1895, p 9]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1895/08/07/archives/trinidads-case-in-washington-courteously-the-chancellor-would.html "Trinidad's Case in Washington: Courteously, the Chancellor Would Permit Britain's Cable Station and Use It, but There Is Graver Trouble", ''New York Times'', August 7, 1895, p 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1895/08/09/archives/trinidads-diplomat-in-action-m-de-la-boissiere-asks-that-his.html "Trinidad's Diplomat in Action: M. de la Boissiere Asks that His Sovereign's Land Be Recognized as a Neutral Principality", ''New York Times'', August 9, 1895, p 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1896/01/24/archives/no-use-for-staten-isle-controller-fitch-and-corporation-coun-sel.html "Trinidad's Prince at Work: Grand Chancellor de la Boissiere Tells How the War Between Great Britain and Brazil Will Be Averted", ''New York Times'', Jan 24, 1896, p 9]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/br-trin.html Flags of the World - Trindade and Martins Vaz Islands (Brazil)] (''sic'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1895, the [[United Kingdom|British]] again tried to take possession of this strategic position in the [[Atlantic]].&lt;ref name="Bryk 2002"/&gt; The British planned to use the island as a cable station.&lt;ref name="Bryk 2002"/&gt; However, Brazilian diplomatic efforts, along with Portuguese support{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}, reinstated Trindade Island to Brazilian sovereignty.

In order to clearly demonstrate sovereignty over the island, now part of the State of [[Espírito Santo]] and the municipality of [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]], a landmark was built on January 24, 1897. Nowadays, Brazilian presence is marked by a permanent [[Brazilian Navy]] base on the main island.

In July 1910 the ship ''[[Terra Nova (ship)|Terra Nova]]'' carrying the last [[Terra Nova Expedition|expedition]] of Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott]] to the Antarctic arrived at the island, at the time uninhabited. Some members of the Scott's expedition explored the island with scientific purposes, and a description of it is included in ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'', by [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]], one of the members of the expedition.

In August 1914, the [[Imperial German Navy]] established a supply base for its warships off Trindade. On September 14, 1914, the [[Royal Navy]] [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{HMS|Carmania}} fought the German {{SMS|Cap Trafalgar}} off Trindade in the [[Battle of Trindade]]. ''Carmania'' sank ''Cap Trafalgar'', but sustained severe damage herself.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|303px|The ultraviolet catastrophe is the error at short wavelengths in the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] (depicted as "classical theory" in the graph) for the energy emitted by an ideal black-body. The error, much more pronounced for short wavelengths, is the difference between the black curve (as classically predicted by the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]]) and the blue curve (the measured curve as predicted by [[Planck's law]]).]]

The '''ultraviolet catastrophe''', also called the '''Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe''', was the prediction of late 19th century/early 20th century [[classical physics]] that an ideal [[black body]] at [[thermal equilibrium]] will emit [[radiation]] in all frequency ranges, emitting more energy as the frequency increases. By calculating the total amount of radiated energy (i.e., the sum of emissions in all frequency ranges), it can be shown that a blackbody would release an infinite amount of energy, contradicting the principles of [[conservation of energy]] and indicating that a new model for the behaviour of blackbodies was needed.

The term "ultraviolet catastrophe" was first used in 1911 by [[Paul Ehrenfest]], but the concept originated with the 1900 derivation of the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]].  The phrase refers to the fact that the Rayleigh–Jeans law accurately predicts experimental results at radiative frequencies below 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; GHz, but begins to diverge with empirical observations as these frequencies reach the [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McQuarrie |first1=Donald A. |last2=Simon |first2=John D. |title=Physical chemistry: a molecular approach |date=1997 |publisher=Univ. Science Books |location=Sausalito, Calif. |isbn=978-0-935702-99-6 |edition=rev. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first appearance of the term, it has also been used for other predictions of a similar nature, as in [[quantum electrodynamics]] and such cases as [[ultraviolet divergence]].

== Problem ==
The ultraviolet catastrophe results from the [[equipartition theorem]] of classical [[statistical mechanics]] which states that all [[harmonic oscillator]] modes (degrees of freedom) of a system at equilibrium have an average energy of &lt;math&gt;kT&lt;/math&gt;.

An example, from Mason's ''A History of the Sciences'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Mason
  | first = Stephen F.
  | title = A History of the Sciences
  | publisher = Collier Books
  | year = 1962
  | page = 550}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates multi-mode vibration via a piece of string.  As a [[Standing wave|natural vibrator]], the string will oscillate with [[Overtone#Explanation|specific modes]] (the standing waves of a string in harmonic resonance), dependent on the length of the string.  In classical physics, a radiator of energy will act as a natural vibrator.  And, since each mode will have the same energy, most of the energy in a natural vibrator will be in the smaller wavelengths and higher frequencies, where most of the modes are.

According to classical electromagnetism, the number of electromagnetic modes in a 3-dimensional cavity, per unit frequency, is proportional to the square of the frequency.  This therefore implies that the radiated power per unit frequency should follow the Rayleigh–Jeans law, and be proportional to frequency squared.  Thus, both the power at a given frequency and the total radiated power is unlimited as higher and higher frequencies are considered:  this is clearly unphysical as the total radiated power of a cavity is not observed to be infinite, a point that was made independently by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and by [[Lord Rayleigh]] and  Sir [[James Jeans]] in 1905.

== Solution ==
[[Max Planck]] derived the correct form for the intensity spectral distribution function by making some strange (for the time) assumptions. In particular, Planck assumed that electromagnetic radiation can be emitted or absorbed only in discrete packets, called quanta, of energy: &lt;math&gt;E_\text{quanta}=h\nu=h\frac{c}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. Planck's assumptions led to the correct form of the spectral distribution functions: &lt;math&gt;B_\lambda(\lambda, T) =\frac{2 hc^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{h c/(\lambda k_\mathrm{B}T)} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] solved the problem by postulating that Planck's quanta were real physical particles — what we now call [[photon]]s, not just a mathematical fiction. They modified [[statistical mechanics]] in the style of [[Boltzmann]] to an ensemble of photons. Einstein's photon had an energy proportional to its frequency and also explained an unpublished law of Stokes and the [[photoelectric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Einstein and the Quantum |first=A. Douglas |last=Stone |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This published postulate was specifically cited by the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] committee in their decision to award the [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|prize for 1921]] to Einstein.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics: 1921 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Media AB |access-date=December 13, 2017 |quote=For his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:White shark café map.png|thumb|right|The White Shark Café, in between the Guadalupe Islands and the Hawaii islands.]]
The '''White Shark Café''' is a remote mid-[[Pacific Ocean]] area noted as a winter and spring habitat of otherwise coastal [[great white shark]]s.

The area, halfway between [[Baja California]] and [[Hawaii]], received its unofficial name in 2002 from researchers at [[Leland Stanford Junior University|Stanford University]]'s [[Hopkins Marine Station]] who were studying the great white shark species using [[Satellite tracking (animal migration)|satellite tracking]] tags.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite news

Although the area had not previously been suspected as a shark habitat, when mapping the satellite tracking data, researchers discovered that members of the species frequently travel to and loiter in the area.&lt;ref name=Nature-02 /&gt; It was once believed the area has very little food for the animals (researchers described it as the shark equivalent of a [[desert]]),&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TOPP-tags /&gt; but research in early 2018 by the vessel ''Falkor'' showed that there is a rich and diverse food chain too deep to be detected by satellites that provides a potentially abundant food supply for the sharks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/28/613394086/great-white-sharks-have-a-secret-cafe-and-they-led-scientists-right-to-it |title=Great White Sharks Have A Secret 'Cafe,' And They Led Scientists Right To It |author=Kennedy, Merrit |date=28 May 2018 |work=NPR |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Male, female, and juvenile great whites have been tracked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The sharks tracked to the area came from diverse [[rookeries]] along the [[North America]]n coast. They typically took up to 100 days to arrive, traveling around {{convert|1|m/s|abbr=on}}, during which they make periodic dives as deep as {{convert|3000|ft}}. While at the Café, they dive to depths of {{convert|1500|ft}} as often as once every ten minutes.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

By 2006, researchers had observed consistent migration and other behavior. Tracking data indicates that white sharks will leave feeding grounds near the coast in winter, travel to the Café, and some may even summer near Hawaii. But many linger in the Café, often for months, before returning to the coast in the fall, coinciding with the [[elephant seal]] breeding season (a favored prey).&lt;ref name=TOPP-tags&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Urbeach-funtain-grille-open-for-shutdown558.jpg|thumb|Winterization of [[Toronto]]'s Dundas Square usually takes place at the end of October]]
'''Winterization''' is the process of preparing something for winter.

==Humanitarian aid==
In emergency or disaster response situations, such as managed by the [[UNHCR]],  winterization activities include the distribution of items including blankets, quilts, kerosene, heating stoves, jerry cans, as well as thermal floor mats and insulation to make tents warmer and more resistant to harsh winter conditions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Winterization assistance is an urgent priority |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/winterization-assistance-urgent-priority-enku |website=ReliefWeb |date=20 Oct 2014 |accessdate=11 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer home==
Some [[summer home]]s, also known as [[Cottage#Cottages in Canada and the U.S.|cabin]]s or [[cottage]]s, were built for summer use only and need to be winterized each  Autumn. This entails locking them up, turning off water, electricity, and phone lines, and protecting various features from heavy snowfall.

In the [[New England]] area, many wealthy families living in cities during the 19th century had summer homes in the mountains. This was to flee the onset of [[yellow fever]] and other epidemics which often struck in the summer months, when city plumbing problems and stagnant horse manure in the streets caused a health hazard. Winterization would take place each Fall when the families returned to the cities (often when school started). In those days, winterization just referred to a lock-down of all movable parts as protection from winter storms. An example of such a summer home that needs to be winterized each fall is the scene of the movie ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'', which was filmed on [[Squam Lake]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In the 20th century, these summer mountain homes in turn were winterized to enable winter holidays, as the popularity of [[skiing]] in the mountains increased that of summer [[camping]]. In this sense, winterization refers to the addition of modern amenities such as [[heating]] and [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], often entailing a complete rebuild of the cottage.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Equipment==
Equipment designed for use in particularly extreme cold conditions (such as the [[polar region]]s) also undergoes a "winterization" process. Many complex devices (automobiles, electronics and radios) as well as common materials (metals, rubbers, petroleum lubricants) are not designed to operate at extremely low temperatures and must be winterized to operate without severe damage from the elements in such conditions. This might involve a chemical treatment process, additional waterproofing/insulation, or even the total substitution of new parts. An example would be the [[internal combustion engine]] of an automobile; the installation of [[block heater|heaters]] on the engine block and battery as well as the substitution of winter-grade coolants and lubricants allows the vehicle to start and run in sub-freezing conditions where a non-winterized engine would quickly break down.

Winterization of equipment can be thought of as the winter-weather extension of [[rugged computer|ruggedization]].

==Boats==
Boats, boat lifts, PWCs, and other watercrafts needs to be properly winterized. This includes draining water from the hull, and the cooling system, inspect stern drive to remove plant life, add fuel, add oil to the engine, and clean the bilges. Thoroughly cleaning the interiors, draining any refrigerators, lock all drawers, and remove valuables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/winteriz.htm|title=Winterize Your Boat|website=www.boatsafe.com|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's also important to properly shrink wrap a boat to protect from moisture, snow, ice, and debris.  

Watercrafts can be winterized and stored outdoors or in an indoor storage facility.

==Strategies for water features==
Some fountains, such as the [[Ontario Science Centre]] FUNtain Hydraulophone and the flame fountain in Nathan Philips Square, are designed to run year-round by virtue of heated water, whereas others require that the water be drained and that all apertures be covered to keep rainwater from entering the fountain and freezing inside. Fountains and other water features are often drained and sealed up so that water inside does not freeze or cause breakage of the pipes in the fountain.

Fish ponds require several additional steps to ensure that the fish are well taken care of. A properly maintained water feature containing fish can operate even in freezing temperatures. Steps should be taken to ensure adequate cleaning of the pond from any loose debris.
