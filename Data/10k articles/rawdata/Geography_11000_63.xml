== Overview ==
[ISRO] launched the [[beta version]] of its web-based [[GIS]] tool, Bhuvan, on August 12, 2009. Bhuvan offers detailed imagery of Indian locations compared to other [[Virtual Globe]] Software, with spatial resolutions ranging up to 1 metre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gisresources.com/bhuvan-updates-gateway-indian-earth-observation/|title=Bhuvan Updates: Gateway to Indian Earth Observation - GIS Resources|date=14 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present 177 cities High resolution datasets are available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhuvan3.nrsc.gov.in/applications/bhuvanstore.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715224517/http://bhuvan3.nrsc.gov.in/applications/bhuvanstore.php |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the other part of the country is covered by 2.5m resolution imagery. Locations will be viewable from different perspectives, and the software will also provide functionality for the measurement of distances and other [[geoprocessing]] capabilities. The Bhuvan portal is designed to run on slow Internet connections. The images available do not include any military installations in India, due to security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merinews.com/article/isros-bhuvan-stands-up-to-google-earth/15781365.shtml |title=ISRO's Bhuvan stands up to Google Earth |publisher=Merinews.com |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Remote Sensing Agency]] played an important role in the development of this product. ISRO has used data provided by satellites including [[RESOURCESAT-1|Resourcesat-1]], [[CARTOSAT-1|Cartosat-1]] and [[CARTOSAT-2|Cartosat-2]] to get the best possible imagery of India.

Bhuvan-2D is developed using open-source software Geospatial solutions (UMN [[Mapserver]], [[Geoserver]], [[OpenLayers]]).2D images are available on all mobile browsers, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medianama.com/2013/08/223-bhuvan-goes-mobile-but-not-on-play-store/|title=Bhuvan Goes Mobile, But Not On Play Store|first=Apurva|last=Chaudhary|date=5 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other Bhuvan applications and services are developed by taking Bhuvan-2D as a base. Bhuvan also provides facility to view satellite imagery in 3-Dimensional format. Earlier Bhuvan-3D was based on a product of Skyline Software Systems. On the 5th Anniversary of Bhuvan on 12 August 2014 Bhuvan has released an Open-source tool (Cesium : [[webGL]] Javascript Library) based [[Virtual Globe]].&lt;ref name="nrsc.gov.in"&gt;http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/globe&lt;/ref&gt; This 3D tool is platform independent and Plug-in free.  Bhuvan also provides an [[android (operating system)|Android]]-based application for field data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nrsc.gov.in/bhuvanpoi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021052228/http://nrsc.gov.in/bhuvanpoi.html |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trak.in"/&gt;

== Features ==
Bhuvan allows users to view 2D and 3D images, along with information on soil, wasteland and water resources on the Indian subcontinent. Users can superimpose administrative boundaries of their choice, from a selection of boundaries available, on images as required. Bhuvan also allows visualization of AWS (Automatic [[Weather Station]]) data in the graphic view, as well as in tabular form. Users can "fly" from one location to another, and also navigate using the 3D view pop-up menu (with fly-in, fly out, jump in, jump around and view point controls). The software features [[Heads-Up Display]] (HUD) navigation controls (tilt slider, opacity control, compass ring and zoom slider). There is also a drawing function, which allows users to draw certain objects in both 2D (text labels, polylines, polygons, rectangles, 2D arrows, circles and ellipses) and 3D (placing of expressive 3D models, 3D polygons and boxes). Users can create snapshots (copies the 3D view to a floating window and allows to save to an external file) to record images and use measurement tools (horizontal distance, aerial distance, vertical distance, measure area) to record distances. Shadow analysis also allows a user to view terrain as it would appear at a specified time of day, by setting the sun position appropriately for the given time, thus creating accurate shadows and lighting.

ISRO plans to allow the end-user to participate in the development of features for the product in the future.

Some of the functionality planned for future versions includes:
* Online shapefile creation
* Urban Design Tools (to build roads, junctions and traffic lights in an urban setting)
* [[Contour line|Contour]] maps (displays a colourized terrain, maps and contour lines)
* Terrain profile (displays the terrain elevation profile along a path)
* Draw tools (creates simple markers, free hand lines and urban designs)
* Navigation map (to jump to and view locations in 3D)

== Plugin download ==
Bhuvan-3D released in 2009 requires Plugin and best viewed on IE 8 in windows machine. However, on its 5th anniversary(12 Aug 2014), Bhuvan has rolled our platform &amp; plug-in independent Bhuvan 3D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gisresources.com/nrsc-launched-plug-independent-bhuvan-3d/|title=NRSC has Launched Plug-in Independent Bhuvan 3D - GIS Resources|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical requirements ==
Bhuvan 2D is compatible with all browsers and operating systems and does not require any plug-in installation. Bhuvan 2D is based on the open source application Geo-spatial solutions. Bhuvan 2D can also be accessed through mobile phones also without any plugin installation.

The previous version of Bhuvan 3D can run only on the Windows operating system and is optimized for [[Internet Explorer 6]] and higher, with Protected Mode turned off. Bhuvan uses a plugin which is around 11 [[Megabyte|MB]] in size, and has to be installed prior to access. The plugin is only supported on [[Internet Explorer]] for Microsoft Windows. Google Chrome, Firefox and other platforms were not supported.

The latest version of Bhuvan 3D&lt;ref name="nrsc.gov.in"/&gt; requires only a [[webGL]] enabled browser&lt;ref&gt;http://get.webgl.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and is platform independent.

== Criticism ==
Since the launch of Bhuvan, users have experienced various difficulties. One problem is that the Bhuvan site has, at various times, been either inaccessible or very slow (due to less band width and servers). Users are required to register before they can use the product, and downloads of plug-ins up to 11 MB in size are needed for the application to work. Furthermore, the plugin only works on Windows, and only Internet Explorer is supported. 
However now Bhuvan is improving and does not require Login to visualize the maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/map/|title=ISRO's Geoportal - Gateway to Indian Earth Observation - 2D Viewer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users need to register only when they wish to download satellite data (up to 25m resolution LISS-III data) and products (like [[NDVI]], [[OHC]] datasets, [[Cartosat]] [[Digital Elevation Model]] etc.)
To overcome the Plugin restrictions and platform-dependency for 3D -visualization, Bhuvan has come with a [[WebGL]] based open-source [[virtual globe]]. It only requires [[WebGL]] enabled browsers.&lt;ref name="nrsc.gov.in"/&gt;

It renders layers unevenly and sometimes images are completely blocked. Bhuvan promises images from a perceived altitude of 10 metres, but technical analysts{{Who|date=November 2011}} dispute the results. If many locations of same name exist, Bhuvan is supposed to give multiple results so that users can choose the intended location, but Bhuvan sometimes fails to return multiple results.

Since the initial, buggy beta release, a more stable version has been released, with which users have reported fewer problems. A discussion forum has also been started for users experiencing difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhuvan-forum.nrsc.gov.in/ |title=Bhuvan Discussion Forum • Index page |publisher=Bhuvan-forum.nrsc.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cape Chelyuskin''' ({{lang-ru|мыс Челюскина}}) is the northernmost point of the [[Eurasia]]n continent (and indeed of any continental mainland), and [[Extreme points of Russia|the northernmost point]] of mainland [[Russia]]. It is situated at the tip of the [[Taymyr Peninsula]], south of [[Severnaya Zemlya]] archipelago, in [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], Russia. The headland has a {{convert|17|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} light on a framework tower.&lt;ref&gt;[https://coastalexplorer.net/downloads/guide_books/sailing_directions/Pub183.db;download Russian Coastal explorer]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cape Chelyuskin is {{convert|1370|km}} from the [[North Pole]]. [[Cape Vega]] is a headland located a little to the west of Cape Chelyuskin. [[Oscar Bay]] lies between both capes.&lt;ref&gt;[[GoogleEarth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The cape was first reached in May, 1742 by an expedition on land party led by [[Semion Chelyuskin]], and was initially called '''Cape East-Northern'''. It was renamed in honour of Chelyuskin by the Russian Geographical Society in 1842, on the 100th anniversary of the discovery.

It was passed on August 18, 1878 by [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]] during the first sea voyage through the North-East Passage.

In 1919 Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s ship [[Maud (ship)|''Maud'']], left behind two men, [[Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen]], at Cape Chelyuskin after having made winter quarters there. The ''Maud'' continued eastwards into the [[Laptev Sea]] and the men were instructed to wait for the freeze-up of the [[Kara Sea]] and then sledge southwestwards towards [[Dikson Island|Dikson]] carrying Amundsen's mail. However, these two men disappeared mysteriously and were never seen again.
In 1922 [[Nikifor Begichev]] led a Soviet expedition in search for Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen on request of the government of [[Norway]], but Begichev was not successful.

A [[Weather station|weather]] and a [[hydrology]] research base named "Polar Station Cape Chelyuskin" was constructed in 1932, and headed by [[Ivan Papanin]]. It was renamed the "E. K. Fyodorov Hydrometeorological Observatory" in 1983. The station has a magnetic observatory and stands on the eastern side of the point.

Systematic geological survey for uranium began here in 1946-47 with industrial extraction between 1950 and 1952 in a mountain 150&amp;nbsp;km south of the cape proper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memorial.krsk.ru/articles/2006larkov.htm С.Ларьков, Ф.Романенко. Самый северный остров Архипелага ГУЛАГ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827075858/http://www.memorial.krsk.ru/articles/2006larkov.htm |date=August 27, 2010 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cape hosts the northernmost airfield in Eurasia, in operation at various locations since 1950.

==Climate==

Cape Chelyuskin has a [[tundra climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''ET'').

[[File:Geographischer Mittelpunkt Deutschlands II.jpg|thumb|"Central point" in Niederdorla]]
'''Central Germany''' (''Zentraldeutschland''/''Mitteldeutschland''), in geography, describes the areas surrounding the [[geographical centre]] of [[Germany]].

[[File:Landlocked_German_states_with_no_external_borders.png|thumb|left|120px|Landlocked German states without external borders]]
[[Hesse]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]] are the only [[landlocked]] [[German states]] without an [[international border]] except for the city-states of [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]].

==Geographical centre==
The central point shifted several times during the country's eventful history. Today [[Niederdorla]] in the state of [[Thuringia]] claims to be the most central municipality in Germany. A plaque was erected and a [[tilia|lime tree]] planted at {{coord|51|9|48.15|N|10|26|51.66|E|type:landmark|display=inline,title}} after the 1990 [[German reunification]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Niederdorla|Niederdorla, German Wikipedia]] Retrieved 1 Nov 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The point was confirmed as the [[centroid]] of the extreme [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] by the [[Dresden University of Technology]]. Niederdorla also comprises the [[Center of gravity|centre of gravity]] ([[equilibrium point]]) about {{convert|4.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southwest. Other municipalities competing are [[Krebeck]] in [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Edermünde]] in [[Hesse]], as well as the village of Landstreit near [[Eisenach]].

The geographical centre of the [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1919 was located at [[Spremberg]] in the Prussian [[Province of Brandenburg]]. The centroid of [[East Germany]] until 1990 was located between the villages of Verlorenwasser and Weitzgrund near [[Bad Belzig|Belzig]].

==Topography==
The German [[Central Uplands]] (''Mittelgebirgsschwelle'') is the ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' area of low mountains and hills, comprising numerous individual ranges like the [[Rhenish Massif]], the [[Lower Saxon Hills]], the [[West Hesse Highlands|West]] and [[East Hesse Highlands]], the [[Harz]] and the [[Thuringian-Franconian Highlands]] as well as the [[Bohemian Massif]] - in between the [[North German Plain]] and the [[Main (river)|Main]] river separating it from the [[South German Scarplands]]. The [[Thuringian Basin]] forms one of the core regions.

'''[[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]''' is home to numerous structures that are noteworthy due to their architectural characteristics or historic associations. The city also boasts [[Fountain Square, Cincinnati|Fountain Square]] and a riverfront that is being revitalized under [[The Banks]] project.

== Famous buildings ==
{{see also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Hamilton County, Ohio}}
[[Image:Cincinnati Music Hall 2002b.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Music Hall (Cincinnati)|Cincinnati Music Hall]]]]
[[Image:Carew Tower Full.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Carew Tower]] is the 2nd tallest building and a great example of [[Art Deco]].]]

[[Carew Tower]]: The second tallest building in Cincinnati and a [[National Historic Landmark]] with an open air observation deck on 49th story. It was the basis for the [[Empire State Building]] and contains some of the finest examples of French [[Art Deco]] architecture.

[[Great American Tower at Queen City Square]]: The tower replaced the Carew Tower as Cincinnati's tallest.

[[Ingalls Building]]: The world's first reinforced concrete skyscraper.

[[PNC Tower]]: The 5th tallest in the world and tallest in the U.S., outside of New York City when it was built in 1914.

[[Scripps Center]]: Home of the world headquarters for the [[E. W. Scripps Company]].

[[Star Tower]]: A free-standing TV/Radio transmission tower.

[[Aronoff Center]]: Performing arts center, by world-renowned architect [[César Pelli]].

[[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal]]: A train station (still housing an AMTRAK station) but that is now primarily a museum and widely considered one of the finest examples of the [[Art Deco]] style.

[[Cincinnati Music Hall]]: One of the oldest and largest performance halls in the U.S. particularly noted for its Gothic German architecture.

[[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]] was recently built along the bank of the [[Ohio River]] as part of The Banks Project.

[[Riverbend Music Center]] is a 20,000 seat outdoor amphitheater complex located on the banks of the Ohio River at the eastern edge of the city limits.

[[Image:TylerDavidsonFountainAtNight.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Tyler Davidson Fountain]], centerpiece of Fountain Square]]
[[Fountain Square, Cincinnati|Fountain Square]] is a public square in [[Downtown Cincinnati]], located at Fifth Street and Vine. Its centerpiece is the landmark bronze [[Tyler Davidson Fountain]]. The square is a popular [[hardscape]], surrounded by hotels, banks, department stores, and restaurants. The space was donated to the city of Cincinnati by prominent citizen Henry Probasco and dedicated on its completion in 1871 to his brother-in-law, Tyler Davidson.

In 1998, the fountain underwent extensive restoration. In September 2005, the fountain was temporarily moved to the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]] while Square was extensively renovated.  The fountain was returned to a different location on the Square on August 19, 2006, in preparation for its re-opening in early October 2006.

Fountain Square was featured in the credits of the television series ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''.

== Riverfront ==
[[Image:Cincinnati Skyline Dusk.JPG|left|thumb|[[Cincinnati]]'s riverfront [[skyline]]]]

Being situated on the Ohio River, Cincinnati is home to several prominent bridges that connect the downtown to [[Covington, Kentucky]] and [[Newport, Kentucky]]. In fact, there are more bridges that cross the Ohio River in Cincinnati than at any other place on the River.  These bridges include the historic and picturesque [[John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge]], which served as a prototype for the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]; the [[Daniel Carter Beard Bridge]] (aka The [[Big Mac]] Bridge); and the [[Newport Southbank Bridge]] (sometimes referred to as the Purple People Bridge), which is the longest pedestrian-only bridge in the United States connecting two states.

Cincinnatians place a great value on the riverfront for its entertainment and economic benefits.  The riverfront is home to both [[Paul Brown Stadium]] home of the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and to [[Great American Ball Park]] home of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], as well as to the  [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]].  "[[The Banks]]", a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} site planned for future mixed commercial, residential and public recreational use is also on the riverfront.  The annual [[WEBN]] Fireworks on [[Labor Day]] are celebrated at the river, as is [[Tall Stacks]], the largest gathering of steam riverboats in the nation.  Many cultural festivals are held at [[Sawyer Point]], including the [[Cincy Blues Fest]] and the [[Cincinnati Celtic Festival]], formerly held at [[Ault Park]]. [[Coney Island, Cincinnati, Ohio|Coney Island]] is on the river several miles east (up-river) from the Downtown area.

{{main article|List of Cincinnati neighborhoods}}

Cincinnati's unique geography nestles its neighborhoods in small basins and the hillsides that overlook them. Because of this, many of the city's neighborhoods developed very strong identities. Today's outer neighborhoods such as [[Clifton, Cincinnati|Clifton]], [[Hyde Park, Cincinnati|Hyde Park]], [[Mount Washington, Cincinnati|Mount Washington]], Westwood, College Hill, and [[Carthage, Cincinnati|Carthage]] were originally settled as separate villages, with business sections of their own. [[Over-the-Rhine]] was an important neighborhood in [[German American]] history. [[Northside, Cincinnati|Northside]] also has its own identity.

Also highly important to the city's landscape is the division into "East Side and West Side." The division came about after the construction of Interstate Route 71, which runs north from Kentucky towards Columbus, Ohio. The rivalry has been intense at times (limited violence or reported discrimination), but is considered mostly light-hearted, although a good number of city residents take the division more seriously. Accents, fashion, attitudes, city planning (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the way the houses are laid out), financial demographics, and other items are some of the stereotypes and behaviors that separate the two distinctions. Though this division is often considered a point of contention in the city, it has only led to limited incidents of violence or litigious discrimination, and is considered more of a "charming quirk" than a divisive hindrance to society.

== Larger divisions ==
Interstates [[Interstate 71|71]] and [[Interstate 75|75]] define the four major areas of the city.

:1.  The area in between I-75 and I-71 tends to be denser and more urban and can be further divided into four smaller areas that decrease in density as one moves further away from the river.  (1) The central business district is the area south of Central Parkway and surrounded on three sides by Interstate Highways 75 and 71.  (2) A densely populated urban area surrounds the central business district to the west and north, filling up the rest of the low, flat basin between the two highways and extending all the way to the foothills.  Its major components are the [[West End, Cincinnati|West End]] and [[Over-the-Rhine]].  3) To the north where the hills begin is the Uptown area, the area surrounding the [[University of Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Uptown Area|url=http://uptowncincinnati.com/uptown-area|publisher=Uptown Consortium|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816114410/http://www.uptowncincinnati.com/uptown-area|archivedate=16 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is the second major business district featuring the other sizable collection of [[high-rise]] buildings and public institutions in the city, such as the aforementioned university and the [[Cincinnati Zoo]].  A large number of hospitals are located here as well.  Many people, including a large number of students, call this diverse and densely populated area home.  (4) North of Uptown is a large residential area, home to many well established neighborhoods such as [[Avondale, Cincinnati|Avondale]], [[Clifton, Cincinnati|Clifton]], [[Bond Hill, Cincinnati|Bond Hill]] and [[Evanston, Cincinnati|Evanston]].  Again, major city institutions are common here, such as [[Xavier University]] in Evanston and [[Cincinnati Gardens]], the city’s former [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] venue, in Bond Hill.

:2.  Just west of Downtown, I-75 follows the [[Mill Creek (Ohio)|Mill Creek]] Valley as it winds its way north from the river.  The Mill Creek Valley is the industrial heart of the city and the center of production, storage and freight transportation.  Interstate 75 is a major transnational trucking route and the valley contains the city's main [[Rail yard|rail complex]] and a [[Inland port|water port]] where Mill Creek meets the [[Ohio River]].  The size and complexity of this area physically separates the West Side from the rest of the city.  Accessing the West Side from the east usually requires crossing any one of several large [[viaduct]]s, which accentuates the East/West division.

:3.  The area west of I-75, the West Side, is a residential area.  It is popularly known for its [[working class]] character.

:4.  The East Side, east of I-71, is also largely residential.  It is popularly known as an [[upper middle class]] area.

The suburbs of the city also tend to follow this pattern, with higher density found between the two highways (the business centers of [[Blue Ash, Ohio|Blue Ash]], [[Evendale, Ohio|Evendale]] and [[Sharonville, Ohio|Sharonville]], for instance), heavy industry and freight located along Mill Creek and I-75 (The sprawling [[GE Aviation]] plant, for instance), and residential [[suburb]]s to the east and west.  In Kentucky the pattern continues, with densely populated [[Covington, Kentucky|Covington]] and [[Newport, Kentucky|Newport]] located between the 71/75 and [[Interstate 471|471]] interstates, and lower density residential cities such as [[Villa Hills, Kentucky|Villa Hills]] and [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky|Fort Thomas]] to either side.

== New development projects ==
[[Image:FountainSquare.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fountain Square, Cincinnati|Fountain Square]] was renovated by [[3CDC]] in 2005]]

Much of the new development plans are run through the Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation (3CDC) which was formed in July 2003 as part of the overall system to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of development activities in the City, as recommended by The Cincinnati Economic Development Task Force.  
3CDC works collaboratively with the City and the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority to take full advantage of each organization's resources and abilities.
They plan to develop in three specific areas: The Banks, Fountain Square, Over-The-Rhine

Cincinnati's City Manager Office also organizes and promotes development within the city, through the Economic Development Division. EDD serves as a liaison between the City and developers, development authorities, and development corporations that are seeking to promote development within the City.   These are broken down into Commercial, Mixed-Use, and Residential.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2848">The '''Common Database on Designated Areas''' or '''CDDA'''&lt;ref name="glossary.eea" /&gt; is a [[data bank]] for officially designated [[protected area]]s such as [[nature reserve]]s, [[protected landscape]]s, [[national park]]s etc. in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="dd.eionet" /&gt;

The data bank, which went live in 1999, is a community project of the  [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA) of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre|United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] (UNEP-WCMC).&lt;ref name="bd.eionet" /&gt;

The data bank is divided into a national area and an international area. The national area is for member states of the EU or EEA about the [[European Environment Information and Observation Network]] or ''EIONET''. Data cleansing for the national area of non-EEA members and the international area is carried out by UNEP-WCMC systems.

The data bank follows the system of the [[IUCN|International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) and the standards of the United Nations in order to ensure compatibility with similar data banks worldwide, especially the [[World Database on Protected Areas]] (WDPA).

The data bank can be accessed from the Internet using the website of the [[European Nature Information System]] (EUNIS).&lt;ref name="EUNIS" /&gt;

To date, true [[marine protected areas]] such as the Marine Protected Areas in the Atlantic Arc (MAIA) have not been included in the data bank. This is being pursued.&lt;ref name="MAIA" /&gt;

The '''Crystal Cascades''' is a [[Waterfall#Types|cascade waterfall]] on the [[Freshwater Creek (Queensland)|Freshwater Creek]] in the [[Far North Queensland|Far North]] region of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].

==Location and features==
The Crystal Cascades is located in a relatively unspoilt section of the upper Freshwater Creek, in the Redlynch Valley, west of [[Cairns]], with numerous waterfalls and swimming [[Depression (geology)|waterholes]] popular with locals and tourists. The largest waterhole is sited alongside a sheer cliff which locals and tourists climb to jump into the adjoining deep waterhole. The most famous part of the cliff is called "No Fear" which is the highest perch from which to jump. In 2014 an 18{{endash}}year{{endash}}old man drowned when he failed to resurface after slipping over the edge of the waterfall, while swimming in a restricted area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-12/teen-missing-after-cairns-waterfall-plunge/5254158|title=Teen missing after Cairns waterfall plunge at Crystal Cascades|author1=Kim, Sharnie|author2=Shorey, Kier|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Australia|date=12 February 2014|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cairnspost.com.au/news/cairns/family-and-friends-fear-the-worst-following-accident-at-crystal-cascades-in-cairns-yesterday/story-fnjpusyw-1226824413074|title=Family and friends fear the worst following accident at Crystal Cascades in Cairns yesterday|author1=Uhr, Grace|work=[[The Cairns Post]]|date=12 February 2014|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deformation monitoring''' (also referred to as '''deformation survey''') is the systematic measurement and tracking of the alteration in the shape or dimensions of an object as a result of [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es induced by applied loads. Deformation monitoring is a major component of logging measured values that may be used to for further computation, deformation analysis, [[predictive maintenance]] and alarming.&lt;ref&gt;Literature, Edited by J.F.A Moore (1992). ''Monitoring Building Structures''. Blackie and Son Ltd. {{ISBN|0-216-93141-X}}, USA and Canada {{ISBN|0-442-31333-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deformation monitoring is primarily related to the field of applied [[surveying]], but may be also related to civil engineering, mechanical engineering, construction, and geology. The measuring devices used for deformation monitoring depend on the application, the chosen method, and the preferred measurement interval.

== Measuring devices ==
[[Image:Freeport Mine Indonesia Total Station.JPG|thumb|A standard geodetic monitoring instrument in the Freeport open pit mine, Indonesia]]
[[Image:Jiangyin Bridge.JPG|thumb|GNSS reference station antenna for structural monitoring of the Jiangying Bridge]]
Measuring devices (or sensors) can be sorted in two main groups, geodetic and geotechnical sensors. Both measuring devices can be seamlessly combined in modern deformation monitoring. 
*'''Geodetic measuring''' devices measure georeferenced (relative to established locations outside the monitoring area) displacements or movements in one, two or three dimensions. It includes the use of instruments such as [[total station]]s, [[Dumpy level|levels]], [[Interferometric synthetic aperture radar|InSAR]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dai|first=Keren|last2=Li|first2=Zhenhong|last3=Tomás|first3=Roberto|last4=Liu|first4=Guoxiang|last5=Yu|first5=Bing|last6=Wang|first6=Xiaowen|last7=Cheng|first7=Haiqin|last8=Chen|first8=Jiajun|last9=Stockamp|first9=Julia|date=December 2016|title=Monitoring activity at the Daguangbao mega-landslide (China) using Sentinel-1 TOPS time series interferometry|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.09.009|journal=Remote Sensing of Environment|volume=186|pages=501–513|doi=10.1016/j.rse.2016.09.009|issn=0034-4257}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[GNSS|global navigation satellite system receivers]].

== Methods ==
Deformation monitoring can be manual or automatic. '''Manual deformation monitoring''' is the operation of sensors or instruments by hand or manual downloading of collected data from deformation monitoring instruments such as [[ShapeAccelArray]]. '''Automatic deformation monitoring''' operation of a group of software and hardware elements for deformation monitoring that, once set up, does not require human input to function.

Note that deformation analysis and interpretation of the data collected by the monitoring system is not included in this definition.

Automated deformation monitoring requires instruments to communicate with a base station. Communication methods used include:
*Transmission cable ([[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], [[fiber optics]])
*Local area network ([[Local area network|LAN]]) 
*Wireless LAN ([[Wireless LAN|WLAN]]) 
*Mobile communication ([[GSM]], [[GPRS]], [[UMTS]])
*[[WiMax]]

== Regularity and scheduling ==

The monitoring regularity and time interval of the measurements must be considered depending on the application and object to be monitored. Objects can undergo both rapid, high frequency movement and slow, gradual movement. For example, a bridge might oscillates with a period of a few seconds due to the influence of traffic and wind and also be shifting gradually due to tectonic changes.

*'''Regularity''': ranges from a days, weeks or years for manual monitoring and continuous for automatic monitoring systems.
*'''Measurement interval''': ranges from fractions of a second to hours.

== Deformation analysis ==
Deformation analysis is concerned with determining if a measured displacement is significant enough to warrant a response. Deformation data must be checked for [[statistical significance]], and then checked against specified limits, and reviewed to see if movements below specified limits imply potential risks.

The software acquires data from sensors, computes meaningful values from the measurements, records results, and can notify responsible persons should threshold value be exceeded. However, a human operator must make considered decisions on the appropriate response to the movement, e.g. independent verification though on-site inspections, re-active controls such as structural repairs and emergency responses such as shut down processes, containment processes and site evacuation.

[[File:Nagalokadhuni.jpg|252px|thumb|right|Nagaloka Dhuni at The Sanctuary at Two Rivers, Costa Rica]]
A '''dhuni''' is (according to the [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], etc.) a sacred site represented as a cleft in the ground. This cleft is emblematic of the [[yoni]] or female vulva and generative organ. A dhuni therefore represents a site of worship dedicated to [[Shakti]].

The '''dhuni (or dhunga)''' is also a term used in Indian cuisine to describe the process of cooking food by placing [https://goodkorma.com/2017/03/09/up-in-smoke/ smoking charcoal] into the finished dish.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word Dhuni is connected with the Sanskrit root ''dhvan'', ''to din'', ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/dʰwen-|''*dʰwen-'']], whence [[English language|English]] [[wikt:din#English|din]]. [[Sayana]] explains it by ''bending'' or'' shaking'', and [[Theodor Benfey]], too, translates it by ''to shatter''.

==Honoring the dhuni==

A dhuni is worshipped by spiritual intention and the kindling of a flame inside it. Suitable materials are offered to the dhuni and consumed by the heat or flame. This represents the eternal process of change and transformation on all levels of existence.

''"Like a river, a dhuni is always changing. Each dhuni also has its own personality that is as much subject to moods as a person. The glow of the dhuni is both a receiver and a transmitter, and like a screen on which Rorschach-like images are projected, it delivers a code"''.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography of a Sadhu: A Journey Into Mystic India|date=2010|publisher=Inner Traditions/Bear|isbn=9781594773303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0r79woAt4M0C|page=54|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[yoni]] is the nexus from which all manifest beings come into this world, the worship of the dhuni represents a sacred nexus for the path of return from the physical to spiritual level. This is an intentional process of inversion or return to our spiritual source. The dhuni is a sacred site and focal point for this form of spiritual exertion or [[sadhana]].

Aside from the offering of sacred fuel to a dhuni, [[mantra]]s are also offered, as well as the sounds of diverse musical instruments and ecstatic dance and gesture.

Although several cultures retain traditions of [[fire worship]] (out of which the [[zorastrianism]] is perhaps the most famous), a unique feature of the dhuni tradition is that it is the dhuni, the actual site itself which is considered sacred, not exclusively the fire kindled within it.

Sitting by the dhuni is believed to "purify one's vibrations" and to have beneficial impact on physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;A follower of [[Haidakhan Babaji]], Hindu sage Shastriji, said for instance:   "In ancient India, the rishis guarded their sacred fire most carefully and kept it clean, as it was believed to be the residence of divinity. Sitting by the dhuni purifies one's vibrations. This you can find out for yourself. Whenever you have any kind of trouble, go to the dhuni and let it give you solace and uplift your spirit."   The Teachings of Babaji, 2 August 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shirdi Sai Baba==
[[Sai Baba of Shirdi]] is certainly the most influential modern "Supersoul" to tend to the Dhuni which he kept lit at a place called [[Dwarkamayi]], until 15 October 1918 when he moved on.

It is said that the same fire has been kept burning by Hindu devotees who were familiar with the notion of ''agnihotri'' or worship by offering to fire. This dhuni was used to create sacred ash also known as udi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shirdisaiashram.blogspot.in/2012/03/st0ry-of-sai-babas-perpetually-burning.html | title=Story of Sai Baba's perpetually burning dhuni in Shirdi | publisher=Shirdi Saibaba | accessdate=10 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sacred ash was (and is) distributed among the devotees.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shrisaibabasansthan.org/new_eng%20template_shirdi/miscellaneous/udi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the popularity of [[Joss sticks]] from India is due to this ancient tradition and this may have roots in the ceremonies referred to in the [[Mahabharata]] and also in the [[Ramayana]].

Many useful details about udi and dhuni can be found in the [[Shri Sai Satcharita]] which has been translated into English language by [[Shri Nagesh Vasudev Gunaji]].

==Meher Baba==
[[File:Dhuni ritual.jpg|thumb|250px|Dhuni at Meherabad]]
The Dhuni fire ritual was also observed by Meher Baba in a modified form. It was among the very few, ''bona fide'' religious ritual that Meher Baba performed. It is still performed on the 12th of each month, in accordance with conventions established by Baba, near the [[Meher Pilgrim Center]] in Lower Meherabad, and is one of the important focal points of the [[Amartithi]] celebration in January of each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ambppct.org/inhisservice/IHS_NL_98_Dec.pdf In His Service, A Newsletter from Meherabad, December 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meher Baba's Dhuni was first lit on 10 November 1925, when some villagers approached Meher Baba about a severe drought that threatened their crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avatarmeherbaba.org/erics/glossc-d.html#d ''Baba Words; The Master's Glossary'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Bhau Kalchuri, Manifestation, Inc. 1986. p. 941&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fwb104.org/meherabad3.php Historic Meherabad (p. 3, 7th paragraph)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''emissions budget''', '''carbon budget''', '''emissions quota,''' or '''allowable emissions''', is an upper limit of total [[carbon dioxide]] ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) emissions associated with remaining below a specific global average temperature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meinshausen|first=Malte|last2=Meinshausen|first2=Nicolai|last3=Hare|first3=William|last4=Raper|first4=Sarah C.

Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, 1535 pp&lt;/ref&gt;     

Global emissions budgets are calculated according to historical cumulative emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and land-use change, but vary according to the global temperature target that is chosen, the probability of staying below that target, and the emission of other non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases (GHGs)]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Friedlingstein, P., Andrew, R.

''Nature geoscience'', ''7''(10), 709.&lt;/ref&gt; Global emissions budgets can be further divided into national emissions budgets, so that countries can set specific climate mitigation goals. Emissions budgets are relevant to [[climate change mitigation]] because they indicate a finite amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted over time, before resulting in dangerous levels of global warming. Change in global temperature is independent from the geographic location of these emissions, and is largely independent of the timing of these emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zickfeld|first=K.|last2=Arora|first2=V.

An "emissions target" may be distinguished from an emissions budget, as an emissions target may be internationally or nationally set in accordance with objectives other than a specific global temperature. This includes targets created for their political palatability, rather than ones focused on climate science warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babiker|first=Mustafa H.|last2=Eckaus|first2=Richard S.|date=2002-09-01|title=Rethinking the Kyoto Emissions Targets|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016139500611|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|pages=399–414|doi=10.1023/A:1016139500611|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the pre-industrial period to 2011, approximately 1890 [[Gigatonnes]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has already been emitted globally, and 2050 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up to 2015.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Rogelj, J., Schaeffer, M., Friedlingstein, P., Gillett, N.

Alternative to budgets set explicitly using temperature objectives, emissions budgets have also been estimated using the [[Representative Concentration Pathways]], which are based on [[radiative forcing]] values at the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vuuren|first=Detlef P. van|last2=Edmonds|first2=James A.|last3=Kainuma|first3=Mikiko|last4=Riahi|first4=Keywan|last5=Weyant|first5=John|date=2011-11-01|title=A special issue on the RCPs|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0157-y|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=109|issue=1-2|pages=1|doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0157-y|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Although temperatures may be inferred from radiative forcing). These were presented in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|International Panel on Climate Change]] Fifth Assessment report.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== National emissions budgets ==
In light of the many differences between nations, including but not limited to population, level of industrialization, national emissions histories, and mitigation capabilities, scientists have made attempts to allocate global carbon budgets among countries using methods that follow various principles of equity.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Ringius, L., Torvanger, A., &amp; Underdal, A. (2002). Burden sharing and fairness principles in international climate policy. ''International Environmental Agreements'', ''2''(1), 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Allocating national emissions budgets is comparable to sharing the burdens of climate change&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;, underlined by some assumptions of state-level responsibility of climate change. Many authors have conducted quantitative analyses which allocate emissions budgets &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;, often simultaneously addressing disparities in historical GHG emissions between nations. 

One common principle that has been used to allocate global emissions budgets to nations is the "responsibility" or "[[Polluter pays principle|polluter-pays" principle]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This principle recognizes nations' cumulative historical contributions to global emissions. So those countries with greater emissions levels over a set time period (for example, since the pre-industrial era to the present) would be responsible for reducing a greater portion of global emissions. Thus, their national emissions budgets would be smaller than those that have polluted less in the past. The concept of national historical responsibility for climate change has prevailed in the literature since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Grübler, A., &amp; Fujii, Y. (1991). Inter-generational and spatial equity issues of carbon accounts. ''Energy'', ''16''(11-12), 1397-1416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K. R. (1992). Allocating responsibility for global warming: The natural debt index. ''Ambio. Stockholm'', ''20''(2), 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, some have quantified cumulative historical emissions of states, while highlighting the ethical challenges of allocating climate responsibilities according to this principle.&lt;ref&gt;Botzen, W. J., Gowdy, J. M., &amp; van den Bergh, J. C. (2008). Cumulative CO2 emissions: shifting international responsibilities for climate debt. ''Climate policy'', ''8''(6), 569-576. doi:10.3763/cpol.2008.0539.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is often favoured by developing countries, as it gives them larger emissions budgets.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pan, J. (2003). Emissions rights and their transferability: equity concerns over climate change mitigation. ''International Environmental Agreements'', ''3''(1), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another common equity principle for calculating national emissions budgets is the "[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian" principle]]. This principle stipulates individuals should have equal rights to pollute, and therefore emissions budgets should be distributed proportionally according to state populations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some scientists have thus reasoned the use of national per-capita emissions in national emissions budget calculations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Baer, P., Athanasiou, T., Kartha, S., &amp; Kemp-Benedict, E.

A third equity principle that has been employed in national budget calculations considers national [[Westphalian sovereignty|sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The "sovereignty" principle highlights the equal right of nations to pollute.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The grandfathering method for calculating national emissions budgets uses this principle. Grandfathering allocates these budgets proportionally according to emissions at a particular base year,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and has been used under international regimes such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]]&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (1998). "Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change".(&lt;nowiki&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;) &lt;/ref&gt; and the early phase of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2010) 2010/384/: Commission Decision of 9 July 2010 on the Community-wide quantity of allowances to be issued under the EU Emission Trading Scheme for 2013 (notified under document C(2010) 4658).

'''Geo-replication''' systems are designed to improve the distribution of data across geographically distributed [[Computer networking|data networks]]. This is intended to improve the response time for applications such as [[web portal]]s. Geo-replication can be achieved using software, hardware or a combination of the two. 

== Software ==
Geo-replication software is a [[network performance]]-enhancing technology that is designed to provide improved access to portal or [[intranet]] content for uses at the most remote parts of large organizations. It is based on the principle of storing complete replicas of portal content on local servers, and then keeping the content on those servers up-to-date using heavily compressed data updates.

=== Portal acceleration ===
Geo-replication technologies are used to provide replication of the content of portals, intranets, web applications, content and data between servers, across wide area networks [[Wide area network|WAN]] to allow users at remote sites to access central content at [[Local area network|LAN]] speeds. 

Geo-replication software can improve the performance of data networks that suffer limited [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and periodic disconnection. [[Terabyte]]s of data can be replicated over a [[wide area network]], giving remote sites faster access to web applications.

Geo-replication software uses a combination of [[data compression]] and content [[web cache|caching]] technologies. [[Delta encoding|differencing]] technologies can also be employed to reduce the volume of data that has to be transmitted to keep portal content accurate across all servers. This update compression can reduce the load that portal traffic place on networks, and improve the response time of a portal.

=== Portal replication ===
Remote users of web portals and collaboration environments will frequently experience network bandwidth and latency problems which will slow down their experience of opening and closing files, and otherwise interacting with the portal. Geo-replication technology is deployed to accelerate the remote end user portal performance to be equivalent to that experienced by users locally accessing the portal in the central office.

=== Differencing engine technologies ===
To deliver this reduction in the size of the required data updates across a portal, geo-replication systems often use differencing engine technologies. These systems are able to difference the content of each portal server right down to the byte level. This knowledge of the content that is already on each server enables the system to rebuild any changes to the content on one server, across each of the other servers in the deployment from content already hosted on those other servers. This type of differencing system ensures that no content, at the byte level, is ever sent to a server twice.

=== Offline portal replication on laptops === 
Geo-replication systems are often extended to deliver local replication beyond the server and down to the laptop used by a single user. Server to laptop replication enables mobile users to have access to a local replica of their business portal on a standard laptop. This technology may be employed to provide in the field access to portal content by, for example, sales forces and combat forces.

The '''Geological Survey of India''' (GSI), founded in 1851, is a [[Government of India]] [[Ministry of Mines (India)|Ministry of Mines]] organisation, one of the oldest of such organisations in the world and the second oldest survey in India after [[Survey of India]] (founded in 1767), for conducting [[geology|geological]] [[Geology of India|surveys and studies of India]], and also as the prime provider of basic earth science information to government, industry and general public, as well as the official participant in steel, coal, metals, cement, power industries and international geoscientific forums.

GSI ([[Geology of India|geology]]) as well as [[Archaeological Survey of India|ASI]] ([[Archaeology in India|archaeology]]), [[Botanical Survey of India|BSI]] ([[Flora of India|botany]]), [[Fishery Survey of India|FiSI]] ([[Fishing|fisheries]]), [[Forest Survey of India|FSI]] ([[Forestry in India|forests]]), [[Indian Institute of Ecology and Environment|IIEE]] ([[Environmental issues in India|ecology]]), [[National Institute of Oceanography, India|NIO]] ([[Indian Ocean#Oceanography|oceanography]]), [[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India|RGCCI]] ([[Census of India|population survey]]) and [[Linguistic Survey of India|language survey]]), [[Survey of India|SI]] ([[Cartography of India|cartography]]),  and [[Zoological Survey of India|ZSI]] ([[Wildlife of India|zoology]]) are key national survey organisations of India.

Until 1852, Geological Survey primarily remained focused on exploration for coal, mainly for powering steam transport, oil reserves, and ore deposits, when Sir [[Thomas Oldham]], father of [[Richard Dixon Oldham]], broadened the ambit of the scope of functioning of the Geological Survey of India by advancing the argument with the government that it was not possible to find coal without first mapping the geology of India. Thus, the Geological Survey commenced to map the rock types, geological structures and relative ages of different rock types . The age of rock strata was estimated from the presence of [[index fossil]]s, which consumed much of the geologists' efforts in finding these index fossils, as the method of [[Radiometric dating]] for estimating the age of rock strata was not developed at that time.&lt;ref name=gsiH6/&gt;&lt;ref name=gsiH7/&gt;

In 19th and early 20th century GSI made important contributions to [[Seismology]] by its studies and detailed reports on numerous Indian earthquakes. [[Richard Dixon Oldham]], like his father also worked for GSI, first correctly identified [[seismic waves|p- and s-waves]], and hypothesised and calculated the diameter of the Earth's core.&lt;ref name=gsiH6/&gt;&lt;ref name=gsiH7/&gt;

On 8 April 2017 GSI began pilot project, with the first ever aerial survey of mineral stocks by GSI, to map the mineral stocks up to a depth of 20&amp;nbsp;km using specially-equipped aircraft.&lt;ref name=gsiH8&gt;{{cite web|title=In a first in India, GSI to use modern aircraft to map mineral stocks|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/in-a-first-in-india-gsi-to-use-modern-aircraft-to-map-mineral-stocks/618461/|website=The Financial Express|accessdate=6 April 2017|date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GSI was restructured into 5 Missions, respectively relating to "Baseline Surveys";"Mineral resource Assessments";"Geoinformatics";"Multi-disciplinary Geosciences"; and "Training and Capacity Building",  on the basis of the Report of a High-level Committee chaired by Mr S.Vijay Kumar&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teriin.org/index.php?option=com_aboutus&amp;id=3158&amp;p=emp&amp;view=profile&amp;Itemid=181&lt;/ref&gt; Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Mines of the Government of India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">The '''geology of [[El Salvador]]''' is underlain by rocks dating to the [[Paleozoic]]. Prior to the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]], sediments deposited and were intensely deformed, intruded by granite rocks and metamorphosed. Northern Central America took shape during uplift in the [[Triassic]], large than its current area and extending east to the Nicaragua Rise. The Cayman Ridge and Bartlet Trough formed from longitudinal faults at the crest of the uplift. Deformation in the [[Cretaceous]] brought granite intrusions, particularly in what is now Nicaragua.&lt;ref name="datapages"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/specpubs/carbona1/data/a039/a039/0001/0200/0203.htm|website=archives.datapages.com|title=AAPG Datapages/Archives: Structural Development of Northern Central America|volume=39|pages=203–220|accessdate=2018-11-10|year=1969|last1=Dengo|first1=Gabriel|last2=Bohnenberger|first2=Otto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the terrain and coastline of the country is defined by volcanoes and volcanic deposits produced from the subduction of the [[Cocos Plate]].&lt;ref name="mtu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.mtu.edu/~raman/papers2/CarretalAGU.pdf|date=2003-05-14|title=Volcanism and Geochemistry in Central America: Progress and Problems|accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027398000766|title=Transition from mildly-tholeiitic to calc-alkaline suite: the case of Chichontepec volcanic centre, El Salvador, Central America|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=86|pages=117–136|accessdate=2018-11-10|doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(98)00076-6|year=1998|last1=Rotolo|first1=Silvio G.|last2=Castorina|first2=Francesca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the surface, rocks in El Salvador primarily date to the [[Pliocene]] and early [[Pleistocene]] and are typically volcanic. Some of the oldest surface exposures are in the Metapan area, with pre-[[Mesozoic]] [[monzonite]] together with Cretaceous marine limestone, overlain by [[Paleogene]] volcanic and terrestrial sedimentary rocks. The 650 foot thick Paleogene sandstone and conglomerate are above an unconformity with 30 feet of gray andesite, 400 feet of limestone and additional sandstone, conglomerate and calcareous shale.
El Salvador has extensive large vertebrate fossils from the [[Cenozoic]], including [[mammoth]], [[mastodon]], [[megatherium]], [[toxodont]], bison, ground sloth and camelid remains.&lt;ref name="geoscienceworld"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/60/11/1731/4252|title=Reconnaissance Geology and Vertebrate Paleontology of El Salvador, Central America &amp;#124; GSA Bulletin |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=1731 |accessdate=2018-11-10|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1949)60[1731:RGAVPO]2.0.CO;2 |year=1949 |last1=Stirton |first1=R.

In the vicinity of the eroded plain of San Salvador, rocks exposed at the surface range in age from the [[Miocene]] to the [[Holocene]], and include nearly 100 meters of alluvium, pyroclastic material, basalt and andesite in the San Salvador Formation. This formation is underlain by the acid volcanic rocks of the Cuscatlan Formation and the andesite-basalt lavas of the Balsamo Formation.&lt;ref&gt;http://mapas.snet.gob.sv/geologia/docs/geology-ss-area.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11553">[[File:Japan separation.png|thumb|300px|The island of Japan was separated from mainland Asia by [[back-arc spreading]]]]

The islands of [[Japan]] are primarily the result of several large ocean movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-[[Silurian]] to the [[Pleistocene]] as a result of the [[subduction]] of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south, and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north.

Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the [[Eurasia]]n continent. The subducting plates, being deeper than the Eurasian plate, pulled Japan eastward, opening the [[Sea of Japan]] around 15 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|author=Barnes, Gina L.|title=Origins of the Japanese Islands: The New "Big Picture"|publisher=[[University of Durham]]|year=2003|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Strait of Tartary]] and the [[Korea Strait]] opened much later.

Japan is situated in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Frequent low intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive [[earthquake]]s, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times a century. The most recent major quakes include the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the [[2004 Chūetsu earthquake]] and the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] of 1995. [[Onsen|Hot springs]] are numerous and have been developed as resorts.

==Geological history==
===Orogeny phase===
The breakup of [[Rodinia]] about 750 million years ago has formed the [[Panthalassa]] ocean, with rocks that eventually became Japan sitting on its eastern margin. Since the early [[Silurian]] (450 million years ago)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth.sinica.edu.tw/papers/1547.pdf|author=BOR-MING JAHN|title=ACCRETIONARY OROGEN AND EVOLUTION OF THE JAPANESE ISLANDS—IMPLICATIONS FROM A Sr-Nd ISOTOPIC STUDY OF THE PHANEROZOIC GRANITOIDS FROM SW JAPAN|publisher=American Journal of Science, Vol. 310, December, 2010, P. 1210–1249, DOI 10.2475/10.2010.02|year=2010|accessdate=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[subduction]] of the oceanic plates has started and continue to today, forming roughly 400&amp;nbsp;km wide [[orogeny]] at the [[convergent boundary]]. Several (9 or 10) oceanic plates were completely subducted and their remains has formed [[paired metamorphic belts]]. Most recent completely subducted plate was [[Izanagi Plate]] 95 million years ago. Currently the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] is subducting beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south at speed 4&amp;nbsp;cm/year, forming [[Nankai Trough]] and [[Ryukyu Trench]]. The [[Pacific Plate]] is subducting under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north at speed 10&amp;nbsp;cm/year. Early stages of subduction-accretion has recycled the continental crust margin several times, leaving the majority of modern [[Japanese archipelago]] composed of rocks formed in [[Permian]] period or later.

===Island arc phase===
Around 23&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the now Western Japan was a coastal region of the Eurasia continent. The subducting plates, being deeper than the Eurasian plate, pulled parts of Japan which become modern [[Chūgoku region]] and [[Kyushu]] eastward, opening the [[Sea of Japan]] (simultaneously with the [[Sea of Okhotsk]]) around 15-20&amp;nbsp;million years ago, with likely freshwater lake state before the sea has rushed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|author=Barnes, Gina L.|title=Origins of the Japanese Islands: The New "Big Picture"|publisher=[[University of Durham]]|year=2003|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 16&amp;nbsp;million years ago, in [[Miocene]] period, a peninsula attached to the eastern coast of the [[Eurasia]]n continent was well formed. About 11&amp;nbsp;million years before present, the parts of Japan which become modern [[Tōhoku]] and [[Hokkaido]] were gradually uplifted from the seafloor, and terranes of [[Chūbu region]] were gradually accreted from the colliding island chains. The [[Strait of Tartary]] and the [[Korea Strait]] opened much later, about 2&amp;nbsp;million years ago. At the same time, a severe subduction of [[Fossa Magna]] graben have formed the [[Kantō Plain]].&lt;ref name="glgarcs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glgarcs.rgr.jp/intro/history_p4.html|publisher=glgarcs.rgr.jp|title=Formation history of the Japanese Islands (4) -- GLGArcs |accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General information====
Overall, the geological composition of Japan is poorly understood. Japanese islands are formed of several geological units parallel to the subduction front. The parts of islands facing oceanic plates are typically younger and display larger proportion of volcanic products, while the parts facing [[Sea of Japan]] are mostly heavily faulted and folded sedimentary deposits. In north-west Japan, the thick [[quaternary]] deposits make determination of the geological history especially difficult.&lt;ref name="gsj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gsj.jp/en/education/geomap-e/geology-e.html|publisher=gsj.jp|title=Geology of Japan｜Geological Survey of Japan, AIST｜産総研地質調査総合センター / Geological Survey of Japan, AIST |accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geological structure====
The Japanese islands are divided into three major geological domains:

Published by [[Aguilar S.A.]] de Ediciones in [[Madrid]] in 1954 with 116 pages of maps preceded by an atlas of Spain. Five further editions were published until 1968, then this notable work was excelled by the three volume, large-sized ''Gran Atlas Aguilar'' by the same company (1969/1970, 406 pages of geographic and thematic maps), one of the most elaborate works of its kind published after [[World War II]]. A concise edition was issued as ''[[Atlas Mundial Gráfico Aguilar]]'' (1976), also published in 1982 by [[The Kimberley Press]], [[Miami]], [[Florida]] as [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's]] ''New World Atlas''.

A '''Green Building Council (GBC)''' is national non-profit, non-government organization that is part of a global network recognized by the [[World Green Building Council]]. A GBC's goal is promote a transformation of the [[built environment]] towards one that is [[sustainable]] (buildings and cities that are environmentally sensitive, economically viable, socially just and culturally significant).&lt;ref&gt;World Green Building Council. 2009. 31 July 2009 &lt;http://www.worldgbc.org/council-development&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of recognised GBCs ==
As of October 2012, there were at least 20 nations with established GBCs, seven recognized as "emerging" members, and dozens more in the development process.&lt;ref&gt;"Established Green Building Councils."

[[File:Institut Géographique National logo.svg|thumb|The logo of the former Institut Géographique National]]
The '''''Institut national de l’information géographique et forestière (National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information)''''', previously '''''Institut géographique national''''' (National Geographic Institute) or '''IGN''' is a [[France|French]] public state administrative establishment founded in 1940&lt;ref name="Larousse"&gt;{{cite book

==Administrative organisation==
The IGN depends on the [[Minister of Transportation (France)|French Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Town and Country Planning, Tourism and Sea]]. Its missions are fixed by decrees.

State subsidies represent 51% of the budget, and sales 49%.

The IGN runs four laboratories to research geographical information acquisition, production, distribution and applications. It also runs its own school to teach techniques to its staff and other students: ''École nationale des sciences géographiques'' (English: National School of Geographical Sciences) or ENSG.

==Missions==

[[Image:Bench mark at Saint Goussaud, Limousin, France, by Institut Geographique National.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Specimen IGN bench mark at Saint Goussaud, Limousin, France, by Institut Geographique National]]

The IGN is responsible for the management and updating of:
* [[geodesy|geodesic]] and [[elevation|levelling]] networks,
* [[aerial photography|aerial photographs]],
* geographical [[data base]]s and [[map]]s.
It has to lead research, and to take part in the [[standardization]] process in the field of geographical information. It has to manage ENSG, and the documentation service about its products, techniques and services.

A group of French public administrations, in partnership with the IGN, establish the Large Scale Reference (''Référentiel à grande échelle'', RGE): [[orthophoto]], [[topography]], [[cadastre|cadastral survey]] and [[address (geography)|address]] databases which can be superimposed on all the French territory, with a 1-meter [[image resolution|resolution]].

==Products==
Covering the whole French territory:
* [[topographic map]]s on the 1:25,000, 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 [[scale (map)|scales]]
* [[road map]]s on the 1:250,000 and 1:1,000,000 scales (this last one covers metropolitan France on one sheet).
* maps of foreign countries
* [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] aeronautical maps on the 1:500,000 scale for [[Visual flight rules|visual flying]] (VFR).
The IGN is also in charge of the [[Géoportail]]. The shop ''Le Monde Des Cartes'' at 50 rue de la verrerie 75004 in Paris closed in 2017.

== History ==

The IGN is the successor to the Geographical Service of the Army (Service Géographique de L’Armée or SGA), which was founded in 1887 and disbanded in 1940. The old maps produced by the SGA were divided into two batches: one which remained at the Institute and one which joined the military files of [[Vincennes]]. The general Louis Hurault, who was at the origin of these modifications, was the first director of the IGN. He tried, in vain, to recover the material shared by the Germans. A law in ten articles is signed the 14 in order to define the functions of the IGN. The statutes had been signed the 8. This established the national School of geographical sciences in order to train Cartographical engineers.

During the Second World War, the IGN became famous for its counterfeiters. The cartographers are indeed experts in penmanship and the material necessary to the production of fake identity papers was available to the Institute. Certain engineers of the IGN were in contact with the services of allied information based in London. In secret, they brought a complete set of maps to London covering France and North Africa in order to replace maps destroyed in a bombardment.

The agents of the IGN took an active part in armed resistance in 1943. Several agents were shot by the Germans or died in action. Between September 1944 and on 8 May 1945, the IGN was under the control of the "provisional government" and most of its personnel and of his services are transformed into "military geographical Service". At the end of the war, the IGN received the thanks of Generals Bradley and Eisenhower.

Between 1945 and 1946, the debate is intense concerning the future of the IGN, last creation of the Third Republic. A law is finally signed the 8. It confirms the membership of the IGN to the Ministry of works and create the "geographical Section of staff of the Army", new section in charge of the military map.

In 1947, the IGN receives the mission of covering the whole France, but also all the dependents’ territories, like North Africa, Western Africa, Madagascar, the countries associated with Indochina and the departments and overseas territories. The task is considerable with more than 12 million km ² being covered. The independence of these countries will have as a consequence the creation of national services in each country (examples: DTGC in Senegal, IGN-N in Niger).

To carry out the aerial survey task, the IGN was equipped in 1948 with several ex [[USAAF]] [[Boeing B-17]] Flying Fortresses, specially modified for the task.  They were based at Creil airfield to the north of Paris. The aircraft were replaced by French-built [[Hurel-Dubois HD.34]] twin engined survey aircraft in the late 1950s.

The IGN then initiates a period of active co-operation with the majority of these organizations by providing some engineers of the IGN and also receive the students of the ENSG who intended to become the executives of the cartographic services of new independent countries. The activity of the IGN apart from the French territory also develops by the control geodesic project(Ecuador 1975, Libya 1979, Saudi Arabia 1981), of cartography (Saudi Arabia, Burundi, Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin…).

1982 to 1988, the control of a large topometric project and numerical cartography in Riyadh is the occasion to massively introduce digital techniques into the processing production; in parallel, the idea of a topoland data base emerges at meetings of the "national Commission of the geographical information" chaired by Guy Lengagne; this commission returns his report in 1983 and outlines numerical geographical information then in agreement with the period of the basic map with 1:25 000.Publicly owned establishment related to administration since 1 January 1967, it is placed under the supervision of the ministry for Transport, the equipment, tourism and the sea.

In 1971, the IGN and the CNES form the "Group of research of geodesic space". This collaboration between the IGN and the CNES continues with the launching of the program SPOT the 5. The launching of satellite SPOT-1 takes place the 22.Six days after take SPOT-1 in orbit, the IGN create its programme of "data bases launches", the "data bases". The data base of the cities, the data base of leveling distribution, the data base of geodesic distribution, the aerial missions data base and the toponyms data base were progressively established . The "Topo data base", bases of topographic data digitized, covers from now on the whole of France and includes nearly two million toponyms.

Its activities abroad begin into 1986 within a new subsidiary private company IGN France International.

From 2000, the IGN develops the concept of Reference frame on a Large Scale (référentiel à grande échelle = RGE); it is a question of completing within a deadline short digitalization the cartography of the French territory with a meter scale and according to four components: topography, land registry and address. This RGE is entirely completed at the end of 2008. Then it enter in a cycle of maintenance in June 2006, the IGN opened the service [[Géoportail]] allowing the cartographic visualization of the French territory on a Web navigator and using on one hand funds of air photographs and on the other hand the digitized maps to the 1/25 000. "Phase 2" of Géoportail was put on line one year later, with a new ergonomics.

At the end of 2006, the IGN was involved in the production of a receiver [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], for the excursion and automobile navigation, called Evadeo. The software of [[navigation]] was provided by [[BCI SA|BCI]] navigation (replaced in 2008 by [http://www.compegps.com CompeGPS]), the road data are of [[Navteq]] and it [[Circuit intégré|puce]] GPS of [[SiRF]], and the IGN provides a part with extracts of its maps at various scales.

In June 2007, the IGN started offering a service whereby it is possible to have a map printed centred on any location in France. This is similar to the service offered in Great Britain by the [[Ordnance Survey]].

In July 2007, Géportail – an online map service – began offering 3D movable views in a similar style to GoogleEarth. To use this function, it is necessary to install the plugin [[TerraExplorer]].

From 1 January 2012, the ''Institut Géographique National'' merged with the ''Inventaire forestier national'' to form the ''Institut national de l’information géographique et forestière'', keeping the same IGN acronym.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.fr IGN website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A "'''kilometric point'''" ({{lang-fr|'''Point kilométrique'''}}, {{lang-es|'''Punto kilométrico'''}}; '''PK''') is a term used in [[Metrication|metricated areas]], especially in [[France]] and [[Spain]], to provide [[Linear referencing|reference points]] alongside a transport route such as a [[road]], a [[railway line]] or a [[canal]]. It is calculated according to the distance in [[kilometre]]s  from a fixed commencement point. In the [[English-speaking world]], its equivalent would be [[milepost]] or [[mile marker]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9423">The '''gardens of Alsace'''  listed and described below are the most outstanding among those [[garden]]s in [[Bas-Rhin]] and [[Haut-Rhin]] in the French region of [[Alsace]] that are classified as [[Remarkable Gardens of France|''Jardins Remarquables'', "Remarkable Gardens of France"]], by the [[French Ministry of Culture]] and the Comité des Parcs et Jardins de France.&lt;ref&gt;The complete list and the criteria for selection (in French) can be found on the [http://www.parcsetjardins.fr website of the Comité des Parcs et Jardins.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gardens of Alsace==

===Bas-Rhin===
[[Image:Kintzheim B 029.JPG|thumb|right|300px|View of the chateaux of Kintzheim and of [[Haut-Koenigsbourg]] from the road between Châtenois and Kintzheim]]

* '''[[Kintzheim]]''' - '''The Park of ruins''' of the [[Château de Kintzheim]].  In 1802 Matthieu de Favier, a future [[Nobility of the First French Empire|baron of the French Empire]], bought a former feudal domain and a ruined 12th-century castle on a mountain, and built a mansion in the new Directory style. In 1803–1807, he created a romantic [[French landscape garden]], or ''jardin tableau'', to highlight the view of the ruined castle, inspired by the paintings of [[Nicolas Poussin]], [[Claude Lorraine]], and [[Hubert Robert]].
* '''[[Kolbsheim]]'''  - The '''Garden of the Château of Kolbsheim'''.  Located 15 kilometers southwest of [[Strasbourg]], overlooking the plain of [[Alsace]].  The chateau has two wings, the oldest built in 1703. The upper part of the garden is a geometric [[Garden à la française]] [[parterre]] garden, decorated with ponds, fountains, hedges and sculpted trees. The lower part is an [[English garden|English park]], with many hundred-year old trees.  Much of the garden was destroyed in the First World War, but was restored by the Grunelius family, the present owners.
* '''[[Ottrott]]''' - '''The Domaine of Windeck'''. The house was built by an Alsatian nobleman, Joseph Pescalis, in 1770. The park was begun by Armand Theodore de Partein in 1835.  It built in the romantic style, with clusters of trees, ponds and views of the ruined castle of Ottrott.  Later trees from America and Asia were added.  It includes a [[beech]] tree 20 meters high, several [[Sequoioideae|sequoia]] trees fifty meters high and four meters in diameter; [[American oak]] trees; [[cryptomeria]] trees from Japan; and groves of [[bamboo]]. In spring the garden has colorful displays of [[rhododendron]]s.
* '''[[Plobsheim]]''' - The '''Garden of Marguerite'''. A small English "secret" garden created by Marguerite and Michel Goetz in 1990, in the heart of the Alsatian village of Plobsheim. The garden features a stream, bridge, fountain, 2000 varieties of plants, and 150 varieties of old [[rose]]s.
* [[Saverne]] - The '''Botanical Garden of the Saverne Pass'''.  An enclave in the [[Vosges]] Forest, featuring local trees, bushes and [[herbaceous]] plants in their natural setting. The garden is also known for its [[bracken]], [[iris (plant)|iris]] from [[Siberia]], and its collection of [[carnivorous plants]].
* '''[[Strasbourg]]''' - '''The Botanical Gardens of the Université Louis-Pasteur''' were founded by the French Academy of Sciences in 1619, and were the second-oldest [[botanical garden]]s in France. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, the gardens were turned into a cemetery and largely destroyed.  The gardens were recreated between 1880 and 1884.  Today the gardens, located on 3.5 hectares, have 6000 species of plants, including a collection of rare trees from around the world, including a [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|Giant Sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron'') from the Sierras of [[California]]; a massive [[pecan]] tree; and a [[walnut]] tree from the [[Caucasus]].  Greenhouses shelter a remarkable collection of tropical plants, including giant [[Nymphaeaceae|waterlily]] (''[[Victoria regia]]'') from the [[Amazon River]] basin.
* '''[[Uttenhoffen]]'''  - The '''Garden of La Ferme Bleue'''.  A modern garden built around a farm from the time of the [[Thirty Years War]] in the 17th century, whose buildings, like those of other Protestant farms of the time, were painted blue. The garden features sculpture, fruit trees and fountains, and colorful seasonal displays of flowers. The garden was created by landscape architect Jean-Louis Cura.

=== Haut-Rhin ===

* '''[[Guebwiller]]'''  - The '''Park of the Marseillaise''' is a public botanical garden and arboretum in the center of the town of Guebwiller, created by landscape designer [[Édouard François André|Édouard André]] between 1897 and 1899. It contains a large fountain, [[bandstand]], a great variety of trees, [[rhododendrons]] and roses, and colorful seasonal flower beds of [[begonias]], [[dahlias]] and [[iris (plant)|iris]].
* '''[[Husseren-Wesserling]]''' - '''Parc of Wesserling.'''  Created beginning in 1699 at the site of a hunting lodge of the prince-abbey of Murbach, the garden contains formal French gardens and an English park, as well as contemporary statues. Trees include a giant [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|Giant Sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron''), [[Virginia tulip|Virginia tulip tree]] (''[[Liriodendron]] sp.''), [[Erythrobalanus|red oak]] (''[[Quercus]] sp.''), [[cypress]], [[Tilia|linden]] (''[[Tilia]] sp.''), [[maple]] (''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]] sp.''), and [[acacia]]s (''[[Acacia]] sp.''); and many kinds of seasonal flowers.
* '''[[Mulhouse]]'''  - The '''Zoo and Botanical Park of Mulhouse Sud-Alsace'''  The park was created in 1868 as a romantic landscape garden, with a zoo whose collection included [[kangaroo]], [[deer]] and birds.  Today the zoo has more than 1200 animals, and is dedicated to preserving rare species of plants and animals. It contains many species of tropical birds and monkeys, 400 kinds of iris in spring and [[dahlias]] in summer, and [[topiary]] trees shaped into fantastic forms.  It also features a garden of the senses for the blind, with signs in [[braille]] and plants chosen for their smell and touch.
* '''[[Riedisheim]]''' - '''Park Alfred Wallach.'''  Created in 1935 by the Parisian landscape architect [[Achille Duchêne]], the park has all the elements of a classic French garden; a large lawn; ornamental flower beds bordered by hedges; a [[rose]] garden with 136 varieties; a ''salle de repos'' ("place of repose") with statues and trees; a basin and fountain; a small [[maze]]; stairways connecting the different parts of the garden; and tree-shaded [[allée]]s.
* '''[[Ostheim]]''' - '''Park de Schoppenwihr.'''  Created in 1840 as a large romantic park to frame a castle, the garden is a series of spaces that appear as natural as possible. [[Achille Duchêne]] redesigned it in 1930 and it was Badly damaged during the battle of Colmar in 1945. Today, the castle is gone and the park is finding a new dimension as an art garden. The park 40 hectares, contains giant and rare trees, 5 lakes, a river, a forest, fields and meadows.

For individual topics, see [[list of science museums]], [[list of natural history museums]], [[list of transport museums]], and articles on [[Art museum|art galleries]], [[print room]]s, [[national museum]]s and [[art museum]]s in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11363">Since 1990, there have been a small number of places in [[Namibia]] which have been renamed, mainly for political, cultural, or linguistic reasons. Some names have been changed to remove colonial or apartheid references, often reverting to their original native language names. Other names (such as street names in [[Windhoek]]) have been renamed after foreign leaders or famous Namibians. Overall, Namibia has had fewer renamed places than neighboring [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

==German period==

Most place names in [[German South West Africa]] continued to bear German spellings of the local names, as well as German translations of some local phrases.
The few exceptions to the rule included places founded by the [[Rhenish Missionary Society]], generally biblical names, as well as
*Hoornkrans
*Sandfontein
*Stolzenfels
*Waterberg ([[Otjiwarongo]])

'''[[Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|Canadian royal tours]] in the 21st century''' carry on [[List of royal tours of Canada (18th–20th centuries)|the tradition of the previous 300 years]],&lt;ref name=DCH&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/fr-rf/1786-1951-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion &gt; Canadian Monarchy &gt; Royal visits to Canada &gt; Royal visits from 1786 to 1951| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; either as an official tour, a working tour, a vacation, or a period of military service by a member of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Royal family and house|Royal Family]]. Originally, official tours were events predominantly for Canadians to see and possibly meet members of their royal family, with the associated patriotic pomp and spectacle. However, nearing the end of the 20th century, such occasions took on the added dimension of a theme; for instance, the 2005 tour of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], was deemed to be a vehicle for Her Majesty and all other Canadians to honour "The Spirit of Nation Builders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ab.ca/premier/royalvisit/index_the_visit.cfm| last=Office of the Premier of Alberta| authorlink=Premier of Alberta| title=Premier Ralph Klein &gt; Royal Visit &gt; The Visit &gt; Theme| publisher=Queen's Printer for Alberta| accessdate=3 October 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007233437/http://www.gov.ab.ca/premier/royalvisit/index_the_visit.cfm| archivedate=7 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, junior members of the Royal Family began to undertake unofficial "working" tours of Canada as well; in this method, royal figures are invited by provinces, municipalities, and other organizations to events which the latter fund without assistance from the federal government. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Anne, Princess Royal]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]], and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex]], have all made several small tours in this fashion.

'''Marcia Lynne Langton''' [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (born 31 October 1951, [[Brisbane]], Australia) holds the Foundation Chair in Australian Indigenous Studies at the [[University of Melbourne]] in the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences|Faculty of Medicine]]. In 2016 she became Distinguished Professor and in 2017, Associate Provost.

==Life and career==
Marcia Langton was born in 1951 to Kathleen (née Waddy) and grew up in south-central [[Queensland]] and Brisbane as a descendant of the Yiman and Bidjara nations.&lt;ref name="Monthly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's Afraid of Marcia Langton?|url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2011/march/1326846139/peter-robb/who-s-afraid-marcia-langton|work=[[The Monthly]]|accessdate=12 March 2014|author=Peter Robb|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father had no presence in her life.&lt;ref name="Monthly" /&gt; Her mother married Scots-born, ex-Korean War veteran Douglas Langton when Marcia was a year old.&lt;ref name="Monthly" /&gt;

She enrolled at the [[University of Queensland]], becoming an activist for indigenous rights. Disillusioned with the conservative mainstream political reaction to these issues she then left Australia to travel, live and work in several countries including Papua New Guinea, Japan and North America. She returned to Australia and graduated in anthropology at the [[Australian National University]] in the 1980s, becoming the first Indigenous Honours graduate in Anthropology. She then worked with several organisations dealing with indigenous social and cultural issues and land claims. These included the [[Australian Film Commission]], the [[Central Land Council]] (where she was a land claims anthropologist), the Queensland government and, in the early 1990s, the [[Cape York Land Council]]. For example, as a member of the Northern Territory Aboriginal Issues Unit she worked for the 1989 Royal Commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. Her report, "Too Much Sorry Business", raised serious concerns about alcohol consumption and the lack of government action to control it; "from an Aboriginal perspective and from the Aboriginal experience alcohol plays a primary role in both the reasons for detention and for the subsequent chances of deaths occurring". The conclusion was that alcohol supply needed limits. Almost 20 years later, she has supported the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response]] which polices alcohol sales and consumption, among other issues.

In 1995 she moved full-time into university research and teaching. She spent five years as Ranger Professor of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies at Northern Territory University (now [[Charles Darwin University]]) in [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], before moving to Melbourne.

==Academic interests==

Langton is known for her work in several academic fields, linked by a concern for indigenous rights, justice, and artistic expression. Langton conducts anthropological work to support land claims by Aboriginal peoples and their negotiations with mining companies and the state.

Her 2005 PhD in geography at [[Macquarie University]] applies phenomenological theory to the study of Aboriginal peoples of the eastern Cape York Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Langton |first=Marcia |date=2005 |type=PhD |title = An Aboriginal ontology of being and place: the performance of Aboriginal property relations in the Princes Charlotte Bay area of eastern Cape York Peninsula, Australia |publisher=Macquarie University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humgeog.mq.edu.au/postgraduate%20thesis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Her international work concerns First Nation rights in Canada, conservation and environmental policies, and long-term support to the people of [[East Timor]].

Langton supports contemporary Indigenous Australian young adults cultural self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;Langton, Marcia (2011) [http://www.wilurarra.com.au/marcia-langton-comments-on-wilurarra-creative/ "Examples of the resilience of Aboriginal culture"], Wilurarra Creative, 12 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has argued that settlement with mining companies on Aboriginal land often benefits local interests more than the Australian government, and that the proposed 2010 Resource Tax on mining in Australia needed a redesign to support indigenous rights and employment&lt;ref&gt;Langton, Marcia (2010) "Who benefits from the resources boom?" ABC National radio, 13 May 2010 [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bigideas/stories/2010/2898279.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in 2017 she has campaigned about "environmentalists" thwarting Native Title reform as part of their case against the Adani [[Carmichael coal mine]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/07/indigenous-people-victims-of-green-fight-against-adani-mine-says-marcia-langton&lt;/ref&gt; Her criticisms of indigenous litigants have been rebuffed by other indigenous lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/09/leading-indigenous-lawyer-hits-back-at-marcia-langton-over-adani&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a frequent media commentator, and serves on various high-level committees on indigenous issues. These have included the Centre for Aboriginal Reconciliation, the directorship of the Centre for Indigenous Natural and Cultural Resource Management, Chair of the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council, and Chair of the [[Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership]], QLD. In May 2008, the Federal government appointed her to a committee looking into reform of the Australian [[Native Title]] process. In 1999 she was one of five indigenous leaders who were granted an audience with the Queen to discuss the proposed recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Australian Constitution.

'''Matthias Kuhle''' (20 April 1948 – 25 April 2015) was a German geographer and professor at the [[University of Göttingen]]. He edited the book series ''Geography International'' published by [[Shaker Verlag]].[http://www.geogr.uni-goettingen.de/hg/Geography_International/Index.htm]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Kuhle died on 25 April 2015 in a [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|major earthquake in Nepal]], five days after his 67th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erbeben in Nepal: Göttinger Professor Matthias Kuhle stirbt im Epizentrum|url=http://www.goettinger-tageblatt.de/Nachrichten/Goettingen/Themen/Erdbeben-in-Nepal/Erbeben-in-Nepal-Goettinger-Professor-Matthias-Kuhle-stirbt-im-Epizentrum|publisher=[[Göttinger Tageblatt]]|date=27 April 2015|author=Britta Bielefeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aagmemoriam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aag.org/2015/05/in-memoriam-matthias-kuhle/|title=In Memoriam: Matthias Kuhle|date=8 May 2015|work=AAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Kuhle studied [[German studies|German philolog]]y, [[geography]], and [[philosophy]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. He graduated in 1972 ([[Staatsexamen]]) and moved to the  University of Göttingen for Ph.D. work. His Ph.D. in the natural sciences (''Dr. rer. nat'')  was conferred in 1975 for work on geography, geology and philosophy. His Ph.D. dissertation was a monograph on the [[geomorphology]] and former glaciation of South-Iranian high mountains. In 1980 he achieved his habilitation in Geography with a monograph titled  ''Dhaulagiri- and  Annapurna Himalaya: A Contribution to the Geomorphology of Extreme High Mountains''. He was appointed  Professor of Geography at the University of Göttingen in 1983, and promoted to the chair for [[Geography]] and High Mountain Geomorphology in 1990.

His main areas of research were the mountain ranges and plateaus of High- and Central [[Asia]], the [[Andes]] and the [[Arctic]]. Since 1973 he undertook several multi-months research expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ist Tibet eine Kälteschaukel? |url=http://www.zeit.de/1985/37/Ist-Tibet-eine-Kaelteschaukel |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=6 September 1985 |accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quaestiones Geographicae |year=1984 |publisher=[[Adam Mickiewicz University]] |pages=46 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=Z71JAAAAIAAJ }} |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuhle’s priority program of research was High Mountain Ecology, [[Periglacial]] and [[Glacial]] Geomorphology, [[Climatology]], [[Ice Age]] research (Paleoclimatology), Glaciology and Science Theory. His work focusses on the reconstruction of the former ice cover of High and Central Asia, caused by the plate tectonic-induced uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding mountain areas above the snowline. His theory of [[Ice Age]] Development during the [[Pleistocene]] is based on this reconstruction and his measurements of radiation energy and budget in [[subtropic]] areas of high altitude.

Derbyshire et al. 1991; Rutter 1995; Zheng and Rutter 1998; Owen et al. 2005; Lehmkuhl and Owen 2005).

The '''Osborn Maitland Miller Cartographic Medal''' was established in 1968 by the [[American Geographical Society]] Council. The Osborn Maitland Miller Cartographic Medal honors "outstanding contributions in the field of cartography or geodesy". &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url =https://americangeo.org/honors/medals-and-awards/o-m-miller-medal/|title= O. M. Miller Cartographic Medal|publisher= American Geographical Society|accessdate = 27 November 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Osborn Maitland Miller]]'s forty-six year career with the [[American Geographical Society]] was only one of the many accomplishments of his career. While on staff, Miller headed, researched, and taught at the [[American Geographical Society]]’s School of Surveying, specializing in photogrammetry and cartography. He developed the [[Miller cylindrical]] projection in 1942, and completed many other aerial photography and surveying projects. Miller was born in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]] in 1897, and was educated at [[Glenalmond College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], after which he served as a regular officer in the Royal Field Artillery in the First World War, being awarded the Military Cross in 1917 &lt;ref&gt;[[The London Gazette]], 9 January 1918, p630&lt;/ref&gt; when he was severely injured. He became a US citizen in 1957 and died in 1979, in New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34879">'''Payments for ecosystem services''' ('''PES'''), also known as '''payments for environmental services''' (or '''benefits'''), are incentives offered to farmers or landowners in exchange for managing their land to provide some sort of ecological service. They have been defined as "a transparent system for the additional provision of environmental services through conditional payments to voluntary providers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tacconi | first1 = L | year = 2012 | title = Redefining payments for environmental services | url = | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programmes promote the conservation of [[natural resources]] in the [[marketplace]].

[[Ecosystem services]] have no standardized definition but might broadly be called "the benefits of nature to households, communities, and economies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-06-02.pdf James Boyd and Spencer Banzhaf, What Are Ecosystem Services?

The report defined the broad categories of ecosystem services as food production (in the form of [[crops]], [[livestock]], capture [[fisheries]], [[aquaculture]], and [[Wildness|wild]] foods), [[fiber]] (in the form of [[timber]], [[cotton]], [[hemp]], and [[silk]]), [[Genetics|genetic]] [[resources]] ([[biochemicals]], [[natural]] [[medicines]], and [[pharmaceuticals]]), fresh [[water]], [[air quality]] [[regulation]], [[climate]] [[regulation]], [[water]] [[regulation]], [[erosion]] [[regulation]], [[Purified water|water purification]] and [[waste treatment]], [[disease]] [[regulation]], [[pest (organism)|pest]] [[regulation]], [[pollination]], [[natural hazard]] [[regulation]], and [[cultural]] services (including [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[religious]], and [[aesthetic]] [[values]], [[recreation]] and [[ecotourism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.429.aspx.pdf |title=Living Beyond Our Means; Statement from the board of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, however, there is a "big three" among these 24 services which are currently receiving the most money and interest worldwide. These are climate change mitigation, watershed services and biodiversity conservation, and demand for these services in particular is predicted to continue to grow as time goes on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a1200e/a1312e00.pdf |title=Paying Farmers for Environmental Services.

The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the author of this 1997 research (Robert Costanza) and a qualified group of co-authors re-took this assessment – using only a slightly modified methodology but with more detailed 2011 data – and increased the aggregate global ecosystem services provisioning estimate to between $125–145 trillion a year. The same research project also estimated between $4.3 to 20.2 trillion a year of losses to ecosystem services, due to land use change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changes in the global value of ecosystem services|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014000685|journal = Global Environmental Change|date = 2014-05-01|pages = 152–158|volume = 26|doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.04.002|first = Robert|last = Costanza|first2 = Rudolf|last2 = de Groot|first3 = Paul|last3 = Sutton|first4 = Sander|last4 = van der Ploeg|first5 = Sharolyn J.|last5 = Anderson|first6 = Ida|last6 = Kubiszewski|first7 = Stephen|last7 = Farber|first8 = R.

PES has also been touted as a tool for rural development. In 2007, the [[World Bank]] released a document outlining the place of PES in development.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEEI/Resources/ProPoorPES-2col.pdf|title=Guidelines for "Pro-Poor" Payments for Environmental Services|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|date=|website=worldbank.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the link between the environment and development had been officially recognized long before with the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]] and later reaffirmed by the [[Earth Summit|Rio Conference on Environment and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=97&amp;articleid=1503|title=Stockholm 1972 - Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|last=UNEP|first=|date=|website=www.unep.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=78&amp;articleid=1163|title=Rio Declaration - Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|last=UNEP|first=|date=|website=www.unep.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note PES programs are usually not designed to be primarily poverty alleviation schemes, although they may incorporate development mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|last2=Arcenas|first2=Agustin|last3=Platais|first3=Gunars|date=2005-02-01|title=Can Payments for Environmental Services Help Reduce Poverty?

Some PES programs involve contracts between consumers of ecosystem services and the suppliers of these services. However, the majority of the PES programs are funded by governments and involve intermediaries, such as non-government organisations. The party supplying the environmental services normally holds the [[property rights]] over an environmental good that provides a flow of benefits to the demanding party in return for compensation. In the case of private contracts, the beneficiaries of the [[ecosystem]] services are willing to pay a price that can be expected to be lower than their welfare gain due to the services. The providers of the ecosystem services can be expected to be willing to accept a payment that is greater than the cost of providing the services.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
There are three main theoretical perspectives concerning PES. The first is that of environmental economics, the second of ecological economics, and the third of those who reject the very idea of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tacconi|first=Luca|date=2012-01-15|title=Redefining payments for environmental services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911004046|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=73|pages=29–36|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental economics ===
The basic conceptualization of nature from the perspective of environmental economics is that manufactured capital can be used as a substitute for [[natural capital]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez-Baggethun|first=Erik|last2=de Groot|first2=Rudolf|last3=Lomas|first3=Pedro L.|last4=Montes|first4=Carlos|date=2010-04-01|title=The history of ecosystem services in economic theory and practice: From early notions to markets and payment schemes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180090900456X|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Special Section - Payments for Environmental Services: Reconciling Theory and Practice|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1209–1218|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of PES provided by environmental economics is the most popular: a voluntary transaction between a service buyer and service seller that takes place on the condition that either a specific ecosystem service is provided or land is used in a way to secure that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wunder|first=Sven|year=2005|title=Payments for environmental services: Some nuts and bolts|journal=Center for International Forestry Research|volume=Occasional Paper No.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is directly related to the Coase theorem, upon which PES is strongly based from the environmental economics perspective, which states that in a competitive market, in the absence of transaction costs and in the presence of clear property rights, direct negotiation between private parties can lead to efficient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coase|first=R. H.|title=[[The Problem of Social Cost]]|url=|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=3|pages=1–44|doi=10.1086/466560|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality, transaction costs are virtually always present and private parties cannot always reach agreements on their own. One of the main reasons is lack of sustained financing, which often leads governments to provide some type of funding assistance. The environmental economics theorists acknowledge that PES systems can resemble an environmental subsidy, complicating the strict Coasian backing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engel|first=Stefanie|last2=Pagiola|first2=Stefano|last3=Wunder|first3=Sven|date=2008-05-01|title=Designing payments for environmental services in theory and practice: An overview of the issues|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908001420|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=663–674|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological economics ===
The conceptualization of nature as understood by ecological economics is that manufactured capital and natural capital are not exclusive or substitutable, but rather complementary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; PES as understood by ecological economics comprises three schematic components.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muradian|first=Roldan|last2=Corbera|first2=Esteve|last3=Pascual|first3=Unai|last4=Kosoy|first4=Nicolás|last5=May|first5=Peter H.|date=2010-04-01|title=Reconciling theory and practice: An alternative conceptual framework for understanding payments for environmental services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800909004558|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Special Section - Payments for Environmental Services: Reconciling Theory and Practice|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1202–1208|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first surrounds the importance of the economic incentive. This idea concerns the relative weight an economic incentive may carry when understood in relation to social, moral, or other non-economic incentives.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The second component is directness of the transfer, referring to the extent of interaction between ultimate buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The most direct program would occur between one buyer and one seller, with no intermediaries. A relatively indirect program would remove the buyers and sellers from each other, placing intermediaries between them, commonly in the form of NGOs and governments. The third and final component is the degree of commodification. This addresses the extent to which the environmental service (ES) being provided can be specifically and clearly assessed and measured. Some ES may be relatively easy to assess, such as tons of carbon sequestered, while others may prove difficult.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Rejection of ecosystem services ===
Those who reject the idea of valuation of ecosystem services argue that nature should be conserved and valued for nature's sake, and that nature's value is impossible to quantify because its value is inherently infinite.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCauley|first=Douglas J.|date=2006-09-07|title=Selling out on nature|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7107/full/443027a.html?cookies=accepted|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=443|issue=7107|pages=27–28|doi=10.1038/443027a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; They posit that the attempt to force the idea of ecosystem services into the market system leads to conservation only when it is deemed useful for human life, abandoning ideals environmental conservation when nature conflicts with human interest or simply does not affect human activity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are also those who support the valuation of nature from a purely practical standpoint, expressed in the idea that "something is better than nothing." They realize and acknowledge the problematic nature of the quantitative valuation of nature but at the same time argue that practically, in a highly commodified society, it is a necessary measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costanza|first=Robert|last2=Daly|first2=Herman|year=1992|title=Natural Capital and Sustainable Development|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=6|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1992.610037.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodification]] of natural capital results in undervaluing ecological systems by not accounting for the innumerable wide-range services provided. PES may decrease in utility as 1) wealth becomes concentrated to the point that natural resource scarcity results in higher short-term value for unsustainable resource extraction, and 2) the long-term cost to engineer limited-range replacement services is [[Externality|externalized]] onto citizens. This occurs either through increased expense to the existing systems or as justification to privatize services for further profit. For example, a parent corporation can profit both from the exploitation of an ecosystem, and by engineering and operating the services formerly provided.

==Organizations and motives for incentivizing production of ecosystem services==

Though the goal of all PES programs is the procurement of some sort of ecosystem service, the reasons why organizations or governments would incentivize the production of these services are diverse. For example, the world's largest and longest running PES program is the United States' [[Conservation Reserve Program]],&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt; which pays about $1.8 billion a year under 766,000 contracts with farmers and landowners to "rent" a total {{convert|34700000|acre|km2}} of what it considers "environmentally-sensitive land."&lt;ref name=programe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB/.cmd/ad/.ar/sa.retrievecontent/.c/6_2_1UH/.ce/7_2_5JM/.p/5_2_4TQ/.d/1/_th/J_2_9D/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?PC_7_2_5JM_contentid=2008%2F10%2F0251.xml&amp;PC_7_2_5JM_parentnav=LATEST_RELEASES&amp;PC_7_2_5JM_navid=NEWS_REL |title=USDA Issues $1.8 Billion in Conservation Reserve Payments |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These farmers agree to plant "long-term, resource-conserving covers to improve water quality, control soil erosion and enhance habitats for waterfowl and wildlife."&lt;ref name=programe/&gt; This program has existed in some form or another since the wake of the American [[Dust Bowl]], when the federal government began paying farmers to avoid farming on poor quality, erodible land.&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt;

In 1999, the Chinese central government announced an even more expensive project under its $43 billion [[Grain for Green]] program, by which it offers farmers grain in exchange for not clearing forested slopes for farming, thereby reducing erosion and saving the streams and rivers below from the associated deluge of sedimentation.&lt;ref name="ecosystemmarketplace1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/article.news.php?component_id=4193&amp;component_version_id=6082&amp;language_id=12 |title=Grain for Green |publisher=Ecosystem Marketplace |date=2006-02-24 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, some sources cite the cost of the entire program at $95 billion.&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt; Many less extensive nationally funded PES projects which bear resemblances to the American and Chinese land set-aside programs exist around the world, including programs in Canada, the EU, Japan and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="ecosystemmarketplace1"/&gt;

==Examples==

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
In [[Jamestown, Rhode Island]], [[United States]], farmers usually harvest the hay in their fields twice a year. However, this practice destroys the habitats of many local grassland birds. Economists from the University of Rhode Island and EcoAssets Markets Inc. raised money from residents of Jamestown who were willing to help the birds. The range of investments was between $5 and $200 per person for a total of $9,800. This money was enough to compensate three Jamestown farms for the cost of reducing their yearly harvests and getting their hay from another source. In this way, the birds have sufficient time to nest and leave the grounds without being subject to a hay harvest. In this example, the farmers benefit because they only have to harvest their fields once a year instead of twice, and the contributors benefit because they value the lives of the birds more than the money they contributed to the project.

[[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], [[United States]] has managed the majority of its watershed since the 1850s through multi-jurisdictional regulatory mechanisms such as specifying allowable uses (and restricting them), and purchasing land or conservation easements. This long-standing, legally-defensible, yet often-overlooked strategy preserves ecosystem services, while still allowing widely utilized recreation including skiing, snowboarding, hiking, mountain biking, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Libby|last2=Vira|first2=Bhaskar|last3=Briefer|first3=Laura|date=2015-10-24|title=The Lost Narrative: Ecosystem service narratives and the missing Wasatch watershed conservation story|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041615300462|journal=Ecosystem Services|volume=16|pages=105–111|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing uses of the land are generally unaffected, and commercial enterprises are restricted to no- or low-impact tourism-related activities.

=== Central and South America ===

==== Costa Rica ====
[[File:Costa_Rica_map_shaded_relief.png|thumb|Costa Rica]]
Costa Rica's PES program, ''Pagos por servicios ambientales'' (PSA) was established in 1997, and was the first PES program to be implemented on a national scale.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|date=2008-05-01|title=Payments for environmental services in Costa Rica|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907004235|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=712–724|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came on the back of Forestry Law 7575 of 1996 which prioritized environmental services over other forest activities such as timber production, and which established the national fund for forest financing (''Fondo Nacional de Financiamento Forestal),'' FONAFIFO.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringhofer|first=Lisa|last2=Singh|first2=Simron J.|last3=Smetschka|first3=Barbara|year=2013|title=Climate Change Mitigation in Latin America: A Mapping of Current Policies, Plans and Programs|journal=Institute for Social Ecology|publisher=Alpen-Adria University, Vienna|volume=Working Paper 143|issn=1726-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSA follows several years of different environmental programs in Costa Rica including the Forest Credit Certificate (''Certificado de Abono Forestal'', CAF) of 1986 and the Forest Protection Certificate (''Certificado para la Protección del Bosque,'' CPB) of 1995.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; One of the main reasons for establishing the PSA program was to reframe conservation subsidies as payments for services.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matulis|first=Brett Sylvester|date=2013-01-01|title=The narrowing gap between vision and execution: Neoliberalization of PES in Costa Rica|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718512001868|journal=Geoforum|series=Global Production Networks, Labour and Development|volume=44|pages=253–260|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explicitly recognized four environmental services:  mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological services, biodiversity protection, and provision of scenic beauty.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; During the early years of the PSA program from 2001 to 2006, it was funded by a World Bank loan and a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) under the project name "Ecomarkets."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; From 2007 to 2014, the World Bank renewed its support for the program through a new project called "Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projects.worldbank.org/P093384/mainstreaming-market-based-instruments-environmental-management-project?lang=en|title=Projects  : Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management Project {{!}} The World Bank|website=www.projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This support also generated FONAFIFO's Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS), designed to target PES programs at owners of small pieces of land, indigenous communities, and communities with low development rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fonafifo.go.cr/home/projects/fbs.html#HERMES_TABS_1_1|title=Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS)|website=www.fonafifo.go.cr|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing of PSA activities was initially accomplished in part through a fuel tax established by Forestry Law 7575. The tax was used to flexibly target ecologically important areas. In 2006 a water tariff was introduced to provide additional funding. The water tariff has a relatively narrow application when compared to the fuel tax. Under the water tariff, holders of water concessions pay fees, a portion of which is transferred for use in the PSA exclusively within the watershed in which the revenues were generated. This removes the potential for revenues to be distributed as needed and has been criticized for concentrating funding in select areas, despite their relatively low ecological importance.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

FONAFIFO acts as a semi-autonomous intermediary organization between service buyers and service sellers. As of 2004, FONAFIFO had contracted 11 different companies in agribusiness, hydropower, municipal water supply, and tourism to pay for the water services they receive. Since then, FONAFIFO has reached agreements with several more companies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

By the end of 2005, 95% of land enrolled in Costa Rica's PSA was under forest conservation contracts, covering 10% of the country.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It is estimated that from the time the program began to 2005, forest cover area increased form 394,000 hectares to 2.45 million hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI_Restoration_Diagnostic_Case_Example_Costa_Rica.pdf|title=The Restoration Diagnostic - Case Example: Costa Rica|last=Buckingham|first=Kathleen|last2=Hanson|first2=Craig|date=|website=www.wri.org|publisher=World Resources Institute|orig-year=2015|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that the PSA prevented 11 million tons of carbon emissions between 1999 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/env/cc/38523758.pdf|title=Incentives to Reduce GHG Emissions from Deforestation: Lessons Learned from Costa Rica and Mexico|last=Karousakis|first=Katia|date=|year=2007|website=www.oecd.org|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these successes, the PSA has been criticized for critical shortcomings. As it stands, the PSA payment system employs a flat rate cash payment to all participating landowners. This has resulted in large swaths of ecologically high value areas being left unenrolled in the program due to associated higher opportunity costs for land-use change not being adequately compensated for by the flat rate payment scheme.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
[[File:22nd_meridian_Bolivia.png|thumb|Bolivia]]

==== Los Negros, Bolivia ====
The program in Los Negros, Bolivia is a small user-financed program of combined payments for watershed and biodiversity services started by local NGO Fundación Natura Bolivia in 2003.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asquith|first=Nigel M.|last2=Vargas|first2=Maria Teresa|last3=Wunder|first3=Sven|date=2008-05-01|title=Selling two environmental services: In-kind payments for bird habitat and watershed protection in Los Negros, Bolivia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907006076|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=675–684|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target area of the program is the watershed in Los Negros valley servicing the town of Santa Rosa and other downhill towns. By August 2007, 2774 hectares of  native vegetation were enrolled in the program under 46 landowners.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Funding for the program was initially provided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, before the Municipality of Pampagrande began making payments for the services&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One of the program's most unique aspects is the landowners' specific request that they be paid in-kind with beehives. They claimed that they wanted their compensation to last beyond a simple cash transfer. Along with the beehives, payment recipients are able to receive training in apiculture. It also allowed for those who prefer cash to sell their hives.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

An organizational obstacle to the program is that some farmers fear that the scheme is just a way to dispossess them of their land. This was a major factor in deciding to be paid in-kind as it is perceived as less of an attempt at land appropriation. Natura is addressing this issue by maintaining a constant presence in the community and leveraging social networks to convince farmers of the program's benefits.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Another issue regards the service buyer of the program. The Municipality of Pampagrande has received some limited support from irrigators in contributing to the program payments. This structure essentially provides the environmental services to downstream users essentially free of charge. Natura is working to implement a strategy through which beneficiaries of environmental services will directly contribute to their maintenance.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Program evaluation has been impeded by two factors, namely a lack of baseline data and insufficient data as the program develops. These are important in order to establish the additionality of the program. This issue is not unique to Los Negros, however, as many programs suffer from a lack of sufficient monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Honduras ====
In [[Jesús de Otoro]], [[Honduras]], the Cumes River is the town's main source of clean water. Coffee producers were dumping their waste into the river upstream, polluting the source and directly affecting the consumers downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watershedmarkets.org/documents/Honduras_Jesus_de_Otoro.pdf|title=Honduras - Jesus de Otoro PASOLAC Initiative|publisher=watershedmarkets.org|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To solve this problem, the local Council for Administration of Water and Sewage Disposal (JAPOE) created a payment program to benefit coffee producers upstream and the town's inhabitants who lived downstream. The villagers downstream paid around $0.06 per household per month to JAPOE, who redirected the money toward the upstream farmers. The farmers complied with guidelines, such as construction of irrigation ditches, proper management of waste, and use of organic fertilizers.

Pico Bonito Forests, near [[La Ceiba]], Honduras, is a mission-driven, for-profit venture between the [[Pico Bonito]] National Park Foundation and the [[EcoLogic Development Fund]]. [[Carbon credits]] are generated by planting native trees to capture, or [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]], carbon dioxide. The credits are then sold though the World Bank's BioCarbon Fund to countries aiming to meet their [[carbon emissions]] reduction targets. The project offers a unique business model because it is owned jointly by investors and the communities near the park. Community members earn income and share profits from implementing the sustainable forestry practices that capture carbon. By 2017, the project is expected to sequester from .45-.55 Mt of carbon through [[reforestation]] and [[agroforestry]] and up to an additional .5 Mt of carbon through avoided [[deforestation]] as destructive practices are replaced with sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carbonfinance.org/Router.cfm?Page=BioCF&amp;FID=9708&amp;ItemID=9708&amp;ft=Projects&amp;ProjID=9637|title=Carbon Finance|date=|publisher=Carbon Finance|accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
The Scolel Té program in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], aims to create a market for positive externalities of [[shade-grown coffee]] plantations. Designed by the [[University of Edinburgh]]'s Institute of Ecology and Resource Management along with the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management, using the Plan Vivo System, Scolel Té is a PES program under which farmers agree to responsible farming and reforestation practices in exchange for payment for carbon offsets. The NGO Ambio manages Scolel Té. Farmers submit their reforestation plans to Ambio, which judges their financial benefits and the amount of carbon sequestration associated with each plan. The farmers then receive payments from the Fondo BioClimatico, managed by Ambio. Funding for the Fondo BioClimatico comes from the sale of [[Voluntary Emissions Reduction]] (VERs) to private groups at a price of $13 per ton of Carbon sequestered.

==== Hoima and Kibaale, Uganda ====
[[File:Ug-map.png|thumb|Uganda]]

The Hoima and Kibaale PES intervention took place from 2010 to 2013 and was especially unique because it was the first PES program set up specifically for a randomized control trial to empirically determine its impact on deforestation&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jayachandran|first=Seema|last2=de Laat|first2=Joost|last3=Lambin|first3=Eric F.|last4=Stanton|first4=Charlotte Y.|year=2016|title=Cash for Carbon: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Payments for Ecosystem Services to Reduce Deforestation|journal=Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/06/this-experiment-could-help-save-endangered-chimps-and-slow-global-warming-at-the-same-time/|title=A cheap, simple experiment just found a very effective way to slow deforestation|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the treatment villages, owners of forested land were paid $28 per year over the course of two years for every hectare of forest land that was left intact, with the possibility of additional payment for planting new trees. The payment scheme amounted to 5% of average annual income for the typical participating landowner.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The program evaluation found there to be significantly less deforestation in participating villages (2%-5%) than in control villages (7%-10%).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

It is important to note that the program did not carry on beyond the evaluation period, and it is assumed that previous forest practice will resume once landowners stop receiving program payments.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

From the early [[Middle Ages]] until early [[Modern world|modern times]], the [[nobility]] was the true basis of power for the English crown. The [[peerage]] was where the king would turn for military, judicial and administrative purposes, and the ruler who ignored his nobility, like [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], did so at great risk to his position. The peerage can perhaps best be compared to the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] of modern-day Prime Ministers or Presidents, though their power and responsibilities were much wider. The emergence of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] did not seriously erode the power of the nobility until, at the earliest, the 17th century.

Below can be found lists of the Peerage of England and Ireland during selected years of the Middle Ages. Though this approach naturally will exclude certain important individuals, the lists still work as snap-shots of the elite of the nation at regular intervals during the Middle Ages.

Up until 1340, when the first [[duke]]dom was created (1337), the lists only include [[Earl]]s. From 1390 [[Marquess]]ates are also included (1385), and from 1450 [[Viscount]]cies (1446).

[[Image:Salween delta.jpg|thumb|[[River delta]]s such as the pictured delta of the [[Salween River]] in [[Myanmar]] often show bifurcations. The water flows in from the lower section of the image and passes on both sides of the large island in the center.]]
'''River bifurcation''' (from {{lang-la|furca}}, fork) occurs when a river flowing in a single [[stream]] separates into two or more separate streams (called [[distributary|distributaries]]) which continue downstream. Some rivers form complex networks of distributaries, especially in their [[delta (river)|deltas]]. If the streams eventually merge again or empty into the same body of water, then the bifurcation forms a [[river island]].

River bifurcation may be temporary or semi-permanent, depending on the strength of the material which separates the distributaries. For example, a mid-stream island of soil or silt in a delta is most likely temporary. A location where a river divides around a rock fin, e.g. a volcanically formed [[Dike (geology)|dike]], or a mountain, may be more lasting. A bifurcation may also be man-made, for example when two streams are separated by a long [[bridge]] pier.

== Examples ==
*The [[Casiquiare canal]], which provides a navigable channel between the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and the [[Orinoco River]] in [[Venezuela]].
*Canada's aptly-named [[Divide Creek]] splits into two branches near [[Kicking Horse Pass]] on the Alberta-British Columbia border. One branch flows west to the Pacific Ocean; the other flows east and eventually reaches the Atlantic Ocean via [[Hudson Bay]].
* Similarly, at [[Two Ocean Pass]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States|USA]], North Two Ocean Creek splits at the [[Parting of the Waters]] into Atlantic Creek, which flows east to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]], [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers and [[Pacific Creek (Teton County, Wyoming)|Pacific Creek]], which flows west to the [[Pacific Ocean]] via the [[Snake River|Snake]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] Rivers.
*The Hase River in Melle, Germany divides into Hase river and Else river and has been researched as a natural phenomenon. 
*A [[Bifurcation of Nerodimka river|bifurcation of the Nerodimka River]] (Albanian ''Nerodimja'') in the city of [[Uroševac]]/[[Ferizaj]], [[Kosovo]], {{efn|name=status}} (at {{coord|42.225556|21.256111|region:RS-KM_type:landmark}}) was a hydrological curiosity as separate streams flowed into the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gordana|last=Tomović|title=Kosovo on old maps from the XV to the XVIII century|publisher=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|location=Belgrade|year=2006|url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/kosovo/delo/11688}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nerodimka bifurcation was the first hydrological protected object in the former Yugoslavia (1979). The Nerodimka bifurcation is a strict wildlife sanctuary, category I according to [[IUCN]], with an area of 13.0 ha (about 32 acres). This bifurcation is considered to be an artificial phenomenon, but created under extremely favorable natural conditions.
*In the past, the small [[Kalaus River]] in south-western Russia, when reaching the [[thalweg]] of the Kuma-Manych Depression at {{Coord|45|43|N|44|06|E}}, would split, the two distributaries becoming the headwaters of the [[Manych River|West and East Manych Rivers]]. The former flows west into the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and eventually into the [[Sea of Azov]], while the latter flows east, and is lost in the steppe before ever reaching the [[Caspian Sea]]. However a dam was built, preventing water from flowing from the Kalaus into the East Manych; thus the Kalaus is now the source of the West Manych only.&lt;ref name=bazelyuk&gt;Alexander Anatolievich Bazelyuk (Базелюк Александр Анатольевич), "[http://www.znb.rsu.ru/referat/D212-208-12/25-00-23/20071114_D212-208-12_25-00-23_BazelyukAA.doc АНТРОПОГЕННОЕ ИЗМЕНЕНИЕ ГИДРОГРАФИЧЕСКОЙ СЕТИ КУМО-МАНЫЧСКОЙ ВПАДИНЫ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305222238/http://www.znb.rsu.ru/referat/D212-208-12/25-00-23/20071114_D212-208-12_25-00-23_BazelyukAA.doc |date=2009-03-05 }}" (Anthropogenic changes in the Hydrographic Network of the Kuma-Manych Depression), summary of the [[Kandidat nauk|Cand.

*The [[Bahr Yussef]] is a channel which splits off the west side of the [[Nile]] and drains into the [[Birket Qarun]], an [[inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] in the [[Fayum Depression]].  Originally a natural bifurcation for flood waters, its flow was increased by canalisation in the [[12th Dynasty]] (about 1900 BC).  Around 230BC, the channel of the Nile from which it came (itself a bifurcation) dried up, but has since been fed by a new canal to allow water again to make it from the Nile to [[Al Fayyum]].  The entire waterway is over 300&amp;nbsp;km long, consisting of modern canals taking Nile water from [[Asyut]] to [[Dairut]],&lt;ref&gt;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=dairut&amp;aq=&amp;sll=27.556982,30.836563&amp;sspn=0.14549,0.264187&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Dairut,+Assiut,+Egypt&amp;ll=27.561966,30.809011&amp;spn=0.036219,0.066047&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&lt;/ref&gt; the old Nile channel then runs alongside the Nile for over 150&amp;nbsp;km to [[Lahun]], then the Ancient Egyptian canal carries the water into the [[Fayum Depression]].
*In [[Suriname]], the [[Wayombo]] and [[Arrawarra]] split, the first flowing into the [[Coppename]], the second into the [[Nickerie River|Nickerie]].
*The [[Sweden|Swedish]] side of [[Torne River]] has a distributary called the [[Tärendö River]], which on average transports 57% of the water of the Torne River into the [[Kalix River]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pajala.se/mun/pajala/www.nsf/English/764B6DC8BFD894E2C1256FB30024F22D?

*The [[Barak River]] in splits into two major rivers at the India-Bangladesh border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=River and Drainage System|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=River_and_Drainage_System|website=[[Banglapedia]]|language=en|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karnali River bifurcates in Nepal and the two parts rejoin after flowing into India for 80 kilometers.

'''Road signs in [[Lithuania]]''' are similar to the [[Russia]]n road sign system that ensure that transport vehicles move safely and orderly, as well as to inform the participants of traffic built-in graphic icons. These icons are governed by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] and [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ketbilietai.lt/uploads/1237645891_Keliu_eismo_taisykles_Kelio_zenklai_Keliu_zymejimas_Transporto_priemoniu_zymejimas.pdf Kelių eismo taisyklių 1 priedas – www.ketbilietai.lt&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SDLIMITS.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Figure 1. Overview of Sailing Directions coverage. The numbers in the squares indicate the individual ''Planning Guide'' coverage areas.]]

'''Sailing Directions''' are written directions, describing the routes to be taken by boats and ships during coastal navigation, and port approaches. There are also products known as Sailing Directions, which are books written by various Hydrographic Offices throughout the world. They are known as Pilot Books, because they provide local knowledge of routes and landmarks, which would typically be provided by a local marine pilot. As such, they are used frequently by naval and government vessels, who are exempted from 'Compulsory Pilotage' in many ports.

Many nations publish Sailing Directions for their home waters, where they are the International Hydrographic Organization's (IHO) primary charting authority. However, the most widely used Sailing Directions product is the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office's, 'Admiralty Sailing directions' (ASDs)( a.k.a. Pilot books). The ASDs, sold under the Admiralty brand, provide the most comprehensive geographic coverage of coastal routes worldwide. They are designed to supplement and enhance the data shown on British Admiralty Nautical Charts, by describing routes for seagoing vessels, relative to coastal features. Ocean routes are covered by the Admiralty book 'Ocean Passages for The World' (Abbrev. OPTW. Nautical Publication  NP136), which describes Offshore routes separately for power driven vessels, and low powered / sailing vessels.

== American Sailing Directions ==
There is a 42-volume American [[navigation]] publication published by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA). ''Sailing Directions'' consists of 37 Enroute volumes, 4 Planning Guide volumes, and 1 volume combining both types. Planning Guides describe general features of ocean basins and country-specific information such as firing areas, pilotage requirements, regulations, search and rescue information, ship reporting systems, and time zones; routes describe features of coastlines, ports, and harbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The American Sailing Directions are available for free download, via the [http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_st=&amp;_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62 NGA MSI Portal] Also, via the Office of Coastal Survey's [http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/nsd/cpdownload.htm website], as well as other products, including [http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/staff/chartspubs.html charts].

''Sailing Directions'' are updated when new data requires extensive revision of an existing text. These data are obtained from several sources, including pilots and ''Sailing Directions'' from other countries.

One book comprises the ''Planning Guide and {{Not a typo|Enroute}} for [[Antarctica]]''. This consolidation allows for a more effective presentation of material on this unique area.

''Sailing Directions (Planning Guide)'' and ''Sailing Directions (Enroute)'' are frequently updated. In early 2005, NGA discontinued production of these publications in printed form; subsequent editions were distributed in digital form only. Between editions, Sailing Directions are corrected via a binary patch process referred to as Publication Data Update (PDU).

'''Figure 1''' shows an overview of Sailing Directions coverage.

==Planning Guide==
[[File:Sample Planning Guide page.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Figure 2. Planning Guide page.]]
''Planning Guide'' volumes assist the navigator in planning an extensive oceanic voyage, and give information on individual countries that is applicable to all ports in those countries. Each of the ''Planning Guides'' covers an area determined by an arbitrary division of the world's seas.

Individual ''Planning Guides'' are divided into Countries and Ocean Basins, as follows:
#''Pub. 120''—51 Countries and 1 Ocean Basin (Pacific Ocean).
#''Pub. 140''—87 Countries and 6 Ocean Basins (Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, and North Sea/English Channel).
#''Pub. 160''—61 Countries and 3 Ocean Basins (Indian Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, and Red Sea/Persian Gulf).
#''Pub. 180''—5 Countries and 1 Ocean Basin (Arctic Ocean).

Country entries may contain information on the following subjects—buoyage systems, currency, firing areas, fishing areas, government, holidays, ice, industries, languages, mined areas, navigational information (to include maritime claims, [[maritime boundary]] disputes, and enroute volumes), offshore drilling, pilotage, pollution, prohibited areas, regulations, restricted areas, search and rescue, signals, submarine operating areas, time zone, traffic separation schemes, U.S. embassy, and vessel traffic services. Information that cannot be accurately depicted within the alphabeticized country text may be listed as an appendix at the end of the dountry text.

Ocean casin entries may contain information on the following subjects—climatology, currents, fishing areas, geophysical features, ice, ionospheric disturbance, magnetic field, meteorology, mined areas, navigational information, optical phenomena, pilotage, pollution, regulations, routes, seas, ship reporting systems, tides, and surface temperatures.

==Enroute==

Each ''Enroute'' volume contains numbered sectors along a coast or through a strait. Each sector is discussed in turn. A preface with detailed information about authorities, references, and conventions used in each book precedes the sector discussions. A table showing conversions between feet, fathoms, and meters is provided. Finally, each volume provides a list of commonly used abbreviations that may be found in the text.

The chart information graphics, the first items in each sector, are a graphic key for charts and digital nautical charts (DNC) pertaining to a sector. The graduation of the border scale of the chartlets enable navigators to identify the largest scale chart for a location and to find a feature listed in the index-gazetteer.

A foreign terms glossary and a comprehensive index-gazetteer follow the sector discussions.

The index-gazetteer is an alphabetical listing of described and charted features. The index-gazetteer lists each feature by geographic coordinates and sector-paragraph number.

==Sources==
The text of this article originated from sections 402 to 404 of the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'', a document produced by the government of the [[United States|United States of America]] and amended by marine analysts at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

[[File:Shallow water.jpg|thumb|Shallow water]]

'''Shallow water marine environment''' refers to the area between the [[shore]] and deeper water, such as a [[reef]] wall or a shelf break. This environment is characterized by oceanic, geological and biological conditions, as described below. The water in this environment is shallow and clear,&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt; allowing the formation of different sedimentary structures, carbonate rocks, coral reefs, and allowing certain organisms to survive and become fossils.

==Sediment==
The [[sediment]] itself is often composed of [[limestone]], which forms readily in shallow, warm calm waters. The shallow marine environments are not exclusively composed of [[siliciclastic]] or [[carbon]]aceous sediments. While they cannot always coexist, it is possible to have a shallow marine environment composed solely of carbonaceous sediment or one that is composed completely of siliciclastic sediment. Shallow water marine sediment is made up of larger [[grain size]]s, because smaller grains have been washed out to deeper water. Within sedimentary rocks composed of carbonaceous sediment, there may also be [[evaporite]] minerals.&lt;ref name="lib book" /&gt; The most common evaporite minerals found within modern and ancient deposits are gypsum, anhydrite, and halite; they can occur as crystalline layers, isolated crystals or clusters of crystals.&lt;ref name="lib book" /&gt;

In terms of geologic time, it is said that most Phanerozoic sedimentary rock was deposited in shallow marine environments as about 75% of the sedimentary carapace is made up of shallow marine sediments; it is then assumed that Precambrian sedimentary rocks were too, deposited in shallow marine waters, unless it is specifically identified otherwise.&lt;ref name="rise&amp;fall of strom"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters et al.|first1=Shanan|title=The rise and fall of stromatolites in shallow marine environments|journal=Geology|date=2017|volume=45|issue=6|pages=487–490|url=https://pubs-geoscienceworld-org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/geology/article-lookup/45/6/487#ref-25|bibcode=2017Geo....45..487P|doi=10.1130/G38931.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is seen in the North American and Caribbean region.&lt;ref name="sed cycling" /&gt; Also, as a result of supercontinent breakup and other shifting tectonic plate processes, shallow marine sediment displays large variations in terms of quantity in the geologic time.&lt;ref name="sed cycling"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=Shanan|title=Sediment cycling on continental and oceanic crust|journal=Geology|date=2017|volume=45|issue=4|pages=323–326|url=https://pubs-geoscienceworld-org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/geology/article-lookup/45/4/323|bibcode=2017Geo....45..323P|doi=10.1130/G38861.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sedimentary Structures==
Various types of structures form in the shallow marine environments. For example, [[Graded bedding|Graded-bedding]], which occurs when beds have vertical gradation in grain size, with the smallest grains at the top. Also, [[Ripple marks|Ripples]], which are the smallest bedform type, and [[dune]]s, which are similar to ripples except are larger.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

[[File:Palimpsest ripples - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07689.JPG|thumb|Palimpsest ripples - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo]]

Carbonaceous sedimentary rocks with several kinds of sedimentary structures within them can be found in shallow marine environments; they are a group of rocks that have a significant amount of non-skeletal matter along with siliciclastic or chemical constituents.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt; Some examples include:

[[Cross-bedding|Cross stratification]] is a layering structure found in gravel, sand, and coarse silt-sized sediment; the strata are distinct layers of sediment that are steeply inclined to the underlying surfaces of the deposit.&lt;ref name="lib book" /&gt;

[[Mudcrack|Desiccation cracks]] are cracks formed do to drying out of newly deposited mud; these form in [[Subaerial|sub-aerial]] climates.&lt;ref name="lib book" /&gt;

[[Syneresis crack]]s are cracks in mud formed by mechanisms other than sub-aerial climate exposure. These mechanisms include: Contraction caused by the clumping of settled clay sediment, contraction due to the deposition/compaction of a settling clay layer during faulting, compaction of smectitic clay because of lost interlayer water due to a change in salinity in surrounding water, compaction dewatering under sediment causing injection from below or collapsing from above, and tensional openings due to down-sloping of a surface mud layer.&lt;ref name="lib book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demicco, Robert V.|first1=Hardie, Lawrence A.|title=Sedimentary Structures and Early Diagenetic Features of Shallow Marine Carbonate Deposits|date=1994|publisher=Society of Sedimentary Geology|location=Tulsa, Oklahoma|isbn=1-56576-013-1|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenestrae is an open or partially filled space occupied by different sediment or cement in the rock.&lt;ref name="lib book" /&gt;

[[Flame structure]]s is mud shaped like flames that intrude the overlying layer of rock.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

Convolute folds are complicated folds in beds into irregular anticlines and/or synclines.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

[[Fluting (geology)|Flutes]] are outstretched ridges that are rounded at one end and flared at the other.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

Groove casts are outstretched, almost straight grooves in sediment caused by the dragging of an object such as a rock, piece of wood, etc.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

[[Chevron (geology)|Chevron]] structures are a type of groove cast that is v-shaped as a result of two or more stress directions; they occur on the bottoms of beds deposited in shallow water environments.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

==Water composition==
The water in this environment is mostly clear and shallow. It is said that if shallow marine environments can be defined by their distributional patterns of marine organisms in terms of temperature, then deductions can be made from that of the past patterns in terms of paleolithic zones. Today, there are 3 major defining criteria used in defining shallow marine environments, these are: The faunal provinces, the faunal elements, and the degree of latitude. However, the limits of different present-day shallow marine environments in terms of climatic zones are seldom agreed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Clarence A.|title=Shallow-Water Marine Climates and Molluscan Provinces|journal=Ecology|date=1964|volume=45|issue=2|pages=226–234|jstor=1933835|doi=10.2307/1933835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, many shallow marine environments are often times associated with carbonate factory zones. In these zones, processes that remove the CO₂ from water to cause the bicarbonate ions to change into carbonate ions are important and support lime precipitation. Increasing temperature, intense evaporation, and mixing water that is high in CO₃ and low in calcium cations with seawater are some examples of processes that change bicarbonate ions to carbonate ions. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by being dissolved in water and is turned into carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then weathers rocks, creating bicarbonate and other ions. Then the calcium carbonate is a precipitate from calcium and the bicarbonate ions that formed through organisms like coral, and then the carbon is stored in layers of limestone on the seafloor. In terms of geologic time, the composition of limestone has changed from calcite rich limestone to aragonite rich limestone. The presence of magnesium ions at certain concentrations inhibits the ability to precipitate calcite. Aragonite, however, has the same chemical formula as calcite but it is in a different crystal system that is much less prone to the magnesium preventing the precipitation of this mineral, which would prevent it from forming carbonate rocks. At times in geologic history where the Mg and Ca ratio were different, and the seas were more abundant in calcite and this was as a result of the high rates of seafloor spreading because of tectonic plate movement and action. The more spreading, the more the Magnesium gets removed, so more calcite is precipitated, and calcite will be more abundant than aragonite.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

==Organisms==
[[File:Echinoderms 600.jpg|thumb|Echinoderms]]
Some organisms in this environment, specifically those in the intertidal zone, are sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, worms, clams, mussels, predatory crustaceans, barnacles and small fish.&lt;ref name="biology" /&gt; [[Hydrozoa]], or hydroids, also live in shallow marine ecosystems and eat surrounding algae and zooplankton.&lt;ref name="hydroids"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gili et al.|first1=J.M.|title=The impact of small benthic passive suspension feeders in shallow marine ecosystems: the hydroids as an example|journal=Zool. Verh. Leiden|date=1998|volume=323|issue=31|pages=99–105|url=http://repository.naturalis.nl/document/149037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of [[Isopoda|isopods]] and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]] are found in the intertidal zones and create several different burrows and surface tracks in the sediment.&lt;ref name="ichnology" /&gt; Brittle stars have been seen buried in sediment with their arms showing through the sediment; this behaviour has been noted in several shallow marine areas.&lt;ref name="ichnology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gingras et al.|first1=Murray K.|title=Biology of shallow marine ichnology: a modern perspective|journal=Aquatic Biology|date=2008|volume=2|pages=255–268|doi=10.3354/ab00055|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/ab2008/2/b002p255.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, carbonate reefs can be found in the depositional environment that is shallow marine areas; they are host to reefs and organisms that reside in reefs. Recent estimates regarding the numbers of species on coral reefs range from 1–9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dumont|first1=H.J.|title=Marine Biodiversity of Costa Rica, Central America|journal=Monographiae Biologicae|date=2009|volume=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 3 main types of reef formations: fringing reefs, these reefs are attached to the shore, barrier reefs, which are separated from mainland by a lagoon, and atoll reefs.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt; Organisms that live in this environment include red algae, green algae, bivalves and echinoderms.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt; Many of these organisms contribute to the formation of reefs.&lt;ref name="Boggs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boggs|first1=Sam|title=Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-321-64318-6|edition=fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Unicellular [[dinoflagellate]]s live in the tissues of corals, and have a mutualistic relationship in which the dinoflagellates provide the corals with organic molecules.&lt;ref name="biology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reece et al.|first1=Jane|title=Campbell Biology|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|location=Ontario|isbn=978-0-13-418911-6|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossils==      
[[File:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|thumb|Stromatolites in Sharkbay]]
The vast majority of the [[fossil record]] has been found after the shallow water marine environment has been [[Lithification|lithified]]. Many of these [[fossil]]s were deposited at times when much of Earth was covered with shallow seas, supporting a wide variety of organisms.

Several fossils can be found/formed in this environment. Some examples include:

Skolithos [[Ichnofacies]] are trace fossils that are vertical, cylindrical or U-shaped burrows created by organisms for protection.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

Glossifungites ichnofacies are trace fossils that are vertical, cylindrical, U or tear-shaped borings or burrows created by organisms like shrimp, crabs, worms and bivalves.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

[[Stromatolite]]s are fossils that are laminated sedimentary structures that form when cyanobacteria form microbial mats which then trap clay and/or silt sediment and organic materials to form the fossil.&lt;ref name="Boggs" /&gt;

'''Tropical geography''' refers to the study of places and people in the [[tropics]]. When it first emerged as a discipline, tropical geography was closely associated with [[imperialism]] and [[colonial expansion]] of the [[Colonial empire|European empires]] as contributing scholars tended to portray the [[tropical]] places as "primitive" and people "uncivilised" and "inferior".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. "Illusory Riches": Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950. ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography''. 21(1), 2000, 6-18.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of subjects has been discussed within the sub-field during late 18th to early 20th century including zoology, climatology, geomorphology, economics and cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, H.R., 1977. ''Tropical geography: An introductory study of the humid tropics'', Macdonald and Evans,p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is now more commonly known as [[development geography]] as [[colonization]] had been replaced by [[economic development]] as the main ideological driver of international and global interactions since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Gallaher&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&amp;pg=PA118 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |oclc= |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|118}} Today, many scholars continue to use the term tropical geography to contest the determinism embedded in the term and de-exoticise the tropical countries and their inhabitants.

==Origins==
The origins of tropical geography can be traced back to as early as the fifteenth century when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] first discovered the Caribbean islands in tropical America. Subsequent writings of European explorers, merchants, naturalists, colonists and settlers who traveled to and lived in the tropics were the main sources of the study.

[[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] are some of the significant contributors. It is argued that it is due to their academic reputation and scientific approaches tropical geography was consolidated into an academic discipline widely studied in Europe in spite of the region's vast differences in vegetation, wild lives, climate, geology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. pp9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Troubled Representations==

The discourse on the tropics and their inhabitants have evolved over time in response to changing patterns of Europe's engagements in the tropics.

A variety of [[environmental determinism]] emerged from the sub-field as colonists and naturalists started representing temperate and tropical people with [[binaries]] like "progressive vs. backward," "civilised vs. primitive," "hard working vs. lazy" and "superior vs. inferior."&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, p177"&gt;Gilmartin, Mary, 2008. p177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]], an invented concept, was convenient and readily applied in attempts to "[link] climatic variation closely to the supposed division of the human species into different 'races'".&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, p177" /&gt;

As activities of the European empires diversified in the 19th century, travelers and settlers who had experienced deadly tropical diseases and conflicts with the local peoples forged another representation of the tropical world as a place full of "dangers" and "horrors" to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. p10.&lt;/ref&gt; The fertile lands of the tropics were then interpreted as to have  obstacles for human morality and physical well-being preventing their inhabitants from technical, philosophical and artistic innovation. This dramatized and pessimistic representation reinforced Europe's superior position and enhanced the depiction of the tropics as an exotic other to the temperate world.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, V.R., 2004. Topicality Imagined and Experienced. ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography'', 25(1), 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether tropical geographers found the tropical places and people abundant and dynamic or deadly and barbaric. They understood them as inferior to the temperate and great Western civilizations. As criticized by [[Edward Said]] in his famous work ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', the literature of tropical geography served the interests of European scholars who were living in the temperate world to create an exotic other which in turn helped define themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward W., 2007. "Latent and Manifest Orientalism." ''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings.'' pp45-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today's tropical geography==

Until the mid 20th century, the imperialist, racist and Euro-centric version of tropical geography was still flourishing as influential works were still being published like ''Les Pays Tropicaux'' by geomorphologist [[Pierre Gourou]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, D. et al., 2009. ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'' 5th ed., Wiley-Blackwell, p.777.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950's onward, [[development geography]] replaced tropical geography as the sub-field of geography.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, J. &amp; Jeffrey, A. 2009. "Imperialism and Postcolonialism". ''Political Geography'' 2nd ed. Sage, London. pp169-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the studied regions were given new terminologies such as the "[[Third World]]" and the "[[global South]]."

Critical geographers argue the replacement of tropical geography by development geography marks the historical turning point of international intervention strategy from [[colonisation]] to [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="Lawson, p70"&gt;Lawson, Victoria, 2007. "Development as Intervention: From Modernisation to Neo-liberalisation." Making Development Geography. Hodder Arnold. p70.&lt;/ref&gt; Though morphed into a different discipline, the ideological roots of tropical geography—superiority, progress, civilization and technological advancement of the West which originated and matured in the [[temperate]] zone—carry on and become the building blocks of mainstream economic development theories.&lt;ref name="Lawson, p70" /&gt;

Paralleled with the rise of critical approaches to other sub-fields of geography, [[development geography]] and tropical geography as academic disciplines have seen a movement away from the mainstream economistic and deterministic view of the tropical world in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Victoria, 2007. "Development as Situated Knowledge." ''Making Development geography.'' Hodder Arnold. pp10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers now attend to the influences imperialism, racism and Euro-centrism have had on tropical geography while attempting to bring class, gender, race and religion into the broader picture to better understand the tropical world and its inhabitants.
 
Today the [[academic journal]] ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography''&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography. Available at: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9493 [Accessed November 23, 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; continues to be a forum for tropical geographers to introduce and present new research and critique existing literature on the tropical world and people. Different from the historic absence of voices from the tropics, now many of the contributors of the ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography'' are of tropical origins and study tropical countries and their citizens with more holistic and inclusive approaches.

'''Tyrraz''' is a fictional [[fictional planet|artificial planet]] in the 30th century [[DC Universe]].

It is the homeworld of [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legion]] foe [[Tyr (DC Comics)|Tyr]], who was the ruler of this planet.

Tyr had the planet cannibalized and transformed into a mobile world, which then travelled throughout the galaxy attacking other planets.

One of [[The Controllers]] is tasked with stopping it, and begins construction of a [[Sun-Eater]] to destroy it. These plans are foiled when a Legion squad, not knowing its intent, destroy the Sun-Eater factory. The Controller then captures these Legionnaires, explains the situation, and forces them to help him in destroying Tyrraz.

The '''Yangon River''' (also known as the '''Rangoon River''' or '''Hlaing River''') is formed by the confluence of the [[Bago River|Pegu]] and [[Myitmaka River]]s in [[Myanmar]]. It is a marine [[estuary]] that runs from [[Yangon]] (also known as Rangoon) to the [[Gulf of Martaban]] of the [[Andaman Sea]]. The [[Channel (geography)|channel]] is navigable by ocean-going vessels, thus plays a critical role in the [[economy of Myanmar]].

The [[Twante Canal]] connects the  Yangon River with the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], once known as 'the rice bowl of Asia'. It consists of {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} of lush teak plantations and mangrove swamps, many of which have now been cleared for rice production.

'''Ċirkewwa''' is a harbour situated on a point at the northernmost part of [[Malta]].

It is the site of the Ċirkewwa Ferry Terminal, where regular car ferries operate to the port of [[Mġarr (Gozo)|Mġarr]] on [[Gozo]]. In the summer, boat trips to [[Comino]] also operate, as well as organised diving excursions. As Ċirkewwa is a point on the northernmost end of the island, and not a town, there is no infrastructure besides the terminal. Construction of a new terminal at the site, costing around €12 million, was announced in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100507/local/transport-malta-announces-tender-for-construction-of-cirkewwa-terminal|title=Transport Malta announces tender for construction of Cirkewwa terminal|work=[[The Times of Malta]]|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors travelling to Gozo can reach Ċirkewwa by car by following road signs to Gozo, and by bus from [[Valletta]], [[Sliema]], [[Buġibba]] and [[St. Paul's Bay]].

Near the harbour there is a hotel and a sandy beach, [[Paradise Bay (Malta)|Paradise Bay]].

Ċirkewwa is one of the most visited [[Recreational diving|scuba diving]] sites on the Maltese Islands. It has underwater cliffs, caves, tunnels and an arch down to the seabed at 27 m. Ċirkewwa also includes the wrecks of the tugboat [[MV Rozi|MV ''Rozi'']] and the [[Maltese patrol boat P29|P29 patrol boat]], which were intentionally sunk in 1992 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rozi|url=http://www.aquaventuremalta.com/rozi.html|website=AquaVenture Limited|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P29|url=http://www.aquaventuremalta.com/p29.html|website=AquaVenture Limited|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out towards Marfa Point is a statue of the Madonna which was placed in a natural cavern by the Amphibians Diving Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Lesley|last2=Wood|first2=Lawson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gWTQNJhDccC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=%C4%8Airkewwa+ferry&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nntpTab4NYKDhQfDrLXsDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Malta, Comino and Gozo|year=2006|publisher=New Holland Publishers|pages=48–49|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the middle of 2010 divers have been cooperating to designate Ċirkewwa as a Voluntary Marine Reserve. The site now has the support of the diving community which is working to gain the support of the fishing, angling and boating communities to implement a Code of Conduct to preserve and protect the site.

'''Šajkaška''' (Шајкашка) is a historical region in northern [[Serbia]]. It is southeastern part of [[Bačka]], located in the Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]]. Territory of Šajkaška is divided among four municipalities: [[Titel]], [[Žabalj]], [[Novi Sad]], and [[Srbobran]]. Historical center of Šajkaška is [[Titel]].

==Name==
Name ''Šajkaška'' means "land of šajkaši". [[Šajkaši]] were a specific kind of [[Austria]]n army, which moved in narrow, long boats, known as "[[Chaika (boat)|šajka]]". These military units have operated on the [[Danube]], [[Tisza|Tisa]], [[Sava]] and [[Mureş River|Moriš]] rivers. In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the region is known as ''Sajkásvidék'' and in [[German language|German]] as ''Schajkaschka''.

== History ==
After 1400, the majority of the people in Šajkaška were Serbs who had settled the area before or after the Ottoman conquered the Balkan lands to the south . Moving further north, they had become established at csepel Island where they founded Srpski Kovin (Raczkeve). After 1526 and the Battle of Mohacs, they moved to the northern Danube and to the city of Komarno which, for a long time, was the administrative headquarters of the Šajkaš forces. 

After the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, the region was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Most of Šajkaška was included into Habsburg [[Military Frontier]] (its [[Podunavlje|Danube]] and [[Potisje|Tisa]] sections), while one part of the region was included into [[Bács-Bodrog|Bodrog County]]. When these parts of Military Frontier were abolished (in 1750), Šajkaška was included into [[District of Potisje|Theiss District]], which was part of the [[Bács-Bodrog|Batsch-Bodrog County]] within the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]]. In 1763, Šajkaška was excluded from Theiss District and was again placed under military administration. Šajkaš Battalion, as part of [[Military Frontier]], was founded in this area. In the beginning of the Habsburg administration, the population of the region was composed entirely of [[Serbs]], which were brave and skillful warriors. Serb Šajkaši have participated in many battles against [[Ottoman Empire]].
 
By 1739 and the Peace of Belgrade, the border between Austria and Turkey was moved to the Sava and Danube rivers, and at that time, the idea was proposed to move the Šajkaši down from the north. That was done in 1763-1764. 
 [[Image:Vojvodina18 19 cen.png|thumb|Location of the Šajkaš Battalion, 18th-19th century]]
In 1848-1849, region was part of autonomous [[Serbian Vojvodina]], but was again included into Military Frontier in 1849. In 1852, Šajkaš battalion was transformed into [[Titel]] infantry battalion. This military unit was abolished in 1873, and region was again incorporated into [[Bács-Bodrog|Bács-Bodrog County]]. Administratively, territory of Šajkaška was organized into municipality of [[Titel]] and separate municipality of [[Žabalj]] was also later established. In 1910, ethnic [[Serbs]] formed an absolute majority in both municipalities. Besides Serbs who formed majority in most settlements, region was also populated by [[Hungarians]] who formed majority in the village [[Budisava]] and sizable minority in few other settlements, [[Germans]] who formed sizable minority in several settlements and [[Pannonian Rusyns|Rusyns]] who formed sizable minority in [[Đurđevo]].

In 1918, as part of [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] region, Šajkaška became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and then part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later renamed to [[Yugoslavia]]). From 1918 to 1922 Šajkaška was part of the [[Novi Sad]] County, from 1922 to 1929 part of the [[Belgrade]] Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the [[Danube Banovina]]. From 1941 to 1944, region was occupied by the [[Axis Powers]] and was attached to [[Bács-Bodrog|Bács-Bodrog County]] of the [[Miklos Horthy|Horthy's]] [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]]. In 1942 raid, Hungarian occupational authorities killed numerous ethnic [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] in Šajkaška. In 1944, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and [[Yugoslav partisans]] expelled Axis forces from the region and Šajkaška became part of the [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (1945–1963)|autonomous province of Vojvodina]] within new [[SFRY|socialist Yugoslavia]]. Since 1945, AP Vojvodina is part of the [[People's Republic of Serbia]] within Yugoslavia. Today, Šajkaška is mainly agricultural region, with well-developed food industry.
