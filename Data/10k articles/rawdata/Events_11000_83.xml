The '''2013 [[FIA European Truck Racing Championship]]''' was a motor-racing championship using highly tuned [[tractor unit]]s producing over 1000&amp;nbsp;bhp. It was the 29th year of the championship and [[Jochen Hahn]] won the title for the third year in a row with [[MAN SE|MAN]].

Since [[Heinz-Werner Lenz]], who between 1997 and 1999 won the [[FIA European Truck Racing Championship#1994.E2.80.932005 .28FIA European Cups.29|Race-Trucks Class title]] at three consecutive years on his Mercedes-Benz 1938-S, and for the first time since the Super-Race-Truck Class was abolished prior to the opening of the 2006 season, [[Jochen Hahn]] is the first truck racer to win the title [[hat-trick]] on his [[Castrol]] [[Jochen Hahn|Team Hahn Racing]] [[MAN SE|MAN]] race truck.

In 1988, 1989 and 1990, [[Curt Göransson (racing driver)|Curt Göransson]] was the first one to achieve such a success by winning three [[FIA European Truck Racing Championship#1985-993|Class B title]]s in a row on his Volvo N12 race truck.

'''''All the Angels''''' (full title - ''All the Angels: Handel and the First Messiah'') is a 2015 play with music by the British poet [[Nick Drake (poet)|Nick Drake]] treating the [[Messiah (Handel)#Dublin, 1742|1742 Dublin premiere]] of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and the actor-singer [[Susannah Cibber]]'s involvement in it. Other historical figures such as the work's librettist [[Charles Jennens]], the music historian [[Charles Burney]] and the soprano [[Christina Maria Avoglio]] also appear. It draws its name from ''[[Messiah Part II#35|Let all the angels of God worship Him]]'', the chorus of Part II, Scene 4 from ''Messiah'', itself quoting and titled after [[Book of Hebrews|Hebrews 1:6]].

'''Animal hoarding''' is keeping a higher-than-usual number of animals as domestic [[pet]]s without  ability to properly house or care for them, while at the same time [[denial|denying]] this inability. [[Compulsive hoarding]] can be characterized as a symptom of [[mental disorder]] rather than deliberate [[animal cruelty|cruelty towards animals]]. Hoarders are deeply [[attachment theory|attached]] to their pets and find it extremely difficult to let the pets go. They typically cannot comprehend that they are harming their pets by failing to provide them with proper care. Hoarders tend to believe that they provide the right amount of care for them.&lt;ref name="Flaherty"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis |first=Susan |author-link= |last2=Flaherty (illus) |first2=Jake |author2-link= |title=Prosecuting Animal Hoarders is like Herding Cats |journal=California Lawyer |volume= |issue=September |pages=26, 28, 29, 67 |year=2002 |url=http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/pubs/herdingcats.pdf |doi= |id= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040703065120/http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/pubs/herdingcats.pdf |archivedate=July 3, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] provides a "Hoarding Prevention Team", which works with hoarders to help them attain a manageable and healthy number of pets.&lt;ref name="abthoard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/abthoard.htm |author=Hoarding of Animals Research Consortium (HARC) |title=Commonly asked questions about hoarding |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112124000/http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/abthoard.htm |archivedate=2010-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of a hoarder==
An animal hoarder keeps an unusually large number of pets for their premises, and fails to care for them properly. A hoarder is distinguished from an animal [[breeder]], who would have numerous animals as the central component of their business; this distinction can be problematic, however, as some hoarders are former breeders who have ceased selling and caring for their animals, while others will claim to be breeders as a psychological defense mechanism, or in hopes of forestalling intervention. Gary Patronek, director of the Center for Animals and Public Policy at [[Tufts University]], defines hoarding as the "pathological human behavior that involves a compulsive need to obtain and control animals, coupled with a failure to recognize their suffering".&lt;ref name="Patronek2006"&gt;Patronek, Gary J. "Animal hoarding: its roots and recognition." Veterinary Medicine 101.8 (2006): 520.&lt;/ref&gt; According to another study, the distinguishing feature is that a hoarder "fails to provide the animals with adequate food, water, sanitation, and veterinary care, and... is in denial about this inability to provide adequate care."&lt;ref name="longtermoutcomes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/pubs/berry.pdf |format=PDF |authors=Berry, Colin, M.S., Gary Patronek, V.M.D., Ph.D., and Randall Lockwood, Ph.D. |title=Long-Term Outcomes in Animal Hoarding Cases |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303060907/http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/pubs/berry.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other [[compulsive hoarding]] behaviors, it is linked in the [[DSM-IV]] to [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] and [[obsessive compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="mentalhealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.vet.upenn.edu/sheltermedicine/HoardingTaskForce/TheHoardingIssue/tabid/5009/Default.aspx |title=Mental health issues and animal hoarding |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613110502/http://research.vet.upenn.edu/sheltermedicine/HoardingTaskForce/TheHoardingIssue/tabid/5009/Default.aspx |archivedate=2014-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-5 includes a diagnosis of hoarding disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM5"&gt;{{Cite book

Alternatively, animal hoarding could be related to [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]], [[dementia]], or even [[focal delusion]].&lt;ref name="longtermoutcomes" /&gt;

The number of animals involved alone is not a determinative factor in identifying hoarding. Instead, the issue is the owner’s inability to provide care for the animals and the owner’s [[denial|refusal]] to acknowledge that both the animals and the household are deteriorating.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info" /&gt; For instance, in one animal hoarding case, 11 cats were seized from a trailer.&lt;ref name="Leek Leiberan"&gt;{{cite web | last =Leek Leiberan| first = Margaret H. | title = In the Matter of a Protective Order for Jean Marie Primrose| work =pleading | date = March 2006 | url =http://animallaw.info/pleadings/pb_pdf/pbusorcatchampion_appellants_brief_1.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate = 2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy police officer testified that the trailer smelled so bad of urine and feces that despite suffering from severe congestion at the time of the investigation, she had a hard time staying in there for more than a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Leek Leiberan" /&gt; The deputy further testified that she couldn't step anywhere in the trailer without stepping on fresh, old, or smeared fecal matter, and that even the stove and sink were filled with feline waste.&lt;ref name="Leek Leiberan" /&gt; Yet, a Canadian woman, who died leaving 100 properly fed, spayed, neutered, vaccinated, and groomed cats, was not considered an animal hoarder because her animals were properly cared for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avery|first=Lisa|title=From Helping to Hoarding to Hurting:  When the Acts of "Good Samaritans" Become Felony Animal Cruelty|journal=Val. U. L. Rev|date=2005|volume=39|page=826|url=http://scholar.valpo.edu/vulr/vol39/iss4/2|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoarding of Animals Research Consortium (HARC) identifies the following characteristics as common to all hoarders:
* Accumulation of numerous animals, which has overwhelmed that person’s ability to provide even minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, and veterinary care;	
* Failure to acknowledge the deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, starvation, and even death) and the household environment (severe overcrowding, very unsanitary conditions); and−	
* Failure to recognize the negative effect of the collection on their own health and well-being, and on that of other household members.&lt;ref name="animallaw.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animallaw.info/articles/ddushoarding.htm |title=Detailed Discussion of Animal Hoarding |last1=Hayes |first1=Victoria |date=May 2010 |website=The Animal Legal and Historical Center |publisher=Michigan State University College of Law |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compulsive hoarding]] can be characterized as a symptom of [[mental disorder]] rather than deliberate [[animal cruelty|cruelty towards animals]]. Hoarders are deeply [[attachment theory|attached]] to their pets and find it extremely difficult to let the pets go. They typically cannot comprehend that they are harming their pets by failing to provide them with proper care. Hoarders tend to believe that they provide the right amount of care for their pets.&lt;ref name="Flaherty" /&gt; The [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] provides a "Hoarding Prevention Team", which works with hoarders to help them attain a manageable and healthy number of pets.&lt;ref name="abthoard" /&gt;

==Legal solutions==

===United States===

====Animal Cruelty Statutes====

In the United States, animal hoarders can be prosecuted under state [[animal cruelty]] laws for failing to provide a certain level of care to their animals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animallaw.info/articles/ddushoarding.htm |title=Detailed Discussion of Animal Hoarding |last1=Hayes |first1=Victoria  |date= 2010 |website=The Animal Legal and Historical Society |publisher=Michigan State University College of Law  |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following provides some examples of the standards currently in effect. In Alaska, the cruelty statute defines a minimum standard of care for animals that includes (1) food and water sufficient to maintain each animal in good health; (2) an environment compatible with protecting and maintaining the good health and safety of the animal; and (3) reasonable medical care at times and to the extent available and necessary to maintain the animal in good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=3 |number=03.55.100 |language=English |date=2004  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusakst03_55_100.htm#s100 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in Colorado, a person commits cruelty to animals if he or she knowingly, recklessly, or with [[criminal negligence]] deprives an animal of necessary sustenance, neglects any animal, allows the animal to be housed in a manner that results in chronic or repeated serious physical harm, or fails to provide the animal with proper food, drink, or protection from the weather consistent with the [[species]], breed, and type of animal involved.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite act |title=18 |number=18-9-202 |language=English |date=2012  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stuscost18_9_201.htm#s202 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Colorado's animal cruelty statute, “neglect” means failure to provide food, water, protection from the elements, or other care generally considered to be normal, usual, and accepted for an animal's health and well-being consistent with the [[species]], breed, and type of animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=18 |number=18-9-201(4) |language=English |date=2012  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stuscost18_9_201.htm#s201 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since failure to provide proper care for animals is an act of omission or neglect rather than an affirmative act, the failure to care for an animal is considered a [[misdemeanor]] offense in most states.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  For instance, in Alaska, if an animal owner fails to provide the aforementioned standards of care, the state has [[prima facie]] [[evidence]] of a failure to care for an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=11 |number=11.61.140(d) |language=English |date=2010  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusakst03_55_100.htm#s100 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[prosecutor]] can prove the owner’s failure to care for an animal was done with [[criminal negligence]] and the failure to care for the animal caused its death or severe physical pain or prolonged suffering, then the owner may be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=11 |number=11.61.140(a)(2) |language=English |date=2010  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusakst03_55_100.htm#s100 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Colorado, failure to provide an animal with the proper standard of care is a Class 1 misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=18 |number=18-9-202(2)(a) |language=English |date=2012  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stuscost18_9_201.htm#s202 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Virginia, each owner must provide for each of his [[companion animals]]: adequate feed; adequate water; adequate shelter that is properly cleaned; adequate space in the primary enclosure for the particular type of animal depending upon its age, size, [[species]], and weight; adequate exercise; adequate care, treatment, and transportation; and veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering or disease transmission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite act |title=3.2 |number=3.2-6503 |language=English |date=2003 |article=2 |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusvast3_1_796_122_126.htm#s6503 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violation of these standards is a Class 4 misdemeanor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; A second or subsequent violation may result in a higher grade misdemeanor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Likewise, under Virginia's animal cruelty statute, any person who deprives any animal of necessary food, drink, shelter or emergency veterinary treatment is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=3.2 |number=3.2-6570 |language=English |date=2013 |article=9 |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusvast3_1_796_122_126.htm#s6570 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some states, like California and New Hampshire, may provide felony provisions for depriving an animal of necessary sustenance, drink, and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=14|number=597  |language=English |date=2011  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stuscacalpencode597.htm |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=LXII|number=644:8  |language=English |date=2008  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusnhrevstatann644_8.htm#s8 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Colorado, it is a class 6 felony upon a second or subsequent conviction of animal cruelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  In Maine, a person who is guilty of cruelty to animals may face criminal or civil charges at the discretion of the state’s attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=7 |number=4016 |language=English |date=2007  |url=http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusmest_t7_4011_4018.htm#s4016 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Penalties Under State Animal Cruelty Statutes====
Penalties for failing to provide proper care or medical care to animals under state animal cruelty statutes can include fines, animal forfeiture, the cost of care for the seized animals, and jail time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Since animal hoarding is sometimes associated with mental illness, a situation may arise when an alleged animal neglecter is found incompetent to stand trial due to a mental disability and thus remains the rightful owner of the animals he or she has neglected (i.e. the animals were not forfeited). In the Matter of a Protective Order for Jean Marie Primrose, for example, after a tip from a veterinarian, police confiscated 11 cats from a woman’s feces and urine covered, rat infested trailer in Oregon; the cats were then placed in the care of a rescue organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animallaw.info/pleadings/pbusorcatchampion.htm |title=

The rescue organization could have (1) kept the cats and kept accruing care fees because they, not being rightful owners, could not place the cats into homes or (2) forgiven the debt and returned the cats to the woman. Since the rescue organization felt the woman was incapable of adequately caring for the cats and since the organization did not want to invest more money that would likely remain uncompensated, the organization filed a petition for a limited protective order as a fiduciary for the care and placement of the cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animallaw.info/pleadings/pbusorcatchampion.htm |title=

In addition to jail time, animal forfeiture, and fines, a state, such as California, may allow courts to order psychological counseling at the court’s discretion or may require the defendant to undergo anger management, such as the case in Colorado.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Prosecutors may also be able to request bans on future pet ownership or request limits on the number of animals a convicted hoarder may keep.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For instance, in ALDF v.Conyers, over one hundred dogs and nine birds were confiscated from the defendants’ home.&lt;ref name="ALDF v. Conyers"/&gt; About 70 of those dogs had severe oral disease, disintegrating jaws, and scarred corneas. One dog, who was caged in the basement, could barely stand up and kept soiling himself, which lead to his skin being scalded from the urine and feces.&lt;ref name="ALDF v.

====Criticism of Applying Animal Cruelty Laws To Hoarding====

Although animal hoarders can be prosecuted under state animal cruelty laws, many scholars maintain that basic animal cruelty laws are inefficient in prosecuting hoarders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   As Stephan Otto, director of legislative affairs for the Animal Legal Defense Fund explains:  “Only a handful of states allow felony charges for the worst kinds of animal neglect . . . They also need stronger laws that take into account when multiple numbers of animals were in involved in a case.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  HARC’s research on 56 animal hoarding cases illustrates Otto’s point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In sixteen cases, individuals were charged with one count of animal cruelty for their entire group of animals rather than one count of cruelty for each animal involved. In several other cases, hoarders were only charged with one count of failure to license or provide a rabies vaccination when there were dozens of animals involved.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prosecutors and judges, however, discourage multiple charges, believing that they “clog” the system. The difficulty of proving each charge also accounts for this discouragement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In order to bring one charge of cruelty for each animal, prosecutors and animal agencies must provide proof of cruelty to each animal, matching each animal with its count number.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Charging the hoarder with only one count reduces the burdens on the system, the prosecutors, and the animal agencies, but undermines the severity of the charges.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Hoarding Specific Laws====
Currently, only two states have animal hoarding specific laws: Illinois and Hawaii.

Passed in 2001, the Illinois Humane Care for Animal Act was amended to include a definition a companion animal hoarder and mandated psychological counseling for animal hoarders who violate Section 3.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A person convicted of violating section 3 of the Act (which requires the provision of food and water, adequate shelter and protection from the weather, veterinary care, and humane care and treatment) is guilty of a misdemeanor with a second or subsequent violation raising the offense to a Class 4 felony.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One commentator, Victoria Hayes, JD, believed that although Illinois’ legal definition of a “companion animal hoarder” is a step in the direction, the definition does not provide any extra tools to a prosecutor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Animal hoarding itself is not prohibited by the statute, she said, the prosecutor must still show a violation of Section 3 of the Humane Care for Animals Act. It is important to note that animal hoarding itself is not prohibited by the Illinois statute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Hawaii, on the other hand, specifically outlaws animal hoarding.  In 2008, animal hoarding became a misdemeanor offense.  Hawaii’s Penal Code now provides:

(1) item A person commits the offense of animal hoarding if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* (a) Possesses more than fifteen dogs, cats, or a combination of dogs and cats;
* (b) Fails to provide necessary sustenance for each dog or cat; and
* (c) Fails to correct the conditions under which the dogs or cats are living, where conditions injurious to the dogs’, cats’, or owner’s health and well-being result from the person’s failure to provide necessary sustenance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(2) Animal hoarding is a misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=37 |number=711-1109.6 |language=English |date=2009  |url=http://animallaw.info/statutes/stushist711_1109.htm#s1109_6 |access-date=2014-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Hawaii's law specifically criminalizes hoarding, while depriving an animal of necessary sustenance can also constitute a separate offense of animal cruelty.  The hoarding law differs from ordinances that limit the number of pets a person can have because it only prohibits keeping more than fifteen dogs and cats if the owner fails to provide necessary care for the animals and that failure causes injury to the animals or the owner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

An important aspect of this law is that prosecutors may be able to charge hoarders with one count of animal hoarding that covers all of the animals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  When hoarding is prosecuted under state animal cruelty laws, prosecutors must charge hoarders with multiple counts of animal cruelty¬—one for each animal on the premises.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  By creating the offense of “hoarding” Hawaii’s law seems to allow prosecutors to charge hoarders with one count of animal hoarding that covers every animal the person has hoarded, easing the prosecution’s burden of providing documentation of each individual animal’s injury.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  This will also decrease the cumbersome burden multiple charges can place on courts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Prosecutors will also be able to bring separate charges of animal cruelty for individual animals whose injuries are easiest to document.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Hawaii’s statute does not mandate psychological counseling for convicted hoarders or restrict future animal ownership, however.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Anti-hoarding legislation has been proposed, but not passed, in several other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspca.org/about-us/faq/are-there-laws-against-animal-hoarding |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Animal Hoarding |last1=ASPCA |date=2010 |website=ASPCA |publisher=ASPCA |accessdate=2014-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181606/http://www.aspca.org/about-us/faq/are-there-laws-against-animal-hoarding |archive-date=2014-04-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hoarding Specific Municipal Ordinances====

While a state may not have an animal hoarding specific statute, its municipalities may have animal hoarding specific ordinances. For instance, the city of Alto, Georgia’s ordinance specifically prohibits hoarders.&lt;ref name="Alto, Georgia Ordinance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alto, Georgia Ordinance|url=http://animallaw.info/local/lousgaalto.htm|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ordinance defines a hoarder as a person or entity that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) Collects animals and fails to provide them with humane/adequate care;
(b) Collects dead animals that are not properly disposed of as required by this article; or
(c) Collects, houses, or harbors animals in filthy, unsanitary conditions that constitute a health hazard to the animals being kept, and/or to the animals or residents of adjacent property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="Alto, Georgia Ordinance"/&gt;

If a person is convicted of being a hoarder under this ordinance, that person may not own, possess, or have on his premises in Alto any animal for one year from the date of conviction. The person may also be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 and/or by imprisonment in the common jail of the town not to exceed six months.
&lt;ref name="Alto, Georgia Ordinance"/&gt;

The Animal Law Coalition has a Model Animal Hoarding Specific Ordinance (available under “Resources” at its website) that can be adapted by various communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Law Coalition|url=http://www.animallawcoalition.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversially, a municipality may limit the number of pets a person is allowed to keep in his or her home in hopes of preventing animal hoarding. These are called pet limitation ordinances. Gary J. Patronek, in The Problem of Animal Hoarding, Municipal Lawyer 6 (2001), stated that pet limitation ordinances are “wildly unpopular, difficult to enforce, and likely to be opposed by a broad coalition of pet fanciers, breeders, rescue groups, and animal protection organizations.” While a hoarding specific ordinance, like Alto, prohibits keeping numerous animals in conditions that are harmful to the animals’ health, pet limitation ordinances simply prohibit keeping more than a certain number of animals regardless of the level of care provided to the animals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As mentioned previously in this article, the number of animals involved alone is not a determinative factor in identifying hoarding and it is possible for a person to successfully care for a large number of animals. Examples of pet limitation ordinances include: Aurora, Colorado  and Banks County, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aurora, Colorado Ordinance|url=http://animallaw.info/local/louscoaurora.htm#s71|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banks County, Georgia Ordinance|url=http://animallaw.info/local/lousgabankscountyzoningandnumberofanimals.htm|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Banks County, Georgia, the number of dogs a person can own differs based on the zone in which the person's property is located.

Some pet limitation ordinances, however, provide exemptions to the pet restrictions. For instance, in Great Falls, Montana, a person who owns or harbors any more than the number of dogs and cats permitted by the ordinance for a period of more than thirty (30) days must obtain a multiple animal permit. Additionally, a breeder can be exempt from the ordinance by obtaining a Multiple Animal Hobby Breeder Permit. These exemptions are, no doubt, provided to lessen the opposition and problems of pet limitation ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Falls, MontanaOrdinance|url=http://animallaw.info/local/lousmtgreatfallshoarding.htm|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems with Prosecuting Hoarders====

Prosecuting animal hoarding cases is “complex, time consuming, and costly; as made evident in the Primrose case, the high cost of caring for animals rescued from hoarders, who often must be cared for at the rescuer’s expense, is a huge disincentive for prosecuting these types of cases. Especially since the animal rescue operation may never be compensated for its expenses. Further, as Dr. Gary Patronek explains, “[p]rosecutors don’t really have the tools they need to fully go after these cases . . . and they often don’t have the support of other agencies that they need.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  This lack of communication among various governmental agencies, such as code enforcement, the health department, and animal control, impedes the detection of animal hoarders and thereby the prosecution of hoarders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Further, since animal hoarding cases do not get widespread attention, they do not garner community support, which is also a disincentive for prosecution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, officials may opt to forgo charges or enter into lenient plea-bargains in exchange for custody of the animals because they fear that the animals will languish in shelters while prosecution is pending.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These attempts to “strike a balance between helping both the hoarder and the animals involved” are generally ineffective because of high recidivism rates among hoarders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
When hoarders are prosecuted, there is broad inconsistency in the number and severity of charges brought.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These inconsistencies may arise because some prosecutors and judges discourage multiple charges, believing that they “clog” the system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The difficulty of proving each charge also accounts for these inconsistencies. In order to bring one charge of cruelty for each animal, prosecutors and animal agencies must provide proof of cruelty to each animal, matching each animal with its count number.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Adversely, charging the hoarder with only one count reduces the burdens on the system, the prosecutors, and the animal agencies, but undermines the severity of the charges.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Laws that create a separate offense of animal hoarding may solve this problem by allowing one count of hoarding to be brought in every case that encompasses the hoarding aspect of the charge rather than focusing on each individual count of cruelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], an [[RSPCA]] spokeswoman said the society was campaigning for legislation to monitor people who take in large numbers of animals.&lt;ref name="BBCN-01"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers of hoarding animals==
The health issues in animal hoarding encompass a variety of concerns related to both individual and public health. Animal hoarding is the cause of many severe health risks that threaten the hoarded animals, individuals living in hoarding residences, and surrounding neighbors.

=== Health effects on animals ===
Due to the harmful effects on the health of the animals involved, animal hoarding is considered a form of [[animal cruelty]].&lt;ref name="Patronek2006"/&gt; Hoarders often fail to provide basic care for their animals, thus resulting in disease and often death. The primary animal health issues involved are [[malnourishment]] and problems related to [[overcrowding]] and neglect. Consequences of hoarding are long-lasting and continue to affect the animals even after they have been rescued and provided with better care.&lt;ref name="Berry2005"&gt;Berry, Colin, Gary Patronek, and Randy Lockwood. "Long-term outcomes in animal hoarding cases." Animal Law 11 (2005): 167-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malnourishment ====
Lack of sufficient food and water is a common feature of hoarding situations. The immediate consequence of this is starvation and death.&lt;ref name="Patronek2006"/&gt; One study found at least one dead animal present in over half of examined cases, the leading cause of death being an insufficient food and water supply.&lt;ref name="Patronek1999"&gt;Patronek, Gary. "Hoarding of animals: an under-recognized problem in a difficult to study population." Public Health Reports (Hyattsville) 114.1 (1999-02): 81-88. {{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malnourishment also leads to increased susceptibility to disease, and the hoarded animals are often in advanced stages of sickness.&lt;ref name="Patronek1999"/&gt; Furthermore, when there is a limited food supply, animals may resort to aggressive behavior in competing for available food, killing and sometimes even eating other animals.&lt;ref name="HARC"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hoarding of Animals Research Consortium (HARC)|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=2007-12-07|url=http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overcrowding ====
Overcrowding also leads to acute animal health problems in hoarding situations. The number of animals found in hoarding cases range from dozens to several hundreds, with extreme cases involving over a thousand animals. Animals are confined to houses, apartments, or trailer-homes.&lt;ref name="Patronek1999"/&gt; In one case, 306 cats were removed from a home, 87 of which were dead. Corpses were found embedded in the chimney and living room furniture.&lt;ref name="Patronek2006"/&gt; In addition to lack of living space, overcrowding facilitates the spread of diseases among animals.&lt;ref name="HARC"/&gt; Furthermore, in cases where more than one species is confined to the same living space, animals can pose a danger to one other due to inter-species aggression.&lt;ref name="Patronek2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patronek |first=Gary |title=Large scale removal and rescue of animals |work=Hoarding of Animals Research Consortium |date=18 November 2007 |url=http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/pubs/removeresc.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=Tufts University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013175448/http://www.tufts.edu/vet/cfa/hoarding/pubs/removeresc.pdf |archivedate=October 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Owner neglect ====
Various other health problems arise from hoarders' neglect of and inability to provide basic care for the animals. Lack of veterinary attention is notable among these. Hoarders, refusing to acknowledge the deteriorating health conditions of their animals and scared they will be forced to give up custody, often refuse to take their animals to veterinarians.&lt;ref name="Berry2005"/&gt; As a result, diseases are left untreated and allowed to become more severe. Another problem tied to neglect is poor sanitary conditions for the animals. Basic animal waste management is absent in virtually all animal-hoarding situations, and animals are filthy and often infected with parasites as a result.&lt;ref name="HARC"/&gt; Furthermore, animals suffer behaviorally from a lack of socialization caused by an absence of normal interaction with other animals.&lt;ref name="Berry2005"/&gt;

==== Lasting consequences ====
Many of these health problems continue to cause suffering even after the animals are rescued. Strained animal shelters or humane societies, forced to prioritize when dealing with numerous rescued animals, may be unable to provide immediate treatment to many animals.&lt;ref name="Patronek2007"/&gt; Furthermore, many of the rescued animals, due to health or behavioral problems, may not be suitable for adoption.&lt;ref name="Berry2005"/&gt; [[Euthanasia]], even in cases where the animals are not beyond rehabilitation, is often the only option for rescued animals.&lt;ref name="Patronek2007"/&gt; The effects of hoarding on the health and socialization of the animals involved are severe and lasting, taking heavy tolls on both their physical and psychological well-being.

=== Health effects on humans ===
Animal hoarding also causes many health problems for the people involved. Hoarders, by definition, fail to correct the deteriorating sanitary conditions of their living spaces, and this gives rise to several health risks for those living in and around hoarding residences.&lt;ref name="Patronek2006"/&gt; Animal hoarding is at the root of a string of human health problems including poor sanitation, [[fire hazards]], [[Zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], [[envenomation]], and neglect of oneself and dependents.

==== Sanitation concerns ====
Poor sanitation practices, a general characteristic of hoarding households, pose health risks to both animals and humans. In typical hoarding residences, animal waste is found coating interior surfaces, including beds, countertops, and cupboards.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arluke|first=Arnie|title=Health Implications of Animal Hoarding|journal=Health &amp; Social Work|volume=27|issue=2|date=May 2002|pages=125|doi=10.1093/hsw/27.2.125|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, floors and other surfaces were found to be covered in a six-inch layer of feces and garbage.&lt;ref name="Patronek2006"/&gt;

In addition to severe odors which may pose a nuisance to neighbors, animal waste poses serious health risks through both the spread of parasites and the presence of noxious [[ammonia]] levels.&lt;ref name="HARC"/&gt; [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], the United States agency regulating air quality standards in work-related environments, has identified an ammonia level of 300 parts per million as life-threatening for humans;&lt;ref name="Berry2005"/&gt; in many hoarding cases the atmospheric ammonia level in the housing space approaches this number,&lt;ref name="Patronek2007"/&gt; requiring the use of protective clothing and breathing apparati during inspections or interventions.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt; In an extreme case, the ammonia level in the hoarder's house was 152 parts per million even after ventilation.&lt;ref name="Berry2005"/&gt;

The presence of animal waste also prevents sanitary storage and preparation of food, which puts residents at risk of contracting food-related illnesses and parasites.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt; Insect and rodent infestation can both follow and worsen hoarding conditions, and can potentially spread to the surrounding environment including to nearby buildings.&lt;ref name="Patronek2007"/&gt; In one case, an elementary school had to be shut down due to a flea infestation that had spread from a nearby dog hoarder residence.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt;

Hoarders are frequently found to collect large numbers of inanimate objects in addition to animals,&lt;ref name="Patronek1999"/&gt; giving rise to clutter as well. Hoarded objects can include newspapers, trash, clothing, and food; the clutter inhibits normal movement around the house, hampering household maintenance and sanitary food preparation, heightening the risk of accidents, and contributing to the overall level of squalor.&lt;ref name="Patronek1999"/&gt; A lack of functioning toilets, sinks, electricity, or proper heating (often due to hoarders not paying bills, though poor maintenance may also be a cause) further exacerbates the problem.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt; Fire hazards comprise yet another health issue tied to poor sanitation;&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt; the clutter found in many hoarding households prevents workable [[fire escape]] plans and serves as possible fuel when located close to heat sources. The risk is amplified when hoarders, due to inoperative heating systems, seek alternate heating methods such as fireplaces, stoves, or kerosene heaters.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patronek2001"&gt;Patronek, Gary. "The Problem of Animal Hoarding." Animal Law May/June 2001: 6-9, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Zoonotic diseases ====
Another human health issue caused by animal hoarding is the risk of zoonotic diseases. Defined as "human diseases acquired from or transmitted to any other vertebrate animal",&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;"animal disease." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 8 Dec. 2007 &lt;http://search.eb.com/eb/article-63292&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; zoonotic diseases can often be lethal and in all cases constitute a serious public health concern. Examples of well-known zoonotic diseases include [[bubonic plague]], [[influenza]], and [[rabies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=zoonosis|work=A Dictionary of Public Health: Oxford Reference Online|first=Ed. John M.|last=Last|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common domesticated animals constitute a large portion of animals carrying zoonoses,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and as a result, humans involved in animal hoarding situations are at particular risk of contracting disease.&lt;ref name="Patronek1999"/&gt; Zoonoses that may arise in hoarding situations&amp;mdash;through vectors such as dog, [[Feline zoonosis|cat]], or rat bites&amp;mdash;include rabies, [[salmonellosis]], [[catscratch fever]], [[hookworm]], and [[ringworm]].&lt;ref&gt;John M. Last "animals as carriers of disease" The Oxford Companion to Medicine. Stephen Lock, John M. Last, and George Dunea. Oxford University Press 2001. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. Brigham Young University (BYU). 8 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; One zoonosis of special concern is [[toxoplasmosis]], which can be transmitted to humans through cat feces or badly-prepared meat, and is known to cause severe [[birth defects]] or stillbirth in the case of infected pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;"toxoplasmosis" A Dictionary of Public Health. Ed. John M. Last, Oxford University Press, 2007. Oxford Reference Online. Brigham Young University. 8 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of zoonotic diseases is amplified by the possibility of community epidemics.

==== Self-neglect and child/elder abuse ====
{{Main|Diogenes syndrome}}
The problems of [[self-neglect]] and [[Elder abuse|elder]] and [[child abuse]] are also health problems associated with animal hoarding. Self-neglect can be defined as "the inability to provide for oneself the goods or services to meet basic needs", and has been shown to be an "independent risk factor for death".&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Carmel Bitondo, et al. "Self-Neglect Among the Elderly: A Model Based on More Than 500 Patients Seen by a Geriatric Medicine Team." American Journal of Public Health. 97 (2007-09): 1671.&lt;/ref&gt; While self-neglect is a condition generally associated with the elderly, animal hoarders of any age can and do suffer from it.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt; This is demonstrated by the fact that hoarders' lifestyles often match the degenerate sanitary conditions that surround them. Child and elder abuse arise when dependents are living with the hoarder. According to one study, dependents lived with hoarders in over half of the cases.&lt;ref name="Berry2005"/&gt; As with his or her animals, the hoarder often fails to provide adequate care for dependents both young and old, who suffer from a lack of basic necessities as well as the health problems caused by unsanitary conditions.&lt;ref name="Patronek1999"/&gt; In one case, two children of a couple hoarding 58 cats and other animals were forced to repeat kindergarten and first grade because of excessive absence due to respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt; Self-neglect and neglect of dependents make up a major human health concern of animal hoarding.

== Mental health issues ==
Evidence suggests that there is "a strong mental health component" in animal hoarding, though it has not been firmly linked to any specific psychological disorder.&lt;ref name="Patronek2001"/&gt; Models that have been projected to explain animal hoarding include [[delusional disorder]], [[attachment disorder]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], [[zoophilia]], [[dementia]], and addiction.&lt;ref name="frost2000"/&gt; Direct evidence for most is lacking, however.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt;

=== Delusional disorder ===
Animal hoarders display symptoms of delusional disorder in that they have a "belief system out of touch with reality".&lt;ref name="Patronek2001"/&gt; Virtually all hoarders lack insight into the extent of deterioration in their habitations and on the health of their animals, refusing to acknowledge that anything is wrong.&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt; Furthermore, hoarders may believe they have "a special ability to communicate and/or empathize with animals",&lt;ref name="frost2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=Randy|title=People Who Hoard Animals|journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=17|issue=4|year=2000|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/54031?pageNumber=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting any offers of assistance. Delusional disorder is an effective model in that it offers an explanation of hoarders' apparent blindness to the realities of their situations.

=== Attachment disorder ===
Another model that has been suggested to explain animal hoarding is [[attachment disorder]], which is primarily caused by poor parent-child relationships during childhood. It is characterized by an inability to form "close relationships [with other humans] in adulthood".&lt;ref name="frost2000"/&gt; As a result, those suffering from attachment disorder may turn to animals for [[companionship]]. Interviews with animal hoarders have revealed that hoarders have often experienced domestic trauma in childhood, which is the basis of the evidence for this model.&lt;ref name="frost2000"/&gt;

=== Obsessive–compulsive disorder ===
Perhaps the strongest psychological model put forward to explain animal hoarding is [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD). An overwhelming sense of responsibility for something is characteristic of people with OCD, who then take unrealistic measures to fulfill their perceived duty. Animal hoarders often feel a strong sense of responsibility to take care of and protect animals, and their solution&amp;mdash;that of acquiring as many animals as they possibly can&amp;mdash;is unrealistic.&lt;ref name="frost2000"/&gt; Further, the hoarding of inanimate objects, practiced by a majority of animal hoarders,&lt;ref name="Arluke2002"/&gt; is a fairly common occurrence in people with OCD.&lt;ref name="frost2000"/&gt; These connections between animal hoarding and obsessive–compulsive disorder suggest that OCD may be a useful model in explaining animal hoarding behavior.&lt;ref name="frost2000"/&gt; However, this theory has also been refuted by some; Dr. Akimitsu Yokoyama theorizes that animal hoarding could be explained using [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philips|first=Allie|title=Defending the Defenseless: A Guide to Protecting and Advocating for Pets|page=125|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781442202146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture and fiction==
* On the [[Animal Planet]] TV series ''Confessions: Animal Hoarding'', friends and family of animal hoarders intervene to offer them support to make a change in the form of psychological help and veterinary care or placement for their pets.
* In the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', animal hoarding is represented by the semi-recurring character [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Crazy Cat Lady|Crazy Cat Lady]] Eleanor Abernathy. She is a mentally ill old woman covered by cats, who is often seen speaking in gibberish and throwing cats at people.
* In [[Ann Bannon]]'s novel ''[[Journey to a Woman]]'', Vega's mother and grandfather own an excessive number of cats and could be considered to be animal hoarders.
* In webtoon [[Lookism (manhwa)|Lookism]], an arc featuring an animal hoarder nabbed both Daniel Park and Johan Song's dogs. But she was later released after posting bail and restarted her hoarding.

'''''Breach''''' is a 2007 American [[spy film|spy]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Billy Ray (screenwriter)|Billy Ray]]. The screenplay, written by Ray, Adam Mazer and William Rotko, is based on the true story of [[Robert Hanssen]], an [[FBI]] agent convicted of spying for the [[Soviet Union]] and later [[Russia]] for more than two decades, and [[Eric O'Neill]], who worked as his assistant and helped bring about his downfall. O'Neill served as a consultant on the film. The film received generally positive reviews.

==Plot==
[[Eric O'Neill]] ([[Ryan Phillippe]]) is a young [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] employee assigned to work undercover as a clerk to [[Robert Hanssen]] ([[Chris Cooper]]), a senior agent he is told is suspected of being a [[sexual deviant]]. Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the [[State Department]] to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in [[Information Assurance]].
Initially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the [[bureaucracy]] of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly "shoot guns" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's [[information technology]] systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies.

Eventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana ([[Caroline Dhavernas]]), who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] who is also a member of [[Opus Dei]], Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular [[East German]]-born wife to become active churchgoers.

O'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, so he confronts his handler in the [[undercover]] assignment, Kate Burroughs ([[Laura Linney]]), and she admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration. Hanssen is suspected of spying for the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]] for years and being responsible for the deaths of agents working for the United States. The entire Information Assurance Division that Hanssen now heads was created specifically to lure him away from his previous job as liaison to the State Department, and his office was specially constructed with hidden surveillance equipment. The investigation already includes fifty agents, and is personally overseen by FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]], who has been reading O'Neill's reports on Hanssen.

Although the FBI already has enough evidence to arrest Hanssen, director Freeh wants to catch Hanssen in the act of making a drop so that their case against him will be airtight, ensuring that he will cooperate once arrested and not retaliate by exposing more undercover agents and informants. O'Neill is ordered to obtain data from Hanssen's [[Palm Pilot]] and keep him occupied while FBI agents search his car and plant [[covert listening device]]s in it.

The tracking devices in Hanssen's car cause interference with the radio, which makes Hanssen suspicious. He also wonders why he was placed in an isolated position in the FBI only a few months before he is scheduled to retire. He tells O'Neill he believes he is being watched by Russian agents. The FBI intercepts a message he sends to his Russian handlers saying he will not provide any more information. O'Neill persuades Hanssen that he is not being trailed by the Russians or by him on behalf of the FBI. With his confidence restored, Hanssen makes one last [[dead drop]] of stolen information and the FBI catches him in the act.

Although he is assured promotion, O'Neill is discouraged with the toll the case has taken on his marriage and opts to leave the agency. When O'Neill leaves his office with his belongings, he unexpectedly encounters Hanssen in an elevator being escorted by arresting officers. A tearful Hanssen asks O'Neill to [[intercession|pray on his behalf]], and O'Neill promises he will.

==Critical reception==
The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported 84% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 167 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/breach/ |title=Breach |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 36 reviews.&lt;ref name="metacritic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/breach|title=Breach|work=Metacritic|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "One of the strengths of ''Breach'', a thriller that manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending, is how well it captures the utter banality of this man and his world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis |first=Manohla |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/02/16/movies/16brea.html |title=What Will My Spy Be? Capitalist, Drone, Deviant... |publisher=The NY Times |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film 3½ out of four stars, calling it a "steadily gripping hothouse of a thriller." He added, "Director and co-writer Billy Ray, who detailed the misconduct of journalist [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]] at ''[[The New Republic]]'' in 2003's ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]'' ... proves himself a filmmaker of uncommon talent and ambition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travers |first=Peter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/breach-20070216 |title=Breach |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruthe Stein of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' commented, "''Breach'' suffers from lavishing so much attention on a relatively minor figure ... O'Neill, at least the way he's presented, isn't a particularly compelling character, and he is made less so by Phillippe's lackluster performance ... [The film] expends too much energy on a minor functionary, but it is still worth seeing for its fleeting looks into a heart of darkness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stein |first=Ruthe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Breach-all-but-ignores-fascinating-bad-guy-2617280.php |title='Breach' all but ignores fascinating bad guy |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Rainer of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' named ''Breach'' the best film of the year.&lt;ref name="metacritic.com"/&gt; [[Richard Schickel]] of  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' ranked it #6 and called Chris Cooper's performance "brilliant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schickel |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1692271,00.html |title=50 Top 10 Lists of 2007 |publisher=Time.com |date=December 9, 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hunter of  ''[[The Washington Post]]'' named it the ninth best film of 2007.&lt;ref name="metacritic.com"/&gt;

==Box office==
The film opened on 1,489 theaters screens in the US and earned $10,504,990 on its opening weekend, ranking #6 among all films in release. It eventually grossed $33,231,264 domestically and $7,722,671 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $40,953,935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=breach.htm |title=Breach |publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com |date=April 12, 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers fictionalized much of Eric O'Neill's story, as mentioned in the [[end credits]]. Among the major changes made for the film:

* The real O'Neill knew going in that Hanssen was the subject of a counterintelligence investigation.&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/breach/a/breach020207_2.htm |title=Billy Ray and Eric O'Neill Discuss "Breach" |publisher=About.com |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607034444/http://movies.about.com/od/breach/a/breach020207_2.htm# |archive-date=2011-06-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no cover story about sexual perversions and no dramatic meeting where O'Neill learned the truth.
* There was no extensive contact outside the office between O'Neill and Hanssen as portrayed in the film (the O'Neills visiting the Hanssens, the Hanssens dropping by O'Neill's apartment). However, Hanssen did take O'Neill to church.
* The scene in which Hanssen takes O'Neill out into the woods and drunkenly fires his pistol is fictional.&lt;ref name=abcint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2890356&amp;page=1 |title='Breach': Secrets and Double Lives |publisher=ABC News |date=February 20, 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlike in the movie, O'Neill never saw Hanssen after the arrest.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;
* While O'Neill did obtain Hanssen's PDA, he took it to FBI technicians to download rather than downloading it himself.&lt;ref name=abcint/&gt;
* As he was getting arrested, Hanssen said, ''"What took you so long?"''; whereas the film portrays Hanssen repeating, ''"Guns won't be necessary."
*  Richard "Rich" Garces is a Latin American.

'''Charles Alfred Cruft''' (28 June 1852 – 10 September 1938) was a British showman who founded the [[Crufts]] dog show. Charles first became involved with dogs when he began to work at [[Spratt's]], a manufacturer of [[dog biscuit]]s. He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first dog show at the 1878 [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]]. After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895. He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for [[Schipperke]]s, [[Pug]]s and [[Borzoi]]s. He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one [[Saint Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]] in his memoirs, published posthumously.

==Early life and Spratts==

Charles Cruft was born on 28 June 1852, one of four children.&lt;ref name=jackson31&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth, Charles attended [[Ardingly College]] in Sussex, and [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] in London.&lt;ref name=jackson11&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Cruft first followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a manufacturing jeweller but he ultimately decided that the career was not for him and left the business in 1865.&lt;ref name=doggypeople&gt;{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Charles Henry|title=Dog shows and doggy people|year=1902|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|pages=84–85|url=https://archive.org/stream/dogshowsdoggypeo00lanerich#page/84/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to apply for the post of office boy in the Holborn shop of James Spratt, the manufacturer of [[Spratt's]] [[dog biscuit]]s. He was recruited by Spratt, who would later go on to say that Cruft had lent forward in the interview at one point whilst talking about the business and said "You know, I think this kind of business ought to do very well, I do honestly."&lt;ref name=timesobituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Mr. Charles Cruft, Founder Of The Dog Show|page=14|issue=48097|newspaper=The Times|date=12 September 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruft overhauled the bookkeeping in the shop, changing it from a system using crosses to distinguish between wholesale and retail customers to a far more detailed system.&lt;ref name=growthtimes /&gt; The [[Maltese cross]] that was previously used in the bookkeeping was later instead stamped onto the biscuits as a type of trademark to distinguish Spratt's biscuits from other dog biscuits.&lt;ref name=jackson16&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months after joining, Crufts convinced Spratt to hire a new boy to work in the shop to free himself up to solicit orders for the dog biscuits from gamekeepers, promoters of dog shows and the like. He saw a connection between improved feeding and [[Purebred (dog)|purebred]] dogs, and so supported the foundation of canine societies.&lt;ref name=timesobituary/&gt; As part of this new role, he was expected to have attended the "Grand National Exhibitions of Sporting and other Dogs" at [[The Crystal Palace]], London, annually between 1870 and 1872. These early shows were unsuccessful financially and were not continued.&lt;ref name=growthtimes /&gt; Whilst at Spratt's, Cruft gradually rose to the role of general manager, after being head of their Show Department for several years.&lt;ref name=doggypeople/&gt; At the age of 26, some twelve years after leaving the jewellery business, Cruft was made office manager.&lt;ref name=jackson13&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The Spratt's dog biscuits became the forerunner of the modern dry [[dog food]], and under Cruft's work the company went from a single small shop to the British leader in these types of products.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite news|last=Deeley|first=Dawne|title=Crufts timeline|url=http://www.dogsincanada.com/crufts-timeline|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=Dogs in Canada|date=4 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927132550/http://www.dogsincanada.com/crufts-timeline|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conformation shows==
In 1878, whilst still working for Spratt's, Cruft travelled across Europe to expand the biscuit business.&lt;ref name=historydfscrufts/&gt; Whilst in France, he was invited to run the dog show at the third [[World's Fair]] whilst he was there promoting Spratt's dog cake,&lt;ref name=dogeatdog&gt;{{cite news|title=Dog eat dog|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3602137/Dog-eat-dog.html|accessdate=30 August 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]].&lt;ref name=historydfscrufts&gt;{{cite web|title=History of dfs Crufts|url=http://www.crufts.org.uk/history-crufts|publisher=Crufts.org.uk|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further offers to run shows came in for Cruft, including an offer to become Secretary of the Dutch Kennel Club, and an offer to run the livestock section of the [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]] International Exhibitions.&lt;ref name=jackson18&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; He took up job offers to run the shows for the [[Scottish Kennel Club]], and became manager of the poultry section of the shows of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]]. He also co-founded and became club secretary of the [[Schipperke]] Club of Brussels.&lt;ref name=jackson18/&gt;

By the time Cruft turned 30 in 1882, Spratts had been sold to Edward Wylan who in turn promoted Charles first to "Chief Traveller", and then to general manager. Under Crufts guidance, the company diversified its product base and expanded into game bird and poultry food markets, as well as producing a range of accessories for cats and dogs. Cruft himself became secretary of the [[King Charles Spaniel|Toy Spaniel]] Club and the [[Pug]] Dog Club. He was also involved in clubs which promoted the [[Saint Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]] and [[Borzoi]] breeds.&lt;ref name=jackson17 /&gt;

In 1886, Cruft was approached to run a [[Conformation showing|dog show]] for [[terrier]]s in London by the [[Kathleen, Duchess of Newcastle|Duchess of Newcastle]],&lt;ref name=jackson18/&gt; and so on 10 March his show opened at the [[Royal Aquarium]] in Westminster, London. Entitled "The first Great Show of all kinds of Terriers", the show received 570 entries across 57 classes and included [[Lord Alfred Paget]] among the patrons.&lt;ref name=growthtimes&gt;{{cite news|title=The Growth of Dog Shows; Mr. Cruft's Influence|page=8|issue=48103|newspaper=The Times|date=19 September 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collie]]s and several breeds of [[toy dog]]s were added by 1890.&lt;ref name=timesobituary/&gt;

[[File:Crufts 1891.jpg|thumb|right|Dogs on display at the 1891 Cruft's dog show]]
This gradual expansion of breeds led to the creation of the first show to be named after Cruft was in 1891, when "Cruft's Greatest Dog Show" was held at the [[Royal Agricultural Hall]], [[Islington]],&lt;ref name=timesobituary/&gt; with part of the deal to hold the show at that location was to restrict the venue to only allowing Cruft to run dog shows at the location.&lt;ref name=doglover&gt;{{cite news|title=Cruft, Dog-Lover|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v5EjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cqgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4682,3085747&amp;dq=charles-cruft&amp;hl=en|accessdate=30 August 2011|page=8|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=24 October 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed the logo himself, the head of a Saint Bernard surrounded by a collar with a crown on top.&lt;ref name=jackson17 /&gt; He introduced a system where competitors would pay to enter their dogs, and make additional payments if they wished to take the dogs away each night of the three-day competition, and again pay if they wanted to take them away early on the final day.&lt;ref name=jackson26&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914, the show had grown in popularity until it was recognised as the largest dog show in the world and by 1936 when the show celebrated its [[Golden Jubilee]], over 10,000 dogs were entered at the event.&lt;ref name=doglover/&gt; Cruft's shows were frequented by Royalty, with [[Queen Victoria]] exhibiting dogs, and [[King Edward VII]] also doing so prior to becoming King. In 1893, Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia]] sent eighteen [[Borzoi]]s to compete, and from 1916 [[King George V]] entered his [[Labrador Retriever]]s regularly.&lt;ref name=timesobituary/&gt;

On 7 and 8 March 1894, he experimented with expanding his shows and held his first Cat conformation show. The first show had over 600 entries, becoming easily the biggest of its kind so far, with patrons that included the Duchess of Newcastle, the [[William Molyneux, 4th Earl of Sefton|Countess de Sefton]] and [[Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet|Lady de Trafford]].&lt;ref name=jackson21&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The publication ''Fur and Feather'' praised the new venture and encouraged more. Crufts however wasn't so sure as the initial show had lost over a hundred pounds, and entries in some of the classes were restricted to only a handful of cats.&lt;ref name=jackson22&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He held a second show in March 1895,&lt;ref name=jackson22/&gt; which once again ''Fur and Feather'' heaped praise upon, despite the cutbacks that Cruft had initiated to make the show more profitable.&lt;ref name=jackson24&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fur and Feather'' announced in March 1896 that the cat show had been postponed due to Cruft's other business commitments, but he never went on to run such a show again.&lt;ref name=jackson24/&gt;

In 1896, Cruft designed special train carriages to carry competition dogs for his shows from around the country.&lt;ref name="jackson26"/&gt; Cruft was Secretary of the Ranelagh Fox Terrier Show in 1901, and together with several colleagues including [[Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet|Sir Humphrey de Trafford]] created the National Terrier Club, and from the second show onwards on 21 June 1902, the show became known as the National Terrier Show. Cruft continued as Secretary of the club until 1914 when Sir William Savory took on the role.&lt;ref name=ntchistory&gt;{{cite web|last=Owen|first=Catherine|title=Early Club History|url=http://www.nationalterrier.co.uk/html/aboutus.htm|publisher=National Terrier Club|accessdate=31 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331122659/http://www.nationalterrier.co.uk/html/aboutus.htm|archivedate=31 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that he gave away very few details about himself to the press, to make them concentrate more on promotion of his shows, he did not always see eye to eye with all members of the media. One newspaper refused to publish his name at all, and whenever it made reference to Cruft's dog shows, it simply referred to them as "a dog show in Islington".&lt;ref name=jackson31 /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:KC Cavalier at Crufts 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel at the Crufts dog show in 2007]]
After running his 45th Crufts show in 1938, he fell ill. By the late summer he was recovering, but he died due to a heart attack at around 5:30am on 10 September. Tributes came in from media agencies, with ''[[Our Dogs]]'' calling him "the man who made dog shows",&lt;ref name=jackson28&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and comparisons with the American showman [[P. T. Barnum]].&lt;ref name=jackson29&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral occurred on 21 September.&lt;ref name=jackson28/&gt; Cruft was buried in a tomb in the western area of [[Highgate Cemetery]], London. It would become [[Grade II listed]] on 14 May 1974.&lt;ref name=tomblisted&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomb of Charles Cruft in Highgate (western) Cemetery, Hampstead|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-478288-tomb-of-charles-cruft-in-highgate-wester|publisher=British Listed Buildings.co.uk|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London Borough of Islington]] placed a [[Blue plaque|plaque]] commemorating Charles Cruft at Ashurst Lodge, Highbury Grove, N5.&lt;ref name=plaque&gt;{{cite web|title=A-Z of Islington's Plaques|url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/leisure/heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/a_z_plaques.asp|publisher=London Borough of Islington|accessdate=25 February 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His will left £30476 [[£sd|9s 3d]] to his family and friends, with the majority going to his second wife, Emma, and £2000 going to his daughter Clara. Two grandchildren, Charles and Betty Cruft each received £500, and two nephews, Kenneth and John Hartshorn, each received the same.&lt;ref name=jackson31 /&gt; Eight nieces, one great nephew and a young cousin each received £50. One of his maids, Kate Hempstead, who had worked for him for over thirty years also received £50. His cousin Lt Arthur Cruft received £100, while Cruft's secretary Miss E. Harrington, who had worked on the Crufts dog shows since 1925 received £500.&lt;ref name=jackson32&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death in 1938, it was thought that his wife, Emma Cruft, would continue to run the dog shows with the help of the show's secretary, Miss Hardingham.&lt;ref name=growthtimes /&gt; After running the show in 1939, Mrs Cruft sold the show to [[The Kennel Club]], however due to [[World War II]], it wasn't until 1948 when they ran the show for the first time. The show would remain being called Cruft's until 1974, when during a rebrand the [[apostrophe]] was dropped, resulting in the show being called Crufts, which it continues to be called at the present.&lt;ref name=historydfscrufts /&gt;

==Family life==
[[File:George Cruft's Family Tomb, Highgate.jpg|thumb|right|Family tomb of Charles Cruft in the western end of [[Highgate Cemetery]].]]
Cruft's first marriage was to Charlotte Hutchinson in 1878. Together they had four children, Charles Francis, Louise, Cecil Arthur and Clara Helen Grace. His second marriage was to Emma Isabel Hartshorn in 1894, they had no children.&lt;ref name=jackson31/&gt; He remained in close contact with his children, and involved each of them in the dog show business. Such was the relationship with his daughter Clara, who was nicknamed "Birdie", that she alone was listed in his second wife's will as a step daughter.&lt;ref name=jackson32/&gt;

His wife Emma stated in her book, ''Mrs Charles Cruft's Famous Dog Book'', published in 1949 that there was an unwritten rule that both herself and her husband couldn't own any dogs for fear of making others believe that they favoured one breed over another, even going as far to say "we were determined to own a pet, so we took the least like of resistance and kept a – CAT!"&lt;ref name=jackson19&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; This was disproved in Cruft's memoirs, published posthumously in ''Charles Cruft's Dog Book'' in 1952, where Cruft explained that he had lived in households which had [[German Shepherd Dogs|Alsatians]] and [[Borzoi]]s. He went on to make particular reference to the fact that he and his wife Emma had owned at least one [[Saint Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]];&lt;ref name=jackson20&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; the same breed of dog he had used in his creation of the Crufts logo.&lt;ref name=jackson17&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 1901]], Cruft was living at 325 Holloway Road, N7 with his wife Emma, his father Charles, a boarder named Albert Causfield and a servant named Alice Gregory. He listed his profession as "show promoter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dean|first=Charles|title=Census tells 'tail' of Dog Show founder|url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/Council/CouncilNews/PressOffice/2011/03/PR4352.asp|work=9 March 2011|publisher=Islington Council|accessdate=30 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824075848/http://www.islington.gov.uk/Council/CouncilNews/PressOffice/2011/03/PR4352.asp|archivedate=24 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma would go on to outlive Charles, she died at the age of 82 on 5 September 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England's Dog Show Operator Succumbs at 82|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6G9gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=23ENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1556,1240426&amp;dq=charles-cruft&amp;hl=en|accessdate=30 August 2011|page=24|newspaper=Star News|date=6 September 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was living at 12 Highbury Grove, London, N5. His staff included a cook, a chauffeur, two maids and a gardener. Additionally, he owned a country home called Windmill Farm, in [[Coulsdon]], Surrey.&lt;ref name=jackson27&gt;[[#jackson1990|Jackson (1990)]]: p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christophe Thierry Daniel Rocancourt''', sometimes also called '''Christopher Rocancourt''' (born 16 July 1967), is a French [[impostor]] and [[confidence trick|confidence man]] who [[fraud|scammed]] affluent people by masquerading in turn as a French nobleman, the heir to the [[Rockefeller]] family or family member of a celebrity.

==Biography==
Rocancourt told ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' in a 2006 broadcast that his mother sometimes worked as a [[prostitute]] and his father was an [[alcoholic]] who took Christophe to an [[orphanage]] when the boy was 5. His first big con was made in Paris, where he faked the [[deed]] to a property that he did not own, which he then "sold" for USD $1.4 million.&lt;ref name="Dateline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11770944/ns/dateline_nbc/t/catch-him-if-you-can/#.WNwQ9IWcGP8|title=Catch Him If You Can|author=Mike Taibbi|date=March 12, 2006|accessdate=March 29, 2017|publisher=Dateline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making his way to the [[United States]], Rocancourt used at least a dozen aliases, and got the rich and powerful to invest in his schemes, he told ''Dateline'', by tapping into their greed. He convinced them that he, too, was rich by paying for their lavish dinners in cash. He once estimated to ''Dateline'' that his various schemes/ventures netted him at least [[US$]]40 million, but this cannot be confirmed.

In [[Los Angeles]], he pretended to be a [[movie producer]], ex-[[boxing]] champion or [[venture capitalist]], also claiming to be the illegitimate son of [[Sophia Loren]], the nephew of [[Oscar de la Renta]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]], and he associated himself with various celebrities: he lived for a time with [[Mickey Rourke]], and apparently convinced actor [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] to produce his next movie. He was also in talks with [[Jermaine Jackson]] to develop a line of fragrances inspired by [[Michael Jackson]] songs.&lt;ref name="Dateline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2001/01/rocancourt200101|title=The Counterfeit Rockefeller|author=Bryan Burrough|date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=March 29, 2017|publisher=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocancourt, using the name Christopher De Laurentiis, married Gry Park in 1992 with whom he had a child. He married ''[[Playboy]]'' model [[Pia Reyes]] in May 1996, and they had a son, Zeus. Beside being married to Pia Reyes, according to the press, he lived with ''Playboy'' model Rhonda Rydell for six months. She did not know Rocancourt was married, and said he had told her he was French nobility, the son of a countess.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"/&gt;

In 1997 police raided Rocancourt's hotel suite, and in 1998 he was arrested for an involvement in a shootout before he jumped [[bail]]. In 1999 he was freed of charges of forging [[passport]]s after he had bribed [[State Department]] employees to get a passport. He was arrested in 2000 in the [[Hamptons]] for an unpaid hotel bill, then jumped bail and relocated to Canada where he assumed the identity of [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] driver Michael van Hoven. On April 27, 2001 he and Reyes were detained in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, and Rocancourt was later charged with defrauding an elderly couple; Reyes was released after convincing authorities that she had no part in the scam, much less any idea of her husband's criminal activities.&lt;ref name="Dateline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/christopher-rocancourt-one-of-lifes-truly-great-pretenders-has-no-regrets---honestly/article4138322/|title=Christopher Rocancourt, one of life's truly great pretenders, has no regrets - honestly|author=Rod Mickleburgh|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=March 21, 2009|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocancourt served a year in prison before being extradited to New York and pleading guilty to charges of [[theft]], [[grand larceny]], [[smuggling]], [[bribery]], [[perjury]] and [[fraud]] against 19 victims. In September 2003, the plea resulted in a fine of $9 million, an order to pay $1.2 million in restitution and a term of three years and ten months in federal prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-rockefeller-gets-jail-time/|title=Fake Rockefeller Gets Jail Time|author=Jarrett Murphy|date=October 21, 2003|accessdate=March 29, 2017|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While being held in Canada, Rocancourt wrote an autobiography in which he ridiculed his victims. In [[Switzerland]], police have connected him with a jewel theft, and barred him from the country for 14 years; this expired 2016.&lt;ref name="Dateline"/&gt;

Rocancourt returned to Paris in October 2005 after completing his prison sentence. He lived with former Miss France [[Sonia Rolland]], and they had a daughter together, named Tess. They announced their split in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepeople.com/article/sonia-rolland-et-christophe-rocancourt-leur-histoire-d-amour-est-terminee_a6738/1|title=Sonia Rolland et Christophe Rocancourt : leur histoire d'amour est terminée !|date=April 10, 2008|accessdate=March 29, 2017|publisher=Purepeople}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, French filmmaker [[Catherine Breillat]] accused Rocancourt of scamming her out of 700,000 [[euro|€]].

Breillat told a French journalist that her first meeting with Rocancourt was the worst day of her life, even worse than the day when she was diagnosed with her cerebrovascular disease. In 2012, Rocancourt was convicted of "abus de faiblesse" ("abuse of weakness") for taking Breillat's money, and sentenced to prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2012/02/17/01016-20120217ARTFIG00667-huit-mois-de-prison-ferme-pour-rocancourt.php|title=Christophe Rocancourt sort de prison et prépare un livre|author=Delphine de Mallevoüe|date=February 18, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently the only circuit racing series in the country that is open to both amateur and professional drivers that features a classic Touring Car series as well as a Time Attack Competition. Each driver and his vehicle is equipped by an AMB timing system to accurately measure their lap times. Drivers are ranked by their qualifying times and bracketed to compete; accumulating points to vie for the championship in each of the six brackets at the end of the season. The series is open individuals and teams from various racing backgrounds welcoming cars from daily driven stock cars to full race cars. Each event is hosted at different race venues in the country. Open to the most amateur of drivers, the organizers provide driving aids from the country's leading race professionals during the event. In addition, the [[Philippine National Red Cross]] provides medical assistance to every event.

== Regulations ==
2012 will see some more changes in regulations particularly in the Grid Races tire restrictions were imposed. The complete list of the regulations can be found on their website for both Grid Races&lt;ref&gt;[http://circuitshowdown.com/grid.html CS Grid Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704223141/http://www.circuitshowdown.com/grid.html |date=2011-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Time Trials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://circuitshowdown.com/time-trial.html CS Time Trial Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704223146/http://www.circuitshowdown.com/time-trial.html |date=2011-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This season, will debut the Champions of Champions race where champions of each bracket are invited to race in identical cars for the title of "Champion of Champions." Also, participants that will be running this year's tire sponsor, GT Radial, may compete for the title GT-R Champion and a set of high performance radials.

=== Race Format ===
Typically, the event is scheduled on the first Saturday of each Month. Each leg is a whole day event that varies from track to track. The track opens early providing participants with an open practice and enough time to test the track and tune their cars. The event formally begins with a compulsory drivers' briefing then the Qualifying sessions for both Grid and Time Trials (TT) commence and ends at mid-day. Time sheets and bracketing are posted immediately over lunch so everyone can see their qualifying times that they did in the morning. This is followed by the grid races; Race 1 starts with Grid C; once the track is cleared, Official Time Trials Begin for all six brackets. After the last of the TT cars have run, Race 2 follows, with Grid B then Race 3 with Grid A. There are cases when the schedules are shortened or revised. These changes are announced on their website and Facebook Page typically weeks before the event.

=== Bracketing ===
Each participant is grouped into their respective brackets based on their performance on the Qualifying Session. Once participants qualify in a bracket, they can no longer go to a lower bracket and compete in that bracket. They can however "break-out" or move to the next higher bracket. Races continue even during rains; in these conditions, bracket times are adjusted and are discussed during the briefing. Below is a sample bracketing for the 6th Leg held at Batangas Racing Circuit with a reverse layout and dry conditions

=== Time Trials ===
The series features time trials for those who want to run their cars against the clock. There are a total of six brackets where a participant can compete. The goal of each participant is to reach the closest time set on the bracket, if time is beat, a maximum of .200sec is allowed but will void the fastest time, in this case the 2nd fastest time will be used. For times of .201sec or better, the participant is moved to the next faster bracket.

=== Grid Race ===
Grid race are for those who want to compete "wheel to wheel" with other competitors. They are grouped into three categories. Grid A is for those who qualify for brackets A &amp; B, Grid B are for the cars that qualify in brackets C &amp; D, and Grid C are for those who qualify in brackets E &amp; F.

== Tracks ==
The series runs throughout the year alternating between the major race venues in the Philippines, often changing the layout to add variation. One of its venues is the [[Clark International Speedway]] (CIS), the newest touring car race track in the Philippines. Its completion in late 2009, and continuous expansion has made this track the most competitive to date. The [[Batangas Racing Circuit]] (BRC) was created in 1996 from a 2.9&amp;nbsp;km circuit it has grown into a 3.5&amp;nbsp;km track with a 550m straight also used for drag racing events.

In 2010, the series ran a few legs on the now defunct [[Subic International Raceway]] (SIR), a 2.9 kilometer circuit with 12 turns, that has been the venue for both local &amp; international races. Located beside the Subic International Airport, it is 15 minutes away from Central Business District of Subic Bay Freeport and was completed in 1994. Early in 2011, the track has been closed to make way for a commercial development in Subic. As a send-off, the administration of the Subic Raceway organized the "Last Lap," a three-day event open to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoindustriya.com/motorsport/the-last-lap.html|title=The Last Lap of Subic Raceway|last1=Roces |first1=Iñigo |last2= |first2= |date=16 August 2010|work=AutoIndustriya.com|publisher=AutoIndustriya.com|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topgear.com.ph/news/subic-racetrack-to-bid-rp-motorsports-goodbye-tires-to-keep-burning-in-clark TopGear Philippines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Sexism===
In a 2016 interview with Steph Harvey conducted by the British Broadcasting Corporation, she explains the controversy of women in eSports. She describes during the interview that video games are thought to be only played by men. She delivers accounts of her experiences while participating in and receiving degrading comments due to her gender. This in turn is the reason she feels more women do not participate in ESports. The constant stigma placed upon them and backlash from the male competitors makes women feel outcast for something designed for anyone to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=100 Women 2016: The women challenging sexism in e-sports |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37992322 |accessdate=24 November 2018 |agency=British Broadcast Corporation |publisher=British Broadcast Corporation |date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Racism===
In a article posted by The ESports Observer, they talk about the controversy of different players interacting with one another during matches. One of the biggest complaints seen is racist comments being exchanged during matches. This not only caused conflicts between the players but cause issues for the game publisher. One way this is being curbed though is punishing the player after they receive a number of complaints about their comments during gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Is Responsible for Policing Racism in Esports? |url=https://esportsobserver.com/policing-racism-esports-dota2/ |website=The Esports Observer |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elephants are an integral part of the [[Mysore Dasara]] Festival. The elephants form the core of the [[Mysore]] Dasara procession on the [[Vijayadashami]] day. The lead [[elephant]] carries the [[Golden Howdah]] ([[Chinnada Ambari]]) with the Goddess [[Chamundeshwari]] in it.

==Arrival==
The Elephants start arriving to [[Mysore]] city in groups. They arrive to Mysore a month or so before the start of the actual festivities and they undergo practice for their march on the final day. The elephants are accompanied by their respective keepers or [[Mahout]]s. The elephants are usually brought in trucks and are occasionally walked the 70-km distance from their home base in the [[Nagarahole National Park]] to Mysore. Villagers greet the sacred animals all along their designated trekking route. As each party of pachyderms arrives at the Veerana Hosahalli forest checkpost in [[Hunsur]] taluk, from the forest, they are received by the [[District]]  Minister, a host of officials and prominent persons from Mysore and people from nearby villages. The villagers perform folk dances, and beat drums and sing songs to welcome the elephants. This in keeping with the royal tradition of the Mysore Maharajas.

==Royal feast==
While in their respective camps the elephants are served '[[Ragi mudde]]', a mixture of [[Finger millet|ragi]] and horse gram and fodder branches. But when they are royal guests in the royal city of Mysore preparing for Dasara, they are served with ‘royal’ food till the grand Dasara finale - [[Jamboo Savari]]. The elephants get to eat uddina bele (black gram), [[green gram]], [[wheat]], boiled [[rice]], [[onion]] and vegetables in the mornings and evenings. They get [[rice]], [[peanut|groundnut]], [[coconut]], [[jaggery]] and [[sugarcane]] with some salt to add taste to the diet after they return from their regular rehearsals. This food is served twice a day. They also get branch fodder like [[banyan]] leaves. Extra care is taken while serving food to the jumbos. High-calorie and protein-rich food is served to the elephants to improve their physical fitness. They carry a lot of weight at the procession and for that, they need strength. Hence they are fed with rich food. The food served in the morning is laced with pure [[butter]] for flavour. Besides nutritious food, [[vitamin]] doses are also injected so as to balance the diet. An elephant eats 400 kilograms of [[fodder]] in a day in the forests. The food served to them in [[Mysore]] contains high calories and is more than what they eat in the jungles.

==Choosing the elephants==
The Dasara Elephants are usually caught by the elephant trainers via the [[Khedda]] operation. During the Wodeyar rule, the elephants thus caught were inspected in an open field  for strength, personality, and character. The walking styles, weaknesses to seduction, the facial charisma were some of the factors considered for selection. Then the chosen elephants were trained for the festival. It is said that the king himself would oversee the training. Sometimes abandoned young elephants are also trained for dasara.

==The abode==
The abode of the elephants during the rest of the year is usually their training camps and the surrounding [[National Parks]]. There are around 70 tamed elephants in exclusive camps at [[Dubare]], Hebballa, Moorkal, Kallalla, Nagarahole, Veeranahosahalli, Metikuppe, Sunkadakatte, Bandipur, Moolehole, K. Gudi and Bheemeshwari. About 240 [[mahout]]s and kavadis take care of the needs of these elephants and develop a bond with them.

==The elephants==
The elephants are named in Kannada and usually have the names of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] mythological and historical figures. Elephants [[Elephant Drona|Drona]] and [[Balarama (elephant)|Balarama]] carried the idol of deity Chamundeshwari housed in the [[Golden Howdah]] for a combined total of 30 years. Balarama took up the responsibility after Drona was electrocuted in 1998 at Nagarahole National Park. Balarama has been granted retirement after 13 years. The 52-year-old [[Arjuna (elephant)|Arjuna]] replaced Balarama and carried the [[Golden Howdah]] during the Dasara 2012 Jamboo Sawari procession at Mysore on 24 October 2012. The other elephants participating in the event are Bharatha, Kanthi, Gayathri, Kokila, Sri Rama, Abhimanyu, Gajendra, Biligiriranga, Vikram, Varalakshmi, and Sarojini.

'''The Destruction of the Country House 1875-1975''' was an exhibition held at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) in 1974, commissioned by V&amp;A Director [[Roy Strong]] and curated by [[John Harris (curator)|John Harris]], [[Marcus Binney]] and [[Peter Thornton]] (then working, respectively, at the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)]], ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine and the V&amp;A Department of Furniture and Woodwork).

The exhibition included a "Hall of Destruction", decorated with falling columns and illustrations of some of the [[Destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain|thousand country houses demolished since 1875]], brought down by falling estate incomes, rising costs, death duties, and damage caused by government requisitioning during the [[Second World War]].

Described as a "landmark" exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ribaj.com/index.php/feature/article/to_the_manor_born/ RIBAJournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the graphic illustration of the scale of destruction of Britain's built heritage changed public opinion, and encouraged moves to protect the country houses that remained.  

The success of the exhibition inspired the formation of the campaigning group, [[SAVE Britain's Heritage]], in 1975 - a year that was designated as European Architectural Heritage Year by the [[Council of Europe]] - but the changed public mood could not prevent the sale of the extraordinary collection of art and furniture at [[Mentmore Towers]] in 1975, and of the empty building itself in 1977, to pay taxes following the death of [[Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery]] in 1973.

The exhibition was followed in 1977 and 1979 by two further exhibitions at the V&amp;A on British architectural heritage: ''Change and Decay: The Future of our Churches'' (curated by Strong, Binney and [[Peter Burman]]), and then ''The Garden: A Celebration of a Thousand Years of British Gardening'' (organised by Harris).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1555">'''Failure to appear''' is the legal term for the failure of a [[defendant]] or respondent to appear at (or within) the stated time before a [[tribunal]] as directed in a [[summons]]. Where the conduct alleged in the summons or [[complaint]] is an [[Summary offence#United States|infraction]] or [[summary offence]], failure to appear is a [[crime]] for which a [[Arrest warrant#Bench_warrant|bench-warrant]] can be issued if the defendant promised to appear. If the conduct alleged is a [[tort]] or other cause for civil action, failure to appear generally results in a [[default judgment]] by the court in favor of the [[plaintiff]]/petitioner.

==In the United States==
Failure to appear in U.S. federal law is an offense punishable by a prison term, depending on the seriousness of the offense the person is being sentenced for:&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|3146|b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Sentencing Guidelines|USSG]] [http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2014/2014-chapter-2-e-k#2j16 §2J1.6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Feraliminal Lycanthropizer''' is a fictional machine invented by American writer [[David Woodard]], whose 1990 pamphlet of the same title speculates on its history and purpose.&lt;ref name="FL"&gt;Woodard, D., [http://juniperhills.net/feraliminallycanthropizer.pdf "Feraliminal Lycanthropizer"] ([[San Francisco]]: Plecid Foundation, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The brief, anonymously published work describes a vibration referred to as thanato-auric waves, which the machine electrically generates by combining three [[infrasonic]] sine waves (3&amp;nbsp;Hz, 9&amp;nbsp;Hz and 0.56&amp;nbsp;Hz) with concomitant tape loops of unspecified spoken text (two beyond the threshold of decipherability, and two beneath the threshold).&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;[[Jack Sargeant (writer)|Sergeant, J.]], [http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/696235/posts "Sonic Doom"], ''[[Fortean Times]]'', Dec 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|This combination of drastically contrasting emotional trigger mechanisms results in an often profound behavioral enhancement which occurs strikingly soon (within moments) after the user enters and remains in the auricular field of the machine.''&lt;ref name="FL" /&gt;}}
The premise is that a mind-altering technology has for decades, at the behest of American intelligence during the [[Cold War]], been withheld from scrutiny. Dispensing [[Information sensitivity|sensitive information]] in the interest of enhancing civilian life, the author shares his own notes as well as those left by earlier researchers.
==Etymology==
The name Feraliminal Lycanthropizer is composed of two [[portmanteau]] words. The first, Feraliminal, is a combination of the Latin [[:wikt:ferus|''ferus'']] (wild animal) and [[:wikt:limen|''limen'']] (threshold), while the second, Lycanthropizer, combines the Ancient Greek root [[:wikt:lycanthrope|''lycanthrope'']] (werewolf) with a generic suffix, [[:wikt:-izer|-''izer'']], conferring [[agency (philosophy)|agency]]. Together the words suggest something hidden that triggers wild or aggressive conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Bruun, J., "Dreamachines, Wishing Machines or Feraliminal Lycanthropizers, Anyone?," in Kerekes, D., ed., ''Headpress: Journal of Sex, Religion, Death—Issues 24-27'' ([[Manchester]]: Headpress, 2002), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
Despite the pamphlet's brevity and obscurity, its story has acquired mythic overtones, and readers have since made extraordinary attempts to replicate the Feraliminal Lycanthropizer and/or invoke its described "animalizing effects on human subjects tested within measurable vibratory proximity."&lt;ref name="Inaudible"&gt;Anon., [http://cripo.com.ua/?sect_id=4&amp;aid=139861 "Inaudible sound that kills"], ''Украина Криминальная'', Jul 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The machine's neologistic name has thus appeared in conjunction with disparate music groups and artists, as indicated:

==Scientific and historical inconsistencies==
Apart from its title and the term ''thanato-auric'', other hitherto unknown coinages introduced in Woodard's text are, in order of appearance: ''Plecidic'', ''aurotic'', ''nucleopatriphobic'' and ''Eugenaestheticus''. Moreover, journalistic coverage appears to have roundly debunked the myth of the machine.

According to ''Fortean Times'', "[L]egends about the machine challenge belief; besides being credited with sparking unrestrained orgies, it has...been blamed for the sex-and-strangulation deaths of six youths. Some, who claim to have used the machine, have felt themselves become mentally stronger and their will more focused. [The] essay claims that 'a Catalan national using the machine daily over a period of five or six weeks eventually managed to ingratiate himself to Adolf Hitler [and] persuade his quarry to adopt the swastika as high totem and emblem of the burgeoning National Socialist Conference.' Such stories are, clearly, beyond belief. There is no evidence that the Feraliminal Lycanthropizer exist[ed] or could have such effects."&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;

In ''TechnoMage'', a compendium of writings on technology and the occult, author Dirk Bruere relates, "The recording '...contains two infrasonic frequencies, 3hz and 9hz, which, combined, generate a lower, third frequency of 0.56hz.' They do not."&lt;ref&gt;Bruere, D., ''TechnoMage'' ([[Bedford, England]]: Dirk Bruere, 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qXJXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA369&amp;dq=feraliminal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 369–370].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|369–370}} Paranormal researcher [[Michael Esposito (paranormal investigator)|Michael Esposito]] opines, "I’m not sure the Feraliminal Lycanthropizer is as effective as a woman leaning against the spin cycle of a [[Washing machine|Maytag]]."&lt;ref&gt;Zylo, A., [http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2013/03/interview-with-michael-esposito.html "Interview with M. Esposito"], [[WFMU#Online broadcasting and blogging|WFMU's Beware of the Blog]], Mar 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flash crash''' is a very rapid, deep, and volatile fall in [[Security (finance)|security]] prices occurring within an extremely short time period. A flash crash frequently stems from [[trade]]s executed by [[black-box trading]], combined with [[high-frequency trading]], whose speed and interconnectedness can result in the loss and recovery of billions of dollars in a matter of minutes and seconds.&lt;ref name=RareEvents&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozdog|first=Dragos|title=Rare Events Analysis of High-Frequency Equity Data|ssrn=2013355|website=papers.ssrn.com|publisher=Wilmott Journal, pp. 74–81, 2011|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Flash Crash ===
{{Main|2010 Flash Crash}}

This type of event occurred on [[2010 Flash Crash|May 6, 2010]]. A $4.1 billion trade on the [[New York Stock Exchange|New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)]] resulted in a loss to the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] of over 1,000 [[Dollar|points]] and then a rise to approximately previous value, all over about fifteen minutes. The mechanism causing the event has been heavily researched and is in dispute. On April 21, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice laid "22 criminal counts, including fraud and market manipulation" against [[2010 Flash Crash#Evidence of market manipulation and arrest|Navinder Singh Sarao]], a trader. Among the charges included was the use of [[Spoofing (finance)|spoofing]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-22/mystery-trader-armed-with-algorithms-rewrites-flash-crash-story|title=How a Mystery Trader With an Algorithm May Have Caused the Flash Crash|date=2015-04-22|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 Ethereum Flash Crash ===
On June 22, 2017, the price of [[Ethereum]], the second-largest digital [[cryptocurrency]], dropped from more than $300 to as low as $0.10 in minutes at [[GDAX]] exchange. Suspected for market manipulation or an account takeover at first, later investigation by GDAX claimed no indication of wrongdoing. The crash was triggered by a multimillion-dollar selling order which brought the price down, from $317.81 to $224.48, and caused the following flood of 800 [[stop-loss order|stop-loss]] and [[margin funding liquidation]] orders, crashing the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/22/ethereum-price-crash-10-cents-gdax-exchange-after-multimillion-dollar-trade.html |title=Ethereum briefly crashed from $319 to 10 cents in seconds on one exchange after ‘multimillion dollar’ trade |last=Kharpal|first=Arjun |date=22 June 2017 |work=[[CNBC]] |accessdate= 24 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British pound flash crash ===
On October 7, 2016, there was a flash crash in the value of [[pound sterling|sterling]], which dropped more than 6% in two minutes against the US dollar. It was the pound's lowest level against the dollar since May 1985. The pound recovered much of its value in the next few minutes, but ended down on the day's trading, most likely due to market concerns about the impact of a "[[hard Brexit]]"—a more complete break with the [[European Union]] following Britain's 'Leave' [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum vote in June]]. It was initially speculated that the flash crash may have been due to a [[Fat-finger error|fat-finger trader error]] or an [[Trading algorithm|algorithm]] reacting to negative news articles about the [[British Government]]'s European policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/dfb375be-8c23-11e6-8cb7-e7ada1d123b1|title=Pound struggles to recover after plunging 6% in 2 minutes|date=7 October 2016|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other crashes ===
In October 2013, a flash crash occurred on the [[Singapore Exchange]] which wiped out $6.9 billion in [[capitalization]] and saw some [[stock]]s lose up to 87 percent of their value. The crash resulted in new regulations being announced in August 2014. Minimum trading prices of 0.20 cents per share would be introduced, [[short position]]s would be required to be reported, and a 5 percent [[Collateralized debt obligation|collateral]] [[Tax|levy]] implemented. The exchange said the measures were to curb excessive [[speculation]] and potential [[Share (finance)|share]] [[price manipulation]].&lt;ref name="SGXCurbs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore Exchange regulators change rules following crash|url=http://www.singaporenews.net/index.php/sid/224382417/scat/a677a0718b69db72/ht/Singapore-Exchange-regulators-change-rules-following-crash|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=''Singapore News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two short-lived (less than a second) movements (more than 1%) in several (40 and 88) stock prices followed by recovery were reported for November 25, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|publisher=MarketWatch|title=Two mini-flash crashes rock stock market Tuesday|

"'''Going to America'''" is the final episode of the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]''. It is the eighth episode of the third series and the 25th episode overall. The show's star [[Dermot Morgan]] died the day after filming was completed.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Batch 2091.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Father Kevin falls victim to depression.]]
After [[Father Ted Crilly|Ted]] prevents a [[clinical depression|depressed]] Father Kevin ([[Tommy Tiernan]]) from jumping to his death at the "It's Great Being a Priest" conference, an American priest, Father Buzz Cagney ([[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]]), asks him if he will come to a parish in [[Los Angeles]]. Ted cannot wait and excitedly tells [[Father Jack Hackett|Jack]], [[Father Dougal McGuire|Dougal]] and [[Mrs. Doyle]], who incorrectly think they will be able to come with him. Ted does not have the heart to tell them otherwise and brings them to the airport, leaving them there while he gets on the plane. However, Ted has second thoughts when Buzz mentions the gang culture around Ted's new parish in Los Angeles and its violent state. Realising he is in serious trouble, Ted abandons going on his trip and rejoins Jack, Dougal and Mrs Doyle. It transpires that the three of them never wanted to go to the States anyway, with the possible exception of Jack, who yells 'Feck!' when he learns of what has gone wrong, though the promise of a drink cheers him up. The group leaves the airport and heads for home, and Ted resigns himself to the fact he is probably never going to escape [[Craggy Island]].

===Alternate ending===
The episode was always intended to be the last ''[[Father Ted]]''; in the original script, the last scene was to be set at the "It's ''Still'' Great Being a Priest" conference with Father Kevin once again on the window ledge and once again Ted arriving on the ledge, except this time it is not to stop him from jumping but to join him, because he was depressed that the intended trip to America fell through and he would have to stay on Craggy Island forever. This ending was abandoned in favour of a montage of clips from all three series of the show, although this was not (as believed) because of the death of [[Dermot Morgan]]. Rather, the writers did not think that their original ending was very funny.

The episode was filmed on 27 February 1998, the day before Morgan died.

==Production==
This episode does not normally contain a credits sequence at the end, as it is replaced by the clips montage. The episode's guest cast is listed alongside the lead actors in the opening credits.

While filming the scene in which Ted dances to "[[Theme from Shaft|Theme from ''Shaft'']]," Tommy Tiernan continually flubbed his lines. As a result, Dermot Morgan was required to perform the dance repeatedly, despite pains in his heart. In a 2009 interview, Tiernan speculated that this contributed to Morgan's fatal heart attack the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/features/interviews/TOMMY%20TIERNAN%20IN%20THE%20CHAT%20ROOM/5849883.html?|title=TOMMY TIERNAN IN THE CHAT ROOM|work=hotpress.com|last=Tyaransen|first=Olaf|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Brian Eno]] makes a brief cameo appearance in the episode as Father Brian Eno. Linehan has claimed that the idea came as "we used to see him around [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] wearing a fez."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linehan|first1=Graham|title=Twitter post|url=https://twitter.com/Glinner/status/21351832408301568|website=Twitter|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When Ted discusses a fictional [[Harrison Ford]] film with Dougal, the details mentioned are identical to those of ''Firestorm'', a fictional film previously described by characters in the American sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76685">The '''International reaction to ''[[Fitna (film)|Fitna]]''''' consisted of condemnation from [[Muslims]], several [[fatwa]] against [[Geert Wilders]], and attempts by many [[Islamism|Islamic]] countries to [[Censorship|censor]] the film. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government immediately distanced itself from the film. Several Muslim organizations and political parties organized [[boycott]]s against [[Netherlands|Dutch]] products.

==Prior to the release==
It was feared that the film would lead to violent demonstrations by Muslims much like the organized protests against the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]] that were published in the [[Denmark|Danish]] newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="embassyburning"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4681294.stm|title=Embassies burn in cartoon protest|date=2006-02-04|accessdate=2008-03-08|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch counter-terrorism agency raised its terror risk level from "limited" to "substantial", noting Islamist death threats against Wilders and calls to attack Dutch troops.&lt;ref name="dtl"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch raise threat level ahead of anti-Koran film|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-32339620080306|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2008-04-02|first=Emma|last=Thomasson|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous violence included the burning of the Danish embassy in [[Syria]] and other acts of violence around the world, including the murder of a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] nun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =In defence of the right to offend | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cdc31436-cbb1-11dc-97ff-000077b07658.html |date = 2008-01-26 | accessdate =2008-01-27 |author=Caldwell, Christopher| work= |publisher=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Netherlands===
The movie was first mentioned in the Dutch media on November 27, 2007. The Dutch government almost immediately expressed great concern about the film release.&lt;ref name="First mention of the movie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/2634487/Provocerende_film_Wilders.html?p=26,1|language=Dutch|title=Provocerende film Wilders|work=[[De Telegraaf]]|first=Paul|last=Jansen|date=2007-11-27|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made evacuation plans available to all its consulates and embassies worldwide and tightened security measures around military installations abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/080123-wilders-film-dutch-mct |title=Wilders and his film worry Dutch expats |work=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |date=23 January 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime minister of the Netherlands, [[Jan Peter Balkenende]], worried about possible repercussions for Dutch citizens and economic interests.&lt;ref name="balkenende"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/03/netherlands.islam|title=Dutch government could ban anti-Islam film|first=Mark|last=Tran|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Wilders accused Balkenende of capitulating to Islam.&lt;ref name="balkenende2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/laatste_24_uur/artikel/asp/artnr/194215/|language=Dutch|title=Wilders: Premier is beroepslafaard|date=2008-02-23|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=elsevier.nl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308184002/http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/laatste_24_uur/artikel/asp/artnr/194215/|archivedate=2008-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilders had been warned by Dutch National Counterterrorism Co-ordinator [[:nl:Tjibbe Joustra (ambtenaar)|Tjibbe Joustra]] that his film may "lead to reactions that endanger public order, security and the economy".&lt;ref name="warn_wilders"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7204452.stm|title=Dutch MP warned over Islam film|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication of the film was investigated by the [[Ministry of Justice  and Security|Dutch Ministry of Justice]] to find out whether the release of the film could be prevented, but this could not be done.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In an opinion poll, 54% of Dutch people still believed that the film should be released, despite any possible negative effects.&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0522616520080305|title=Dutch want Koran film shown but fear reactions: poll|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-03-05 | first=Emma | last=Thomasson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2008, the Dutch government raised its national risk level of a [[Tactics of terrorism|terrorist attack]] from the status 'limited' to 'substantial' because of concerns that Muslim terrorists would launch attacks against European targets, using the film as justification.&lt;ref name="terror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/960/Buitenland/article/detail/196174/2008/03/06/Nederland-vreest-aanslagen-wegens-film-Wilders.dhtml|title=Nederland vreest aanslagen wegens film Wilders|language=Dutch|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=hln.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="terror2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3175532,00.html|title=Dutch Raise Terror Threat Level After Film Stokes Muslim Hostility|date=2008-03-07|accessdate=2008-03-09|work=dw-world.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A demonstration against the release of the film occurred in [[Dam Square]], in [[Amsterdam]], on 22 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7309838.stm|title= Dutch protest against Islam film |date= 2008-03-22|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to concerns, Dutch broadcaster ''[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]'' created a multi-language website to detail the film, the surrounding controversy, its creator, and the nation of its origin.&lt;ref name="Radio Netherlands site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/aboutfitna/|title= About Fitna The Movie|accessdate=2008-03-24|publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch newspaper ''[[De Pers]]'' printed a reconstruction of how the concerns came about and who was responsible for them.&lt;ref name="De Pers Article reconstructie van fitna-gate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/178021/Reconstructie-van-Fitna-gate.html|title=Reconstructie van Fitna-gate|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2008-03-03|work=Dutch|publisher=[[De Pers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large advertisement was placed on the front page of ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' stating that if Wilders had said the things he has said about Muslims, about Jews, he would have been prosecuted for [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article976448.ece/Advertentie_tegen_Wilders_op_voorpagina_Volkskrant|title=Advertentie tegen Wilders op voorpagina Volkskrant|language=Dutch|work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement was endorsed by the Jewish organisations ''[[Stichting de Initiavieven]]'' and ''[[Een Ander Joods Geluid]]''.

===Other reactions===
On 7 April 2008, [[Indonesia]] blocked access to [[YouTube]] and a number of other websites, such as MySpace and Multiply. Minister of Menkon Info Muhammad Nuh passed a bill that forced 146 ISP's in Indonesia to block access to YouTube on Monday. [[Kompas]] confirmed that the reason for the block was YouTube's refusal to remove ''Fitna'' from their servers.&lt;ref name="Indonesia Blocks YouTube"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kompas.co.id/tekno/read.php?cnt=.xml.2008.04.07.10341640&amp;channel=7&amp;mn=114&amp;idx=114|title=Indonesia Blokir YouTube|accessdate=2008-04-07|publisher=[[Kompas]], Indonesia|date=2008-04-07|language=Indonesian}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The block has now been removed, and the foreign relation minister has apologised to the people for any inconvenience.

The [[European Union|EU]] alerted its [[diplomatic mission]]s around the world to expect a reaction to the release of the film.&lt;ref name="eu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/961220.html|title=EU braces for outrage over Dutch lawmaker's anti-Koran film|date=2008-03-05|accessdate=2008-03-25|work=[[The Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NATO]] said it feared that the consequences of ''Fitna'' would affect the safety of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="natofears"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7274259.stm|title=Nato fears over Dutch Islam film|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[Zabihullah Mujahid]] stressed that the [[Taliban]] would increase their attacks on Dutch military and humanitarian peacekeepers in Afghanistan, if the film were released.&lt;ref name="talibanthreat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kleinverzet.blogspot.com/2008/02/taliban-threatens-attacks-because-of.html|title=Taliban threatens attacks because of Wilders film|date=2008-02-28|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau]]|publisher=Expatica News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] declared that [[France]] would provide the support to the Netherlands in the event of international problems.&lt;ref name="francehelp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/960/Buitenland/article/detail/195560/2008/03/05/Frankrijk-belooft-Nederland-steun-na-Wilders-film.dhtml|title=Frankrijk belooft Nederland steun na Wilders-film|language=Dutch|date=2008-03-05|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=hln.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]] threatened to review its diplomatic stance with the Netherlands if the film was aired.&lt;ref name="foxiranwarn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324406,00.html|title=Iran Warns Netherlands Not to Air Controversial 'Anti-Muslim' Film|work=[[Fox News]]|first=Michael|last=Park|date=2008-01-21|accessdate=2008-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612070628/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324406,00.html|archive-date=2009-06-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public protests occurred in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="kabul1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSISL1279420080322?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title=Afghans chant death in cartoon protest|date=2008-03-22|accessdate=2008-03-24|work=[[Reuters]]|first=Ahmad|last=Masood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kabul2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=48495&amp;sectionid=351020403|title=Afghans protest Danish cartoons|date=2008-03-22|accessdate=2008-03-24|work=[[Press TV]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416124218/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=48495&amp;sectionid=351020403|archivedate=2008-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]] said it was closely monitoring the situation.&lt;ref name="egypt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPfRaEYgm1Qxcws2W1wbCuTK9GGw |title=Egypt 'monitoring attacks on Islam ahead of Dutch TV film' |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2008-03-08 |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=[[Google]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309100648/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPfRaEYgm1Qxcws2W1wbCuTK9GGw |archivedate=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, [[Pakistan]] internally banned [[YouTube]] for several days due to a video clip one report claimed to be a trailer for ''Fitna'';&lt;ref name="pakistanblock"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7261727.stm|title=Pakistan blocks YouTube website|date=2008-02-24|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ban was lifted a few days later.&lt;ref name="pakistanlift"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7262071.stm|title=Pakistan lifts the ban on YouTube|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2008-03-08|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the block, [[Pakistan]] accidentally caused YouTube to be unavailable worldwide for two hours.&lt;ref name="worldwideoutage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/25/pakistan.youtube/index.html |title=Pakistan move knocked out YouTube |work=[[CNN]] |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-03-08 |author=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229001908/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/25/pakistan.youtube/index.html |archivedate=2008-02-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view/20080226-121307/Pakistans-YouTube-ban-briefly-affected-global-access|title=Pakistan's YouTube ban briefly affected global access|work=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=Inquirer.net|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube-hijack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripe.net/news/study-youtube-hijacking.html |title=YouTube Hijacking: A RIPE NCC RIS case study |work=[[RIPE]] |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405030750/http://www.ripe.net/news/study-youtube-hijacking.html |archivedate=2008-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grand Mufti]], Ahmad Badr al-Din, said that if Geert Wilders showed the image of a burning Qur'an in his film, the Dutch people will be held responsible and possible attacks against [[Western world|Western]] public interests would not be not out of the question.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitnathemovie.info/timeline.php|title=Geert Wilders Fitna Movie Timeline|publisher=FeceOnAir.com|accessdate=2008-03-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306185627/http://www.fitnathemovie.info/timeline.php|archivedate=2008-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the release==
The reaction was mild in comparison with what was expected, with some Muslim delegates describing it as “not as jarring as anticipated”, saying they were “extremely relieved”.&lt;ref name="apafterfitna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gbdWDY3d2pIF8SJM8-HhVKSIJz3wD8VM07T81 |title=Dutch Lawmaker Releases Anti-Quran Film |first=Toby |last=Sterling |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Google News]] |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2008-03-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419034742/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gbdWDY3d2pIF8SJM8-HhVKSIJz3wD8VM07T81 |archivedate=2008-04-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dnfitna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/03/wilders_film_within_the_law_sa.php|title='Fitna' within the law, says Muslim group|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-03-27|work=DutchNews.nl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403000814/http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/03/wilders_film_within_the_law_sa.php|archivedate=2008-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A worldwide violent reaction did not materialise, in stark contrast with threats made by Islamic leaders in the months before the release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,342470,00.html|title=First Reactions to Dutch Anti-Quran Film Are Muted|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-03-27|work=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/middleeast/080327-fitna-response-mc|title=Moderate response to anti-Islam movie|work=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]|date=2008-03-28|accessdate=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death threats did occur against Wilders and the company that hosted the film. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===In the Netherlands===
In a televised reaction following the release, Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister of the Netherlands, gave his reaction on behalf of the Dutch government.&lt;ref name="genaff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.minaz.nl/english/News/Press_releases_and_news_items/2008/Maart/Government_s_reaction_to_Wilders_film |title=(Dutch) Government's reaction to Wilders' film |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2008-03-27 |work=[[Ministry of General Affairs]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404045120/http://www.minaz.nl/english/News/Press_releases_and_news_items/2008/Maart/Government_s_reaction_to_Wilders_film |archivedate=2008-04-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Amongst other things, it stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The film equates Islam with violence. We reject this interpretation. The vast majority of Muslims reject extremism and violence. In fact, the victims are often also Muslims... ...We therefore regret that Mr Wilders has released this film. We believe it serves no purpose other than to cause offence.&lt;ref name="genaff"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dutch parliamentarians of the largest political parties, [[Pieter van Geel]] ([[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]]), Mariëtte Hamer ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]) and [[Mark Rutte]] ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]) stated that it was sad that the film did not present any solutions to current problems in the Dutch society - integration of Muslim immigrants and Muslim extremism - and invited Mr. Wilders to discuss possible solutions in the parliament.&lt;ref name="nova27"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://novatv.nl/index.cfm?ln=nl&amp;fuseaction=videoaudio.details&amp;reportage_id=5923&amp;CFID=39188582&amp;CFTOKEN=29478978|title=Fitna is released, how does the Netherlands and the world react?|language=Dutch|work=[[Nova (Dutch TV series)|Nova]]|publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] [[VARA (broadcaster)|Vara]]|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later parliamentary debate to discuss Balkenende's televised reaction, they expressed further opinions, calling the film 'cunningly made with evil intentions' (CDA), 'a message of fear beyond compare' (PvDA) and 'paranoid' (SP). Wilders was described as a 'political pyromaniac' (VVD) and a 'fearful man' ([[Democrats 66|D66]]).&lt;ref name="nieuwsnl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuws.nl/505080|title=Fel Kamerdebat over film Wilders|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', a speaker for the Muslim organization ''Contactorgaan Moslims en Overheid'' (CMO), Yusuf Altuntas, said that Wilders "is obviously looking to push the limits, but he resists crossing them." For instance, in the film a ripping sound overlaid with imagery of the Qur'an is said to be the ripping of a page from the phone book, and thunder sounds are replacing what might otherwise be perceived as bomb explosion sounds. The Arabic expert Leo Kwarten on the other hand said that "these subtleties may however be lost in the Arabic world."&lt;ref name="populist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,543855,00.html|title=Koranfeindliches Video veröffentlicht - Protest gegen Rechtspopulist Wilders|language=German|first=Gerald|last=Traufetter|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Centraal Joods Overleg'' (Central Jewish Committee) released a statement on March 28, 2008, condemning the film for reinforcing prejudices by implying that all Muslims are terrorists. The Committee said that the portrayal of Muslims in this manner was counterproductive, and that the Dutch Jewish community, along with the Dutch Muslim community and all of Dutch society, has a duty to combat all religious-based terrorism, and to protect everyone against those who wish to overthrow democracy or promote religious hatred.&lt;ref name="cjo1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cjo.nl/|title=Verklaring Centraal Joods Overleg over de film FITNA|accessdate=2008-04-02|publisher=Centraal Joods Overleg, the Netherlands|language=Dutch|date=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cjo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/970768.html|title=Dutch Jews louder than Muslims in condemning 'Fitna' film|accessdate=2008-04-02|publisher=[[Haaretz]], Israel|date=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politician, and former Muslim, Ehsan Jami had intended to release an [[animated cartoon]] entitled ''The Life of Mohammed'' on April 20, 2008.&lt;ref name="jamihitler"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/3681412/__Jami_ziet_af_van_Mohammed-tekenfilm___.html|title='Jami ziet af van Mohammed-tekenfilm'|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=[[De Telegraaf]], Netherlands|date=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, critical of Islam and Muhammad, was to depict Muhammad as a "sexual pervert" for the consummation of his marriage to [[Aisha]] when she was nine or ten years old at the time. In one clip, Muhammad is shown with an [[erection]], taking the girl to a mosque adorned with a [[Swastika#As the symbol of Nazism|Nazi swastika]], in preparation of her deflowering.&lt;ref name="jamigirl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/3666033/_Minister_doet_een_beroep_op_Jami__.html|title=Minister vraagt Jami af te zien van islamfilm|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=[[De Telegraaf]], Netherlands|date=2008-03-29|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following calls from the [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Minister of Justice]], [[Ernst Hirsch Ballin]], to not increase tension in society, Jami decided against its release. He spoke of his fears that the Dutch police would be unable to adequately protect his safety, and of the possibility of a fatwa calling for his death being issued by Iran.&lt;ref name="jami"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article521586.ece/Jami_ziet_af_van_animatiefilm_tegen_islam|title=Jami ziet af van animatiefilm tegen islam|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=[[De Volkskrant]], Netherlands|date=2008-03-31|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jaminis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nisnews.nl/public/020408_1.htm |title=Film 'Worse than Fitna' Abandoned over Fatwa Fear |accessdate=2008-04-04 |publisher=NIS, Netherlands |date=2008-04-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408101344/http://www.nisnews.nl/public/020408_1.htm |archivedate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch Islamic Federation petitioned a judge for a judgement on Geert Wilders on allegations of [[Hate speech|hate speech law]] violations.&lt;ref name="dutchshrug"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1726155,00.html|title=Dutch Shrug for Anti-Muslim Film|first=Lauren|last=Comiteau|date=2008-03-30|accessdate=2008-04-08|work=[[TIME Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilders was found not guilty of spreading hate.&lt;ref name="wildersclear"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/articles/news/Judge-clears-Wilders-of-spreading-hate.html|title=Judge clears Wilders of spreading hate|date=2008-04-07|accessdate=2008-04-08|work=expatica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, a pamphlet that was distributed to children aged 10–12 years compared ''Fitna'' to ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', stating that "Geert Wilders’ film Fitna and Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf are based upon one-sided points-of-view. Fortunately there are also other books and plays that -on the contrary- show respect for people with other ideas or faiths or that look different." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hudsonny.org/2008/11/wilders-is-hitler.php |title=Wilders is Hitler |accessdate=2008-11-05 |publisher=Hudson New York |date=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In [[Algeria]], the Minister for Religious Affairs said that ''Fitna'' is "a recurrent expression of the fascism which is abhorred by all cultures", and the country's imams have been ordered to denounce the film.&lt;ref name="algeria"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2008/04/02/feature-01|title=Algerians join international outrage over "Fitna" film|accessdate=2008-04-03|publisher=[[Magharebia]]|date=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egypt]], Foreign minister referred to Wilders' film as "a humiliation" to Islam, calling it "nothing less than repugnant," and stating that "Egypt rejects any offence or denigration of Islam and its prophet."&lt;ref name="arabsdenounce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mwl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/891/eg5.htm|title=Blasted backlash|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=[[Al-Ahram]]|date=2008-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408102846/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/891/eg5.htm|archive-date=2008-04-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Omar al-Bashir]] of [[Sudan]] called on Muslims to "challenge those who insult" Muhammad, and asked for "a binding international charter" for the respect of religious beliefs. al-Bashir continued: ""The offenses against our Arab and Islamic nations under the banner of freedom of expression are derogatory and defamatory and go against all human values."&lt;ref name="arabsdenounce"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hvjTyyTBwAmgI4o2OKkJTIjX5pEgD8VNDF8G0 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124145102/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hvjTyyTBwAmgI4o2OKkJTIjX5pEgD8VNDF8G0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-24 |title=Arabs Denounce Dutch Anti-Islam Film |accessdate=2008-04-04 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2008-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====Central Asia====
[[Murat Ali Jumanov]], the Grand [[Mufti]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]], denounced the film, saying that it defames Islam and the Koran. He urged Kyrgyzstan's Muslim population to counter the hostility of the film's release.&lt;ref name="kyrgyzstan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathaba.net/news/?x=587534|title=Kyrgyz grand Mufti condemns anti-Islam film|accessdate=2008-04-03|publisher=Mathaba|date=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Asia====
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh "condemned in the strongest terms" the release of ''Fitna''. It said that "Islam is a faith of peace which preaches patience and understanding," and the film's "unwarranted and mindless release can have grave consequences."&lt;ref name="mofa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.bd/Adviser%20press%20release.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426024913/http://www.mofa.gov.bd/Adviser%20press%20release.htm |archive-date=2007-04-26 |title=Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the posting of Dutch film on Holy Quran on the web |accessdate=2008-04-04 |publisher=Bangladesh Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=2008-03-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial for the independent English-language Bangladeshi newspaper ''[[Weekly Blitz]]'', under the editorship of [[Salah Choudhury]], there were many opinions expressed in condemnation of the Muslim world's response: "The Muslim world that is vocal and vociferous in its demands for censorship in the West is going through a reenergized paroxysm of anger and hate," the newspaper said, and asked "is it realistic to mandate that 100% of the world’s population must be pro-Koran and pro-Muslim?" The editorial stated that ''Fitna's'' relative artistic or philosophical worth is irrelevant, and that its release is an issue of [[individual rights]], [[freedom of speech]], [[critical thinking]], and the West's cultural inheritance of 3,000 years of civilization. The editorial continued to question Muslim countries' censorship and restriction of free speech, satirically saying that "we should ask them firmly yet politely exactly how they so effectively censor the existing hate speech, the rampant anti-Semitic and anti-West propaganda that fill their media, Mosques, schools and universities on an hourly basis, every day, almost without exclusion." The newspaper noted the hypocrisy of how [[Islam and other religions|Islam interacts with other religions]], saying that Islam has "such unrivaled respect and such unprejudiced consideration for Christianity, Judaism and the rest of the world’s religious cultures and beliefs." It notes that anti-government, pro-democratic, and "moderate or revolutionary speech and actions within their societies" are censored, and that [[multiculturalism]], [[freedom of religion]], and "unqualified personal expression" is prohibited.&lt;ref name="blitz"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sacks, Leslie J. |date=2008-04-03 |title=FITNA Unveiled |url=http://www.weeklyblitz.net/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1207259492&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=3&amp;cat=3 |newspaper=The Weekly Blitz |accessdate=2008-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415182903/http://www.weeklyblitz.net/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1207259492&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=3&amp;cat=3 |archivedate=April 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated that ''Fitna'' and the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons were a reaction against the "blossoming of Islam," and that "these films and caricatures are disseminated under the pretext of freedom of information in Europe.

Khatami spoke of a Europe actively engaged in defaming Islam, saying that "there is a catchy disease spreading in Europe today, whose victims feel obliged to insult Islam and to fight against the Muslims," mentioning the conversion of [[Magdi Allam]] from Islam to [[Catholicism]] as further proof of his statements. He claimed that European "plans" that had been "devised for hundreds of years have borne absolutely no fruit, which is the reason why they have begun conducting such wretched moves." Khatami said that "such moves are made in Europe under the cover of freedom of expression prove that such a freedom does not exist there, since as soon as an intellectual begins talking about the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], they put him to trial, condemn his move, and imprison him." He claimed that Islam in the Netherlands is increasing, saying that "the Dutch have also bought a large number of electronic versions of Qur'an in their own language and a large number of people in Holland have openly announced they have converted to Islam."&lt;ref name="ayatollah2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0804047792170302.htm|title=Major cleric: Iran's 3 islands to remain Iranian for good|accessdate=2008-04-05|publisher=[[Islamic Republic News Agency]]|date=2008-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413095555/http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0804047792170302.htm|archive-date=2008-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch ambassador of [[Qatar]] said that: "In Holland, we have full freedom of expression. There is absolutely no censorship.

The [[Saudi Arabia]]n embassy in [[The Hague]] called the film provocative and "full of errors", that could ultimately lead to hatred of Muslims.&lt;ref name="saudi_condemn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-32732420080329|title=Muslim nations condemn Dutch Koran film|accessdate=2008-04-03|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2008-03-28 | first=Niclas | last=Mika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Directorate of Religious Affairs]] in [[Turkey]] condemned the film as being 'incompatible with freedom of speech and thought', saying that it "aimed to portray Muslims as potential terrorists and to gradually exclude them from the [[international community]]." The Directorate said that "Islam is unfortunately face-to-face with a new 'fitna' due to the film, which promotes discrimination, hatred and violence." It continued to say that the film's objective was to create worldwide prejudice against Islam, and that "it is a serious indication of irresponsibility that in the film negative implications are directed at Muslim religious scholars, who never refrain from sharing their knowledge on religion with the Dutch government." The Directorate said that followers of other religions also did not accept the notion that [[terrorism]] is associated with Muslims, and that "this is an auspicious development for restoring peace among different cultures in the world."&lt;ref name="zaman"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=138102|title=Religious Affairs Directorate blasts anti-Islam film|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=[[Today's Zaman]]|date=2008-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605015617/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=138102|archive-date=2008-06-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lengthier responses were released by the [[Arab European League]] and the Union of NGOs of the Islamic World.

====Union of NGOs of the Islamic World====
The [[Union of NGOs of the Islamic World]] (UNIW) issued a press release, stating that the film "heavily included insults to the Holy Qur’an and to the Islamic values." The UNIW said that distribution of such [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] material, as well as other forms of Islamophobia such as the [[Play (theatre)|theatrical]] interpretation of Salman Rushdie's [[novel]], ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', and the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons, should be banned in Europe. It said that "humiliation of the values that are held in high esteem by people cannot be justified by the freedom of speech" or [[art|artistic expression]]. It stated that "freedom of speech and disseminating ideas do not amount to the right to insult," and that no-one's "sacred values" should be humiliated. It went on to call for European states to "not give permission to such publications, broadcasts and policies," and asked that they "take the necessary regulations that shall regard the Islamophobic acts and incidents as a crime." The UNIW likened Islamophobia to antisemitism and its legal status in Europe, saying that if Islamophobia and Islamophobic publications are not made illegal, "marginal extremist-racist groups that are after discrimination may be strengthened." It said that Islamophobia is an  infringement of [[human rights]], and "a perilous discrimination." It said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The reason why Muslim public opinion have not overreacted to these aforementioned broadcasts, policies and events is that they have a common sense stemming from their belief. Nevertheless, it does not mean that they shall never react. It should be ensured that Muslim public opinion react to these all the Anti-Islamist broadcasts, policies and acts through peaceful means.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The UNIW called on Europe "to use their common sense and heed, and to revise their attitudes in order to build social peace."

====Arab European League====
The [[Arab European League]] released a short film, ''Al Mouftinoun'', in response to ''Fitna''. It was released March 28 on [[YouTube]], one day after ''Fitna'' was released. ''Al Mouftinoun'' criticizes Fitna's director Wilders as a [[racism|racist]]. The film was created by the AEL because they find that [[Muslim]]s are being marginalised and [[discrimination|discriminated]] against by ''Fitna''.&lt;ref name="De Arabisch-Europese Liga lanceert film"&gt;{{cite news
| title = De Arabisch-Europese Liga lanceert film

| publisher = Arab European League Belgium
| date = 2008-03-28
| accessdate = 2008-03-29
| language = Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [http://www.ael.nl/ their website], the AEL claimed the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The announced movie of Wilders and the Danish cartoons are part of an agenda to provoke Muslims in Europe and around the world under the flag of freedom of expression. There can be no doubt about their intentions. Defending their statements with the right of expression is deceptive. There should be a debate on the content.
The right-wing movement should not be underestimated. They represent a large part of European society. They are advocating for the eradication of equality as a constitutional law. And more often advocating for constriction of the rights of ethnic minorities. The right-wing movement in the Netherlands and in Europe in general is not compatible with its own "Western  values."&lt;ref&gt;AEL Blog about Fitna&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''iron harvest''' is the annual "harvest" of [[unexploded ordnance]], [[barbed wire]], shrapnel, bullets and congruent trench supports collected by Belgian and French farmers after plowing their fields. The harvest generally applies to the material from [[World War I]], which is still found in large quantities across the former [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

==Unexploded munitions==
{{see also|Unexploded ordnance}}
[[File:World-war-one-belgium-iron-harvest-telegraphpole.redvers.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Stokes Mortar|Stokes trench mortar]] shell from World War I left in a telegraph pole for disposal in 2004 near [[Ieper]] in [[Belgium]]]]
[[File:Passendale Iron Harvest.JPG|thumb|Shell pieces and other battlefield artifacts deposited next to a farmer's bin at [[Passendale]]]]

During World War I an estimated one tonne of explosives was fired for every square meter of territory on the Western front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/world_war_i/197406.stm BBC News] "Legacies of the Great War" 3 November 1998, accessed 1 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As many as one in every three shells fired did not detonate. In the [[Ypres Salient]], an estimated 300 million projectiles that the British and the German forces fired at each other during World War I were [[dud]]s, and most of them have not been recovered.{{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Daily Mail is [[WP:DAILYMAIL|not a reliable source]]}} In 2013, 160 tonnes of munitions, from bullets to 15 inch naval gun shells, were unearthed from the areas around Ypres.{{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Daily Mail is [[WP:DAILYMAIL|not a reliable source]]}}

Unexploded weapons—in the form of shells, bullets, and grenades—buried themselves on impact or were otherwise quickly swallowed in the mud. As time passes, construction work, field plowing, and natural processes bring the rusting shells to the surface. Most of the iron harvest is found during the spring planting and autumn plowing as the region of northern France and [[Flanders]] are rich agricultural areas.&lt;ref name="Geo"&gt;{{cite book |title=Humans as Geologic Agents |first1=Judy |last1=Ehlen |first2=William |last2=Haneberg |first3=Robert |last3=Larson |publisher=Geological Society of America,| page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers collect the munitions and place them along the boundaries of fields or other collection points for authorities.&lt;ref name="Geo"/&gt;

==Dangers==
Despite the condition of the shells, they remain very dangerous. The French ''Département du Déminage'' (Department of Mine Clearance) recovers about 900 tons of unexploded munitions every year. Since 1945, approximately 630 French clearers{{what?|date=October 2018}} have died handling unexploded munitions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200412/russell The Atlantic online] "The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Humankind" December 2004, accessed 1 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Two died handling munitions outside [[Vimy]], [[France]] as recently as 1998. Over 20 members of Belgian Explosive Ordnance Disposal (DOVO) have died disposing of First World War munitions since the unit was formed in 1919. Civilian deaths are also common. In just the area around Ypres, 260 people have been killed and 535 have been injured by unexploded munitions since the end of the First World War. Shells containing poisonous gas remain viable and will corrode and release their gas content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cleanup of Chemical and Explosive Munitions: Location, Identification and Environmental Remediation |first=Richard |last=Albright |year =2011 |page=120 |publisher=William Andrew |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to five percent of the shells fired during the First World War contained poisonous gas and ordnance disposal experts continue to suffer burns from [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] shells that were split open.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Disposal==
In Belgium, iron harvest discovered by farmers is carefully placed around field edges, or in gaps in telegraph poles, where it is regularly collected by the Belgian army for disposal by controlled explosion at a specialist center in [[Langemark-Poelkapelle|Poelkapelle]]. The depot was built after ocean dumping of shells stopped in 1980. Once extracted by the army, the gas chemicals are burned and destroyed at high temperatures at specialized facilities and the explosives detonated.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The '''J-[[integral]]''' represents a way to calculate the [[strain energy release rate]], or work ([[energy]]) per unit fracture surface area, in a material.&lt;ref name=VanVliet&gt;[http://www.stellar.mit.edu/S/course/3/fa06/3.032/index.html Van Vliet, Krystyn J. (2006); "3.032 Mechanical Behavior of Materials"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical concept of J-integral was developed in 1967 by Cherepanov&lt;ref&gt;G. P. Cherepanov, '' The propagation of cracks in a continuous medium'', Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, 31(3), 1967, pp. 503–512.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1968 by [[James R. Rice|Jim Rice]]&lt;ref name=Rice68&gt;J. R. Rice, ''A Path Independent Integral and the Approximate Analysis of Strain Concentration by Notches and Cracks'', Journal of Applied Mechanics, 35, 1968, pp. 379–386.&lt;/ref&gt; independently, who showed that an energetic [[contour integral|contour path integral]] (called ''J'') was independent of the path around a [[Fracture|crack]].

Later, experimental methods were developed, which allowed measurement of critical fracture properties using laboratory-scale specimens for materials in which sample sizes are too small and for which the assumptions of Linear Elastic [[Fracture Mechanics]] (LEFM) do not hold,&lt;ref name="Lee and Donavon"&gt;Lee, R. F., &amp; Donovan, J. A. (1987). J-integral and crack opening displacement as crack initiation criteria in natural rubber in pure shear and tensile specimens. Rubber chemistry and technology, 60(4), 674–688. [https://dx.doi.org/10.5254/1.3536150]&lt;/ref&gt; and to infer a critical value of fracture energy ''J''&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt;.  The quantity ''J''&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt; defines the point at which large-scale [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] yielding during propagation takes place under mode one loading.&lt;ref name="VanVliet" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;Meyers and Chawla (1999): "Mechanical Behavior of Materials," 445–448.&lt;/ref&gt;

The J-integral is equal to the [[strain energy release rate]] for a crack in a body subjected to monotonic loading.&lt;ref name="Yoda80"&gt;Yoda, M., 1980, ''The J-integral fracture toughness for Mode II'', Int. J. Fracture, 16(4), pp. R175–R178.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is generally true, under quasistatic conditions, only for [[linear elasticity|linear elastic]] materials. For materials that experience small-scale [[yield (engineering)|yield]]ing at the crack tip, ''J'' can be used to compute the energy release rate under special circumstances such as monotonic loading in [[fracture mechanics|mode III]] ([[antiplane shear]]).  The strain energy release rate can also be computed from ''J'' for pure [[power-law hardening]] [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] materials that undergo small-scale yielding at the crack tip.

The quantity ''J'' is not path-independent for monotonic [[fracture mechanics|mode I]] and [[fracture mechanics|mode II]] loading of elastic-plastic materials, so only a contour very close to the crack tip gives the energy release rate.  Also, Rice showed that ''J'' is path-independent in plastic materials when there is no non-[[proportional loading]]. Unloading is a special case of this, but non-proportional plastic loading also invalidates the path-independence. Such non-proportional loading is the reason for the path-dependence for the in-plane loading modes on elastic-plastic materials.

== Two-dimensional J-integral ==
[[File:Integrale-J 2D.png|200px|right|thumb|Figure 1. Line J-integral around a notch in two dimensions.]]
The two-dimensional J-integral was originally defined as&lt;ref name="Rice68" /&gt; (see Figure 1 for an illustration)
:&lt;math&gt;
   J := \int_\Gamma \left(W~dx_2 - \mathbf{t}\cdot\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial x_1}~ds\right)
        = \int_\Gamma \left(W~dx_2 - t_i\,\cfrac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_1}~ds\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''W''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[strain energy density]], ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinate directions, '''t'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;['''σ''']'''n''' is the [[stress (physics)|surface traction]] vector, '''n''' is the normal to the curve Γ, ['''σ'''] is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]], and '''u''' is the [[displacement vector]].  The strain energy density is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  W = \int_0^{[\varepsilon]} [\boldsymbol{\sigma}]:d[\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}] ~;~~ 
  [\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}] = \tfrac{1}{2}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u}+(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^T\right] ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The J-integral around a crack tip is frequently expressed in a more general form{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} (and in [[Einstein notation|index notation]]) as 
:&lt;math&gt;
   J_i := \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0} \int_{\Gamma_\varepsilon} \left(W(\Gamma) n_i - n_j\sigma_{jk}~\cfrac{\partial u_k(\Gamma, x_i)}{\partial x_i}\right) \, d\Gamma
 &lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt; is the component of the J-integral for crack opening in the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; direction and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a small region around the crack tip.
Using [[Green's theorem]] we can show that this integral is zero when the boundary &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is closed and encloses a region that contains no [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] and is [[simply connected]].  If the faces of the crack do not have any [[surface traction]]s on them then the J-integral is also [[path independence|path independent]].

Rice also showed that the value of the J-integral represents the energy release rate for planar crack growth.
The J-integral was developed because of the difficulties involved in computing the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] close to a crack in a nonlinear [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or elastic-[[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] material.  Rice showed that if monotonic loading was assumed (without any plastic unloading) then the J-integral could be used to compute the energy release rate of plastic materials too.

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Proof that the J-integral is zero over a closed path
|-
|To show the path independence of the J-integral, we first have to show that the value of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is zero over a closed contour in a simply connected domain.  Let us just consider the expression for &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; which is
:&lt;math&gt;
   J_1 := \int_\Gamma \left(W n_1 - n_j\sigma_{jk}~\cfrac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_1}\right) \, d\Gamma
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can write this as
:&lt;math&gt;
   J_1 = \int_\Gamma \left(W \delta_{1j} - \sigma_{jk}~\cfrac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_1}\right)n_j \, d\Gamma
 &lt;/math&gt;
From [[Green's theorem]] (or the two-dimensional [[divergence theorem]]) we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{\Gamma} f_j~n_j~d\Gamma = \int_A \cfrac{\partial f_j}{\partial x_j}~dA
 &lt;/math&gt;
Using this result we can express &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   J_1 &amp; = \int_A \cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(W \delta_{1j} - \sigma_{jk}~\cfrac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_1}\right) dA \\
     &amp; = \int_A \left[\cfrac{\partial W}{\partial x_1} - 
                \cfrac{\partial\sigma_{jk}}{\partial x_j}~\cfrac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_1} -
                \sigma_{jk}~\cfrac{\partial^2 u_k}{\partial x_1 \partial x_j}\right]~dA
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area enclosed by the contour &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, if there are '''no body forces''' present, equilibrium (conservation of linear momentum) requires that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mathbf{0} \qquad \implies \qquad  \cfrac{\partial\sigma_{jk}}{\partial x_j} = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Also,
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}] = \tfrac{1}{2}\left[\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u}+(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^T\right] 
  \qquad \implies \qquad
  \varepsilon_{jk} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_j} + \cfrac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_k}\right) ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{jk}\cfrac{\partial\varepsilon_{jk}}{\partial x_1} = 
    \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_{jk}\cfrac{\partial^2 u_k}{\partial x_1 \partial x_j} + \sigma_{jk}\cfrac{\partial^2 u_j}{\partial x_1 \partial x_k}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the balance of angular momentum we have &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{jk} = \sigma_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{jk}\cfrac{\partial\varepsilon_{jk}}{\partial x_1} = 
    \sigma_{jk}\cfrac{\partial^2 u_j}{\partial x_1 \partial x_k}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The J-integral may then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   J_1 = \int_A \left[\cfrac{\partial W}{\partial x_1} - 
                \sigma_{jk}~\cfrac{\partial\varepsilon_{jk}}{\partial x_1}\right]~dA
 &lt;/math&gt;
Now, for an elastic material the stress can be derived from the stored energy function &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; using 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{jk} = \cfrac{\partial W}{\partial\varepsilon_{jk}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then, if the elastic modulus tensor is homogeneous, using the [[chain rule]] of differentiation,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{jk}~\cfrac{\partial\varepsilon_{jk}}{\partial x_1} = \cfrac{\partial W}{\partial\varepsilon_{jk}}~\cfrac{\partial\varepsilon_{jk}}{\partial x_1} = \cfrac{\partial W}{\partial x_1}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, we have &lt;math&gt;J_1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for a closed contour enclosing a simply connected region without any elastic inhomogeneity, such as voids and cracks.

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Proof that the J-integral is path-independent
|-
|[[Image:J integralPathIndep.png|200px|right|thumb|Figure 2. Integration paths around a notch in two dimensions.]]
Consider the contour &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \Gamma_1 + \Gamma^{+} + \Gamma_2 + \Gamma^{-} &lt;/math&gt;.  Since this contour is closed and encloses a simply connected region, the J-integral around the contour is zero, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;
   J = J_{(1)} + J^{+} - J_{(2)} - J^{-} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
assuming that counterclockwise integrals around the crack tip have positive sign.  Now, since the crack surfaces are parallel to the &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; axis, the normal component &lt;math&gt;n_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; on these surfaces.  Also, since the crack surfaces are traction free, &lt;math&gt;t_k = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  J^{+} = J^{-} = \int_{\Gamma} \left(W n_1 - t_k~\cfrac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_1}\right) \, d\Gamma = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  J_{(1)} = J_{(2)}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the J-integral is path independent.

==J-integral and fracture toughness==

For isotropic, perfectly brittle, linear elastic materials, the J-integral can be directly related to the [[fracture toughness]] if the crack extends straight ahead with respect to its original orientation.&lt;ref name="Yoda80" /&gt;

For plane strain, under [[fracture mechanics|Mode I]] loading conditions, this relation is
:&lt;math&gt;
  J_{\rm Ic} = G_{\rm Ic} = K_{\rm Ic}^2 \left(\frac{1-\nu^2}{E}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G_{\rm Ic}&lt;/math&gt; is the critical strain energy release rate, &lt;math&gt; K_{\rm Ic}&lt;/math&gt; is the fracture toughness in Mode I loading, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the Poisson's ratio, and ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]] of the material.

For [[fracture mechanics|Mode II]] loading, the relation between the J-integral and the mode II fracture toughness (&lt;math&gt;K_{\rm IIc}&lt;/math&gt;) is
:&lt;math&gt;
  J_{\rm IIc} = G_{\rm IIc} = K_{\rm IIc}^2 \left[\frac{1-\nu^2}{E}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

For [[fracture mechanics|Mode III]] loading, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt;
  J_{\rm IIIc} = G_{\rm IIIc} = K_{\rm IIIc}^2 \left(\frac{1+\nu}{E}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

== Elastic-plastic materials and the HRR solution ==

Hutchinson used a material [[constitutive law]] of the form suggested by [[Ramberg-Osgood plasticity|Ramberg and Osgood]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Ramberg|first1=Walter|first2=William R.|last2=Osgood|title= Description of stress-strain curves by three parameters|journal= US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|volume=902|year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_y}=\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_y}+\alpha\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_y}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ'' is the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress]] in uniaxial tension, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[yield (engineering)|yield stress]], ''ε'' is the [[infinitesimal strain theory|strain]],  and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/''E'' is the corresponding yield strain.  The quantity ''E'' is the elastic  [[Young's modulus]] of the material.  The model is parametrized by ''α'', a dimensionless constant characteristic of the material, and ''n'', the coefficient of [[work hardening]].  This model is applicable only to situations where the stress increases monotonically, the stress components remain approximately in the same ratios as loading progresses (proportional loading), and there is no [[flow plasticity theory|unloading]].

If a far-field tensile stress ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;far&lt;/sub&gt; is applied to the body shown in the adjacent figure, the J-integral around the path Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (chosen to be completely inside the elastic zone) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
    J_{\Gamma_1} = \pi\,(\sigma_{\text{far}})^2 \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since the total integral around the crack vanishes and the contributions along the surface of the crack are zero, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   J_{\Gamma_1} = -J_{\Gamma_2} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If the path Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen such that it is inside the fully plastic domain, Hutchinson showed that
:&lt;math&gt;
   J_{\Gamma_2} = -\alpha\,K^{n+1}\,r^{(n+1)(s-2)+1}\,I
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''K'' is a stress amplitude, (''r'',''θ'') is a [[polar coordinate system]] with origin at the crack tip, ''s'' is a constant determined from an asymptotic expansion of the stress field around the crack, and ''I'' is a dimensionless integral.  The relation between the J-integrals around  Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and  Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to the constraint
:&lt;math&gt;
   s = \frac{2n+1}{n+1} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
and an expression for ''K'' in terms of the far-field stress
:&lt;math&gt;
  K = \left(\frac{\beta\,\pi}{\alpha\,I}\right)^{\frac{1}{n+1}}\,(\sigma_{\text{far}})^{\frac{2}{n+1}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''β'' = 1 for [[plane stress]] and ''β'' = 1 − ''ν''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for [[plane strain]] (''ν'' is the [[Poisson's ratio]]).

The asymptotic expansion of the stress field and the above ideas can be used to determine the stress and strain fields in terms of the J-integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}= \sigma_y \left (\frac{EJ}{r\,\alpha \sigma_y^2 I} \right )^{{1}\over{n+1}}\tilde{\sigma}_{ij}(n,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}=\frac{\alpha \varepsilon_y}{E} \left (\frac{EJ}{r\,\alpha \sigma_y^2 I} \right )^{{n}\over{n+1}}\tilde{\varepsilon}_{ij}(n,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\sigma}_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\varepsilon}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are dimensionless functions.

These expressions indicate that ''J'' can be interpreted as a plastic analog to the [[stress intensity factor]] (''K'') that is used in linear elastic fracture mechanics, i.e., we can use a criterion such as ''J'' &gt; ''J''&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt; as a crack growth criterion.

== Plot ==
After John Wick loses his wife, Helen, to a terminal illness, he receives a [[beagle]] puppy named Daisy to help him cope with his grief. He connects with the puppy and they spend their day driving around in his vintage 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]]. At a gas station, he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters whose leader, Iosef Tarasov, insists on buying his car, but John refuses to sell it. The mobsters follow John to his home that night, knock him unconscious, steal his car, and kill Daisy.

Iosef takes the Mustang to a [[chop shop]] run by Aurelio to have the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] changed. Aurelio recognizes the car and, upon learning that Iosef stole it from John, punches him before throwing him out of his shop. John visits Aurelio, who tells him Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the head of the [[Russian mafia|Russian crime syndicate]] in [[New York City]]. Viggo, informed by Aurelio of Iosef's actions, beats and berates Iosef, explaining to him that John Wick was his best assassin, nicknamed "[[Baba Yaga]]". When John wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him an "impossible task", implied to involve multiple assassinations. John succeeded, and his efforts were key in establishing the Tarasov syndicate.

Viggo tries to talk John out of seeking retribution, but John silently refuses. Viggo then sends a twelve-man hit squad to John's house, but John kills them all and has the bodies professionally removed. An unsurprised Viggo places a $2-million bounty on John's head and personally offers the [[contract killing|contract]] to John's mentor, Marcus. John seeks refuge at the Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no "business" on its premises. Viggo doubles the bounty for those willing to break the rules to kill John at the Continental.

John learns from Winston, the Continental's owner, that Viggo has Iosef protected at his nightclub, the Red Circle. John enters the Red Circle and kills his way to Iosef, but Viggo's henchman Kirill waylays John, allowing Iosef to escape. John retreats to the Continental to patch up his injuries. Ms. Perkins, an assassin and former acquaintance, sneaks into John's room to kill him, but Marcus alerts John, allowing him to subdue Perkins. He forces Perkins to reveal the location of Viggo's [[front organization|front]], knocks her unconscious and leaves her with fellow assassin Harry to await punishment. However, Perkins frees herself and kills Harry.

John travels to the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Little Russia]] church which serves as Viggo's front and destroys Viggo's cache of money and [[blackmail]] material. When Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but he is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking he could leave his old life behind. Before John can be killed, Marcus intervenes again, allowing John to free himself, kill Kirill, and accost Viggo, who reveals Iosef's location. John then travels to Iosef's [[safe house]] and kills him.

Perkins learns that John and Marcus have been in contact and tells Viggo, who has Marcus beaten for information before executing him in his home. Viggo calls John to report this, planning to have Perkins ambush him. Perkins, however, is called to a meeting with Winston, who has her executed for breaking the Continental's rules.

Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter. John races to the harbor helipad, where he kills Viggo's remaining henchmen before engaging Viggo in a fistfight on the dock. Viggo pulls a knife, but John allows himself to be stabbed, surprising Viggo. John then disarms and fatally wounds Viggo. Wounded himself, John stops at a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound and takes with him a [[pit bull]] puppy which was scheduled to be [[animal euthanasia|euthanized]]. John and the dog walk home along the boardwalk where he had his last date with Helen.

{{quote box
| quote = Making a movie is actually fairly easy. Making a good one is much harder. It was a huge learning experience and I'm very proud of it. We stretched our schedule to the absolute limits. We fought for what we believed in, and chose to make a story-driven, character-driven action movie. That's why I chose to do it. This was an opportunity to do something that wasn't just about cars, explosions, fire and fights. Yes, John fights; yes, he shoots guns; and he drives a car very fast, but the focus was always trying to do something cinematically different.

The premise for ''John Wick'' was conceived by screenwriter Derek Kolstad who began work on a [[film treatment|treatment]] about a retired contract killer coming out to seek vengeance, entitled ''Scorn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Derek Kolstad Interview|url=http://theactionelite.com/2012/07/derek-kolstad-interview/ |accessdate=July 30, 2012|newspaper=The Action Elite|date=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After one month of work, he had completed the first draft of the screenplay, and once he had addressed several issues he pitched the script to various clients, garnering at least three offers.&lt;ref name="JOHN WICK, HIT MAN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoaisnotme.net/articles/2014_0106_joh.htm|title=JOHN WICK, HIT MAN|publisher=whoa is (not) me|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolstad was influenced by film-noir classics and the themes of [[revenge]] and the [[antihero]] and what might play out if the most evil man found redemption only to have it taken away.&lt;ref name="John Wick PRODUCTION NOTES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/showbiz/movie-review-reeves-returns-wicked-action-flick|title=Reeves returns in wicked action flick|publisher=AsiaOne Entertainment|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Alistair MacLean]] and [[Stephen King]] influenced Kolstad in creating the story in terms of world-building and characterisation, respectively.&lt;ref name="Flickering Myth" /&gt;

On December 3, 2012, it was announced that [[Thunder Road Pictures]] had bought the script with [[Discretionary spending|discretionary funds]], with Kolstad agreeing due to plans to make the film straight away.&lt;ref name="Scorn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JOHN WICK, HIT MAN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/the-hit-list-2012-full-list/|title=THE HIT LIST 2012 (FULL LIST)|publisher=Tracking Board|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Basil Iwanyk, head of Thunder Road Pictures, had first read Kolstad's original screenplay, he was immediately drawn to the main character of Wick.&lt;ref name="EmanuelLevy" /&gt; He also admired the emotional weight and action theme of the piece. After Thunder Road had optioned the script, Kolstad spent additional months refurbishing the script with them. In the original script, the character of John Wick was written with "a man in his mid-sixties" to play the role, given the title character's fabled reputation as a revered and respected assassin.&lt;ref name="EmanuelLevy" /&gt; However, Iwanyk was of the belief that this was irrelevant, and rather than casting an older actor looked for a film veteran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movienews.me/2014/10/keanu-reeves-plays-hitman-in-john-wick.html|title=KEANU REEVES PLAYS HITMAN IN "JOHN WICK" – Surprises with Unexpected Use Of Artillery In Action Scenes|publisher=MovieNews.Me|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2013, it was announced that [[Keanu Reeves]] had begun negotiations in April to star in the piece. He was later confirmed as the film's male lead, after Iwanyk and Peter Lawson of Thunder Road showed him the script,&lt;ref name="John Wick PRODUCTION NOTES" /&gt; which he thought to be full of potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.inquirer.net/15643/keanu-reeves-plays-hitman-in-john-wick-surprises-with-unexpected-use-of-artillery-in-action-scenes|title=Keanu Reeves plays hitman in 'John Wick' – Surprises with unexpected use of artillery in action scenes|publisher=Inquirer EX Movies|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves and Kolstad had worked closely together on further developing the screenplay and the story,&lt;ref name="JOHN WICK, HIT MAN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoaisnotme.net/dedication.htm|title=on his dedication to his craft|publisher=whoa is (not) me|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the screenwriter stating that Reeves understood how even tiny details affect the story's strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/movies/news/2014/10/23/1383520/keanu-reeves-film-john-wick-gets-positive-reviews|title=Keanu Reeves film 'John Wick' gets positive reviews|publisher=PhilSTAR|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the film was later changed from ''Scorn'' as, according to Kolstad, "Reeves kept telling everyone that he was making a film called 'John Wick{{' "}}, and the producers agreed, changing the title.&lt;ref name="Edgewood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgewood.k12.wi.us/media/CrusConn14.pdf|title=Alumni and Friends of Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart|publisher=Edgewood|accessdate=October 22, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053259/http://www.edgewood.k12.wi.us/media/CrusConn14.pdf|archivedate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During story discussions, Reeves contacted [[Chad Stahelski]] and [[David Leitch (director)|David Leitch]], who he originally met on the set of ''[[The Matrix]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Chad Stahelski &amp; David Leitch|url=http://dorkshelf.com/2014/10/24/interview-chad-stahelski-david-leitch/|accessdate=October 24, 2014|newspaper=Dorkshelf|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to see if they were interested in choreographing the action&lt;ref name="thesource.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Veteran stuntmen become directors with 'John Wick'|url=https://news.yahoo.com/veteran-stuntmen-become-directors-john-wick-155217192.html|accessdate=October 17, 2014|newspaper=[[Yahoo]]|date=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he hoped they would direct.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com" /&gt; He thought the project and the worlds it created would appeal to them.&lt;ref name="thesource.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com" /&gt; The quality of the script and Reeves' enthusiasm convinced Stahelski and Leitch to direct the film. They later presented a thriller version of the story with Wick as an urban legend.&lt;ref name="John Wick PRODUCTION NOTES" /&gt; With Reeves' support, Stahelski and Leitch pitched the idea to the studio, who hired them to direct, contrary to an initial request of directing the film's second unit.&lt;ref name="thesource.com" /&gt; On May&amp;nbsp;7, 2013, it was announced that Stahelski and Leitch were to direct the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keanu Reeves to star in John Wick|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/distribution/keanu-reeves-to-star-in-john-wick/5054693.article|accessdate=May 7, 2013|newspaper=[[Screen International]]|date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keanu Reeves To Play "John Wick"|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/27028/keanu-reeves-to-play-john-wick|accessdate=May 7, 2013|newspaper=[[Dark Horizons]]|date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was later ruled by the [[Directors Guild of America]] that only Stahelski would be given the director credit.&lt;ref name="filmstage" /&gt; Leitch was credited as a producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outtakesatl.com/2014/10/24/john-wick/|title='JOHN WICK'|publisher=Outtakes Atlanta|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stahelski acknowledged the challenges in balancing the action with the pace and tone,&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com" /&gt; having done this for individual scenes but never before for a whole movie. He acknowledged that action itself should be a collaborative entity with the story, as opposed to being a separate element.&lt;ref name="womanusa.net"&gt;{{cite news|title='John Wick': Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe Talk "Fantasy" Drifting and Gun Fu Stunts|url=http://womanusa.net/entertainment/movies/john-wick-keanu-reeves-willem-dafoe-talk-fantasy-drifting-and-gun-fu-stunts/|accessdate=October 14, 2014|newspaper=Woman USA|date=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said they didn't stop the story for an action sequence, but integrated it to provide a deeper feeling of the characters.&lt;ref name="Reeves impresses colleagues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="womanusa.net" /&gt;

It was remarked by Kolstad, once Reeves, Stahelski and Leitch were officially on board, that from January to September 2013,&lt;ref name="theactionelite.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Screenwriter Derek Kolstad Talks 'John Wick'|url=http://theactionelite.com/2014/10/screenwriter-derek-kolstad-talks-john-wick/|accessdate=October 3, 2014|newspaper=The Action Elite|date=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was still working on the final drafts of the screenplay, which he described as a "relentless process ... in order to get everyone's vision in check."&lt;ref name="theactionelite.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Derek Kolstad Interview|url=http://theactionelite.com/2012/07/derek-kolstad-interview/|accessdate=July 30, 2012|newspaper=The Action Elite|date=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to directors commentary, their first cut of the movie was 2 hours and 20 minutes long. They didn't reveal much about approximately 39 minutes of footage that was left out of the movie but they did mention that the climactic fight between John and Viggo was pared down after they acknowledged that Viggo shouldn't pose a big physical threat to Wick. David Leitch said many visually amazing shots were cut which were "just Keanu walking in cool environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/38-things-learned-john-wick-commentary.php|title=38 Things we learned from the John Wick commentary|first=Rob|last=Hunter|publisher=Film School Rejects|date=February 2, 2015|accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinematography ===
{{quote box
| quote = Having the ALEXA XT with in-camera ARRIRAW is like going to back to an ARRICAM or an ARRIFLEX 435, which is amazing.
|source= — Cinematographer [[Jonathan Sela]], on the usage of ALEXA XT on ''John Wick''&lt;ref name="ALEXA XT on JOHN WICK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/news/news/alexa-xt-on-john-wick/|title=ALEXA XT on JOHN WICK|publisher= [[Arri Alexa]]|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomprehensible inline|date=April 2018|A quote should illustrate a point in support of the prose but this one would be incomprehensible to the average reader, recommend removing it.}}

The film was shot digitally with [[Arri Alexa]] XT in a [[Aspect ratio (image)|distributed aspect ratio]] of [[2.39:1]].&lt;ref name="John Wick 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shotonwhat.com/john-wick-2014.html|title=John Wick (2014)|publisher= ShotOnWhat|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cinematographer Jonathan Sela chose to work with Arri Alexa XT cameras due to discussions regarding the look of the film. He had pushed for a mix of [[Arricam]] and Alexa for a blend of film and digital&lt;ref name="ALEXA XT on JOHN WICK" /&gt; but the cost of both packages and film was unreasonable so they used ALEXA exclusively. Sela had familiarity with the camera from previous commercial work.&lt;ref name="ALEXA XT on JOHN WICK" /&gt;

Sela spoke of the idea that Stahelski, Leitch and himself wished to achieve a visual contrast between John Wick's normal life and the other of which he's drawn back into the underworld of assassins. "We wanted the first look to be soft and clean, and the second to be grittier, darker and sharper." They shot with a single camera so Sela used lenses and camera techniques to achieve the contrasting visuals. He describes the first section of the film as being far more static by stating that, "the camera never stops moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/news/news/alexa-xt-on-john-wick/|title='John Wick' DP Jonathan Sela Achieves Two Distinctive Looks with ARRI Alexa X|publisher= Creative Planet Network|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For ''John Wick'' he had decided on using both [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] and spherical lenses, to which he combined a set of Hawk V-Lite Vintage '74 anamorphics with that of [[Cooke Optics|Cooke S4]] sphericals. The initial plan was to use the anamorphic and spherical lenses in the first and second parts, respectively, to create the visual contrast; however, he decided against such a course of action as he felt camerawork alone sufficiently separated the worlds, allowing them to use anamorphics for day shoots and sphericals at night.&lt;ref name="ALEXA XT on JOHN WICK" /&gt; Sela praised Hawk's Vintage '74 as "beautiful", though they flare considerably, which would have become overbearing during night-time shooting. He felt their daytime use gave a "hazy look [... which seemed ...] more cinematic".&lt;ref name="ALEXA XT on JOHN WICK" /&gt;

According to Sela, on-board ARRIRAW recording with the ALEXA XT cameras made a considerable difference with camerawork, stating, "Having the ALEXA XT with [[In-camera editing|in-camera]] ARRIRAW is like going to back to an ARRICAM or an ARRIFLEX 435, which is amazing."{{incomprehensible inline|date=April 2018|A quote should illustrate a point in support of the prose but this one would be incomprehensible to the average reader, recommend removing it.}} There was a considerable amount of handheld camera work on the second section and usage of the ALEXA M allowed filming through windows and tight spaces, particularly for the car scenes.&lt;ref name="ALEXA XT on JOHN WICK" /&gt;
Sela was recording ARRIRAW and used the whole sensor area of ALEXA's 4:3 for the anamorphic scenes, which allowed for the maximisation of the image quality for a 4K cinema release. The extra sensor area provided valuable data for later image processing.&lt;ref name="ALEXA XT on JOHN WICK" /&gt;

=== Design ===
==== Costume ====
[[Costume designer]] Luca Mosca explained that Wick had to possess a piece of attire that had to be worn throughout almost the entire production of the film. Mosca's team tailored it to be "sleek and timeless" for the film's world. Due to the nature of the world Stahelski and Leitch created, Mosca had to create a statement for every character based on their costume.&lt;ref name="cinemareview.com" /&gt;
Reeves gave praise for the costume designer and highlighted Mosca's ability to give the pieces of clothing subtle meanings. He described his costume as "funereal" and "priestly" and stylish without standing out.&lt;ref name="John Wick" /&gt;
Initially the villains were to be in combat gear, but later they decided against that due to the principle that they have to be placed in suits, with Leitch quoting Mosca, "It is about men in suits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinapse.co/2014/09/30/interview-john-wick-directors-chad-stahelski-and-david-leitch-discuss-capturing-fluid-hard-r-action/|title=INTERVIEW: JOHN WICK DIRECTORS CHAD STAHELSKI AND DAVID LEITCH DISCUSS CAPTURING FLUID, HARD-R ACTION|publisher= [[Cinapse]]|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Set ====
''John Wick'' features not two worlds, but instead "two of everything", joked production designer Dan Leigh on the contrast of the worlds.&lt;ref name="cinemareview.com" /&gt; Leigh approached the production as a graphic-novel fable, with ethereal textures and unexpected set dressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emanuellevy.com/comment/john-wick-visual-style/|title=John Wick: Visual Style|publisher=[[Emanuel Levy]]|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sound ====
James Bolt and Martyn Zub were the [[re-recording mixer]]s. [[Mark Stoeckinger]] was the supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/477328/John-Wick/credits|title=John Wick (2014) Credits|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Production sound mixer]] [[Danny Michael]] had used [[Sound Devices]]' 788T-SSD digital recorder&lt;ref name="sounddevices.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound Devices 788T Captures Audio For Veteran Sound Mixer Danny Michael|url=http://www.sounddevices.com/news-events/news/sound-devices-788t-captures-dynamic-audio-for-veteran-sound-mixer-danny-michael|accessdate=May 21, 2014|newspaper=SoundDevices|date=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CL-WiFi&lt;ref name="sounddevices.com" /&gt; as sound devices, supplemented with a Lectrosonics VRT-Venue System, Lectrosonics radio mics, [[Schoeps]] CMC-6U and CMIT-5U microphones, a Cooper Sound 208 mixer, [[Blackmagic Design|Blackmagic]] dual seven-inch monitors and a Denecke Dcode GR-1 as the main time clock.&lt;ref name="sounddevices.com" /&gt; The action-oriented film required many sound effects and "file-based workflow".&lt;ref name="news.creativecow.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=Veteran Sound Mixer Danny Michael Captures Pristine Audio with Sound Devices 788T Digital Recorder|url=https://news.creativecow.net/story/875820|accessdate=May 21, 2014|newspaper=CreativeCOW|date=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|date=April 2018|What does file-based workflow mean?}}

For Michael, the 788T-SSD's ability to swap removable storage was an advantage, supplying [[CompactFlash]] (CF) to the post-production company Light Iron, in order for them to process the [[dailies|raw unedited footage]] on set.&lt;ref name="news.creativecow.net" /&gt; Michael stated he would hand-off his sound at every camera change to a person in arm's reach&lt;ref name="4rfv.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound Mixer Relies On Sound Devices' Digital Recorder For Audio Production|url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews/180953/sound_mixer_relies_on_sound_devices_digital_recorder_for_audio_production|accessdate=May 22, 2014|newspaper=4rfv|date=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who assembled it with the digital footage on the spot.&lt;ref name="4rfv.co.uk" /&gt;

=== Visual effects ===
Jake Braver was the overall visual-effects supervisor and visual-effects company Spin VFX worked on most of the visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinvfx.com/filmography/|title=Spin VFX – John Wick|publisher=Spin VFX|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
{{Main|John Wick: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}
The musical score to ''John Wick'' was composed by [[Tyler Bates]] and Joel J. Richard, with on-screen violin music performed by [[Scott Tixier]].&lt;ref name="John Wick' Soundtrack Announced"&gt;{{cite web|title='John Wick' Soundtrack Announced|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/09/23/john-wick-soundtrack-announced/|accessdate=September 23, 2014|newspaper=Film Music Reporter|date=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features a few pieces of additional music such as [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s "[[Killing Strangers]]" and T-Bo and Bengie B's "Get Money". The original soundtrack album, ''[[John Wick: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'', was released digitally on October&amp;nbsp;21, 2014 and received a physical format release on October&amp;nbsp;27 by [[Varese Sarabande Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Varese Sarabande Records To Release 'John Wick' Soundtrack|url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=104071|accessdate=October 7, 2014|newspaper=T4C|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Bates and Richard's score, the album features music by artists such as Ciscandra Nostalghia, The Candy Shop Boys, and M86 &amp; Susie Q. [[Le Castle Vania]] provided additional music for the score.&lt;ref name="John Wick' Soundtrack Announced" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyler Bates and Ciscandra Nostalghia|url=http://www.zimbio.com/photos/Tyler+Bates/Ciscandra+Nostalghia/John+Wick+Premieres+in+LA/4WKnLBIsnZo|accessdate=October 21, 2014|newspaper=Zimbio|date=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Director Chad Stahelski said influences on ''John Wick'' included ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'' (1967), ''[[Le Cercle Rouge]]'' (1970), and ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="ScreenRant"&gt;{{cite web|title='John Wick' Directors Talk World-Building &amp; Not Killing a Dog in the Sequel|url=http://screenrant.com/john-wick-directors-interview-sequel-ending-spoilers/|work=ScreenRant|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stahelski considered the untold backstory in ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' and wanted to leave John Wick's to the audience's imagination.&lt;ref name="Grantland" /&gt; He also said that they repeatedly watched ''Point Blank'' and made homages to it in ''John Wick''.&lt;ref name="Complex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/10/interview-john-wick-keanu-reeves/page/2|title=Keanu Reeves Came Up With a Badass Hashtag for "John Wick"|publisher=Complex|accessdate=October 24, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129090256/http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/10/interview-john-wick-keanu-reeves/page/2|archivedate=November 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Park Chan-wook]]'s ''[[The Vengeance Trilogy]]'' (2002–2005) and [[Lee Jeong-beom]]'s ''[[The Man from Nowhere (film)|The Man from Nowhere]]'' (2010) influenced the film due to their "minimalist composition and graphic nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chad Stahelski &amp; David Leitch, longtime stunt coordinators &amp; performers, founders of 87Eleven Action Design, and the filmmakers responsible for the new Keanu Reeves action-thriller 'JOHN WICK' ...

Screenwriter Derek Kolstad said that he was hugely influenced by [[Alistair MacLean]] for world-building and [[Stephen King]] for characterisation, noting that King surprised readers with what a protagonist could be driven to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An interview with Derek Kolstad, screenwriter of John Wick|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/10/interview-derek-kolstad-screenwriter-john-wick.html|work=Flickering Myth|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stahelski and Leitch also drew inspiration from the visual stylings of the 1960s and 1970s and works of [[Sergio Leone]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Lee Marvin]], [[William Friedkin]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]].&lt;ref name="Grantland" /&gt; Stahelski stated liking the Kurosawa and [[spaghetti western]] sensibility in the composition, and that [[noir film]] had less influence on them.&lt;ref name="ScreenRant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Complex" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='John Wick' Directors Talk World-Building &amp; Not Killing a Dog in the Sequel|url=http://pixmovies.co.uk/news/342-john-wick-directors-talk-worldbuilding-not-killing-a-dog-in-the-sequel|work=PixMovies|accessdate=October 25, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129033725/http://pixmovies.co.uk/news/342-john-wick-directors-talk-worldbuilding-not-killing-a-dog-in-the-sequel|archivedate=November 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''John Wick'' enjoyed a mostly positive reception upon release, attaining praise for the action sequences, direction, visual style, pacing and the performances of the cast, especially Keanu Reeves as John Wick.&lt;ref name="reception"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Keanu Reeves is on fire in 'John Wick,' reviews say|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-john-wick-keanu-reeves-movie-reviews-critics-20141023-story.html|accessdate=April 4, 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a score of 86% based on 202 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 7.2/10.

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' stated, "''John Wick'' is the kind of fired-up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of" and noted the "juicy performances" from Dafoe, Leguizamo, and McShane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keanu Reeves goes ballistic in this bloody bit of B-movie fun|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/john-wick-20141024#ixzz3H5Q8mIpu|accessdate=October 24, 2014|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote, "Action movies are about movement, and ''John Wick'' pursues that goal with remorseless verve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: In John Wick, Keanu Reeves is Back Up to Speed|url=http://time.com/3536452/keanu-reeves-john-wick-review/|accessdate=October 24, 2014|newspaper=[[TIME Magazine]]|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film an "B+" rating, stating, "An underworld fantasy that grafts crisp action on to [[Rian Johnson]]-esque world-building, producing one of the more fully realized shoot-'em-up flicks in recent memory." He continued by praising Kolstad's script which "distinguishes itself by carefully defining the boundaries of its universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keanu Reeves shoots his way through the entertaining action fantasy John Wick|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/keanu-reeves-shoots-his-way-through-entertaining-a-210627|accessdate=October 23, 2014|newspaper=[[The A.V.

Justin Lowe of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "After a marked absence from the genre, Reeves resoundingly returns with an effortless, kinetic style that positions the film extremely well for any potential follow-ups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='John Wick': Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/john-wick/review/742842|accessdate=October 22, 2014|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' spoke highly of the film, "Back in action-hero mode, Keanu Reeves joins forces with his ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|Matrix]]'' stunt double to deliver a slick and satisfying revenge thriller" and noted "what a thrill well-choreographed action can be when we're actually able to make out what's happening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review: 'John Wick'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-keanu-reeves-in-john-wick-1201331660/|accessdate=October 16, 2014|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said that, "Reeves is wonderful here, a marvel of physicality and stern determination – he moves with the grace of an old-school swashbuckler."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keanu Reeves Is Just Plain Awesome in John Wick|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2014-10-22/film/john-wick/|accessdate=October 22, 2014|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bilge Ebiri]] of ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'' commented, "It's a beautiful coffee-table action movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Wick Is a Violent, Violent, Violent Film, But Oh-So Beautiful|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/john-wick-movie-review.html|accessdate=October 23, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeannette Catsoulis wrote, in her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Harboring few ambitions beyond knock-your-socks-off action sequences, this crafty revenge thriller delivers with so much style – and even some wit – that the lack of substance takes longer than it should to become problematic." Catsoulis praised Dafoe and Leguizamo for "bringing real subtlety to an all-too-brief scene" and Nyqvist as "marvellous", as well as Stahelski's direction and Sela's cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pet's Slaughter Uncorks a Latent Inner Assassin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/movies/in-john-wick-keanu-reeves-as-an-avenger.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=October 23, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest Wickman of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' noted, "''John Wick'' offers a slow burn, sizzling in a manner true to its hero's surname."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Wick|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/10/keanu_reeves_action_movie_john_wick_reviewed.html|accessdate=February 11, 2015|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordan Hoffman]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' scored the film four out of five stars, writing, "A slick, propulsive and ridiculous crime picture that strides like an automatic machine gun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Wick review – a thrill ride driven by a relentless vengeance machine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/john-wick-review-thrill-ride-relentless-vengeance-machine|accessdate=October 23, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Peter Bradshaw]], also reviewing for ''The Guardian'', gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and stated "Reeves's semi-deliberate zonked deadpan style only really works in juxtaposition with funny dialogue – and this is a pretty humourless and violent film, which grinds on and on with more and more gleaming black SUVs getting trashed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pet's Slaughter Uncorks a Latent Inner Assassin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/09/john-wick-review-keanu-reeves-in-humourless-violent-generic-action-film|accessdate=October 23, 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ealasaid Haas of ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' described ''John Wick'' as a "disappointingly standard revenge movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/milpitas/ci_26830372/review-john-wick-is-disappointingly-standard-revenge-movie|title=Review: 'John Wick' is a disappointingly standard revenge movie|last=Haas|first=Ealasaid A.|date=October 30, 2014|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|accessdate=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Semley of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' called the title "the new name in crummy action cinema," giving it one-half out of 4 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/john-wick-the-new-name-in-crummy-action-cinema/article21273677/|title=John Wick: the new name in crummy action cinema|last=Semley|first=John|date=October 24, 2014|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|publisher=Phillip Crawley|accessdate=January 2, 2016|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3716">The '''Macerata Opera''' is the name given to the coordinating bodies of the provincial and local government in [[Macerata]], the provincial capital of the [[Marche]] region of Italy, which puts on performances of three or four operas each July and August under the name '''Macerata Opera Festival'''.  From 1992 the Opera Association was founded by the municipality and the Province Association of Macerata to oversee the operations of the Festival.  In addition to the main summer activities, the Association organizes many other musical events, ranging from the New Music Festival to the performances of baroque music in a number of historical sites and buildings. The Association also organizes international conferences.

==Overview==
[[File:Sferisterio by night 1.jpg|300px|thumb|right|''Sferisterio'' open-air theatre]]
While the Macerata Opera has organized the Macerata Opera Festival as a summer [[list of opera festivals|opera festival]], it actually began in 1921 with a performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' in the 3,000 seat (plus 6,000 standing places) [[Sferisterio|Arena Sferisterio]], a huge [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[arena]] erected in the 1820s as a [[stadium]] for a form of [[Team handball|handball]] called ''pallone al bracciale'', a sort of game with ball and bangle.  After a disastrous second year due to the performance of ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'' being rained out, (and except for a popular concert by [[Beniamino Gigli]] in 1929), the Festival did not begin again until 1967. The present layout of the arena allows for the seating of 3,500 to 4,500 people depending upon the specific sets.

By the late 1960s, the Festival was re-established, presenting mainly popular 19th and early 20th Century Italian opera, most of which were Macerata premieres.  Within ten years, the repertory was gradually broadened to include more modern and foreign works but, for financial reasons, the emphasis was on the bigger crowd-pleasers with as many big name international opera singers as possible. In addition, many [[Producer's opera|Regietheater]]-style productions were to be found such as film director [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' set in a brothel and a [[Franco Zeffirelli]] ''[[Carmen]]'' set in a motor cycle gang populated New York city.

With the decline in international singer participation as the 1990s progressed, the last decade has seen a return to popular Italian operas given spectacular productions.  

From 2003 to 2005, the [[soprano]] [[Katia Ricciarelli]] was Artistic Director. But 2006 saw changes at the Sferisterio with the artistic direction being taken over by Pier Luigi Pizzi and a summer festival concept created.  A common theme evolved in the selection of operas to be performed and, at the same time, the reconstruction of the stage was undertaken.  The 2006 season acknowledged the 250th anniversary of [[Mozart]]'s birth, with a production of ''[[Die Zauberflöte|The Magic Flute]]''. Performances were moved to 9pm to take to allow the audience to enjoy the sunset.  Seminars, discussions, and readings of literary works were added.

Venues include [[Teatro Lauro Rossi]].

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Matronalia''' (or '''Matronales Feriae''') was a [[Roman festivals|festival]] celebrating Juno [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], the goddess of childbirth ("[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] who brings children into the light"), and of motherhood (''mater'' is "mother" in [[Latin]]) and women in general. In the original [[Roman calendar]] traditionally thought to have been established by [[Romulus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perrin (translator)|first=Bernadotte|last2=Plutarch|title=Plutarch Lives I, Theseus and Romulus. Lycurgus and Numa. Solon and Publicola|date=1914|publisher=Loeb Classical Library|location=London|isbn=978-0674990524|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the first day of the year. As the first day of March (''Martius''), the month of [[Mars (god)|Mars]], it was also the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|Feriae]] Martis''.

The date of the festival was associated with the dedication of a temple to Juno Lucina on the [[Esquiline Hill]] circa 268 BCE, and possibly also a commemoration of the peace between the Romans and the [[Sabines]]. On the day, women would participate in rituals at the temple, although the details have not been preserved other than the observation that they wore their hair loose (when Roman decorum otherwise required them to wear it up), and were not allowed to wear belts or to knot their clothing in any place.

At home, women received gifts from their husbands and daughters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Alexander|title=Manual of Mythology|date=1874|location=London|page=49|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman husbands were expected to offer prayers for their wives. Women were also expected to prepare a meal for the household slaves (who were given the day off work), as Roman men did at the [[Saturnalia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3514">'''Music Mountain''' Summer Chamber Music Festival, located on Music Mountain Road in [[Falls Village, Connecticut]], is America's oldest continuing summer [[chamber music]] festival.  Founded in 1930, it is currently in its 89th season. 

==Mission==
Music Mountain's mission is to promote the teaching and performance of the [[string quartet]] literature.

==History==
Music Mountain was founded in 1930 by the violinist [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=2456 Jacques Gordon] as the permanent home for the Gordon String Quartet. Music Mountain's mission is the teaching and performance of the string quartet literature. It is known for regularly programming world-famed artists.  Music Mountain also offers a variety of teaching programs each season. Music Mountain's educational and artistic activities were overseen from 1975 until 2017 by Nicholas Gordon, son of founder Jacques Gordon.  In 2016, Oskar Espina-Ruiz, clarinetist, was named Artistic Director.  Board member Ann M. McKinney was elected Interim President upon Nick Gordon's death in October, 2017.

==Premises==
Music Mountain concerts take place in Gordon Hall, an acoustically perfect chamber music hall. Designed to be the analogue of the violin, the beaming in the ceiling replicates the bass bar and sound post of the violin, the French doors mimic the f holes in the belly of the fiddle.  The shape of Gordon Hall is similar to that of a violin, being long and narrow.  The chamber  itself is completely surrounded by air with hollow walls, a crawl space under the floor and above the ceiling.  There is nothing to impede the ability of the walls, floor and ceiling to vibrate when music is played on the stage.  Gordon Hall seats 335 people (400 with additional seating.)

In addition to Gordon Hall, Music Mountain has 4 houses, each named after an instrument in a string quartet.  The houses were prefabricated buildings ordered from [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] and built in 1930.  The property has been listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] for the impressive architecture of Gordon Hall, and for the relatively rare example of mail-order houses.&lt;ref name="NRHP"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=87001909}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Music Mountain |date=1987 |author=David F. Ransom |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=87001909|title=''Accompanying photos''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerts==
In the 2016 season, Music Mountain hosted 29 concerts, and additional community events. This included 13 concerts in the Twilight series - including Gilbert and Sullivan, Jazz, Big Band, Broadway, Country, and Folk. The remaining 16 concerts were part of Music Mountain's famous string quartet series, featuring groups such as The St. Petersburg Quartet, The Juilliard String Quartet, The Harlem String Quartet, The Shanghai String Quartet, and many more.  Concerts from prior seasons and the current season can be heard on the internet at www.musicmountain.org or by going to InstantEncore.com.

Kumaritashvili, who first began to participate in luge when he was 13, came from a family of seasoned lugers: his grandfather had introduced the sport to the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet republic of Georgia]], and both his father and uncle had competed when they were younger, with his uncle later serving as the head of the Georgian Luge Federation. Kumaritashvili himself began competing in the [[2008–09 Luge World Cup]]. He had also been a student at the [[Georgian Technical University]], where he earned an economics degree in 2009.

== Life and career ==

Kumaritashvili was born on 25 November 1988, in [[Borjomi]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]], present-day Georgia, to David and Dodo Kumaritashvili.&lt;ref name="Swift and Fatal"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/sports/olympics/a-swift-and-fatal-luge-plunge-and-then-an-abyss-of-sorrow.html?_r=0 |title = A Swift and Fatal Luge Plunge, and Then an Abyss of Sorrow |last = Borden |first = Sam |date = 1 February 2014 |work = The New York Times |accessdate = 20 February 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170805063408/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/sports/olympics/a-swift-and-fatal-luge-plunge-and-then-an-abyss-of-sorrow.html?_r=0 |archivedate = 5 August 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had one sister, Mariam, who was four years younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/02/18/olympic-photos-wednesday-february-18th-2010/aptopix-georgia-luger-dies/ |title = Olympic Photos: Wednesday February 18th, 2010 |last = Aivazov |first = Shakh |date = 18 February 2010 |publisher = Macleans.ca |accessdate = 1 January 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101101053353/http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/02/18/olympic-photos-wednesday-february-18th-2010/aptopix-georgia-luger-dies/ |archivedate = 1 November 2010 |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumaritashvili's family had a long association with luge. His grandfather Aleko Kumaritashvili introduced luge to Georgia after first training for it in [[East Germany]]. Aleko helped build a primitive luge run in [[Bakuriani]] in 1970; a more finished track, funded by the Soviet authorities, was built in 1973. Kumaritashvili's uncle and coach, Felix Kumaritashvili, served as the head of the Georgian Luge Federation, and his father, David, won a USSR Youth Championship when Georgia was part of the [[Soviet Union]], and was a three-time champion at the [[Spartakiad]], once in two-man bobsled and twice in luge.&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2010/03/28/georgian_hamlet_grieves_for_son_lost_at_olympics.html|title=Georgian hamlet grieves for son lost at Olympics|last=Potter|first=Mitch|date=28 March 2010|work=The Toronto Star|accessdate=20 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221005632/https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2010/03/28/georgian_hamlet_grieves_for_son_lost_at_olympics.html|archivedate=21 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.olympic.cn/news/sports_news/2010-02-21/1974594.html|title=Georgian town in deepmourning for Olympic luger Nodar Kumaritashvili|author=Liu Lihang|date=21 February 2010|publisher=en.Olympic.cn|accessdate=1 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310174201/http://en.olympic.cn/news/sports_news/2010-02-21/1974594.html|archivedate =10 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumaritashvili grew up in nearby Bakuriani, which is known for its many ski slopes.

During his first season of competition, Kumaritashvili finished 55th out of 62 competitors at the [[2008–09 Luge World Cup]], where he was entered in four races.&lt;ref name="FIL 9"&gt;{{citation|title=FIL Report|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished 28th out of 32 competitors at the [[2009–10 Luge World Cup]] event at [[Cesana Pariol]] in January, which was his fifth and last World Cup event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61B2I220100212 |title = Dead Georgian just wanted to live his dreams |last = Baldwin |first = Alan |date = 12 February 2010 |publisher = Reuters.com |accessdate = 1 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was ranked 44th out of 65 competitors in the 2009–10 World Cup season and was regarded as one of the best lugers to come from Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FIL Report|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 31 December 2009, the cut-off date for luge qualifications for the Olympics, Kumaritashvili was ranked 38th overall. He qualified for the [[Luge at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's singles|luge men's singles event]] at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], his Olympic debut, by racing in five World Cup races over two years.&lt;ref name="FIL 9"/&gt;

== Olympic luge track ==
The venue for the Olympic luge competition, the [[Whistler Sliding Centre]], was designed by [[Udo Gurgel]] and his firm, Ingenieurburo Gurgel (IBG) of Leipzig, with the final version produced on 23 October 2004.&lt;ref name=TelegraphMagnay20100220 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IBG + Partner |url=http://ibg-partner.com/ |access-date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the specified track dimensions for a variety of sled entrance and exit trajectories, IBG calculated the speeds and G forces along each curve of the track. The new curve configurations, rather than the speed, were expected to provide the main challenge. The maximum calculated speed for men's luge was {{convert|136.3|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Coroner's Report 8"&gt;{{citation |last=Pawlowski |first=Tom |title=Coroner's Report into the Death of Kumaritashvili Nodar of Bakuriani, Georgia |url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/coroners/publications/docs/coroners-report-kumaritashvili-nodar.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tacmFWAh?url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/coroners/publications/docs/coroners-report-kumaritashvili-nodar.pdf|page=8|archive-date=19 October 2010 |date=16 September 2010 |publisher=Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, British Columbia |access-date=1 January 2018 |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, concerns arose regarding the difficulties posed by Cesana Pariol, the track built for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in Turin, Italy. Several serious crashes occurred, prompting calls for physical modifications to that track. The [[International Luge Federation]] (FIL) was concerned that similar modifications might be required at the Whistler track and communicated these concerns to the [[Vancouver Organizing Committee]] (VANOC) in March 2005. Uncertainty about the track design persisted into 2006 until the scheduled start of track construction, when it was determined that construction would be based on the original design.&lt;ref name="Coroner's Report 8"/&gt;

After construction, during the track [[homologation]] (certification) process, the track produced speeds exceeding the design calculations by at least  {{convert|10|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Following the Olympic test event in February 2009, [[Josef Fendt]], president of FIL, sent a letter to IBG expressing surprise that a record speed of {{convert|153.937|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} had been reached, concluding that the designer's calculations were incorrect, and stating that the high speed "makes me worry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Branch |first = John |title = Tempting fate at the Winter Games |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/sports/olympics/11danger.html |work = The New York Times |date = 10 February 2010 |accessdate = 18 February 2010 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100218054654/http://www.nytimes.com//2010//02//11//sports//olympics//11danger.html |archivedate = 18 February 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The letter also said that "overstepping this limit would be an absolute unreasonable demand for the athletes." He asked IBG to respond, in particular with regard to the future Sochi Olympic track. Fendt also informed VANOC that the Whistler track was not supplied as ordered. VANOC, however, concluded that no action was required regarding the Whistler track, since the focus of Fendt's letter to IBG was the new Sochi track.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Coroner's Report|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, IBG explained that the differences between the calculated and actual observed speeds were caused by new sled technology that reduced [[drag coefficient]]s and ice [[friction coefficient]]s. Because of the secrecy inherent in sled development, the IBG engineers had difficulty obtaining the latest sled specifications required for their engineering calculations. In the view of the Games organizers, the high speeds and technical challenges could be safely mitigated by imposing additional practice and graduated training requirements on the athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Coroner's Report|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FIL stated that Kumaritashvili's death "was not caused by an unsafe track",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.startribune.com/sports/olympics/84312137.html |title = No longer a fast track |last = Russo |first = Michael |date = 14 February 2010 |work = Star Tribune |location = Minneapolis, Minnesota |accessdate = 6 January 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100219022658/http://www.startribune.com/sports/olympics/84312137.html |archivedate = 19 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as a preventive measure, the walls at the exit of curve{{nbsp}}16 were raised, and the ice profile was adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/fil-statement-on-mens-luge-competition_274462nE.html |title = Joint VANOC – FIL Statement on Men’s Luge Competition |publisher = vancouver2010.com |date = 12 February 2010 |accessdate = 13 February 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100213085549/http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/fil-statement-on-mens-luge-competition_274462nE.html |archivedate = 13 February 2010 |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Padding was also added to exposed metal beams near the finish line. Olympic officials claimed the changes were "not for safety reasons but to accommodate the emotional state of the lugers".&lt;ref name="NYTolympics" /&gt; In addition, the start of the men's luge was moved to the women's starting point, to reduce speed, while the start of the women's luge was also moved farther down the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/luge/news/story?id=4914998 |title = Luger was afraid of a turn, father says |date = 15 February 2010 |publisher = ESPN|accessdate = 15 September 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160130104002/http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/luge/news/story?id=4914998 |archivedate = 30 January 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training runs on the track resumed on 13 February, after the changes to the track were finished. Three lugers, including the departed Gureshidze, did not participate in any training runs on that day.&lt;ref name="NYTolympics" /&gt;

=== International Luge Federation report ===
On 19 April 2010, the FIL published its final report to the [[International Olympic Committee]] on Kumaritashvili's death.&lt;ref name="FIL news"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fil-luge.org/en/news/fil-publishes-accident-report |title = Secretary General Svein Romstad: "Unforeseeable fatal accident" |date = 19 April 2010 |publisher = FIL-luge.org |accessdate = 15 September 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170915114415/http://www.fil-luge.org/en/news/fil-publishes-accident-report |archivedate = 15 September 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that the sled used by Kumaritashvili had met all FIL standards. It attributed the accident to "driving errors starting in curve 15/16 which as an accumulation ended in the impact that resulted in him leaving the track and subsequently hitting a post.... This is a tragic result that should not have occurred as a result of an initial driving error".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FIL Report|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the sled hit the wall at the curve-16 exit, it catapulted off the track, causing Kumaritashvili to lose control of it entirely. This was a type of accident not seen before, and therefore "[w]ith the unknown and unpredictable dynamics of this crash, the calculation and construction of the walls in that section of the track did not serve to prevent the tragedy that happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FIL Report|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report also determined that during the homologation process and later sessions at the Whistler Sliding Centre, the track was faster than originally calculated. Instead of the expected {{convert|136|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest speed recorded was {{convert|153.98|km/h|abbr=on}}. The FIL felt that luge athletes were able to cope with this speed, but "this was not a direction the FIL would like to see the sport head [in]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FIL Report|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIL President Fendt wrote to the [[Sochi 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Organizing Committee|Sochi 2014 Olympic Organizing Committee]] that the FIL would homologize the proposed Sochi track only if speeds did not exceed {{convert|130|to|135|km/h|abbr=on}}. The FIL also said it was "determined" to do what it could to prevent such accidents from occurring again. It would re-examine changes to the sport, sled design, and track technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FIL Report|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIL Secretary General Svein Romstad summarized: "What happened to Nodar has been an unforeseeable fatal accident".&lt;ref name="FIL news" /&gt;

=== Coroner's report ===
[[File:NodarKumaritashvili-Memorial-Whistler-20100320.jpg|thumb|right|Kumaritashvili memorial, [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]], 2010]]
The British Columbia coroner's office investigated the incident. It was reported to be considering, among other pieces of evidence, written complaints about the safety of the Whistler track by Venezuelan luger [[Werner Hoeger]]{{snd}}who crashed on the track on 13 November 2009, suffering a severe [[concussion]]{{snd}}and information suggesting that the track was constructed in such a narrow and steep location, near the Whistler and [[Blackcomb Peak|Blackcomb]] mountains, for commercial reasons. The track designer, Udo Gurgel, said: "The track had to be near Whistler, for use after the Olympics. You don't want to ruin an investment so the track is on terrain that's a little steep." According to [[John Furlong (Canadian)|John Furlong]], the chief executive of the 2010 Winter Olympics organizing committee, proposals to build the sliding centre on [[Grouse Mountain]] near Vancouver were rejected early in the bid phase due to reservations expressed by the international luge, and the bobsled and skeleton, federations.&lt;ref name=TelegraphMagnay20100220&gt;{{cite news |author = Jacquelin Magnay |title = Officials accused on being forewarned of luge danger |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/7273518/Winter-Olympics-2010-officials-accused-of-being-forewarned-of-potential-luge-danger.html |newspaper = The Daily Telegraph (Sport) |location = London |date = 20 February 2010 |accessdate = 20 February 2010 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100222224039/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/7273518/Winter-Olympics-2010-officials-accused-of-being-forewarned-of-potential-luge-danger.html |archivedate = 22 February 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report dated 16 September 2010, the coroner ruled Kumaritashvili's death an accident brought on by an "interaction of factors", including the high speed of the track, its technical difficulty, and the athlete's relative unfamiliarity with the track.&lt;ref name="Coroner's Report 16"&gt;{{citation|title=Coroner's Report|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that during Kumaritashvili's training runs, it was reasonable to assume that "Mr.{{nbsp}}Kumaritashvili was sliding faster than ever before in his life, and was attempting to go even faster, while simultaneously struggling to learn the intricacies of the track and the dynamics it created".&lt;ref name="Coroner's Report 16"/&gt; The coroner accepted that luging would always carry an element of risk and that the best practices known at the time had been followed in the construction of the Whistler track. He also called upon the FIL to require athletes to engage in more mandatory training sessions prior to the Olympic Games and other major competitions.&lt;ref name="Coroner's Report 16"/&gt;

[[File:Stamps of Georgia, 2010-02.jpg|thumb|left|2010 Georgian postal stamp commemorating Kumaritashvili]]

The coroner also commented, "The organizers, regulatory bodies and venue owners must ensure that no effort is spared to anticipate the unforeseeable as far as safety is concerned," and to "err on the side of caution, insisting on more, rather than less."&lt;ref name="Coroner's Report 16"/&gt;

Responding to the report, Kumaritashvili's father said: "I don't accept the statement about Nodar's lack of experience. He wouldn't have won the right to take part in the Olympics if he lacked experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Katie |last = Thomas |title = Coroner calls for changes in luge training |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/sports/olympics/05luge.html |work = The New York Times |date = 4 October 2010 |accessdate = 4 October 2010 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130514100704/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/sports/olympics/05luge.html |archivedate = 14 May 2013 |df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mont Hubbard report ===
In 2013, Mont Hubbard, a [[University of California, Davis]], mechanical and aerospace professor, issued a report claiming that Kumaritashvili's crash was probably caused by a "fillet", a joint between the lower edge of the curve and a vertical wall.&lt;ref name="Hubbard 10"&gt;{{citation|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4901.pdf|last=Hubbard|first=Mont|title=Luge Track Safety|date=21 December 2012|publisher=arXiv.com|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard suggested that the right runner of Kumaritashvili's sled rose up the fillet, launching him into the air.&lt;ref name="Hubbard 10"/&gt; Terry Gudzowsky, the president of [[ISC/IBG Group]], a consortium involved in the construction of the Whistler track, dismissed Hubbard's theory as "flawed", stating that the data to replicate the ice surface at the site of the accident in three dimensions do not exist.&lt;ref name="Branch"&gt;{{cite news |last = Branch |first = John |title = On the Luge, Safety Built Into Swerves |work = The New York Times |date = 4 February 2014 |accessdate = 6 February 2014 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/sports/olympics/on-the-luge-safety-built-into-swerves.html?_r=0 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140309041603/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/sports/olympics/on-the-luge-safety-built-into-swerves.html?_r=0 |archivedate = 9 March 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sliding Center Sanki|luge track]] built for use at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], Russia, was designed with two uphill sections to reduce speeds, and for runs about {{Convert|10|mph}} slower than the Whistler track.&lt;ref name="Branch" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15029">'''Oak Park Festival Theatre (OPFT)''' is a professional theatre company in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], under contract with [[Actors' Equity Association]]. The company was founded in 1975 by Marion Kaczmar, an Oak Park resident and [[arts patron]], and performed Renaissance works, almost exclusively by [[William Shakespeare]], until 2004, when it broadened its scope to classics of other eras.  Its outdoor venue has been Austin Gardens, a wooded park near downtown Oak Park within walking distance from restaurants, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] landmarks, and [[Metra]] and [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] trains.  To attract a greater following, Renaissance, classical, and modern American works were added to the offerings, some being produced indoors in historic Farson-Mills Home and, in the 2010-11 season, in the studio space in the Madison Street Theatre.

Audience members in Austin Gardens often picnic before performances. Occasionally, special performances by the Oak Park Recorder Society or other pre-show events are presented. Special Family Day performances and child-centered special crafts, games, and activities are held at least twice a summer to encourage families to introduce their children to Shakespeare.

==History==

===Predecessor===
Oak Park had a Shakespeare theatre previous to OPFT.  In the 1960s, producers [[Josephine Forsberg]], Ed Udovic, and actor-director [[Lee Henry]] created Village Classics Theatre and produced ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', and other productions outdoors on the hill of Field Playground under the auspices of the Recreation Department of the Village of Oak Park. Actors who performed included Equity performers  [[Val Bettin]], [[Robert Kidd]], Tom Elrod, and Angel Casey, as well as Oak Park residents Clifford Osborne and Nick Cotsonas. The hill was, at that time, crowned on all sides with numerous large bushes and small trees, providing a natural set for battle scenes and forest liaisons. The professionalism of the productions brought, among others, esteemed ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' drama critic [[Richard Christiansen (critic)|Richard Christiansen]], a native Oak Parker, to the theater.

===Early Decades===
Oak Park Festival Theatre was begun in 1975 by Marion Kaczmar, an Oak Park resident.&lt;ref&gt;New Theatre in Town, Oak Park World, March 15, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first production was ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' with a cast that included [[David Mamet]] and [[William H. Macy]]. Its artistic directors since then have included Patrick O'Gara, Tom Mula, David Darlow, Dale Calandra, and Jack Hickey.

The 1980s were heady years for the theater.  With numerous Actors' Equity contracts attracting Chicago professional actors and the presence of talented non-Equity actors, audiences numbering in the 300s and 400s came to see Shakespeare under the stars.

===Later Decades===
The 1990s began some difficult years for OPFT. During this time the number of Chicago area theaters quadrupled and other theaters, inspired by Festival Theatre's success, began to produce Shakespeare on a regular basis.  The resulting decrease in  attendance compounded by some questionable management decisions and the elimination of arts funding from the Village of Oak Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-111233DC4EBFD160.html&lt;/ref&gt; necessitated a decrease in the number of Actors' Equity contracts that could be offered.

In 2002 Joyce Porter,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.me/joyceporter&lt;/ref&gt; an actress, director, Professor of Theatre at [[Moraine Valley Community College]], and member of the Board of Directors since 1989, averted a vote by the board to cease production and was, shortly after, elected President of the Board.

Porter envisioned broadening the focus of the theater to performing classics of all eras year-round indoors as well as outdoors.  The new artistic director, Jack Hickey, who had been appointed by the previous board president, worked with Porter to effect this expansion in phases.  They attracted new board members and began financial reforms that led to solvency within a few years.  Additional innovations under Porter’s leadership included educational programs, including a college intern program, the creation of a touring show, later revised and directed by Kevin Theis, and a summer workshop for teens.  The theater, in a very real sense, owes its continued existence to the dedication of Porter and Hickey.

In 2010, Kevin Theis and Belinda Bremner were elected co-presidents of the board and began the expanded four-production season with stable theatre finances.

===Productions/Actors===
For most of its history, OPFT produced almost exclusively works by [[William Shakespeare]].  These included multiple productions of ''The Taming of the Shrew'', ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', as well as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Loves Labour's Lost]]'', and others.  It also presented notable original adaptations of classics, including ''Falstaff'' by Tom Mula and ''Don Quixote'' by Dale Calandra.  In 2011 it presented the ''History of King Henry IV'', an adaptation by Stanton Davis of Shakespeare's ''Henry IV'' [[Henry IV, Part 1|parts 1]] [[Henry IV, Part 2|and 2]]. Featured Actors' Equity members have included Chicago actors [[David Mamet]], David Darlow,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flixster.com/actor/david-darlow&lt;/ref&gt; Kristine Thatcher, Kevin Theis, Don Brearley, William J. Norris, Greg Vinkler,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peninsulaplayers.com/players/GregVinkler.html&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Christiansen, Ned Mochel, Susan Hart, Ray Andrecheck, Lanny Lutz, George Wilson, Kevin Gudahl, Mary Michell, Barbara Zahora, [[Henry Godinez]], Steve Pickering, Kathey Logelin, Linda Kimborough, and others, as well as professional non-Equity actors such as Dennis Grimes, David Skvarla, Mark Richard,  [[Michael W. Halberstam]], [[Robert Petkoff]], Toni Graves, Krista Lally,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0482469/&lt;/ref&gt; Maggie Kettering, Anne Gottlieb, Peter Ash, and Christopher Prentice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christopher Prentice Bio|url=http://christopher-prentice.com/bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its expanded production schedule has included ''[[Faith Healer]]'', ''[[Picnic (play)|Picnic]]'', ''[[Tartuffe]]'', ''[[All My Sons]]'', ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', and other plays considered to be classics of many eras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oakparkfestival.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ossian Opera House''', also known as the '''Knights of Columbus Hall''', is a historic building located in [[Ossian, Iowa]], United States.  The opera house "movement" was active in [[Iowa]] from about 1870 to 1930.  Numerous auditoriums and halls were built in towns large and small.  Ossian is somewhat unusual for a small town in that its opera house was a single-use type of building, rather a mixed-use facility.&lt;ref name=Klingensmith&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=79000950}}|title=Steyer Opera House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-07-09|author=S.J.

It features a three-part [[facade]], with a central frontispiece that is flanked by side wings.  The hall could seat 350 people.  The local [[Knights of Columbus]] council, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[fraternal organization]], acquired the building in 1956, and renovated the building for their clubhouse.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

A '''pow wow''' (also '''powwow''' or '''pow-wow''') is a social gathering held by many different [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] communities. A modern pow wow is a specific type of event for Native American people to meet and dance, sing, socialize, and honor their cultures. Pow wows may be private or public. There is generally a dancing competition, with many different types of traditional dances, music and regalia, often with significant prize money awarded. Pow wows vary in length from a one-day event, to major pow wows called for a special occasion which can be up to one week long.

In popular culture, such as older [[Western movie]]s, the term has also been used to describe any gathering of Native Americans, or to refer to any type of meeting, such as among military personnel.  (Some consider this use as [[cultural appropriation|offensive]] and disrespectful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patricia |last=Sabine |url=http://www.hanscom.af.mil/News/Commentaries/Display/Article/382092/did-they-really-just-say-that/ |title=Commentary - Did they really just say that? |work=[[Hanscom Air Force Base]] |date=November 16, 2011 |accessdate= September 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== History ==
The word “pow wow” is derived from the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] word ''powwaw'', meaning "spiritual leader".&lt;ref name="New England Algonquian Language Revival "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bigorrin.org/waabu10.htm | title=Chapter 10: Spirit Names and Religious Vocabulary | accessdate=20 July 2014 | author=O'Brien, Frank Waabu | pages=entry # 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself has different variants including ''Powaw'', ''Pawaw'', ''Powah'' and ''Pawau''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ostler |first1=Rosemarie |title=Splendiferous Speech: How Early Americans Pioneered Their Own Brand of English |date=2018 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=9780912777078 |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=WwZKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14 |accessdate=13 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of different tribes claim to have held the “first” pow wow.&lt;ref name=Northern&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heartbeat of the People: Music and Dance of the Northern Pow-wow|last=Browner|first=Tara|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Urbana and Chicago|pages=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, public dances that most resemble what we now know as pow wows were most common in the [[Great Plains]] region of the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a time when the United States government fragmented many Native communities in the hopes of acquiring land for economic exploitation.&lt;ref name=Northern/&gt; In 1923, Charles Burke, Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the United States, passed legislation modeled on Circular 1665, which he published in 1921, that limited the times of the year in which Native Americans could practice traditional dance, which he deemed as directly threatening the Christian religion.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dancing People: Powwow Culture on the Southern Plains|last=Ellis|first=Clyde|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2003|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Native communities continued to gather together in secret to practice their cultures’ dance and music, in defiance of this, and other, legislation. By the mid-nineteenth century, pow wows were also being held in the Great Lakes region.&lt;ref name=Northern/&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:UIATF Pow Wow 2007 - 61A.jpg|thumb|left|Fancy dancer, [[Seattle, WA]] 2007]]
Planning for a pow wow generally begins months, perhaps even a year, in advance of the event by a group of people usually referred to as a pow wow committee. Pow wows may be sponsored by a tribal organization, by an American Native community within an urban area, a Native American Studies program or American Native club on a [[college]] or [[university]] campus, tribe, or any other organization that can provide startup funds, insurance, and volunteer workers.

===Committee===
A pow wow committee consists of a number of individuals who do all the planning prior to the event. If a pow wow has a sponsor, such as a tribe, [[college]], or organization, many or all members of the [[committee]] may come from that group. The committee is responsible to recruit and hire the head staff, publicize the pow wow, secure a location, and recruit vendors who pay for the right to set up and sell food or merchandise at the pow wow.

===Staff===
[[File:Northern Men's Fancy Dancer - West Valley.jpg|thumb|upright|A Northern plains style Men's Fancy Dancer, California, 2005]]
The head staff of a pow wow are the people who run the event on the day or days it actually occurs. They are generally hired by the pow wow committee several months in advance, as the quality of the head staff can affect attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Glazner, Roxanne Solis, and Geoff Weinman; ''Southern Native American Pow Wows''; [http://library.thinkquest.org/3081/arena.htm "The Arena and Staff"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006182819/http://library.thinkquest.org/3081/arena.htm |date=2011-10-06 }}; url accessed April 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; To be chosen as part of the head staff is an honor, showing respect for the person's skills or dedication.

====Arena director====
The arena director is the person in charge during the pow wow. Sometimes the arena director is referred to as the ''whip man'', sometimes the whip man is the arena director's assistant, and many pow wows don't have a whip man. The arena director makes sure dancers are dancing during the pow wow and that the drum groups know what type of song to sing. If there are contests the arena director is ultimately responsible for providing judges, though they often have another assistant who is the head judge. The arena director is also responsible for organizing any ceremonies that may be required during the pow wow, such as when an eagle feather is dropped, and others as required. One of the main duties of the arena director is to ensure that the dance arena is treated with the proper respect from visitors to the pow wow.
[[File:JingleDress3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Girls in jingle dress competition]]

====Master of ceremonies====
The [[master of ceremonies]], or MC, is the voice of the pow wow. It is his job to keep the singers, dancers, and public informed as to what is happening. The MC sets the schedule of events, and maintains the ''drum rotation'', or order of when each drum group gets to sing. The MC is also responsible for filling any dead air time that may occur during the pow wow, often with jokes. The MC often runs any raffles or other contests that may happen during the pow wow.

====Head dancers====
The head dancers consist of the Head Man Dancer and the Head Woman Dancer, and often Head Teen Dancers, Head Little Boy and Girl Dancers, Head Golden Age Dancers, and a Head Gourd Dancer if the pow wow has a [[Gourd Dance]]. The head dancers lead the other dancers in the ''grand entry'' or parade of dancers that opens a pow wow. In many cases, the head dancers are also responsible for leading the dancers during songs, and often dancers will not enter the arena unless the head dancers are already out dancing.

====Host drums and drum groups====
&lt;!--[[Pow wow drum]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
[[File:Mystic River Singers 1024.jpg|thumb|Drum group]]

Music for pow wow dance competition and other activities is provided by a "Drum," a group of performers who play a large, specially designed drum and sing traditional songs. The number of members of a drum group may vary, but is usually at least four people, and can be far more. Some members of the drum group may wear traditional regalia and dance as well as drum, other times drummers simply wear street clothing. Drums usually rotate the duty of providing songs for the dancers, each taking a turn at the direction of the pow-wow management.

The Host Drum of the pow wow is a drum group primarily responsible for providing music for the dancers to dance to. At an Intertribal pow wow, two or more drums are hired to be the host drums. In some places there is a Host Northern Drum and a Host Southern Drum. Depending on the size of the pow wow and the region where it is held, there may be many drums, representing nearly every tribe or community attending the pow wow. At some pow wows, the drums are judged on the quality of their performances, with prize money awarded to the winners.

Each drum has a Lead Singer who runs his or her drum and leads the singers while singing. Host drums are responsible for singing the songs at the beginning and end of a pow wow session, generally a starting song, the grand entry song, a flag song, and a veterans or victory song to start the pow-wow, and a flag song, retreat song and closing song to end the pow wow. Additionally, if a pow-wow has gourd dancing, the Southern Host Drum is often the drum that sings all the gourd songs, though another drum can perform them. The host drums are often called upon to sing special songs during the pow-wow.

Famous host drums &lt;!--in what region?--&gt;include [[Black Lodge Singers]], [[Cozad Singers]], &lt;!--hiding red links until notable enough to support an article [[Mandaree Singers]], [[Southern Thunder]], [[The Boyz]], [[Southern Boyz]],--&gt; and [[Yellowhammer]].

==The event==

===Setup===
[[File:GirlsShawl1.jpg|thumb|upright|Girls' shawl dance, Montana, 2007]]&lt;!--LOCATION: any or #Women's dances--&gt;
A pow wow is often set up as a series of large circles. The center circle is the ''dance arena'', outside of which is a larger circle consisting of the MC's table, drum groups, and sitting areas for dancers and their families. Beyond these two circles for participants is an area for spectators, while outside of all are designated areas with vendor's booths, where one can buy food (including [[frybread]] and Indian tacos), music, jewelry, souvenirs, arts and crafts, beadwork, leather, and regalia supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Becky Olvera Schultz (2001); ''Powwow Power''; "[http://www.powwow-power.com/powwowhistorypg2.html What is a powwow and a brief history]"; url accessed May 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

At outdoor pow wows, this circle is often covered by either a committee-built arbor or tent, or each group, particularly the MC and the drums, will provide their own. While most of the time, a tent provides shelter from the sun, rain can also plague outdoor events. It is particularly important to protect the drums used by the drum groups, as they are sensitive to temperature changes and, if it rains, they cannot get wet. Most vendors provide their own tents or shelters at an outdoor pow wow.

===Etiquette===
Pow wow etiquette is required; such as rules for when photography is or is not acceptable, protocol for the Grand Entry, and so on. A few guidelines are common; clothing worn by participants is known as "regalia" and not to be called a "costume." Some rules are for common sense courtesy: drums have special rules and should not be touched or played by those not a part of the drum group. People and their regalia should not be touched without permission. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powwow-power.com/powwowetiquette.html |title=Powwow-Power.Com's Powwow Etiquette |publisher=Powwow-power.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs are also a big part of pow wow etiquette. Depending on the reservation and ceremony, viewers should ask before taking photographs or recording videos or tapes. Some tribes, such as the Pascua Yaqui and Hopi, ban photos and sketches of ceremonies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Volante|first1=Enric|title=Respectful Ways go a Long Way on Arizona Indian Land|url=http://navajocentral.org/etiquitte.htm|website=Navajo Central|publisher=Navajo Central|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening===
[[File:GrandEntry1.jpg|thumb|The Eagle Staff leads the Grand Entry]]
A pow-wow session begins with the Grand Entry and, in most cases, a prayer. The Eagle Staff leads the Grand Entry, followed by flags, then the dancers, while one of the host drums sings an opening song. This event is sacred in nature; some pow wows do not allow filming or photography during this time, though others allow it.

If military veterans or active duty soldiers are present, they often carry the flags and eagle staffs. They are followed by the head dancers, then the remaining dancers usually enter the arena in a specific order: Men's Traditional, Men's Grass Dance, Men's Fancy, Women's Traditional, Women's Jingle, and Women's Fancy. Teens and small children then follow in the same order. Following the Grand Entry, the MC will invite a respected member of the community to give an invocation. The host drum that did not sing the Grand Entry song will then sing a Flag Song, followed by a Victory or Veterans' Song, during which the flags and staffs are posted at the MC's table.

===Dances===
[[File:BoyGrassDance.jpg|thumb|upright|A boy in Grass Dance regalia, [[Spokane, WA]], 2007]]
[[File:UIATF Pow Wow 2007 - 56A.jpg|thumb|upright|Men's Traditional regalia, [[Seattle, WA]]]]

Most of the various types of dances performed at a pow wow are descended from the dances of the Plains tribes of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Besides those for the opening and closing of a pow wow session, the most common is the ''intertribal'', where a Drum will sing a song and anyone who wants to can come and dance.  Similar dances are the ''round dance''; ''crow hop'' when performed by a northern drum or a ''horse stealing song'' by a southern drum; there is also "double beat", "sneakup" and, for Women's Traditional and Jingle, "sidestep". Each of these songs have a different step to be used during them, but are open for dancers of any style.

In addition to the open dances, contest dances for a particular style and age group are often held, with the top winners receiving a cash prize. To compete in a contest, the dancer must be in regalia appropriate for the competition. Larger pow wows have more specific categories. The dance categories vary somewhat by region, but general categories are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Glazner, et al.; [http://library.thinkquest.org/3081/styles.htm "Dance Styles"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425174757/http://library.thinkquest.org/3081/styles.htm |date=2006-04-25 }}; url accessed April 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Men's====
*[[Fancy Dance]] or Fancy Feather Dance (Northern and Southern styles): A dance featuring vivid regalia with dramatic movement, including spins and leaps. Often the biggest crowd-pleasing competition of a pow wow. Aside from bright color and non-traditional materials, fancy dancers are also distinguished by use of a two-bustle design on their regalia. There are two styles of the roach: In the North, it is the same as the grass dance roach, in the South, the roaches have rockers, two feathers on springs that rock back and forth.
*Northern Traditional (simply "Men's Traditional" in the North): A dance featuring traditional regalia, authentic design and materials, single or no bustle, and movements based on traditional dances.
*[[Straight dance]] (or Southern traditional): Straight dancers usually are more neat and with more homemade features such as chokers, breastplates, etc. Their dances are like Northern, They take one foot and step on the ball of their foot and then they tap it once on the ground. Then they tap it once again but this time they put their heel a few millimeters above the ground and repeat the process with the other foot. They do this in a walking motion. it is very hard especially if you have to follow the beat of fast drums. If they catch themselves off beat they will tap their foot three times instead of two to get back with the drums' rhythm.
*[[Grass dance|Grass Dance]]: A dance featuring regalia with long, flowing fringe and designs remniscent of grass blowing in the wind. Dance movements are more elaborate than the traditional dancers, but less flashy than the fancy dancers.
*Eastern War Dance: A dance from the East Coast that is a storytelling dance, Men wear no bustle however do carry a fan and dance stick. This is also called the "Eastern Strait Dance".
====Women's====
*Traditional (seen at Northern pow wows): A dance featuring traditional regalia of cloth or leather, featuring authentic design and materials, and dancers who perform, with precise, highly controlled movement.
*Buckskin and Cloth:&lt;!--better description needed--&gt; A traditional dance from the South. The name refers to the type of material of which the dress is made. The regalia is similar to the Northern traditional dance. However, in the South, buckskin and cloth dancers are judged in two separate categories. The dance steps are the same for both regalia categories.
[[Image:WomansTraditional2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Women's traditional dancer]]
*Fancy Shawl: A dance featuring women wearing brilliant colors, a long, usually fringed and decorated, shawl, performing rapid spins and elaborate dance steps.
*[[Jingle dress|Jingle Dress]] (healing dance):The jingle dress includes a skirt with hundreds of small tin cones that make noise as the dancer moves with light footwork danced close to ground.
Normal intertribal dancing is an individual activity, but there are also couples and group dances. Couples dances include the ''two step'' and ''owl dance''. In a two step each couple follows the lead of the head dancers, forming a line behind them, whereas in an owl dance each couple dances alone. Group dances include the ''Snake and Buffalo'' dance, where the group dances to mimic the motions of a snake in the beginning of the dance, then change to mimic the actions of a herd of buffalo.

At pow wows where there is a large Southern Plains community in the area, the ''Gourd Dance'' is often included before the start of the pow wow sessions. The gourd dance originated with the [[Kiowa]] tribe, whence it spread, and is a society dance for veterans and their families. Unlike other dances, the gourd dance is normally performed with the drum in the center of the dance arena, not on the side.

==Music==
[[File:Pow-Wow Maryland.jpg|thumb|upight| Aztec Dancer, [[Maryland]], 2007]]
'''Pow wow music''' is the [[American Indian music|Native American]] [[drums|drumming]], [[singing]], and [[dancing]] performed at pow wows. Though there are many [[genre (music)|genres]] unique to different [[tribe]]s pow wow [[music]] is characterized by pan or intertribalism with the [[Plains Indians|Plains cultures]], the originators of the modern pow wow, predominating. For information on dancing, see ''[[#Dances|Dances]]''.

===Drumming===
&lt;!--[[Drum group]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
: "Good drums get the dancers out there, good songs get them to dance well. Without drum groups there is no music. No music, no dance, no powwow."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Chris (1992). ''Powwow Country''. {{ISBN|1-56037-025-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be many drums at a pow wow, especially weekend or week long ones, but each pow wow features a ''host drum'' which is accorded great respect and the most authority. The members of drum groups are often family, extended family, or friends. Groups are then often named for families, geographic locations, tribal societies, or more colorful names. Many groups display their names on jackets, caps, vehicles, and chairs. Traditionally only men would drum and women would sit behind the men singing high harmonies. Beginning in the mid-1970s, women began drumming with men and ''seconding'', or singing, an octave higher, the song.&lt;ref&gt;*Roberts, Chris (1992). ''Powwow Country'', p.85-89. {{ISBN|1-56037-025-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are mixed-gender and all-female drum groups.

The supplies a drum group carries include the drum, rawhide headed, a cloth bag for padded drum sticks, the drum stand, folding chairs for sitting, and, in some cases, a public address system. The drum head, stand, microphone stands, and PA box are often decorated with paintings or eagle feathers, fur, flags, and strips of colored cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Chris (1992). ''Powwow Country'', p.86 and 89. {{ISBN|1-56037-025-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GirlDrummers.jpg|thumb|An all-woman Drum group]]

Readily noticeable in performances are the "hard beats" used to indicate sections of the song. The "traditional method" consists of a pronounced strike by all singers every other beat. These may appear in the first or second line of a song, the end of a section, before the repetition of a song. A cluster of three hard beats (on consecutive beats) may be used at the end of a series of hard beats, while a few beats in the first line of a song indicate performer enthusiasm. In the "Hot Five" method five beats are used, with the first hard beat four beats before the second, after which the beats alternate.&lt;ref&gt;Hatton, O. Thomas (1974). "Performance Practices of Northern Plains Pow-Wow Singing Groups", ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 10, pp. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Etiquette====
To understand drum protocol, a drum may be thought of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such. Drum etiquette is highly important. There are regional variations. The drum is the central symbol of Oklahoma pow wows and is located in the center of the dance floor and pow wow (which are themselves shaped in concentric circles). Southern drums are suspended by four posts, one for each direction. Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum in the best position. Drummer-singers are expected to remain at their drum and ready to sing at any moment's notice; a dancer might approach the drum and whistle, fan or gesture his staff over a drum to indicate his request for a song even if it is not that drum group's turn to sing. In some regions it is considered disrespectful to leave a drum completely unattended. Some drum groups do not allow females to sit down at their drum but welcome them to stand behind the drummers and sing backup harmonies; the reasons for this point vaguely to a variety of tribal stories that attempt to tell the history of drumming as each group understands it. The drum is offered gifts of tobacco during giveaways and musicians acknowledge this by standing.&lt;ref&gt;Hatton, O. Thomas (1974). "Performance Practices of Northern Plains Pow-Wow Singing Groups", p.85-86, ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 10, pp. 123-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singing===
[[File:HoopDance.jpg|left|thumb|[[Native American Hoop Dance|Hoop Dancers]] are featured at some Pow Wows. The hoop has no beginning or end; it represents the continuity of the spirits of all living things.]]

While the drum is central to pow wows, "the drum only helps them keep beat. Dancers key on the melody of the song. [[Rhythm]]s, tones, [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] all help create their '[[dance move|moves]]'." (p.&amp;nbsp;85) Note that Bill Runs Above did not mention the lyrics of the songs, and while they are no doubt important, most lyrics of most songs employ [[vocable]]s, syllable sounds such as "ya", "hey", and "loi" (p.&amp;nbsp;86).&lt;ref&gt;*Roberts, Chris (1992). ''Powwow Country'', p.85-86. {{ISBN|1-56037-025-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly evident in intertribal songs, such as the [[AIM Song]], which cannot be biased towards a certain [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]].
[[File:TraditionalBustle1.jpg|thumb|Detail of the single feather bustle of a men's traditional dance outfit]]

The [[song structure]] consists of four ''pushups'', singing the chorus and verse through four times. In each chorus the melody is introduced or ''led off'' by the lead singer whose is then ''seconded'' by another singer who begins to vary the melody before the end of the leader's first line. They are then joined by the entire chorus for the rest of the pushup. Three ''down strokes'' or ''hard beats''&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno (1989). ''Blackfoot Musical Thought: Comparative Perspectives''. Ohio: The Kent State University Press. {{ISBN|0-87338-370-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; mark the end of the chorus and beginning of the verse, and during these drummers will alter their dancing such as by hopping low like fancy dancers. An increase in tempo and volume on the last five beats marks the end of the final verse. The dancing stops on the final beat and then a ''tail'', or [[coda (music)|coda]], finishes the song with a shortened chorus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated86"&gt;*Roberts, Chris (1992). ''Powwow Country'', p.86. {{ISBN|1-56037-025-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a drum group will sing the song more than four times, particularly when the song feels good and the singers seize the moment for an extra pushup or two (or more), or when a dancer blows a whistle or passes his staff or fan over the drum to signal that the song is to be continued four extra pushups while he prays.

Singing differs by region in that a high [[falsetto]] is used in the north while in the south a lower range is used. "To the unfamiliar listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend," and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European musics may have much to do with that difficulty. However, "to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend" while dancers react to changes in the structure of the melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, "If you give me a stink song, I'll dance stink. If you give me good music, I'll give you a great show," implying that one can appreciate the music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone.&lt;ref name="autogenerated86"/&gt; But others say that today's contemporary contest dancers are expected to dance their best no matter how well or poor the drum group is that is singing for their contest. Generally, Native American singing follows a pentatonic scale (as if playing only the black keys on a piano) and while, to the outsider, it may sound like we're just pounding a drum and going "Heya-heya-heya-heya" sometimes there are actual words in Cree, Pikuni, Lushuutsid, Niimipuu, Lakhota, Sahpatin, Salish, Ojibwemowin or many other Native languages.

Talented singers also sing off-the-beat, placing the words between the drum beats rather than on them, which "is probably the non-Indian's greatest obstacle in trying to learn Indian songs."&lt;ref&gt;*Hatton, O. Thomas (1974). "Performance Practices of Northern Plains Pow-Wow Singing Groups", p.128, ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 10, pp. 123-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genres and change===
In the 1970s, drums had begun incorporating native words in addition to vocables. Groups such as the [[Black Lodge Singers]] have released songs with English words, such as on their children's albums. Given the intertribal style of pow wow music it may be viewed as less traditional or valuable though the music is also used to support tribal identity and display the value of a living culture.

[[File:Tumba de Napoleon Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|250px|Napoleon's tomb at [[Les Invalides]]]]
The '''''retour des cendres''''' ("return of the ashes"&lt;ref&gt;Though ashes is used here as meaning any mortal remains, rather than its strict meaning of cremated remains.&lt;/ref&gt;) was the return of the mortal remains of [[Napoleon I of France]] from the island of [[St Helena]] to [[France]] and their burial in the [[Hôtel des Invalides]] in [[Paris]] in 1840, on the initiative of [[Adolphe Thiers]] and King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]].

== Background ==
After defeat in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] in 1814, Napoleon abdicated as emperor of the French, and was exiled to the Mediterranean island of [[Elba]].  The following year he returned to France, took up the throne, and began the [[Hundred Days]].  The powers which had prevailed against him the previous year [[War of the Seventh Coalition|mobilized against him]], and defeated the French in the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. Napoleon returned to Paris and [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|abdicated]] on 22 June 1815.  Foiled in his attempt to sail to the United States, he gave himself up to the British, who [[Napoleon#Exile on Saint Helena|exiled him]] to the remote island of St Helena in the south Atlantic Ocean.  He died and was buried there in 1821.

==Previous attempts==
In a codicil to his will, written in exile at [[Longwood House]] on St Helena on 16 April 1821, Napoleon had expressed a wish to be buried "on the banks of the [[Seine]], in the midst of the French people [whom I] loved so much". On the Emperor's death, [[Henri Gratien Bertrand|Comte Bertrand]] unsuccessfully petitioned the British government to let Napoleon's wish be granted. He then petitioned the ministers of the newly restored [[Louis XVIII of France]], from whom he did not receive an absolute refusal, instead the explanation that the arrival of the remains in France would undoubtedly be the cause or pretext for political unrest that the government would be wise to prevent or avoid, but that his request would be granted as soon as the situation had calmed and it was safe enough to do so.

==Course==
===Political discussions===
====Initiation====
After the [[July Revolution]] a petition  demanding the remains' reburial in the base of the [[Place Vendôme|Colonne Vendôme]] (on the model of [[Trajan]]'s ashes, buried in the base of [[Trajan's Column|his column]] in Rome) was refused by the Chambre des Députés on 2 October 1830. However, ten years later, [[Adolphe Thiers]], the new Président du Conseil under [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] and a historian of the [[French Consulate]] and [[First French Empire]], dreamed of the return of the remains as a grand political ''coup de théâtre'' which would definitively achieve the rehabilitation of the Revolutionary and Imperial periods on which he was engaged in his ''Histoire de la Révolution française'' and ''Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;The 10-volume ''Histoire de la Révolution française'' was published in 1839;  the 20-volume ''Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire'' would appear in 1845-1862.&lt;/ref&gt; He also hoped to flatter the left's dreams of glory and restore the reputation of the [[July Monarchy]] (whose diplomatic relations with the rest of Europe were then under threat from its problems in Egypt, arising from its support for [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]).

It was, nonetheless, Louis-Philippe's policy to try to regain "all the glories of France", to which he had dedicated the [[Château de Versailles]], turning it into a museum of French history. Yet he was still reluctant and had to be convinced to support the project against his own doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Among the rest of the royal family, the Prince de Joinville did not want to be employed on a job suitable for a "carter" or an "undertaker"; Queen [[Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies|Marie-Amélie]] adjudged that such an operation would be "fodder for hot-heads"; and their daughter [[Marie-Louise of France|Louise]] saw it as "pure theatre": quoted by Antonetti, ''Louis-Philippe'', p. 816.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 1840 [[François Guizot]], then French ambassador in London, against his own will submitted an official request to the British government, which was immediately approved according to the promise made in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Though not without a sense of irony:  [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] wrote about it to his brother, "Here's a really French idea" (quoted by Antonetti, ''Louis-Philippe'', p. 816).&lt;/ref&gt;

====12 May====
On 12 May, during discussion of a bill on sugars, the [[French Interior Minister]] [[Charles de Rémusat]] mounted the rostrum at the Chambre des Députés and said:
{{quote box|quote=Gentlemen, the King has commanded His Royal Highness the Prince de Joinville [''at which point there was a hubbub of attention and curiosity''] to take a frigate to the island of Saint Helena [''new hubbub''] to receive the mortal remains of the Emperor Napoleon [''explosion of applause on all sides of the Assembly'']. We come to ask you for the means to receive them onto French soil in a dignified fashion and to raise a final resting place for Napoleon [''acclamations, applause'']. [...] The frigate charged with [bringing] the mortal remains is ready to return to the mouth of the Seine, another ship to bring them as far as Paris. They will be deposited at Les Invalides. A solemn ceremony, a major religious and military procession will inaugurate the tomb which must hold him forever. [...] He was Emperor and King, he was our country's legitimate sovereign. Thus he could be buried at [[Basilique Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], but Napoleon must not receive the ordinary burial of Kings. He must still reign and command in the fortress where soldiers of the fatherland will always rest, and where they will always be inspired by those who have been called to defend her. [...] Art shall elevate a worthy tomb under the dome, in the middle of the temple consecrated to the God of armies, if any tomb can be worthy of the name that will be engraved thereon. [...] We do not doubt, Gentlemen, that the Chambre shares with patriotic emotion the royal idea that we have now expressed before it. Henceforth France, and France alone, shall possess all that remains of Napoleon. His tomb, like his memory, shall belong to no one but his country. The monarchy of 1830 is, indeed, the sole and legitimate heir of all the sovereigns of which France can be proud. Without doubt, it belonged to this monarchy to first rally all the powers and reconcile all the vows of the [[French Revolution]], to fearlessly elevate and honour the statue and the tomb of a hero of the people, for there is one thing, and one only, which does not fear comparison with glory - and that is liberty! [''triple round of applause, acclamations from the left and centre, long hubbub''].&lt;ref&gt;Laumann, ''Le retour'', pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The minister then introduced a bill to authorise "funding of 1 million [francs] for translation of the Emperor Napoleon's mortal remains to the [[Hôtel des Invalides|Église des Invalides]] and for construction of his tomb". This announcement caused a sensation. A heated discussion began in the press, raising all sorts of objections as to the theory and to the practicalities. The town of [[Saint-Denis (Seine-Saint-Denis)|Saint-Denis]] petitioned on 17 May that he instead be buried at their basilica, the traditional burial place of French kings.

====25–26 May====
On 25 and 26 May the bill was discussed in the Chambre. It was proposed by [[Bertrand Clauzel]], an old soldier of the [[First French Empire]] who had been recalled by the [[July Monarchy]] and promoted to [[Marshal of France]]. In the commission's name he approved the choice of [[Les Invalides]] as the burial site, not without discussing the other suggested solutions (besides Saint-Denis, the [[Arc de Triomphe]], the [[Colonne Vendôme]], the [[Panthéon de Paris]] and even the [[Église de la Madeleine|Madeleine]] had been suggested to him). He proposed that the funding be raised to 2 million, that the ship bringing the remains back be escorted by a whole naval squadron and that Napoleon would be the last person to be buried in the Invalides. Speeches were made by the republican critic of the Empire [[Alexandre Glais-Bizoin|Glais-Bizoin]], who stated that "Bonapartist ideas are one of the open wounds of our time; they represent that which is most disastrous for the emancipation of peoples, the most contrary to the independence of the human spirit." The proposal was defended by [[Odilon Barrot]] (the future president of [[Napoleon III]]'s council in 1848), whilst the hottest opponent of it was [[Alphonse de Lamartine|Lamartine]], who found the measure dangerous. Lamartine stated before the debate that "Napoleon's ashes are not yet extinguished, and we're breathing in their sparks".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Antonetti, ''Louis-Philippe'', p. 817)&lt;/ref&gt; Before the sitting, Thiers tried to dissuade Lamartine from intervening but received the reply "No, Napoleon's imitators must be discouraged." Thiers replied "Oh! But who could think to imitate him today?", only to receive Lamartine's reply that then spread right round Paris - "I do beg your pardon, I meant to say Napoleon's parodists."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Antonetti, ''Louis-Philippe'', p. 817.&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate Lamartine stated:
{{quote box|quote=Although I am an admirer of this great man, I am not enthusiastic about him with neither recollection nor foresight. I do not prostrate myself before this memory; I am not a follower of this Napoleonic religion, of the cult of force that for a time some have wished to substitute in the Nation's spirit for the serious religion of liberty. I also do not think it will be good ceaselessly to deify war, to encourage these over-impetuous bubblings in the French blood, that make us appear impatient to wreck ourselves after a truce of 25 years - as if peace, which is the good fortune and glory of the world, could be the shame of nations. [...] Let us, who take liberty seriously, make our views known in a measured way. Let us not appeal to the opinion of a people who better understand what dazzles them than what serves them. Let us not wholly efface, or so much decrease, our monarchy of reason, our new, representative and peace-loving monarchy. It would end up disappearing from the people's eyes. [...] it is good, Gentlemen; I do not oppose this, I applaud it: but pay attention to these encouragements to genius at any price. I am doubtful for the future. I do not like these men who have liberty, legality and progress as their official doctrine, and as their symbol a sabre and despotism.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Laumann, ''Le retour'', pp. 32 and 34; and by Antonetti, ''Louis-Philippe'', p. 816.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In conclusion Lamartine invited France to show that "she [did not wish] to create out of this ash war, tyranny, legitimate monarchs, pretenders, or even imitators".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Antonetti, ''Louis-Philippe'', p. 817.&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing this peroration, which was implicitly directed against him, Thiers looked devastated on his bench. Even so, the Chambre was largely favourable and voted through the measures requested, although by 280 votes to 65 it did refuse to raise the funding from 1 to 2 million. The Napoleonic myth was already fully developed and only needed to be crowned. The July Monarchy's official poet [[Casimir Delavigne]] wrote:
:France, you have seen him again! Your cry of joy, O France,
:::Drowns out the noise of your cannon;
:Your people, a whole people reaching out from your riverbanks,
:::Holds out its arms to Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;"France, tu l’as revu ! ton cri de joie, ô France, / Couvre le bruit de ton canon ; / Ton peuple, un peuple entier qui sur tes bords s’élance, / Tend les bras à Napoléon." - Casimir Delavigne, « La Napoléonne », 1840 – in ''Œuvres complètes'', Paris, Didier, 1855, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;

====4–6 June====
On 4 or 6 June [[Henri Gratien Bertrand|General Bertrand]] was received by Louis-Philippe, who gave him the Emperor's arms, which were placed in the treasury. Bertrand stated on this occasion:
{{quote box|quote=It is to Your Majesty, to Your solemn and patriotic outlook, that we owe the fulfilment of the Emperor's last wishes, wishes that he particularly expressed to me on his deathbed in circumstances that can never fade from my memory.

Sire, paying homage to the memorable act of national justice which you have generously undertaken, animated by a sense of gratitude and confidence, I come to deposit in Your Majesty's hands these glorious arms, which for long I have been reduced to hiding from the light, and which I hope soon to place upon the coffin of the great Captain, on the illustrious tomb destined to hold the gaze of the Universe.

May the hero's sword become the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the fatherland.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Laumann, ''Le retour'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{-}}
Louis-Philippe replied, with studied formality:
{{quote box|quote=In the name of France, I receive the arms of the Emperor Napoleon, which his last wishes gave to you in precious trust; they shall be guarded faithfully until the moment when I can place them on the mausoleum that national munificence is preparing for him.

I count myself happy that it has been reserved for me to return to the soil of France the mortal remains of him who added so much glory to our pomp and to pay the debt of our common Fatherland by surrounding his coffin with all the honours due to him.

I am very touched by all the sentiments you have just expressed to me.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Laumann, ''Le retour'', pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{-}}

This ceremony angered [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] and [[Napoléon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], the latter writing in ''[[The Times]]'':
{{quote box|quote=The sword of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] must never be found in enemy hands; it must remain where it can be taken up in the day of danger for the glory of France. [...] To deprive the Emperor's heirs of the sole inheritance he has left them; to give the conqueror's arms to a beneficiary of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], is to betray the most sacred duties, to force the oppressed one day to say to their oppressors "Give us that which you have usurped".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by René Girard, ''Napoléon III'', Paris, Fayard, 1986; reiss. Paris, coll. Pluriel, 1993, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the arms ceremony Bertrand went to the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de ville]] and offered to the president of the Conseil Municipal the council chair that Napoleon had left to the capital - this is now in the [[Musée Carnavalet]].

===Arrival at St Helena===
[[File:PrinceDeJoinville.jpg|thumb|[[François d'Orléans, prince de Joinville]]]]
At 7pm on 7 July 1840 the frigate ''[[French ship Belle Poule (1828)|Belle Poule]]'' left [[Toulon]], escorted by the corvette ''Favorite''. The [[Prince de Joinville]], the king's third son and a career naval officer, was in command of the frigate and the expedition as a whole. Also on board the frigate were [[Philippe de Rohan-Chabot]], an attaché to the French ambassador to the United Kingdom and  commissioned by Thiers (wishing to gain reflected glory from any possible part of the expedition) to superintend the exhumation operations; generals [[Henri Gratien Bertrand|Bertrand]] and [[Gaspard Gourgaud|Gourgaud]]; Count Emmanuel de Las Cases (député for [[Finistère]] and son of [[Emmanuel de Las Cases]], the author of ''[[Le Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène]]''); and five people who had been domestic servants to Napoleon on Saint Helena (Saint-Denis - better known by the name Ali Le Mameluck -  Noverraz, Pierron, Archambault and Coursot). Captain Guyet was in command of the corvette, which transported [[Louis Joseph Marchand|Louis Marchand]], Napoleon's chief valet de chambre, who had been with him on Saint Helena. Others on the expedition included Abbé [[Félix Coquereau]] (fleet almoner); Charner (Joinville's lieutenant and second in command), Hernoux (Joinville's aide-de-camp), Lieutenant Touchard (Joinville's orderly), General Bertrand's young son Arthur, and ship's doctor Rémy Guillard. Once the bill had been passed, the frigate was adapted to receive Napoleon's coffin: a candlelit chapel was built in the steerage, draped in black velvet embroidered with the Napoleonic symbol of silver bees, with a [[catafalque]] at the centre guarded by four gilded wooden eagles.

The voyage lasted 93 days and, due to the youth of some of its crews, turned into a tourist trip, with the Prince dropping anchor at [[Cadiz]] for four days, [[Madeira]] for two days and [[Tenerife]] for four days, while 15 days of balls and festivities were held at [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. The two ships finally reached Saint Helena on 8 October and in the roadstead found the French brig ''Oreste'', commanded by Doret, who had been one of the ensigns who had come up with a daring plan at [[île d'Aix]] to get Napoleon away on a lugger after Waterloo and who would later become a [[Lieutenant Commander|capitaine de corvette]]. Doret had arrived at Saint Helena to pay his last respects to Napoleon but he also brought worrying news - the [[Oriental Crisis of 1840|Egyptian incident]], combined with Thiers' aggressive policy, were very close to causing a diplomatic rupture between France and the United Kingdom. Joinville knew that the ceremony would be respected but began to fear he would be intercepted by British ships on the return trip.

The mission disembarked the following day and went to Plantation House, where the island's governor, Major-General [[George Middlemore]] was waiting for them. After a long interview with Joinville (with the rest of the mission waiting impatiently in the lounge), Middlemore appeared before the rest of the mission and announced "Gentlemen, the Emperor's mortal remains will be handed over to you on Thursday 15 October". The mission then set off for Longwood, via the Valley of the Tomb (or Geranium Valley).&lt;ref&gt;Cp [http://www.napoleon-series.org/ins/weider/c_helena.html Ben Weider, "My Pilgrimage to St Helena"]. Retrieved 2011-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's tomb was in a solitary spot, covered by three slabs placed level with the soil. This very simple monument was surrounded by an iron grille, solidly fixed on a base and shaded by a [[Salix babylonica#Horticultural selections and related hybrids|weeping willow]], with another such tree lying dead by its side. All this was surrounded by a wooden fence and very close by was a spring whose fresh and clear water Napoleon had enjoyed. At the gate to the enclosure, Joinville dismounted, bared his head and approached the iron grille, followed by the rest of the mission. In a deep silence they contemplated the severe and bare tomb. After half an hour Joinville remounted and the expedition continued on its way. Lady Torbet, owner of the land where the tomb was sited, had set up a booth to sell refreshments for the few pilgrims to the tomb and was unhappy about the exhumation since it would eliminate her already small profits from it. They then went in pilgrimage to Longwood, which was in a very ruinous state - the furniture had disappeared, many walls were covered with graffiti, Napoleon's bedroom had become a stable where a farmer pastured his beasts and got a little extra income by guiding visitors around it. The sailors from ''Oreste'' grabbed the billiard table, which had been spared by the goats and sheep, and carried off the tapestry and anything else they could carry, all the while being loudly shouted at by the farmer with demands for compensation.

=== Exhumation ===
{{story|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Napoleon's casket opened in 1840.jpg|thumb|Opening of Napoleon's casket, Valley of the Tomb, 14 October 1840.]]
The party returned to the Valley of the Tomb at midnight on 14 October, though Joinville remained on board ship since all the operations up until the coffin's arrival at the embarkation point would be carried out by British soldiers rather than French sailors, and so he felt he could not be present at work that he could not direct. The French section of the party was led by the Count of Rohan-Chabot and included generals Bertrand and Gourgaud, Emmanuel de Las Cases, the Emperor's old servants, Abbé Coquereau, two choirboys, captains Guyet, Charner and Doret, doctor Guillard (chief surgeon of the ''Belle-Poule'') and a lead-worker, Monsieur Leroux. The British section was made up of William Wilde, Colonel Hodson and Mr Scale (members of the island's colonial council), Mr Thomas, Mr Brooke, Colonel Trelawney (the island's artillery commander), naval lieutenant Littlehales, Captain Alexander (representing Governor Middlemore, who was indisposed, although he eventually arrived accompanied by his son and an aide) and Mr Darling (interior decorator at Longwood during Napoleon's captivity).

By the light of torches, the British soldiers set to work.  They removed the grille, then the stones that formed a border to the tomb. The topsoil had already been removed and the French shared among themselves the flowers that had been growing in it. The soldiers then pulled up the three slabs that were closing the pit over. Long efforts were needed to break through the masonry enclosing the coffin. At 9.30 the last slab was raised and the coffin could be seen.  Coquereau took some water from the nearby spring, blessed it and sprinkled it over the coffin, before reciting the psalm ''[[Psalm 130|De profundis]]''. The coffin was raised and transported into a large blue and white striped tent that had been put up the previous day. Then they proceeded to open the bier, in complete silence. The first coffin, of mahogany, had to be sawn off at both ends to get out the second coffin, made of lead, which was then placed within the neo-classical, ebony coffin that had been brought for it from France. General Middlemore and Lieutenant Touchard then arrived and presented themselves, before the party proceeded to unsolder the lead coffin. The coffin inside this, again of mahogany, was remarkably well-preserved. Its screws were removed with difficulty. It was then possible to open, with infinite care, the final coffin, made of tin.

When the lid of this coffin was removed, "a white form appeared - of uncertain shape". The white satin padding from the coffin lid had become detached and was covering the body like a shroud. Doctor Guillard delicately rolled it back, from the feet to the head, to reveal the body. Napoleon's green uniform with red facings, that of a colonel of chasseurs, was perfectly preserved. The chest was still crossed by the red ribbon of the [[Légion d’honneur]], although the decorations and buttons on the uniform were slightly tarnished. The body remained in a comfortable position, the head resting on a cushion and the left forearm and hand on the thigh. The facial expression was serene, the eyes were fully closed (with some eyelashes showing) and only the sides of the nose had changed. A slightly receding gum allowed to shine, as at the moment of death, three very white incisors. The chin was stippled with the beginnings of a blueish beard which had emerged due to the dryness of the skin. The hands were perfectly preserved, with long and very white fingernails still attached. Only the seams of the boots had cracked, showing the four smaller toes on each foot. Napoleon's small hat was placed sideways across his thighs.
[[File:Château de la Baume (15).jpg|thumb|Exhumation of the body of Napoleon]]
All the spectators were in a state of shock. Gourgaud, Las Cases, Philippe de Rohan, Marchand and all the servants wept; Bertrand seemed to be overcome with emotion. After two minutes' examination, Guillard proposed that he continue examining the body and open the jars containing the heart and the stomach. Gourgaud, however, suppressing his tears, became angry and ordered that the coffin be closed at once. The doctor complied and replaced the satin padding, spraying it with a little creosote before putting back on the tin lid (though without re-soldering it) and the mahogany lid. Then the lead coffin was re-soldered and finally the combination lock on the ebony coffin that had been brought from France was closed.

This ebony coffin, made in Paris, was 2.56m long, 1.05m wide and 0.7m deep. Its design imitated classical Roman coffins. The lid bore the sole inscription "Napoléon" in gold letters.  Each of the four sides was decorated with the letter N in gilded bronze and there were six strong bronze rings for handles. On the coffin were also inscribed the words "Napoléon Empereur mort à Sainte-Hélène le 05 Mai 1821 (Napoleon, Emperor, died at St Helena on 05 May 1821)".

The ebony coffin and its contents were then placed in a sixth coffin, made of oak and designed to protect that of ebony.  Then this mass, totalling 1,200 kilos, was hoisted by 43 gunners onto a solid hearse, draped in black with four plumes of black feathers at each corner and drawn with great difficulty by four horses caparisoned in black. The coffin was covered with a large (4.3m by 2.8m) black pall made of single piece of velvet sown with  golden bees and bearing eagles surmounted by imperial crowns at its corners as well as a large silver cross. The ladies of Saint Helena offered to the French commissioner the tricolour flags that would be used in the ceremony and which they had made with their own hands, and the imperial flag that would be flown by ''Belle Poule''.

[[File:Le transfert des cendres de Napoléon à bord de La Belle Poule, le 15 octobre 1840, Eugène Isabey.jpg|thumb|''Loading the remains of Napoleon onto ''Belle Poule'', 15 October 1840''. Painting by [[Eugène Isabey]].]]
At 3.30, in driving rain, with the citadel and ''Belle Poule'' firing alternate gun salutes, the cortège slowly moved along under the command of Middlemore. Count Bertrand, Baron Gourgaud, Baron Las Cases the younger and Marchand walked holding the corners of the pall. A detachment of militia brought up the rear, followed by a crowd of people, while the forts fired their cannon on every minute. Reaching Jamestown, the procession marched between two ranks of garrison soldiers with arms reversed. The French ships lowered their launches, with that of ''Belle Poule'', ornamented with gilded eagles, carrying Joinville.

At 5.30 the funeral procession stopped at the end of the jetty. Middlemore, old and ill, walked painfully over to Joinville. Their brief conversation, more or less in French, marked the point at which the remains were officially handed over to France. With infinite caution, the heavy coffin was placed in the launch. The French ships (up until then showing signs of mourning) hoisted their colours and all the ships present fired their guns. On ''Belle Poule'' 60 men were paraded, drums beat a salute and funeral airs were played.

The coffin was hoisted onto the deck and its oak envelope was taken off. Coquereau gave absolution and Napoleon had returned to French territory. At 6.30 the coffin was placed in a candlelit chapel, ornamented with military trophies, on the stern of the ship. At 10 the following day mass was said on deck, then the coffin was lowered into the candlelit chapel in the steerage, while the frigate's band played.&lt;ref&gt;It is claimed, although by dubious sources, that the music played was the principal air from [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer's]] then popular opera ''[[Robert le diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]''. In that famous solo, in the cemetery of a ruined convent the Devil invokes the souls of nuns who had broken their vow of chastity while alive: "Nuns who rest / 'Neath this cold stone / Awake. / For one hour leave / Your funeral bed / And arise! (etc)" (''"Nonnes qui reposez / Sous cette froide pierre / Réveillez-vous, / Pour une heure quittez, / Votre lit funéraire / Et levez-vous ! etc."'').&lt;/ref&gt; Once this had been done, each officer received a commemorative medal.&lt;ref&gt;The medal bore on its obverse a profile of Louis-Philippe and on the reverse the inscription "Loi du 18 juin 1840 ordonnant la translation des restes mortels de l’empereur Napoléon, de l’île de Sainte-Hélène, à l’église de l’hôtel royal des Invalides de Paris, et la construction de son tombeau aux frais de l’État. S.A.R. le prince de Joinville, commandant l’expédition" (''Law of 18 June 1840 prescribing the translation of the mortal remains of emperor Napoleon from the Island of Saint Helena to the church of the Hôtel Royal des Invalides de Paris, and the construction of his tomb at State expense. H.R.H. the Prince de Joinville, commander of the expedition.»&lt;/ref&gt; The sailors divided up among themselves the oak coffin and the dead willow that had been taken away from the Valley of the Tomb.

=== Return from St Helena ===
[[File:Château de la Baume (14).jpg|thumb|Religious ceremony on the frigate Belle Poule]]
At 8am on Sunday 18 October ''Belle Poule'', [[French corvette Favorite (1829)|''Favorite'']] and [[French brig Oreste (1833)|''Oreste'']] set sail. ''Oreste'' rejoined the Levant division, whilst the two other ships sailed towards France at full speed, fearful of being attacked. No notable setback occurred to ''Belle Poule'' and ''Favorite'' during the first 13 days of this voyage, though on 31 October they met the merchantman ''Hambourg'', whose captain gave Joinville news of Europe, confirming the news he had received from Doret. The threat of war was confirmed by the Dutch ship ''Egmont'', en route for [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. Joinville was sufficiently worried to summon the officers of both his ships to a council of war, to plan precautions to keep the remains out of harm's way should they meet British warships. He had ''Belle Poule'' prepared for possible battle. So that all the ship's guns could be mounted, the temporary cabins set up to house the commission to Saint Helena were demolished and the dividers between them, as well as their furniture, were thrown into the sea - earning the area the nickname "''Lacédémone''".&lt;ref&gt;"Lacedemonia", the ancient name of Sparta.&lt;/ref&gt; The crew were frequently drilled and called to action stations. Most importantly, he ordered ''Favorite'' to sail away immediately and make for the nearest French port. Joinville was aware that no British warship would attack the ship carrying the body, but also that they would be unlikely to extend the same generosity to ''Favorite''. He doubted, with good reason, that he would be able to save the corvette if she got within range of an enemy ship, without risking his frigate and its precious cargo. Another hypothesis is that ''Favorite'' was the slower ship and would only have held ''Belle Poule'' back if they had been attacked.

On 27 November ''Belle-Poule'' was only 100 leagues from the coasts of France, without having encountered any British patrol. Nonetheless, her commander and crew continued with their precautions - even though these were now unnecessary, because Anglo-French tension had ceased, after France had had to abandon its Egyptian ally and Thiers had been forced to resign.

=== Arrival in France ===

[[File:Retour des Cendres - 4.jpg|thumb|"Arrival of ''Dorade'' at Courbevoie on 14 December 1840." Painting by [[Henri Félix Emmanuel Philippoteaux|Félix Philippoteaux]], 1867. Château de Malmaison.]]
In the meantime, in October 1840, a new ministry nominally presided over by Marshal [[Nicolas Soult]] but in reality headed by [[François Guizot]] succeeded Thiers's cabinet in an attempt to resolve the crisis Thiers had provoked with the United Kingdom over the Middle East. This new arrangement gave rise to fresh hostile comment in the press as to the "''retour des cendres''":
{{quote box|quote=He [Guizot] who will receive the Emperor's remains is a man of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]], one of the salon conspirators who allied themselves to shake the king's hand at Ghent, behind the British lines, while our old soldiers were laying down their lives to defend our territory, on the plains of Waterloo. The ministers who will lead the cortège have been imposed on us by foreigners. The mourning will be led by the major-general of the French army at Waterloo [Soult], who was brought to power with the aid of [[Lord Palmerston]] and who shook the hand of the renegade of Ghent.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Courrier français (1820–1851)|Le Courrier Français]]'', 11 December 1840; quoted by Laumann, ''Le retour'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Fearful of being overthrown thanks to the "''retour''" initiative (the future Napoleon III had just attempted a coup d'État) yet unable to abandon it, the government decided to rush it to a conclusion - as [[Victor Hugo]] commented, "It was pressed into finishing it."&lt;ref&gt;Victor Hugo, « 15 décembre 1840. Funérailles de l’Empereur. Notes prises sur place », ''Choses vues'' – in ''Œuvres complètes, Histoire'', Paris, Robert Laffont, coll. Bouquins, 1987, p. 813. Hereafter: Hugo, "Funérailles".&lt;/ref&gt; The interior minister, [[Tanneguy Duchâtel|Comte Duchâtel]], affirmed that "Whether the preparations are ready or not, the funeral ceremony will take place on 15 December, whatever weather should happen or arise."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Laumann, ''Le retour'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone in Paris and its suburbs were conscripted to get the preparations done as quickly as possible, with the coffin's return voyage being faster than expected and internal political problems having caused considerable delays. From the Pont de Neuilly to Les Invalides, papier-mâché structures were set up which would line the funeral procession, though these were slapped together only late on the night before the ceremony.

The funeral carriage itself, resplendently gilded and richly draped, was 10m high, 5.8m wide, 13m long, weighed 13 tonnes and was drawn by four groups of four richly caparisoned horses. It had four massive gilded wheels, on whose axles rested a thick tabular base. This supported a second base, rounded at the front and forming a semi-circular platform on which were set a group of [[Genius (mythology)|genii]] supporting [[Charlemagne]]'s crown. At the back of this rose a dais, like an ordinary pedestal, on which stood a smaller pedestal in the shape of a quadrangle. Finally: 14 statues, larger than life and gilded all over, held up a vast shield on their heads, above which was placed a model of Napoleon's coffin; this whole ensemble was veiled in a long purple [[crêpe]], sown with gold bees. The back of the car was made up of a trophy of flags, palms and laurels, with the names of Napoleon's main victories.

To avoid any revolutionary outbreak, the government (which had already insisted on the remains being buried with full military honours in Les Invalides) ordered that the ceremony would be strictly military, dismissing the civil cortège and thus infuriating the law and medical students who were to have formed it.&lt;ref&gt;The students protested in ''[[Le National (Paris)|Le National]]'':
"Children of the new generations, [the law and medical students] do not understand the exclusive cult that gives in to force of arms, in the absence of the civil institutions that are the foundation of liberty. [The students] do not prostrate themselves before the spirit of invasion and conquest, but, at the moment when our nationality seems to be demeaned, the schools had wished to pay homage by their presence to the man who was from the outset the energetic and glorious representative of this nationality." Quoted by Laumann, ''Le retour'', pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;
The diplomatic corps gathered at the British embassy in Paris and decided to abstain from participating in the ceremony due to their antipathy to Napoleon as well as to Louis-Philippe.

On 30 November ''Belle-Poule'' entered the roadstead of [[Cherbourg]], and six days later the remains were transferred to the steamer [[French ship Normandie (1835)|''la Normandie'']]. Reaching [[Le Havre]], and then on to [[Val-de-la-Haye]], near [[Rouen]], where the coffin was transferred to ''la Dorade 3'' for carrying further up the Seine, on whose banks people had gathered to pay homage to Napoleon. On 14 December ''la Dorade 3'' moored at [[Courbevoie]] in the northwest of Paris.

=== Reburial ===
[[File:Retour des Cendres - 1.jpg|thumb|''Napoleon's funeral carriage passes under the [[Arc de Triomphe]].'' 19th-century French school. Château de Versailles.]]
The date for the reburial was set for 15 December. Victor Hugo evoked this day in his ''Les Rayons et les Ombres'':
:"'''O frozen sky! and sunlight pure! shining bright in history!'''
:''Funereal triumph, imperial torch!''
:Let the people's memory hold you forever,
:::Day beautiful as glory,
:::Cold as the tomb&lt;ref&gt;"Ciel glacé ! soleil pur ! Oh ! brille dans l’histoire ! / Du funèbre triomphe, impérial flambeau ! / Que le peuple à jamais te garde en sa mémoire / Jour beau comme la gloire, / Froid comme le tombeau." - Victor Hugo, ''Les Rayons et les Ombres'', 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the temperature never rising above 10 degrees Celsius, the crowd of spectators stretching from the [[Pont de Neuilly]] to the [[Hôtel des Invalides|Invalides]] was huge. Some houses' rooftops were covered with people. Respect and curiosity won out over irritation, and the biting cold cooled all restlessness in the crowd. Under pale sunlight after snow, the plaster statues and gilded-card ornaments produced an ambiguous effect upon Hugo: "the niggardly clothing the grandiose".&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, "Funérailles", p. 806.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo also wrote:
{{quote box|align=left|width=75%|quote=''Suddenly, cannon fire all at once from three different points on the horizon. This triple noise simultaneously encloses the ear in a tremendous and superb kind of triangle. Distant drums are beating in the fields. The emperor's carriage appears.''

Veiled until then, at the same time the sun reappears. The effect is extraordinary.

In the distance could be seen slowly moving, amid steam and sunlight, upon the grey and red background of the trees of the Champs-Élysées, past tall white statues that resembled phantoms, a sort of golden mountain. One could not yet make out anything but a kind of shimmering light that made the whole surface of the carriage glitter sometimes with stars, sometimes with lightning. A vast murmur enveloped this apparition.

This carriage, one might say, draws after it the whole city's acclamation as a torch draws after it its smoke. [...]

The cortège continues its progress. The carriage advances slowly. We begin to be able to distinguish its shape. [...]

The whole possesses a grandeur. It is an enormous mass, gilded all over, whose stages rise in a pyramid atop the four huge gilded wheels that bear it. [...] The actual coffin is invisible. It has been placed in the base of the carriage, which diminishes the emotion. This is the carriage's grave defect. It hides what one wants to see: that which France has reclaimed, what the people are awaiting, what all eyes were looking for - the coffin of Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, "Funérailles", pp. 808-809.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Retour des Cendres - 3.jpg|thumb|''Napoleon's funeral carriage passes along the [[Champs-Élysées]].'' Engraving by Louis-Julien Jacottet after a drawing by Louis Marchand.]]{{-}}
The cortège arrived at the [[Hôtel des Invalides|Invalides]] around 1:30, and at 2 pm it reached the gate of honour. The king and all France's leading statesmen were waiting in the royal chapel, the Église du Dôme. Joinville was to make a short speech, but nobody had remembered to forewarn him - he contented himself with a sabre salute and the king mumbled a few unintelligible words.&lt;ref&gt;Prince de Joinville, ''Vieux Souvenirs'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Le Moniteur Universel|Le Moniteur]]'' described the scene as best it could:

{{quote box|align=left|quote="Sire", said the Prince de Joinville, lowering his sword to the ground, "I present to you the body of the Emperor Napoleon."
"I receive it in the name of France", the king replied in a strong voice.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Moniteur'', 16 décembre 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Retour des Cendres - 2.jpg|thumb|''Napoleon's funeral carriage crosses the [[Place de la Concorde]].'' Painting by Jacques Guiaud. Château de Versailles.]]{{-}}
[[Louis Marie Baptiste Atthalin|General Atthalin]] stepped forward, bearing on a cushion the sword that Napoleon had worn at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]], which he presented to Louis-Philippe. The king made a strange, recoiling movement, then turned to [[Henri Gratien Bertrand|Bertrand]] and said: "General, I charge you with placing the Emperor's glorious sword upon his coffin." Overcome with emotion, Bertrand was unable to complete this task, and Gourgaud rushed over and seized the weapon. The king turned to Gourgaud and said: "General Gourgaud, place the Emperor's sword&lt;!---Fr Wikipedia says "chapeau", which seems to be an error or perhaps two stages in the ceremony are being confused here---&gt; upon the coffin."

In the course of the funeral ceremony, the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Paris Opera]]'s finest singers were conducted by [[François-Antoine Habeneck|Habeneck]] in a performance of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]''. The ceremony was more worldly than reverent - the deputies were particularly uncomfortable:
{{quote box|align=left|width=75%|quote=Upper-school boys would be thrashed if they behaved in a solemn place dressed and acting like these gentlemen. [...] This has meant that the Emperor has been received in three different ways. He has been received piously, in the Champs-Élysées by the people; coldly, from the platforms on the Esplanade [des Invalides] by the middle classes; and insolently, under the dome of the Invalides by the deputies.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, "Funérailles", pp. 812 and 813.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Retour des Cendres - 6.jpg|thumb|''Napoleon's funeral carriage heads towards les Invalides.'' Print after Adolphe Jean-Baptiste Bayot and Eugène Charles François Guérard. Paris, [[Musée de l'Armée]].]]{{-}}
The bearing of the old [[Bon Adrien Jeannot de Moncey|Marshal Moncey]], the governor of the Invalides, somewhat redeemed the impertinence of the court and the politicians. For a fortnight he had been in agony, pressing his doctor to keep him alive at least to complete his role in the ceremony. At the end of the religious ceremony he managed to walk to the catafalque, sprinkled holy water on it and pronounced as the closing words: "And now, let us go home to die".&lt;!---Fr Wikipedia has "Et maintenant, rentrons mourir" but other sources have "A présent, rentrons mourir". The meaning seems to be the same.---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although he actually lived until 20 April 1842.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 16 to 24 December, the Église des Invalides, illuminated as on the day of the ceremony, remained open to the public. The people had long disbelieved in Napoleon's death and a rumour spread that the tomb was only a [[cenotaph]]. It was claimed that on St Helena the commission had found only an empty coffin and that the British had secretly sent the body to London for an autopsy. (This rumour has recently been revived.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Rétif de la Bretonne, ''Anglais, rendez-nous Napoléon!'' (''English, Give Us Napoleon Back!''), Paris, Jérôme Martineau, 1969; and Bruno Roy-Henry, ''Napoléon, l’énigme de l’exhumé de 1840'', Paris, L’Archipel, 2000. Later, it would be claimed that in 1870 the Emperor's mortal remains had been removed from the Invalides to save them from being captured in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and had never been returned.&lt;/ref&gt;) Hugo wrote that, though the actual body was there, the people's good sense was not amiss:

{{quote box|quote=All this ceremony had a curious mark of evasion. The government seemed to fear the phantom they were summoning up. They looked like they were both displaying Napoleon and at the same time hiding him. Everything that would have been too great or too touching was left in shadow. Whatever was real or grand was hidden away beneath more or less splendid shrouds; the imperial cortège was hidden within the military cortège, the army within the National Guard, the parliamentary chambers within the Invalides and the coffin within the cenotaph. Instead, Napoleon should have been considered boldly and openly - honouring him properly, treating him royally and popularly as an emperor; and then they would have found strength where they nearly stumbled.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, "Funérailles", p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{-}}

==A political failure==
The return of the remains had been intended to boost the image of the July Monarchy and to provide a tinge of glory to its organisers, Thiers and Louis-Philippe. Thiers had spotted the rise of the French infatuation with the First Empire that would go on to become the Napoleonic myth. He also thought that returning the remains would seal the new spirit of accord between France and the United Kingdom, even while the Egyptian affair was beginning to agitate Europe. As for Louis-Philippe, in the end he was disappointed in his hope to use the remains' return to give some small additional legitimacy to his monarchy, rickety and indifferent to the French people.

The great majority of the French, excited by the return of the remains of one whom they had come to see as a martyr, felt betrayed that they had been unable to render him the homage that they had wished. Hence the government began to fear rioting and took every possible measure to prevent the people from assembling.  Accordingly, the cortège had been mostly river-borne and had spent little time in towns outside Paris. In Paris, only important personages were present at the ceremony. Worse, the lack of respect shown by most of the politicians shocked public opinion and revealed a real rupture, a gulf, between the people and their government.

The "retour" also did not prevent France from losing its diplomatic war with the United Kingdom. France was forced to give up supporting its Egyptian ally. Thiers, losing his way in aggressive policies, was ridiculed and the king was compelled to dismiss him even before ''Belle Poule'' arrived. Thiers had managed to push through the return of the remains, but was unable to profit from that success.
{{-}}

== Monument ==
As planned, Napoleon's remains repose today in a magnificent monument beneath the middle of the dome in the Invalides. The monument was designed by architect [[Louis Visconti]] in 1842, but was not completed until 1861.

A circular hollow was cut beneath the dome as a kind of open crypt. In it was placed a large sarcophagus - said to be of "red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]", but in fact of [[aventurine]] [[quartzite]], similar to porphyry, from quarries in Karelia, Northern Russia on the shore of the Onega lake. The sarcophagus rests upon a base of green granite from the [[Vosges]].&lt;ref&gt;François Lagrange in ''L'estampille/L'objet d'art'' magazine, N°21 January 2006, issue "Les Invalides", p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Karelian quarries belonged to Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] and the stone cost around 200,000 francs, paid by France: L. Léouzon Le Duc, ''Études sur la Russie'', p. 12, cited by Octave Aubry, ''Sainte-Hélène'', Paris, Flammarion, coll. « L’histoire », 1973, p. 461 note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; That green granite block rests, in turn, upon a slab of black marble, 5.5m x 1.2m x 0.65m, quarried at [[Sainte-Luce, Isère|Sainte-Luce]] and transported to Paris with great difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;René Reymond, ''Énigmes, curiosités, singularités'', (self-published), 1987, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 1861, Napoleon's coffin was transferred from the chapel of Saint-Jérôme, where it had lain since 1840. The transfer was accompanied only by an intimate ceremony: present were the Emperor [[Napoleon III]], Empress [[Eugénie de Montijo|Eugénie]], the Prince Imperial [[Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial|Napoléon Eugène]], other related princes, government ministers and senior officials of the crown.

{{Battles involving Assyria}}
The '''Revolt of Babylon''' in 626 BC refers to a series of events from 626 BC to 616 BC when the Babylonians succeeded in establishing their independence and removing the last Assyrian influence in their domains. The revolt is one of the key factors contributing to the fall of Assyria; within four years of the end of the revolt, the Assyrian presence in Mesopotamia ends and the Assyrians fled into exile at Harran in the eastern parts of Syria.

Shakespeare in Delaware Park was first founded in 1976 by [[Saul Elkin]], as a part of the [[University at Buffalo]]’s theater department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatredance.buffalo.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/elkin.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkin began the project for Shakespeare in Delaware Park by asking the Mayor of the city of Buffalo to help in developing a free Shakespeare theater festival to resemble the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. Mayor Stanley Makowski gave permission for the performances to take place in Delaware Park, as well as pledge to fund the electricity costs for all performances (a pledge honored to this day). 

Shakespeare in Delaware Park’s previous [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor style stage]] was first built and designed by Gary Casarella (technical director for the University at Buffalo's Theatre department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatredance.buffalo.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/casarella_gary.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081001232850/http://www.theatredance.buffalo.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/casarella_gary.shtml |archivedate=2008-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and was constructed at the University at Buffalo with funding from the school's dean. After the construction of the stage it was marked, taken apart, and transported to Delaware Park, where it was reconstructed at the base of what is now known as “Shakespeare Hill”,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nickelcity.net/news/00_05/shakespeare.htm&lt;/ref&gt; during the 1993 season, in time for that year's production of [[Romeo and Juliet]]. That season's first production used a temporary stage, and prior seasons used other stages.  The seating has always been the hill itself, and audience members watch the productions on blankets, lawn chairs, and other self-provided seating.

In 1991, Shakespeare in Delaware Park became a fully independent non-profit organization whose only funding comes from donations made by the public, audience members, the City of Buffalo, Erie County, and outside entities such as [[M&amp;T Bank]], the local NBC affiliate [[WGRZ-TV]], the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] (NYSCA) and ''[[The Buffalo News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shakespeareindelawarepark.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational Activities ==
The majority of roles for the productions in Shakespeare in Delaware Park are done through an audition process held at the Shakespeare in Delaware Park’s offices, before the summer season. Most actors are from the local area of Buffalo, NY and are hired seasonally, with the exception of a small troupe members who work year long with the company, performing in high schools throughout the Buffalo area.

Previous education productions include "Et Tu, Shakespeare?", “Where There’s a Will, There’s a Play!” written by the troupe members, and are hour long shows they perform for high school students that teaches parts of Shakespeare’s life, times, and Theater, by incorporating different parts of Shakespeare’s work such as his plays; “[[Comedy of Errors]]”, “[[Midsummer Night’s Dream]]”, and “[[Hamlet]]”, and some of his sonnets. The actors will then stay after the performance to answer questions students might have about Shakespeare and his work. This small troupe of actors also provide workshops for students where they can work alongside the actors to learn different elements such as; [[iambic pentameter]], sound, meaning, and image, and can arrange these workshops to work around a specific Shakespearean play students may be working on. 

The company also offers an intense 6 day workshop that includes the performance of “Where There’s a Will, There’s a Play”, the three-day workshop, and a joint performance that includes both students and troupe members from Shakespeare in Delaware Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shakespeareindelawarepark.org/education.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710081514/http://www.shakespeareindelawarepark.org/education.html |archivedate=2008-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Short-course Off-road Drivers Association''' (usually abbreviated as '''SODA''') was an [[Offroad racing|off-road racing]] sanctioning body in the [[United States]].

==History==
SODA began as a [[Midwestern United States]] off-road racing series in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dirtnewz.com/corr-pressreleases/2008/10-2008/corr10-3-08.shtml|title=Background on CORR|date=October 2008|publisher=[[Championship Off-Road Racing]]|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was televised in the 1980s and 1990s. Series races appeared tape delayed on [[ESPN]]/[[ESPN2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://racedesert.com/race/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=228076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519031254/http://racedesert.com/race/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=228076 |archivedate=2006-05-19 |df= }}, Retrieved from August 27, 2007 Google cache but no longer accessible; Douglas scored double win at Lake Geneva Race; July 13, 1997; Retrieved September 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (often during in the winter months).  Most races were held in [[Wisconsin]] but a few were held in [[Michigan]]. The crown jewel of the series was the off-road championship event held at the [[Crandon International Off-Road Raceway]] - the "home of the world championship off-road race".

The vehicles used were primarily [[Trophy Truck|Trophy trucks]], buggies (which were based on the original [[Volkswagen Beetle]] called [[Baja Bug]]), and a few stock cars. All vehicles had heavily modified suspension.

Most drivers from SODA moved to [[Championship Off-Road Racing|CORR]] (Championship Off-Road Racing) after the 1997 season, which basically ended SODA's existence. A greatly diminished series continued on for at least a few years afterwards.

==Video game==
In 1997, [[Sierra Entertainment]] released a SODA-themed racing video game called ''[[SODA Off-Road Racing]]''.

==Classes==

*Class 1-1600, 1600&amp;nbsp;cc engine buggies with driver only
*Class 2-1600, 1600&amp;nbsp;cc engine buggies with driver plus co-pilot (Sometimes run with class 1-1600)
*Class 3, 4-wheel-drive Short Wheelbase vehicles (Jeep CJ, Ford Bronco, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="530">'''Speed thinking''' is a type of thinking technique proposed by authors such as Dr Ken Hudson, [[Malcolm Gladwell]] and [[Edward de Bono]] that, according to the authors, could accelerate the pace of thinking and improve how an individual or group thinks, creates, solves and acts.

Structurally, Hudson's speed thinking involves two-minute bursts whilst trying to generate nine possibilities in a five-step process (start, enhance, connect, evaluate, action).

'''Spying on the United Nations''' refers to acts of espionage committed by states against the United Nations.

The UN claims that acts of espionage on it are illegal under a number of [[international treaties]], including the 1946 [[Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations]], the 1947 agreement between the United Nations and the United States, and the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].&lt;ref name=UN-20040227&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.unog.ch/news2/documents/newsen/pb040227.htm|title=United Nations press briefing|author=United Nations Information Service in Geneva|publisher=United Nations|date=27 February 2004|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one notable incident, the US and other Western countries were found to be spying on the UN in March 2003, in the run-up to the [[Iraq War]],&lt;ref name=age-20040619&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/18/1087245106216.html|title=Australia 'party to bugging of UN'|author=Mark Forbes|work=[[The Age]]|date=19 June 2004|accessdate=1 May 2008|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actual bugging devices were found inside the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2004/12/17/un-bug-geneva041217.html|title=New bugging device found in UN offices - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.quintessenz.at/mirror/un-bug.htm|title=Technical analysis of the bug|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170757/http://cryptome.quintessenz.at/mirror/un-bug.htm|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1376585,00.html Bugging device found at UN offices], Brian Whitaker, 18 December 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[WikiLeaks]] revealed that US diplomats had been [[Spying on United Nations leaders by United States diplomats|spying on UN leaders]].

{{see also|Spying on United Nations leaders by United States diplomats}}
The British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' published an investigative report revealing that the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) of the United States was conducting a secret surveillance operation directed at intercepting the telephone and email communications of several [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] diplomats, both in their offices and in their homes.&lt;ref name=observer-20030302&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,905899,00.html|title=Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war|author=Martin Bright, Ed Vulliamy and Peter Beaumont|date=2 March 2003|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign, the result of a directive by [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} was aimed primarily at the delegations from [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Guinea]] and [[Pakistan]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The investigative report cited an NSA memo which advised senior agency officials that it was "'mounting a surge' aimed at gleaning information not only on how delegations on the Security Council will vote on any second resolution on Iraq, but also 'policies', 'negotiating positions', 'alliances' and 'dependencies' – the 'whole gamut of information that could give US policymakers an edge in obtaining results favourable to US goals or to head off surprises'.&lt;ref name=nsa-memo&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/02/iraq.unitednations1|title=Reflections of Iraq Debate/Votes at UN-RT Actions + Potential for Related Contributions|author=Frank Koza, [[National Security Agency|NSA]]|date=31 January 2003|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=1 May 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authenticity of this memo has been called into question by many in the US and it is still unclear as to whether or not it is legitimate.&lt;ref name=observer-20030302 /&gt; 

A young translator for Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), [[Katharine Gun]], leaked the memo to the ''Observer'' because she believed the war was illegal.  She was fired from her job at GCHQ. Gun was arrested and accused of violating the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]], but charges were dropped after the prosecution presented no evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3485072.stm GCHQ translator cleared over leak], BBC News (26 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Smith, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/31/katharine-gun-observer-iraq-war-whistleblower-hollywood-film-official-secrets Hollywood beckons for whistleblower who risked jail over Iraq 'dirty tricks'], ''The Guardian'' (30 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 confidential cable released by [[WikiLeaks]] the following year, US diplomats were directed to spy on UN leaders, including Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], as well as the Security Council delegations of Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cables-spying-un | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Robert | last1=Booth | first2=Julian | last2=Borger | title=US diplomats spied on UN leadership | date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to documents leaked by [[Edward Snowden]] the NSA successfully cracked the encryption guarding the United Nations' internal videoconferencing system in the summer of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/08/25/nsa-hacked-into-un-communications-leaked-documents-show/|title=NSA hacked into encrypted UN communications, leaked documents show|first=David|last=Meyer|date=25 August 2013|website=gigaom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clare Short]], a British cabinet minister who resigned in May 2003 over the war, stated in media interviews that British intelligence regularly spied on UN officials.

On 26 February 2004 Short alleged on the [[BBC]] ''[[The Today programme|Today]]'' radio programme that [[Secret Intelligence Service|British spies]] regularly intercept UN communications, including those of [[Kofi Annan]], its [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]]. The revelation came the day after the unexplained dropping of whistleblowing charges against former [[GCHQ]] translator [[Katharine Gun]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20040227"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D7103CF934A15751C0A9629C8B63|title= Ex-Aide to Blair Says the British Spied on Annan|author=Patrick E. Tyler|date=27 February 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to Short's statement, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Tony Blair]] said "I really do regard what Clare Short has said this morning as totally irresponsible, and entirely consistent [with Short's character]." Blair also claimed that Short had put UK security, particularly the security of its spies, at risk.&lt;ref name="guardian-20040226"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/26/iraq.iraq|title=Short claims UK spied on Annan|author=George Wright, Martin Nicholls and Matthew Tempest|date=26 February 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 April 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, on the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme, Short called Blair's response "pompous" and said that Britain had no need to spy on Kofi Annan. Blair did not explicitly deny the claims but [[Robin Cook]], former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], wrote that in his experience he would be surprised if the claims were true.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

A few days later (on 29 February 2004) Ms Short appeared on [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s ''[[Jonathan Dimbleby]]'' programme. She revealed that she had been written to by [[UK|Britain's]] senior civil servant, [[Cabinet Secretary]] [[Andrew Turnbull, Baron Turnbull|Andrew Turnbull]]. Turnbull's confidential letter (which Short showed to Dimbleby, and which was quoted on the programme) formally admonished her for discussing intelligence matters in the media, and threatened "further action" if she did not desist from giving interviews on the issue. Turnbull wrote that she had made claims "which damage the interests of the United Kingdom", and that he was "extremely disappointed". The "further action" referred to in the letter has been interpreted as threatening either the removal of Short's status as a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] or to legal action under the Official Secrets Act. Either course of action would be without recent precedent; the last time a Privy Counsellor's status was revoked was in 1921 when Sir [[Edgar Speyer]] was accused of collaborating with the Germans during the [[First World War]]. However, on 1 March 2004, Tony Blair's official spokesman refused to rule out such a step.&lt;ref name="guardian-20040301"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1159241,00.html|title=Top civil servant tells Short to shut up|author=Nicholas Watt|date=1 March 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 April 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the same interview on the ''[[Jonathan Dimbleby]]'' programme, Short backtracked on her claim about British agents bugging Mr Annan. She admitted that the transcripts she saw of Mr Annan's private conversations might have related to Africa and not to Iraq.&lt;ref name="guardian-20040301" /&gt;
Asked whether she could confirm that the transcripts related to Iraq, she said: "I can't, but there might well have been ... I cannot remember a specific transcript in relation, it doesn't mean it wasn't there." Short also admitted that her original claim, on the ''[[The Today programme|Today]]'' programme, that Britain had eavesdropped on Mr Annan may have been inaccurate. Asked whether the material could have passed to the British by the Americans, she said: "It could. But it normally indicates that. But I can't remember that."&lt;ref name="guardian-20040301" /&gt;

===Australia===
Australia reportedly received transcripts from the US and British phone-tapping operations against UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] and another top UN figure, [[Hans Blix]] via phone-tapping. Australia also allegedly assisted the bugging with spy satellites connected to the [[Pine Gap]] relay centre near [[Alice Springs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/27/1077676969778.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Australian spy circle tied to UN bugging | date=28 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
British writer [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]] alleges that [[Mossad]], Israel's foreign intelligence service, sees penetrating all UN diplomatic missions as a task of its New York ''[[katsa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Gordon: ''Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad'' (1999, 2009 updated version)&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Alain Pellegrini]], former commander of [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|UNIFIL]], the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, claimed that Israel regularly spies on the peacekeeping mission. According to Pellegrini, Israeli agents had access to all reports and information submitted by UNIFIL to the UN, and is either obtained by wiretapping or is stolen when it reaches New York. According to Pellegrini, Israeli intelligence even accessed his encrypted semi-annual reports to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/150081.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218075225/http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/150081.html |archivedate=18 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
Cypriot intelligence is alleged to have stolen 6,500 UN documents containing sensitive information on its negotiations with [[Turkish Cypriot]] leaders. An internal UN investigation reportedly concluded that the theft was the work of the Cyprus Intelligence Service (CIS). The operation was reportedly headed by a CIS agent who befriended Sonja Bachmann, a senior aide to [[Alexander Downer]], an Australian politician who served as an adviser to UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] and the special rapporteur on the Cyprus negotiations. The agent allegedly obtained Bachmann's email login information, allowing a CIS team to access Downer's email several times while he was away on UN business.&lt;ref name=intelnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelnews.org/2010/10/26/02-380/|title=Greek-Cypriot spies behind largest document theft in UN history, report claims|date=26 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, stolen documents were leaked to the press, and the UN investigation concluded that the Cypriots leaked the documents in the hope of undermining the role of Downer, who was seen as being too closely aligned to Turkish Cypriots.&lt;ref name=intelnews/&gt;

===Morocco===
In a 28-page report to the UN Security Council on the situation in [[Western Sahara]] and on the situation faced by [[MINURSO]], the UN monitoring force in the region, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wrote that Morocco was intercepting MINURSO communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/12/us-sahara-un-idUSBRE83B1A120120412 | agency=Reuters | title=Morocco may have spied on Western Sahara mission: UN | date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stock Car Brasil''', also known as '''Stock Car V8''', is a [[Touring car racing|touring car]] [[auto racing]] series based in [[Brazil]]. It is considered the major [[South America]]n motorsports series.

==History==
===1970s===
The series was created in 1979 to be an alternative to the former Division 1 championship that competed with [[Chevrolet Opala]] and [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]]. The dominance of [[Chevrolet]] over [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] models was causing a lack of public interest and sponsors. [[General Motors]] then created a new category, with a name reminiscent of the famous [[NASCAR]] with standardized performance and improvements for all the competitors. The first race was run on April 22, 1979 at the [[Autódromo Internacional de Tarumã]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] with 19 cars competing, all of them 6-cylinder Chevrolet Opalas. The pole position was held by [[José Carlos Palhares]], and the race was won by [[Affonso Giaffone]].

===1980s===
[[Image:Stock Car Brasil 1988 Chevrolet Opala Ingo Hoffman.jpg|thumb|[[Chevrolet Opala]] 1987–1989]]
This decade saw the emergence of several rivalries between drivers. In 1982 two races were held for the first time at the [[Autodromo do Estoril]], Portugal.

The first major change in the Stock Car standard occurred in 1987. With the support of General Motors, a fairing designed and built by coachbuilder Caio was adopted, which was adapted to the Opala's chassis. The car exhibited improved aerodynamics and performance. Safety equipment become more sophisticated.

===1990s===
[[File:Stock Car Brasil 1992 Chevrolet Opala Wilson Fittipaldi.jpg|thumb|[[Chevrolet Opala]] 1990–1993]]
[[Image:Stock Car Brasil 1994 Chevrolet Omega.jpg|thumb|[[Chevrolet Omega]] 1994–1999.]]
In 1990 General Motors renewed its interest in the category and built a prototype intended to replace the Caio/Hidroplas model.

In 1991 new rules were established and the races were disputed in double rounds on the weekends, with two drivers per car, but the series continued to lose ground with the public, sponsors and television networks to other championships with many manufacturers involved, such as [[Campeonato Brasileiro de Marcas e Pilotos]] that included the involvement of [[Chevrolet]], [[Fiat]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and  [[Volkswagen]], as well as the always popular [[Formula racing]] championships.

In 1994 the championship returned to the old rules and Chevrolet announced that the [[Chevrolet Omega]] would be introduced as the new standard model. As part of a marketing strategy and in order to reduce costs, the tickets were free and the races were now held in double rounds sponsored by Brazilian Formula Chevrolet in an event called ''Chevrolet Challenger''. This decade marked a dominant era for [[Ingo Hoffmann]] with eight titles, three in partnership with Ângelo Giombell. His only serious challenges came from Paulo Gomes in 1995 and [[Chico Serra]] in 1999.

===2000s===

[[Image:Stock Car Brasil - The new era.jpg|thumb|JL G-09 Chevrolet 2009–2012]]
From 2000 on, General Motors departed the series and Vicar Promoções Desportivas, owned by former racing driver Carlos Col, took over the organization. This ushered in a period of modernization and improved security as the category started to use a [[tubular chassis]] designated '''JL G-09'''. The project engineer was Edgardo Fernandez, who did something similar for the Argentina category [[Top Race V6]], inspired by both NASCAR and the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]]. The chassis was built by Zeca Giaffone's [[JL Racing]].

In 2003 the category replaced the Chevrolet 6-cylinder engine used with modifications since 1979 with a Chevrolet [[V8 engine|V8]] imported from the [[United States]] by JL Racing, similar to the engines used by the NASCAR Busch Series. General Motors participated in the series with the [[Chevrolet Vectra|Vectra]].

In 2005 [[Mitsubishi]] entered the series with the [[Mitsubishi Lancer]]. October 30 of that same year marked the first race held in [[Argentina]] at [[Autódromo Juan y Oscar Gálvez]], alongside the [[TC 2000 Championship|TC 2000]] category. Attendance was 70,000. Giuliano Losacco was the winner, with Mateus Greipel second and [[Luciano Burti]] coming in third.

In 2006, [[Volkswagen]] entered in the series with the [[Volkswagen Bora|Bora]] and the championship adopted a point system similar to the one used in NASCAR, as well as a new system with 16 teams and 32 drivers. At the end of the season, the 10 best drivers were automatically qualified to run the 4 final races, called ''Super Final'', similar to the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup]]. In 2007, the category gained another manufacturer with the entrance of [[Peugeot]] with its [[Peugeot 307|307 Sedan]]. Volkswagen announced it was withdrawing from the category in 2008, with two-time champion Mitsubishi doing the same one year later.

===2010s===

[[File:Luciano Burti (5797860059).jpg|thumb|[[Luciano Burti]] on Campo Grande Speedway with the Peugeot 408, in 2011.]]
For 2010 the category will use [[ethanol]] as fuel and engines with [[Fuel injection|electronic injection]].

In 2011, Peugeot re-entered the championship announced with the [[Peugeot 408|408]] sedan model, replacing the 307. In 2012, Chevrolet introduced the [[Chevrolet Sonic]] as its competing model. The category announced changes for 2012 season, dropping the ''Super Final'' system. The scoring system was also changed, with the top twenty drivers in each race being awarded points. For the 2016 season, General Motors announced the [[Chevrolet Cruze]] as the replacement for the Sonic. In 2017, Peugeot announced its retirement from the competition leaving Chevrolet as the lone automaker to compete in the series in which all drivers now use identical Cruze models, making it a one-make style championship in South American stock car racing.

==Support races==
Created in 1992, the ''Brazilian Formula Chevrolet'' was the Series' main support category. It used the same chassis as Formula Opel until 1994, subsequently switching to a Techspeed chassis until 2002, which was the same year the category was retired.

The ''Stock Car Light'' second tier was created in 1993, and reformulated in 2008 to become the ''Copa Vicar''. After a merger with Pick-up Racing Brasil, the ''Copa Chevrolet Montana'' was established and standardized around the [[Chevrolet Montana]] model. Pick-up Racing Brasil was a category created in 2001 but only became part of the Stock Car Brasil programme until 2006.

The ''Stock Car Jr.'' third tier was created in 2006. It was intended for young and amateur drivers moving from Kart racing. In 2010 the category was replaced with the ''Mini Challenge Brasil''. After three seasons it was cancelled.

==Concept==
The basic idea of the party is that the person enters the room and receives a bright color (light stick or glow necklace) or wears a color that best suits their status. Red if you are taken (stop), yellow if you are not sure (caution), green if you are single (go). 

Usually, the color [[green]] means that one is [[single person|single]] and looking for a relationship. [[Red]] means that one is in a relationship, or not looking for one.&lt;ref name="azcentral.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=At stoplight parties, guesswork goes out the door|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/music/articles/1107stoplight-party07-ON.html?&amp;wired|accessdate=28 January 2013|newspaper=AZ Central|date=Nov 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellow]] may mean "unsure" or "maybe," or could mean that one is in a relationship but still open to advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Mixed Signals At Stoplight Parties .|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zA5PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jB8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6660,3113392&amp;dq=stoplight-party&amp;hl=en|accessdate=28 January 2013|newspaper=Star-News|date=Feb 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a stop light party is to decrease the [[apprehension (fear)|apprehension]] associated with approaching potential mates at parties. It also serves the purpose of providing an easy indicator of one's unavailability, to fend off unwelcome advances. The color codes derive from the [[traffic light]] signal colors indicating red for stop, yellow for caution/slow down, and green for go. 

===History===
The earliest documented examples of a Stoplight or Traffic Party held in the public setting can be traced back to the late 90's and the college town of Albany in upstate New York, where a promoter named Bill Kennedy was throwing them in nightlife venues across the city. The party would gain in popularity after a large nightclub named Sneaky Pete's opened in the winter of 2000. Kennedy would give out glow necklaces and had a large decommissioned traffic light lit up at every party. After years of creating a local buzz the party received national attention in 2005 after the Times Union newspaper in Albany, NY ran a feature story about it. The Associated Press (AP) picked up on the story and it ran nationally on the front page of papers across America.&lt;ref&gt;http://helenair.com/entertainment/red-light-green-light/article_c756956a-b26e-5d91-b2bc-bcb9adeed4c1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Internet dating site Match.com ran a feature story and after that and the party went “viral." It has been thrown in venues across the world since receiving extensive media coverage. Bill Kennedy has been interviewed about the popularity of the Stoplight Parties in countless trade publications like Nightclub &amp; Bar Magazine. Kennedy is still working in the nightlife business and is currently based out of Las Vegas, NV. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ocregister.com/2005/11/23/fashion-stop-in-the-name-of-love/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">'''Summerlicious''' and '''Winterlicious''' are two food festivals that are held each year in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Winterlicious runs during the first two weeks of February, typically one of the poorest times of the year in terms of restaurant attendance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Summerlicious occurs at the start of July, also a slow time for restaurants. During the events major restaurants from across the city offer a limited menu of [[prix fixe]] dinners at a discount from typical prices. Currently{{when|date=June 2018}} the prices are $23, $28 or $33 for lunch and $33, $43 or $53 for dinner, with drinks and gratuity extra.  Originally when the festival started, lunches were $15, $20, $25, while dinners were $25, $35, $45.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The promotion originally began in 2003 with 35 restaurants participating. Based on similar events in other cities it was designed to boost the restaurant trade at a slow time of the year. It was further promoted as part of the efforts to help Toronto recover from the tourism decline that followed the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemic in 2003.{{fact|date=June 2018}} The event has since grown rapidly, becoming a popular semiannual event. In 2009, 150 restaurants were invited to participate in Winterlicious.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The event is run by the special events department of the city, and the city selects which restaurants are allowed to participate. There are several rules for becoming a participating restaurant, including certain price standards, a clean health inspection record, and good reviews from prominent Toronto restaurant review guides. It is also closed to chains. There is considerable demand to be included in Winterlicious. While the prices are discounted, participating restaurants see three to four times as much business. Non-participating restaurants are also correspondingly hurt during the event. Final invitations are at discretion of the city, which has been accused of choosing the largest and most prominent of the city's dining locations at the expense of smaller local ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/comment/2009/01/29/8184221-sun.html Winterlicious' cold shoulder 'City-wide' event is a great idea -- so why isn't it open to any restaurant willing to participate?] ''Toronto Sun'' Thursday, February 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other restaurants offer similar prix fixe combinations without participating in the promotion, but use different (though often similar) names to avoid infringement of the city's [[official mark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torontoist.com/2009/07/summerlicious-ish/|title=Summerlicious-ish|first=Kaori|last=Furue|work=[[Torontoist]]|publisher=[[St. Joseph Communications|Ink Truck Media]]|date=July 17, 2009|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/viewTrademark?id=0916134&amp;lang=eng&amp;tab=reg|title=Canadian Trademarks Details (application no. 0916134)|publisher=[[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large number of attendees and the stiff competition for restaurants to be included, the event is also regularly criticized. Customers complain about smaller food portions and lower ingredient quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2009/01/winterlicious_winternautious.php A Word of Winterlicious Warning]. ''Torontoist.'' January 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurant workers complain about being overworked and forced to deal with over large numbers of uneducated diners.&lt;ref&gt;"Dishing Licious dirt;" ''Toronto Star.'' Toronto, Ont.: Feb 4, 2009. pg. L.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with these criticisms, the licious promotions remain a very popular program and provide an opportunity for restaurants to make money during a typically otherwise slow time of the year. In Winterlicious 2009, 180,000 meals were served over 2 weeks, resulting in $12 million in economic impact for the City of Toronto.

"'''The Dorcons'''" is the twenty-fourth episode of the second season of ''Space: 1999'' (and the forty-eighth and final overall episode of the programme).  The screenplay was written by [[Johnny Byrne (writer)|Johnny Byrne]]; the director was [[Tom Clegg (director)|Tom Clegg]].  Original titles were "Last of the Psychons"&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Space: 1999'', McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and "Return of the Dorcons".  The final shooting script is dated 17 November 1976.  Live-action filming took place Tuesday 7 December 1976 through Thursday 23 December 1976.&lt;ref name="TP 2010"&gt;''Destination: Moonbase Alpha'', Telos Publications, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==
It is 2409 days after leaving Earth orbit, and [[Moonbase Alpha (Space: 1999)|Moonbase Alpha]] is tracking an unidentified powered object following the [[Moon]].  Sensors detect no life forms and the craft is emitting an energy field highly sensitive to matter.  The Alphans conclude the object to be a robot survey device.  The object continues to close, the energy field making contact with the Moon surface.  The instruments suddenly register a tremendous energy surge.  As [[John Koenig]] orders defensive measures, the object projects a ray at Alpha that not only penetrates the defence screens, but underground into [[Moonbase Alpha (Space: 1999)#Command Centre|Command Centre]].

As the light-beam appears in the room, all personnel are immobilised...with the exception of [[Maya (Space: 1999)|Maya]].  The ray's first action is to short-out the Main Computer input terminal.  It then roams the room, briefly pausing on each person's face.  When it encounters Maya, it focuses on her and the Psychon woman experiences horrible pain.  With an agonised shriek, she collapses.  Its goal achieved, the light disappears and the others are released from their paralysis.

As attempts to contact the now-inert survey device fail, technicians examining Computer discover damage to its data-bank.  [[Helena Russell]] tends to the unconscious Maya.  The doctor's preliminary diagnosis is [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] due to neurological trauma.  To everyone's relief, Maya soon comes to.  She tells them the ray was a mind-probe; after singling her out, it intensified and almost tore her mind apart.  Concerned, Koenig questions the doctor about the possibility of brain damage.

Sensors detect activity from the alien object—it is losing molecular cohesion, transforming into a gaseous mass of raw matter.  As they watch, the mass expands and solidifies, becoming an impressive spacecraft.  Maya is terrified at the sight of it, sobbing that the light was a Dorcon probe and that the ship is after ''her''.  She explains the Dorcons are the most powerful race in this galaxy...and her people's most feared enemy.  A scan of the vessel reveals a [[meson]] converter, a power system that can convert matter to energy, restructure it into any form and shift it through space instantaneously.

Maya is correct.  Aboard the Dorcon capital ship, a heated discussion over the best means to catch the Psychon is underway.  In the presence of the Imperial Archon, supreme ruler of the Federated Worlds of Dorcon, His Excellency Malic—the Archon's unstable nephew and [[heir apparent]]—proposes an armed invasion of the alien base to capture her.  The Archon's chief advisor, Consul Varda, disagrees, arguing the Psychon might be killed in such a campaign.  Knowing Maya's death would suit his ambitious nephew's desire to ascend to the throne, the Archon supports Varda's recommendation to employ diplomatic methods.

Maya relates that, with their technology, the Dorcons can control of all the forces of nature...except death.  They have hunted her people for centuries as, through Psychons, they can achieve immortality.  Her tale is interrupted by a signal from the Dorcon ship.  It is Varda, presenting her credentials.  Koenig is angered by the attack on Maya and the Dorcon woman offers a gracious apology.  Varda officially requests, in the name of the Imperial Archon, that Maya be delivered into her custody.  Koenig declines, but a hysterical Maya warns him "[[Borg (Star Trek)#"Resistance is futile"|Resistance is futile]]."  Varda's final words are to heed the Psychon—Koenig may be willing to die for his principles, but is everyone on Alpha equally inclined?

Alpha is at red alert.  Combat [[Eagle Transporter|Eagles]] rise on the launch pads, laser batteries are deployed, non-combatants move to underground shelters and security forces guard the airlock stations.  As they wait, Koenig asks Maya to explain how her people provide Dorcons with immortality.  She informs him Dorcons do not die in the manner of most humanoid races: their [[brain-stem]]s cease to function at an advanced age.  They discovered Psychons possess brain-stems with regenerative properties that can last forever.  ''If a Psychon brain-stem is [[Transplant Surgery|surgically grafted]] to a Dorcon brain, the result is virtual immortality.''

On the Dorcon ship, Malic and Varda bicker over her failure.  Outraged, the Archon silences them, then orders Varda to obtain the Psychon at any cost.  The Dorcon crew selects targets for the assault and, with reluctance, Varda gives the order to fire.  A fusillade of energy bolts lay waste to perimeter buildings of the Alpha installation.  Alpha's main batteries return fire, but the laser beams bounce off the Dorcon ship's hull.  The next Dorcon volley destroys the gun emplacements.  [[Alan Carter (Space 1999)|Alan Carter]]'s combat Eagle group lifts-off and converges on the alien battlewagon.  Their weapons are also ineffective and they withdraw, though not before Eagle Four is picked off by Dorcon fire.

As the bombardment continues, two hysterical operatives demand Koenig turn over Maya, one threatening him with a [[Moonbase Alpha (Space: 1999)#Hand-held armament|stun-gun]].  The man is disarmed, but a desperate Maya pleads with Helena to use the weapon to kill her—if taken, the surgery will leave her nothing more than a living husk.  The doctor briefly considers [[euthanasia|euthanising]] Maya, but is unable to fire and passes the gun to Koenig.  Pressing it to Maya's temple, he contacts Varda.  Unless the attack is cancelled immediately, he will kill the last of the Psychons.  Varda cannot risk calling his bluff and ceases fire.

Moving fast, the Dorcons activate the meson converter.  Varda and her personal guard transport into Command Centre.  When the Dorcon stormtroopers effortlessly subdue all resistance, Koenig is forced to surrender.  Maya is nowhere in sight (having disguised herself in the form of a co-worker) and Varda resorts to using the mind-probe ray to flush her out.  They take the [[metamorph]] into custody and depart.  Koenig leaps into the still-active transporter beam, arrives on the ship and is stunned on sight.  The Archon is on hand to congratulate Varda on the success of her mission.  He orders Maya taken to the medical unit, where she is placed under a paralysing beam while the Imperial surgeon prepares for the brain-stem transfer.

The Archon orders Koenig killed, but a guilty Varda persuades the ruler to spare his life.  As the Archon withdraws, the Commander is secured in a force-field until the meson converter's [[antimatter]] coils recharge; the attack has temporarily drained its power.  Malic approaches Varda with a sly proposal: allow his uncle to die and, when he is named Archon, she may have anything she desires.  The Consul's reply is blunt.  The Archon fosters peace and stability, while Malic's ambitions will plunge the empire into war and misery.  Now that Malic has shown his treasonous intent, she bars him from the Archon's presence.

Returning to the operations area, she finds Koenig conscious and hostile.  Varda reasons the security of thousands of worlds outweighs the life of one Psychon.  He asks if this justification is for his benefit—or her own?  The medical officer interrupts, stating she is ready for surgery.  Varda leaves, ordering Koenig be transported when the converter is recharged.  He resists and makes a break for the door—to be stopped by an armed Malic.  Koenig is amazed when the Dorcon aristocrat shoots his own men, more so when he allows the Commander to go free.  Once Koenig is out of sight, the scheming youth raises the alarm.

Unaware of this intrigue, Varda escorts the Archon to the surgical transfer unit.  Looking down at Maya, he reflects on who is the greater victim: she, destined to living death, or he, to eternal life.  Unfamiliar with the layout of the vast Dorcon ship, Koenig has difficulty evading the stormtroopers.  When the Commander is finally cornered, Malic again appears to gun down his own soldier.  Koenig is suspicious, but Malic taunts him with Maya's impending fate and directs him to the surgical area.  Malic then contacts Varda, telling her the escaped alien commander has gone berserk, killing multiple soldiers in his search for her.  Varda leaves the Archon unattended to lead the hunt for Koenig...just as Malic planned.

Koenig's trail is soon picked up by Varda and her troops.  When trapped in a blind alley with pursuers just around the corner, he pulls open a grille and hides in a ventilation duct.  He realises the ducts will make travelling easier and he crawls off in search of Maya.  Malic, meanwhile, enters the surgical unit and guns down the medical officer.  After waking his uncle to gloat on the end of his reign, he activates a surgical instrument that projects an intense energy beam on the Archon's forehead.  The [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] youth enjoys watching his uncle beg for mercy as the beam slowly fries his brain.

After the Archon expires, Malic releases Maya from her paralysis (intending to hide her until he can make use of her himself).  Just then, Koenig jumps out of the air vent; in the ensuing scuffle, Maya [[Maya (Space: 1999)#A Metamorph|transforms]] into a lizard beast to subdue Malic.  After they leave in search of the transporter, the Dorcon heir recovers and announces the death of the Archon.  As the new Archon, he orders the human murderer to be killed on sight—but his Psychon accomplice must be captured alive.  He removes the badge of office from his uncle and places the medallion around his own neck, mocking the corpse with a sarcastic salute.

Arriving at the operations room, the Alphans are confronted by a vengeful Varda.  She pledges to kill not only them, but everyone on Alpha for their heinous crime.  Malic enters to observe the execution.  Koenig identifies the real murderer—the new Archon, who decoyed Varda away so he could assassinate their leader.  As the truth dawns on Varda, Malic orders the Consul placed under arrest.  An enraged Varda attacks the youth, who shoots her.  Her dying move is to fire her own weapon at the meson converter, intentionally damaging the [[magnetic shielding|magnetic shield]] to expose the antimatter coils.

With the ship disintegrating around them, the Alphans jump into the transporter beam and return home.  The insane Malic hysterically shouts for the converter to obey its Archon as the ship blows apart with a blast that seems to set space itself ablaze.  On Alpha, repairs are well in hand and all casualties off the critical list.  Resting after their ordeal, Koenig reflects that, all things considered, Consul Varda was quite a woman. Helena suggests taking care of Koenig's bandaged hands, and he asks if they should do that in his quarters or hers.  She seductively says "medical center" and the two share a gentle laugh. [[Tony Verdeschi]] jokingly asks Maya if there is anything else in her Psychon past they should know about.  With an air of mock pretension, she replies that is a highly improper question to ask any lady.

== Production Notes ==

* The episode carried the working title "Return of the Dorcons" on a shooting script dated 19 October 1976.  With much of the same scene structure and dialogue, several differences exist:  (1) The script notes the title 'Archon' should be pronounced the same as 'march on' to avoid confusion with the episode title "[[The Mark of Archanon]]"; (2) Helena is relegated to the underground shelters with her patients before the attack and is not seen until the epilogue; (3) Maya transforms into a potted plant to hide from Varda and threatens to shoot herself with Verdeschi's gun when outed.  Koenig talks her out of committing suicide; (4) A different epilogue was scripted where the six regular characters relax in Koenig's quarters.  The question of her Psychon past caused Maya to recollect an encounter with a handsome Psychon boy during a holiday to her planet's Southern Flora Region.  Jealous, Verdeschi sweeps her off her feet and out of the room.  When left alone, Koenig and Helena reflect that 'What's in the past has gone...fate has played us some strange hands but we've won through in the end.  As for the future...that starts right here and now,' and would close the scene with a kiss.&lt;ref name="SScr 1976"&gt;"Return of the Dorcons" shooting script dated 19 October 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  (This seems to acknowledge the staff's awareness this would be the programme's final installment.)
* Many of the changes from the above version of the script would be motivated by the budgetary restrictions of this being the series' last episode.  Scenes set in Medical Centre and Koenig's quarters would take place in Command Centre in the re-write.  The scene showing Helena in an underground shelter was cut.  Carter would have been shown coordinating Bill Fraser and the Eagle attack force on the Dorcon ship from Command; in the final draft, Fraser went unmentioned, and Carter himself was seen via TV monitor in the pilot's seat, leading the strike.&lt;ref name="SScr 1976"/&gt;  The Dorcon vessel's sets were constructed out of pre-existing flats and set-dressings from previous episodes.  Attentive viewers would recognise actor [[Laurence Harrington]] (playing Stewart) from his previous role as Tom Jackson in "[[Journey to Where]]".
* This installment would fulfill first-season script editor [[Johnny Byrne (writer)|Johnny Byrne]]'s three-script commitment to producer [[Fred Freiberger]].  After seeing his scripts "The Biological Soul" and "The Face of Eden" (later "[[The Metamorph]]" and "[[The Immunity Syndrome (Space: 1999)|The Immunity Syndrome]]") extensively re-worked (for the worse by his reckoning) for new series format, he gave the man a 'Freddie Freiberger/Johnny Byrne' action adventure story which would revolve around Maya, but done in such a way she would be rendered helpless.  Tired of Maya being used to get out of every perilous situation, he created a race that hunted Psychons—as they would be able to control them.&lt;ref name="TP 2010"/&gt;
* Byrne would have preferred Freiberger to use his script "Children of the Gods" as the series finale.  In it, the Alphans are terrorised by a pair of sociopathic children with formidable mental powers.  The children are revealed to be their distant descendants, brought back in time by an alien race.  The aliens have caused these children to be raised alone, without any human contact), to prove that Mankind in inherently amoral.  They intend to destroy Alpha in the present to prevent the birth of these future Alphans.  Koenig then must prove Mankind's worthiness to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Johnny Byrne interview re: "Children of the Gods"; ''Space: 1999'' website 'The Catacombs', Martin Willey&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novelisation ==

The episode was adapted in the sixth Year Two ''Space: 1999'' novel ''The Edge of the Infinite'' by [[Michael Butterworth (author)|Michael Butterworth]] published in 1977.  This novel was not released in the United Kingdom and only as a limited edition in the United States and Germany.  The adaptation was based on the earlier version "Return of the Dorcons".&lt;ref&gt;''Space: 1999 - The Edge of the Infinite'', Warner Books, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tokio Jokio''''' is a 1943 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short directed by [[Norman McCabe]] ("Cpl." was added after the film finished production, as McCabe was drafted into the Armed Forces before its release). It is a propaganda film made during [[World War II]] mocking Japan in the style of a supposed Japanese film journal broadcast. [[Mel Blanc]] supplied all the voices. As with most of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts produced during World War II, the film consists of a series of rapid-fire, short gag vignettes.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=April 2012}}
The cartoon begins with a voiceover saying that a film captured from the Japanese, a typical example of vicious "Japanazi" propaganda, is now about to be released publicly. 

The first segment is "Civilian Defense". The voiceover proudly presents the Japanese [[air raid siren]] system, which turns out to be two men wearing [[Horo (cloak)|horo]]s taking turns in pricking each other in the [[buttocks]] with a [[Sewing needle|needle]]. Then a [[listening post]] is shown, which is literally a pole with key holes in it, and an [[aircraft spotter]], which is literally someone painting spots on a plane. The camera then moves to the [[fire prevention]] headquarters which has burned down to the ground.

Then a lesson about [[incendiary bombs]] is given. The text states that one should never approach incendiary bombs for the first five seconds. A small Japanese man with an [[umbrella]] appears, reads the text, checks his watch (which is decorated with Nazi [[swastika]]s) to count the seconds and then roasts a [[sausage]] above the dynamite stick. Then he explodes; emerging from the blast, he is headless, but his glasses and hat are still in the same place. The figure then says "Oh, rosing face, prease! Rosing face!" as a pun on the Asian concept of "[[losing face]]" or shaming oneself in public.

The second segment is "Kitchen Hints", which stars General [[Hideki Tojo]] as a cook. Tojo explains how a delicious Japanese [[club sandwich]] is made: a bread [[ration card]] is sliced in two, a piece of a meat ration card is put in between, then it is eaten and afterwards Tojo hits himself over the head with a club.

The third segment is a style show which shows the new Japanese victory suit: no [[cuff]]s, no [[pleat]]s, no [[jacket lapel|lapel]] and ... no suit! A small Japanese person is shown at this conclusion, shivering in a cloth diaper in the snow, while trying to warm himself to a [[candle]].

Then Red Toga-san (a pun on sport journalist Red Torgeson) brings us the highlights of today's Japanese sports, while talking out of an [[iris shot|iris]]. Suddenly the iris fades out and his false teeth get stuck in the circle, before clattering to the ground. The Japanese "[[Babe Ruth|king of swat]]", his head shaped exactly like his trophy, is shown in his [[baseball]] outfit. Suddenly he spots a [[fly]], which he tries to kill with a [[fly swatter]], but misses and spins around in a circle. The fly grabs the swatter and clobbers him down. Afterwards it takes his trophy and flies away.

The fifth segment shows "Headline Poisonalities" (combination of "poison" and "personalities") who made headlines that week. A [[human skull|skull]] is seen in the title which changes into the face of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] sitting at his desk. He introduces himself and then leaves his desk, while walking on [[stilts]] to look bigger. He tells the audience that he "will dictate peace term in [[the White House]]". An editor's note covers the screen which is written: "Editor's Note: this is the room reserved for Admiral Yamamoto". When the card is removed an [[electric chair]] room with an active electric chair is shown and [[Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|funeral march]] is quoted. (By the time the film was released, Yamamoto [[Operation Vengeance|had been killed]] when the plane carrying him was shot down over the [[Solomon Islands]] by an American fighter squadron.)

The sixth segment is shown featuring General [[Masaharu Homma]] demonstrating, according to the voice-over, "coolness and calmness of Japanese Officer during air raid". Homma, however, does exactly the opposite and runs around in panic before ducking into a hallowed tree log. When he sticks his head out of the log, a [[skunk]] does the same. Disgusted by the smell of the Japanese, he ducks and reappears with a [[gas mask]] on his head. 
[[File:LordHeeHaw.png|thumb|Lord Hee Haw in ''Tokio Jokio''.]]
"Flashes from [[Axis powers|the Axis]]" is the next (seventh) segment. [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]: a [[monocle]]d [[anthropomorphic]] [[donkey]] identified by a sign on his desk reading "Lord Hee Haw - Chief Wind Bag" (a caricature of the American-British radio broadcaster and Nazi collaborator "[[Lord Haw-Haw|Lord Haw Haw]]", or possibly of [[Fred W. Kaltenbach]]), brays loudly before announcing into a microphone that "the Führer had just received a postcard from a friend vacationing abroad". A hand is shown holding the postcard which reads: "Wish you were here" and then turns the card around to see the picture. It depicts [[Rudolf Hess]] in a prison camp (Hess had flown to Great Britain in 1941 and landed there by parachute to negotiate with the Allied Forces; he was arrested immediately). [[Adolf Hitler]] looks up in amazement and wiggles his nose. [[Rome]], [[Italy]]: shots shown of the "celebrated" ruins of [[Ancient Rome]] and then cuts to [[Benito Mussolini]] sitting on a modern Roman ruin while playing with a yo-yo, titled "Ruin #1".

The next (eighth) segment focuses on the Japanese [[navy]] achievements. A large [[submarine]] is shown "three weeks ahead of schedule", according to the voiceover. Indeed, they are still working on it while it moves under water. After this, a group of Japanese submarine sailors are shown using "intricate and technical machinery," which are actually [[pinball machine]]s, [[slot machine]]s and a [[peep show]] machine.

The ninth segment shows a Japanese sailor piloting a [[Kaiten]] [[human torpedo]] on a dangerous mission. The voiceover tells us that the pilot does not care about the danger, but when he asks him if he has anything to say the pilot exclaims: "No, nothing, except...RET (LET) ME OUT OF HERE!", apparently stuck in the torpedo.

The tenth (and final) segment includes scenes that are again literal interpretations of certain marine boats and air force planes. A plane is shot into the air with a large [[catapult]], a [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero fighter aircraft]] is shown with a [[tricycle]] landing gear (actually a small man riding a tricycle attached to the plane), an aircraft carrier is presented (which carries remains of crashed planes) and a [[Minesweeper (ship)|mine sweeper]] (a boat with two mechanical hands operating a broom to sweep mines away). When this ship accidentally explodes, a [[buoy]] is dropped in the sea with the note: "Regrettable incident please".

==Controversy over stereotypes==
The cartoon was intended as an American [[propaganda film]] against Japan while the two countries were at war. The depiction of the Japanese would generally be considered [[racist]] by today's standards. All the Japanese are shown wearing big glasses, having buck teeth and grinning and rubbing their hands in a very sinister way. Their stereotypical politeness is mocked by their continuous use of the words: "please", "regrettable" and "honorable". Also, their language is spoofed by adding many "Ooo's" at the start of every sentence and [[Engrish|replacing the letter "l" with the letter "r"]] and vice versa.

Furthermore, the Japanese are represented as being incompetent, weak, cowardly, and primitive. Some were completely false: Japanese were more than competent baseball players, allowing for the eventual rise of [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] and the creation of a [[posting system]] several decades later that allowed [[Major League Baseball]] teams to buy the rights to Japanese players from their home clubs. Although the jokes are generally aimed at Japan, the cartoon also pokes fun at [[Lord Haw Haw]], [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].

As with many of the World War II cartoons in America, Tokio Jokio hasn't aired on any network, syndicated, or cable channel due to its offensive content of ethnic and racial stereotyping of Nazi propaganda and Japanese people. However, the Cartoon Network animation history show ''ToonHeads'' once showed clips of this cartoon during a special episode about World War II-era cartoons, with a voiceover explaining that the cartoon, like many others at the time, had very cruel depictions of the Japanese.

[[File:When You See Me You Know Me TP (1613).jpg|thumb|Title page of the second edition of Samuel Rowley's ''When You See Me You Know Me'' (1613) published in London by Nathanial Butter]]
'''''When You See Me You Know Me''''' is an early [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] history play about [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], written by [[Samuel Rowley]] and first published in 1605.

The play was acted by [[Admiral's Men|Prince Henry's Men]], the company to which Rowley belonged through most of his acting career, and premiered most likely in 1604 at the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]]. The play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 12 Feb. 1605; the [[book size|quarto]] that followed was published by the bookseller [[Nathaniel Butter]].

Rowley's play has been cited as a "probable source" for [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']].&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vol. 4, pp. 437–42 and 489–510.&lt;/ref&gt; The second quarto edition of ''When You See Me'' was issued in 1613, the year in which ''Henry VIII'' was performed. Subsequent quartos of ''When You See Me'' appeared in 1621 and 1632.

Inevitably, Rowley had to take a selective approach to the vast subject of Henry VIII's biography; he chose to emphasize the King's conflict with [[Cardinal Wolsey]] and the birth and early education of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. Rowley's approach is loose and broadly synthetic: the events depicted in the play actually spread over three decades (1514–44); Wolsey is still alive at the end of the play, though he should have been long dead. The young Edward is depicted as an incipient hero of Protestantism, defending his sister [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and [[Thomas Cranmer]] when they are accused of treason.

Rowley also shows the King going out in disguise to mingle with his subjects, as in the legends surrounding [[Harun al-Rashid]] and similar figures. Henry is even shown getting into brawls and being arrested. Comic relief is provided by scenes of the King with his jester [[William Sommers|Will Summers]].

Scholars have noted links between ''When You See Me'' and the "B text" or 1616 version of [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe's]] [[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus|''Doctor Faustus'']]. The Diary of [[Philip Henslowe]] records a payment to Rowley for additions to Marlowe's play in Nov. 1602. The common features between ''When You See Me'' and ''Faustus'' have been employed in an effort to trace Rowley's contribution to the B text.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen and Bevington, pp. 72–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
