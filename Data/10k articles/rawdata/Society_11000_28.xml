      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4722">[[File:Nenačovice, tabulka Akce-Z.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque that says that the building was constructed in course of ''Akce Z'']]

"Initiative Z" was the Czechoslovak communist regime's attempt to tap a volunteer work and community spirit toward supplementing local infrastructure and public facility improvement using volunteer work while the construction material and the logistics were provided by the government.

In [[Communist Czechoslovakia]], '''Initiative Z''' ({{lang-cs|Akce Z}}) was a nationwide program of a volunteer, community-improvement unpaid manual labor by population, which was officially recognized as [[Volunteering|volunteer]] work which run for several decades, mainly on the projects where the 5-year planned economy was in a substantial delay.

Specific local plans with Initiative Z community-improvement projects were usually announced by a local ''[[:cs:Národní výbor (1945-1990)|Národní výbor]]'' ("[[People's Committee (Czechoslovakia)|People's Committee]]", i.e. an elected city council-like local government administrative body). Larger projects undertaken within the  Initiative Z have eventually found their place into the nationwide [[planned economy|state plans of economic development, such as Five-Year Plans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexdata.cz/lexdata/sb_free.nsf/c12571cc00341df1c12566af007f1a09/c12571cc00341df1c12566d40071fc2f?OpenDocument Notice 6/1960 of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Finance and State Bank]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, see sections 15, 18 {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was done outside the regular work hours, very often on Saturday morning and was somehow similar to ''[[subbotnik]]s'' in the [[Soviet Union]] or standard community-action or community-improvement initiatives and programs in the West.&lt;ref&gt;''The Czechoslovak Cooperator'', Issues 3-4, [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=JRooAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=czechoslovakia+%22action+z%22&amp;q=%22action+z%22#search_anchor p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was meant to be entirely voluntary work, the names of volunteers and a number of worked hours were duly documented. Those citizens who did not participate and their names therefore did not figure on the lists, were questioned, why they did not come to contribute and in many cases put under an unpleasant pressure by mentioning possible disadvantages such as a reduced choice with respect to future education or difficult change of employer.

Those citizens who worked the most hours were publicly recognized and there was an award-system which gave those who contributed more than 50 hours in a given year a Silver Akce Z Pin and those with more than 100 hours a Golden Akce Z Pin. Many, especially young people, earned - over the years - several of these and mentioned the fact say in applications for university admission.

"Z" stands for the Czech word ''zvelebování'', "improvement", referring to improvement of public places. Typical activities ranged from garbage removal and planting trees to construction of some public-service facilities, such as children [[playground]]s, [[cultural center]]s (Kulturní domy, Houses of Culture), municipal pipelines or sewage lines, large number of grocery stores in small villages (for example grocery store [[Smíšené Zboží]] in village ([[Hůrky]] coordinates 49.049331 N ,15.133108 E) near [[Nová Bystřice]]) etc..

In the late 1980s when the planned economy was in the latest phase of its struggle, even technically advanced projects were attempted to be progressed by sending numbers of unskilled volunteers to help under the umbrella of '''Initiative Z'''. However, the lack of skills among volunteers often resulted in contra-productive outcome and faulty results of volunteer work, although well hidden, regularly led to even longer delays. Many participants recalled futile work be ordered upon them, for illustration having to shuffle a large heap of sand with shovels and wheelbarrows the whole day by 20 meters, just to witness it being relocated by a machine to its original location in the following working days.

Under any regime always sceptical, Czech folk wit claimed that "Z" stood for ''zdarma'', i.e., "without pay".&lt;ref name=from&gt;"From Good King Wenceslas to the Good Soldier Švejk: a dictionary of Czech Popular Culture ", by Andrew Lawrence Roberts, {{ISBN|963-7326-27-8}}, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qlnrXT2yS0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22akce+z%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22akce%20z%22&amp;f=false p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ainu''' or the '''Aynu''' ([[Ainu language|Ainu]] [[Katakana|アィヌ]] [[Latin alphabet|''Aynu'']]; Japanese: {{lang |ja|アイヌ}} ''[[Romanization of Japanese|Ainu]]''; Russian: {{lang |ru|Айны}} ''[[ISO 9|Ajny]]''), in the historical Japanese texts the '''[[Ezo]]''' ({{lang|ja|蝦夷}}), are an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] of Japan ([[Hokkaido]], and formerly [[Tōhoku region|northeastern]] [[Honshu]]) and Russia ([[Sakhalin]], the [[Kuril Islands]], and formerly the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]).&lt;ref name="The languages of Japan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shibatani |first=Masayoshi |title=The Languages of Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sD-MFTUiPYgC&amp;pg=PA3 |year=1990 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-36918-3 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official number of the Ainu is 25,000, but unofficially is estimated at 200,000, due to many Ainu having been completely assimilated into Japanese society and, as a result, having no knowledge of their ancestry.

===Pre-modern===
Recent research suggests that Ainu culture originated from a merger of the [[Jomon culture|Jomon]], [[Okhotsk culture|Okhotsk]] and [[Satsumon culture|Satsumon]] cultures.&lt;ref name="Sato, Takehiro 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sato |first1=Takehiro |year=2007 |title=Origins and genetic features of the Okhotsk people, revealed by ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis |url= |journal=Journal of Human Genetics |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=618–627 |doi=10.1007/s10038-007-0164-z |pmid=17568987|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1264, Ainu invaded the land of [[Nivkh people]] controlled by the [[Yuan Dynasty]], resulting in battles between Ainu and the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/hakubutsukagaku/museum/syuzo/59-tatakai/59-tatakai.html |script-title=ja:第59回 交易の民アイヌ Ⅶ 元との戦い |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Asahikawa, Hokkaido|Asahikawa City]] |date=June 2, 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721151652/http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/hakubutsukagaku/museum/syuzo/59-tatakai/59-tatakai.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active contact between the [[Yamato people|Wajin]] (the ethnically Japanese) and the Ainu of [[Ezo]]chi (now known as [[Hokkaido]]) began in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Weiner |editor-first=M. |year=1997 |title=Japan's Minorities: The Illusion of Homogeneity |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-41515-218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ainu formed a society of hunter-gatherers, surviving mainly by hunting and fishing. They followed a religion which was based on natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu.html |website=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA Online]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |title=Island of the Spirits – Origins of the Ainu |accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573), the disputes between the Japanese and Ainu developed into a war. [[Takeda Nobuhiro]] killed the Ainu leader, Koshamain. Many Ainu were subject to Japanese rule which led to a violent Ainu revolt such as [[Koshamain's Revolt]] ([[:ja:コシャマインの戦い]]) in 1456.
[[File:An Aino-Couple, Japan (10795600564).jpg|thumb|An Ainu Couple in Japan (1914)]]
During the [[Edo period]] (1601–1868) the Ainu, who controlled the northern island which is now named Hokkaido, became increasingly involved in trade with the Japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island. The [[Tokugawa bakufu]] (feudal government) granted the [[Matsumae clan]] exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive. Throughout this period the Ainu became increasingly dependent on goods imported by the Japanese, and were suffering from epidemic diseases such as [[smallpox]].&lt;ref name="Brett L. Walker 2001, Pages 49-56"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion, 1590–1800 |last=Walker |first=Brett |year=2001 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |pages=49–56, 61–71, 172–176 |isbn=978-0-52022-736-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the increased contact created by the trade between the Japanese and the Ainu contributed to increased mutual understanding, it also led to conflict which occasionally intensified into violent Ainu revolts. The most important was [[Shakushain's Revolt]] (1669–1672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority. Another large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the [[Menashi-Kunashir Battle]] in 1789.

===Meiji Restoration and Later===
In the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |first=Dinah |last=Shelton |volume=2 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaido, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Howell |chapter=The Meiji State and the Logic of Ainu 'Protection' |title=New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan |editor-first=Helen |editor-last=Hardacre |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1997 |page=614 |isbn=978-9-00410-735-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture. The Japanese government introduced a variety of social, political, and economic reforms in hope of modernizing the country in the Western style. One innovation involved the annexation of Hokkaido. Sjöberg quotes Baba's (1980) account of the Japanese government's reasoning:&lt;ref name="Brett L. Walker 2001, Pages 49-56"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;… The development of Japan's large northern island had several objectives: First, it was seen as a means to defend Japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist Russia. Second … it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class … Finally, development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg1993" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1899, the Japanese government passed an act labelling the Ainu as "former aborigines", with the idea they would assimilate—this resulted in the Japanese government taking the land where the Ainu people lived and placing it from then on under Japanese control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Loos |editor-first1=Noel |editor-last2=Osani |editor-first2=Takeshi |year=1993 |title=Indigenous Minorities and Education: Australian and Japanese Perspectives on their Indigenous Peoples, the Ainu, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders |publisher=Sanyusha Publishing Co., Ltd. |location=Tokyo |isbn=978-4-88322-597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this time, the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group.

[[File:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|Ainu bear sacrifice. Japanese scroll painting, {{circa|1870}}]]
The Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own land—over a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |first=Philippa |last=Fogarty |title=Recognition at last for Japan's Ainu |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7437244.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the land the Ainu lived on was distributed to the Wajin who had decided to move to Hokkaido, encouraged by the Japanese government of the Meiji era to take advantage of the island's abundant natural resources, and to create and maintain farms in the model of Western industrial agriculture. While at the time, the process was openly referred to as colonization ("takushoku" 拓殖), the notion was later reframed by Japanese elites to the currently common usage "kaitaku" (開拓), which instead conveys a sense of opening up or reclamation of the Ainu lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siddle |first=Richard |title=Race, Resistance, and the Ainu of Japan |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |page=51 |isbn=978-0-41513-228-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, factories such as flour mills, beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines, during a development period that lasted until 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sjöberg |first=Katarina |year=1993 |title=The Return of the Ainu |series=Studies in Anthropology and History |volume=9 |publisher=Harwood Academic Publishers |location=Switzerland |page=117 |isbn=978-3-71865-401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the Ainu were forced to learn Japanese, required to adopt Japanese names, and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=David |title=Encyclopedia of Modern Asia |volume=1 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |page=72 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-684-80617-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1899 act mentioned above was replaced in 1997—until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups.&lt;ref name="Sato, Takehiro 2007"/&gt; It was not until June 6, 2008, that Japan formally recognised the Ainu as an indigenous group (see [[#Official recognition in Japan|Official Recognition]], below).&lt;ref name="Sato, Takehiro 2007"/&gt;

As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu-Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture.

Their most widely known [[ethnonym]] is derived from the word ''ainu'', which means "human" (particularly as opposed to ''kamui'', divine beings), basically neither ethnicity nor the name of a race, in the Hokkaido dialects of the [[Ainu language]]. Ainu is the word Ainu identify themselves as from their first male ancestor Aioina. Ainu also identify themselves as ''Utari'' (”comrade” in the Ainu language). Official documents use both names.

===Official recognition in Japan===
[[File:Map of Ainu in Hokkaido.svg|thumb|Map of the distribution of Ainu in Hokkaido]]

On June 6, 2008, the [[Japanese Diet]] passed a bipartisan, non-binding resolution calling upon the government to recognize the Ainu people as [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous to Japan]], and urging an end to discrimination against the group. The resolution recognised the Ainu people as "an indigenous people with a distinct language, religion and culture". The government immediately followed with a statement acknowledging its recognition, stating, "The government would like to solemnly accept the historical fact that many Ainu were discriminated against and forced into poverty with the advancement of modernization, despite being legally equal to (Japanese) people."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="japantimes2008"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ito |first=M. |title=Diet officially declares Ainu indigenous |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=June 7, 2008 |accessdate=April 25, 2015 |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/06/07/national/diet-officially-declares-ainu-indigenous/#.VTtdfZPJZoM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
 Though the resolution is historically significant, Hideaki Uemura, professor at [[Keisen University]] in Tokyo and a specialist in indigenous peoples' rights, commented that the motion is "weak in the sense of recognizing historical facts" as the Ainu were "forced" to become Japanese in the first place.&lt;ref name="japantimes2008" /&gt;

===Official recognition in Russia===
{{main article|Ainu in Russia}}
As a result of the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)]], the Kuril Islands – along with their Ainu inhabitants – came under Japanese administration. A total of 83 North Kuril Ainu arrived in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] on September 18, 1877, after they decided to remain under Russian rule. They refused the offer by Russian officials to move to new reservations in the [[Commander Islands]]. Finally a deal was reached in 1881 and the Ainu decided to settle in the village of Yavin. In March 1881, the group left Petropavlovsk and started the journey towards Yavin on foot. Four months later they arrived at their new homes. Another village, Golygino, was founded later. Under Soviet rule, both the villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the Russian-dominated Zaporozhye rural settlement in [[Ust-Bolsheretsky District|Ust-Bolsheretsky Raion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIErWxe16k |title=Камчадальские айны добиваются признания |trans-title=Kamchadal Ainu seek recognition |author=vostokmediaTV |date=March 21, 2011 |website=YouTube |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of intermarriage, the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the [[Kamchadals|Kamchadal]] community. In 1953, K. Omelchenko, the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in the USSR, banned the press from publishing any more information on the Ainu living in the USSR. This order was revoked after two decades.&lt;ref name="kamchatka-etno"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kamchatka-etno.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=95 |title=Айны |trans-title=Ainu |year=2008 |website=Kamchatka-Etno |language=ru |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623191226/http://www.kamchatka-etno.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=95 |archivedate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of |2015}}, the North Kuril Ainu of Zaporozhye form the largest Ainu subgroup in Russia. The Nakamura clan (South Kuril Ainu on their paternal side), the smallest group, numbers just six people residing in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]]. On Sakhalin island, a few dozen people identify themselves as Sakhalin Ainu, but many more with partial Ainu ancestry do not acknowledge it. Most of the 888 Japanese people living in Russia (2010 Census) are of mixed Japanese-Ainu ancestry, although they do not acknowledge it (full Japanese ancestry gives them the right of visa-free entry to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.5-tv.ru/news/37800/ |title=В России снова появились айны - самый загадочный народ Дальнего востока |trans-title=In Russia, the Ainu appear again - the most mysterious people of the Far East |date=March 22, 2011 |work=5-tv.ru |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, no one identifies themselves as Amur Valley Ainu, although people with partial descent live in Khabarovsk. There is no evidence of living descendants of the Kamchatka Ainu.

In the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census of Russia]], close to 100 people tried to register themselves as ethnic Ainu in the village, but the governing council of Kamchatka Krai rejected their claim and enrolled them as ethnic Kamchadal.&lt;ref name="kamchatka-etno"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pk.russiaregionpress.ru/archives/4889 |title=Айны – древние и таинственные |trans-title=Ainu - ancient and mysterious |date=March 22, 2011 |work=russiaregionpress.ru |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[leadership|leader]] of the Ainu community in Kamchatka, Alexei Vladimirovich Nakamura, requested that Vladimir Ilyukhin (Governor of Kamchatka) and Boris Nevzorov (Chairman of the State Duma) include the Ainu in the central list of the [[Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East]].

Ethnic Ainu living in [[Sakhalin Oblast]] and [[Khabarovsk Krai]] are not organized politically. According to Alexei Nakamura, {{as of|2012|lc=y}} only 205 Ainu live in Russia (up from just 12 people who self-identified as Ainu in 2008) and they along with the Kurile Kamchadals ([[Itelmens|Itelmen]] of Kuril islands) are fighting for official recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nazaccent.ru/interview/13/ |title=Алексей Накамура |trans-title=Alexey Nakamura |date=January 17, 2012 |work=nazaccent.ru |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.segodnia.ru/content/105359 |title=Айны – борцы с самураями |trans-title=Ainu - wrestlers with samurai |first=Ivan |last=Skvortsov |date=January 29, 2012 |website=Сегодня.ру |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Ainu are not recognized in the official list of the peoples living in Russia, they are counted as people without nationality or as ethnic Russians or Kamchadal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rg.ru/2008/04/03/reg-dvostok/ainu.html |title=Без национальности: Представители малочисленного народа хотят узаконить свой статус |trans-title=Without nationality: Representatives of a small number of people want to legitimize their status |date=April 3, 2008 |first=Svetlana |last=Bogdanova |newspaper=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Joseph Powell of the [[University of New Mexico]] wrote "...we follow Brace and Hunt (1990) and Turner (1990) in viewing the Ainu as a southeast Asian population derived from early Jomon peoples of Japan, who have their closest biological affinity with south Asians rather than western Eurasia peoples".&lt;ref name="NPS Chapter 2"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Powell |first1= Joseph F. |last2= Rose |first2= Jerome C. |url= http://www.nps.gov/archeology/kennewick/powell_rose.htm |title= Report on the Osteological Assessment of the Kennewick Man Skeleton  (CENWW.97.Kennewick) |website= [[National Park Service]] |accessdate= September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark J. Hudson]], Professor of Anthropology at [[Nishikyushu University]], [[Kanzaki, Saga]], Japan, has stated that Japan was settled by a "Proto-Mongoloid" population in the [[Pleistocene]] who became the Jōmon and that their features can be seen in the Ainu and [[Ryukyuans|Okinawan]] people.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson |first= Mark J. |year= 1999 |title= Ruins of Identity: Ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands |location= Honolulu |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |isbn= 978-0-82481-930-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, anthropologist [[Arnold Henry Savage Landor]] described the Ainu as having deep-set eyes and an eye shape typical of Europeans, with a large and prominent browridge, large ears, hairy and prone to [[baldness]], slightly hook nose with large and broad nostrils, prominent cheek-bones and a medium mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Landor |first= Arnold Henry Savage |year= 1893 |title= Alone with the Hairy Ainu: or, 3,800 Miles on a Pack Saddle in Yezo and a Cruise to the Kurile Islands |location= London |publisher= John Murray |pages= 229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omoto has also shown that the Ainu are far more related to other East Asian groups (previously mentioned as 'Mongoloid') than to any Caucasian groups, on the basis of fingerprints and dental morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Cavalli-Sforza |first1= Luigi Luca |last2= Menozzi |first2= Paolo |last3= Piazza |first3= Alberto |title= The History and Geography of Human Genes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=FrwNcwKaUKoC&amp;pg=PA232 |year= 1994 |location= New Jersey |publisher= Princeton University Press |isbn= 978-0-691-08750-4 |page= 232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner {{who|date=November 2018}} found remains of Jōmon people of Japan to belong to a pattern resembling the [[Sinodonty and Sundadonty|Sundadont]] pattern which is typically found in Southern Mongoloid living populations of Taiwanese aborigines, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Thais, Borneans, Laotians, and Malaysians. A recreation of a map made by William W. Howells, professor of anthropology at Harvard University, shows in the shaded the remnants and populations of non-Mongoloid people, appearing as N (Negrito) or A (Australoids of Wallacea, Melanesia and Australia). The latter peoples comprise the present aboriginals of Australia and Melanesia, as shown; the interest here is their presence and remnants. Sundadonts comprise Southeast Asiatics and offshore peoples from northern Japan (Ainu) down to Taiwan and Indonesia. [[Sinodont]]s comprise the East Asian populations from Korea, Japan, China, Mongolia and Siberia. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many have wavy hair, but some straight black hair. Very few of them have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. The Ainu have broad faces, beetling eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Language==
{{Main article|Ainu language}}
Today, it is estimated that fewer than 100 speakers of the language remain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hohmann |first=S. |year=2008 |title=The Ainu's modern struggle |journal=World Watch |volume=21 |number=6 |pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other research places the number at fewer than 15 speakers. The language has been classified as "endangered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Vovin |authorlink=Alexander Vovin |year=1993 |title=A Reconstruction of Proto-Ainu |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this the study of the Ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research.

Although there have been attempts to show that the Ainu language and the Japanese language are related, modern scholars have rejected that the relationship goes beyond contact, such as the mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu. No attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and Ainu is currently considered to be a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref name=shibatani /&gt;

Words used as prepositions in English (such as ''to'', ''from'', ''by'', ''in'', and ''at'') are postpositional in Ainu; they come after the word that they modify. A single sentence in Ainu can be made up of many added or [[agglutinate]]d sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas.

The Ainu language has had no system of writing, and has historically been transliterated by the Japanese [[kana]] or [[Russian alphabet|Russian Cyrillic]]. Today, it is typically written in either [[katakana]] or [[Latin alphabet]]. The unwieldy nature of the Japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent [[syllable coda|coda]] consonants has contributed to the degradation of the original Ainu. For example, some words, such as ''Kor'' (meaning "to hold"), are now pronounced with a [[paragoge]], as in ''Koro''.

Many of the Ainu dialects, even from one end of Hokkaido to the other, were not mutually intelligible; however, the classic Ainu language of the [[Yukar]], or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ainu.htm |title=Ainu |website=omniglot.com |year=2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ethnologue data is incorrect; see [[ainu language]]--&gt;

Traditional Ainu culture was quite different from [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full [[beard]]s and [[moustache]]s. Men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women [[tattoo]]ed their mouths, and sometimes the [[forearm]]s. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for colour. Their traditional [[Clothing|dress]] was a robe spun from the inner bark of the [[elm]] tree, called ''attusi'' or ''attush''. Various styles were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.&lt;ref name= "EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ainu |volume=1|pages=441–442}} Citations:

Modern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots were made from the skin of dogs or [[salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/education/00_resources/articles/Columbia_river_basin/posterback.html |title=Columbia River Basin |date=February 25, 2009 |website=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225075127/http://www.blm.gov/education/00_resources/articles/Columbia_river_basin/posterback.html |archivedate=February 25, 2009 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ainu culture considers earrings, traditionally made from grapevines, to be gender neutral.

Their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of [[bear meat|bear]], fox, [[wolf]], [[badger]], [[ox]], or [[horse meat|horse]], as well as fish, [[fowl]], [[millet]], vegetables, herbs, and [[root]]s. They never ate raw fish or flesh; it was always boiled or roasted.&lt;ref name= "EB1911" /&gt;

Their traditional habitations were reed-thatched huts, the largest {{convert |20|ft|0|abbr=on}} square, without partitions and having a fireplace in the center.

Instead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (''[[Iris pseudacorus]]''); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets. The men used [[chopstick]]s when eating; the women had wooden [[spoon]]s.&lt;ref name= "EB1911" /&gt; [[Ainu cuisine]] is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; there are only a few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaido, serving primarily Japanese fare.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgment upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. [[Corporal punishment|Beating]] was considered a sufficient and final penalty. However, in the case of murder, the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of his feet severed.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

A village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JVnMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=ainu+iwor#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20iwor&amp;f=false |title=Songs of Gods, Songs of Humans: The Epic Tradition of the Ainu |last=Phillipi |first=Donald L. |year=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-40087-069-1 |location=Princeton, NJ |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory.

A village is called a ''kotan'' in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal [[clan]]. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.

''Cise'' or ''cisey'' (houses) in a kotan were made of [[cogon grasses]], [[bamboo grass]], [[bark (biology)|bark]]s, etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the "rorun-puyar," a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called ''shiso'') . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called ''harkiso''). The house had a platform for valuables called ''iyoykir'' behind the shiso. The Ainu placed ''sintoko'' (hokai) and ''ikayop'' (quivers) there.

Outbuildings included separate lavatories for men called ''ashinru'' and for women called ''menokoru'', a ''pu'' (storehouse) for food, a "heper set" (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar (''nusasan'') faced the east side of the house (''rorunpuyar''). The Ainu held such ceremonies there as ''[[Iyomante]]'', a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods.

===Traditions===
The Ainu people had various types of marriage. A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=f3EIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=ainu+marriage#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20marriage&amp;f=false |title=The Ainu and their folk-lore |last=Batchelor |first=John |year=1901 |publisher=The Religious Tract Society |location=London |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called ''tunpu'' annexed to the southern wall of her house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iiADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=ainu+marriage+house#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20marriage%20house&amp;f=false |title=Ainu Family Life and Religion |first=J. K. |last=Goodrich |journal=[[Popular Science]] |volume=XXXVI |date=April 1889 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parents chose her spouse from men who visited her.

The age of marriage was 17 to 18 years of age for men and 15 to 16 years of age for women,&lt;ref name="Service2006" /&gt; who were [[tattoo]]ed. At these ages, both sexes were regarded as adults.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ht1VOTfuU0EC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=ainu+marriage+age+tattoo#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20marriage%20age%20tattoo&amp;f=false |last=Poisson |first=Barbara Aoki |year=2002 |title=The Ainu of Japan |publisher=Lerner Publications |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-82254-176-9 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a man proposed to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal.&lt;ref name="Service2006" /&gt; When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for the back of the hand, leggings and other handmade clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=f3EIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=ainu+marriage+knife#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20marriage%20knife&amp;f=false |title=The Ainu and their folk-lore |last=Batchelor |first=John |year=1901 |publisher=The Religious Tract Society |location=London |page=226|isbn=9785871451199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some books, many ''yomeiri'' marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.

For a ''yomeiri'' marriage, a man and his father would bring betrothal gifts to the house of a woman, including a sword, a treasured sword, an ornamental quiver, a sword guard, and a woven basket (''hokai''). If the man and woman agreed to marry, the man and his father would bring her to their house or the man would stay at her house for a while and then bring her to his house. At the wedding ceremony, participants prayed to the god of fire. Bride and bridegroom respectively ate half of the rice served in a bowl, and other participants were entertained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uq1kCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=ainu+marriage+fire+rice#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20marriage%20fire%20rice&amp;f=false |title=Native Wisdom - Unusual Customs and Rites from Native Cultures|last=Abbotts|first=The|date=2015-08-15|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781326391812|location=|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The worn-out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a [[decoction]] of the endodermis of [[alder]] and the roots of [[butterburs]] to discharge impurities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sILrJPM4DFAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA110&amp;dq=ainu+decoction+alder#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20decoction%20alder&amp;f=false |title=Early European Writings on Ainu Culture: Religion and Folklore |last=Refsing |first=Kirsten |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-70071-486-5 |location= |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as ''attush'', until coming of age.

Newborn babies were named ''ayay'' (a baby's crying),&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ht1VOTfuU0EC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=ainu+baby+ayay#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20baby%20ayay&amp;f=false |last=Poisson |first=Barbara Aoki |year=2002 |title=The Ainu of Japan |publisher=Lerner Publications |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-82254-176-9 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''shipo'', ''poyshi'' (small excrement), and ''shion'' (old excrement). Children were called by these "temporary" names until the ages of two to three. They were not given permanent names when they were born.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Their tentative names had a portion meaning "excrement" or "old things" to ward off the demon of ill-health. Some children were named based on their behaviour or habits. Other children were named after impressive events or after parents' wishes for the future of the children. When children were named, they were never given the same names as others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6JQMmDXI9pQC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=ainu++name#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20%20name&amp;f=false |title=Alone with the Hairy Ainu: or, 3,800 Miles on a Pack Saddle in Yezo and a Cruise to the Kurile Islands |last=Landor |first=Arnold Henry Savage |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-10804-941-2 |location= |page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men wore [[loincloth]]s and had their hair dressed properly for the first time at age 15–16. Women were also considered adults at the age of 15–16. They wore underclothes called ''mour''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPsNAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ainu+mour&amp;q=mour |title=Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People |last1=Fitzhugh |first1=William W. |last2=Dubreuil |first2=Chisato O. |year=1999 |publisher=Arctic Studies Center, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution in association with University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-96734-290-0 |location= |page=320 |quote=Ainu women's underclothes were called mour, literally "deer," a sort of one-piece dress with an open front, ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had their hair dressed properly and wound [[waistcloth]]s called ''raunkut'' and ''ponkut'' around their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6cLYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ainu+ponkut&amp;q=pon+kut |title=Ainu Life and Legends |last=Kindaichi |first=Kyōsuke |year=1941 |publisher=Board of Tourist Industry, Japanese Government Railways |isbn= |location= |page=30 |quote=One is a nettle-hemp braid named pon kut (small sash) or ra-nn kut (under sash).}}&lt;/ref&gt; When women reached age 12–13, the lips, hands and arms were tattooed.

[[File:Iomante2.JPG|thumb|left|Ainu traditional ceremony, c. 1930]]

The Ainu are traditionally [[animists]], believing that everything in nature has a ''[[kamuy]]'' (spirit or god) on the inside. The most important include [[Kamuy Fuchi]], goddess of the hearth, [[Kim-un Kamuy]], god of bears and mountains, and [[Repun Kamuy]], god of the sea, fishing, and marine animals.

The Ainu have no priests by profession; instead the village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary. Ceremonies are confined to making [[libation]]s of [[sake]], saying [[prayers]], and offering [[willow]] sticks with wooden shavings attached to them.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; These sticks are called ''[[inaw]]'' (singular) and ''nusa'' (plural).

They are placed on an altar used to "send back" the spirits of killed animals. Ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called ''[[Iyomante]]''. The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of [[Illness|sickness]]. They believe their spirits are [[Immortality|immortal]], and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to ''kamuy mosir'' (Land of the Gods).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The Ainu are part of a larger collective of indigenous people who practice "arctolatry" or [[bear worship]]. The Ainu believe the bear is very special because they think the bear is Kim-un Kamuy's way of delivering the gift of bear hide and meat to humans.

John Batchelor reported that the Ainu view the world as being a spherical ocean on which float many islands, a view based on the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. He wrote that they believe the world rests on the back of a large fish, which when it moves causes earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Batchelor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batchelor|first1=John|title=The Ainu and their folk-lore|date=1901|publisher=The Religious Tract Society|location=London|pages=51–52|url=https://archive.org/stream/ainuandtheirfol00batcgoog#page/n84/mode/2up/search/round|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ainu assimilated into mainstream Japanese society have adopted [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]], while some northern Ainu are members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

==Institutions==
[[File:Ainu promotion center, Sapporo.JPG|thumb|Ainu cultural promotion centre and museum, in [[Sapporo]] (Sapporo Pirka Kotan)]]

Most Hokkaido Ainu and some other Ainu are members of an umbrella group called the [[Hokkaido Utari Association]]. It was originally controlled by the government to speed Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese [[nation-state]]. It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.

Other key institutions include ''The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC)'', set up by the Japanese government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the Hokkaido University Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cais.hokudai.ac.jp/english/ |title=Center for Ainu &amp; Indigenous Studies |website=Hokkaido University |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 2007, as well as museums and cultural centers.

===Litigation===
On March 27, 1997, the Sapporo District Court decided a landmark case that, for the first time in Japanese history, recognized the right of the Ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions. The case arose because of a 1978 government plan to build two dams in the [[Saru River]] watershed in southern Hokkaido. The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Levin |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635451 |title=Essential Commodities and Racial Justice: Using Constitutional Protection of Japan's Indigenous Ainu People to Inform Understandings of the United States and Japan |journal=New York University Journal of International Law and Politics |volume=33 |pages=445–446 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to [[Nibutani]] village,&lt;ref name="MarkLevin"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1635447 |first=Mark |last=Levin |year=1999 |title=Kayano et al. v. Hokkaido Expropriation Committee: 'The Nibutani Dam Decision' |journal=International Legal Materials |volume=38 |page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; the home of a large community of Ainu people and an important center of Ainu culture and history.{{sfnp|Levin|2001|pages=419, 447}} In the early 1980s when the government commenced construction on the dam, two Ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land. These landowners were Kaizawa Tadashi and [[Shigeru Kayano|Kayano Shigeru]]—well-known and important leaders in the Ainu community.{{sfnp|Levin|2001|page=443}} After Kaizawa and Kayano declined to sell their land, the Hokkaido Development Bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a Project Authorization, which required the men to vacate their land. When their appeal of the Authorization was denied, Kayano and Kaizawa's son Koichii (Kaizawa died in 1992), filed suit against the Hokkaido Development Bureau.

The final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons—the dam was already standing—but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the Ainu people. In short, nearly all of the plaintiffs' claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders.&lt;ref name="MarkLevin"/&gt;{{rp|442}} The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japan's majority, referred to as Wajin in the case and discussions about the case.&lt;ref name="MarkLevin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1551462 |first=Mark |last=Levin |title=The Wajin's Whiteness: Law and Race Privilege in Japan |journal=Hōritsu Jihō |volume=80 |number=2 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal roots of the decision can be found in Article 13 of Japan's Constitution, which protects the rights of the individual, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;ref name="japan_con"&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of Japan (November 3, 1946) |url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Japan/English/english-Constitution.html |website=Solon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was issued on March 27, 1997, and because of the broad implications for Ainu rights, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision, which became final two weeks later. After the decision was issued, on May 8, 1997, the Diet passed the Ainu Culture Law and repealed the Ainu Protection Act—the 1899 law that had been the vehicle of Ainu oppression for almost one hundred years.&lt;ref name="ainushinpou"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoshida Hitchingham |first=Masako |title=Act for the Promotion of Ainu Culture and Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Ainu Traditions – A Translation of the Ainu Shinpou |journal=[[Asian–Pacific Law &amp; Policy Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2000 |url=http://blog.hawaii.edu/aplpj/files/2011/11/APLPJ_01.1_hitchingham_masako.pdf |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;The law's original Japanese text is available at [[:ja:s:アイヌ文化の振興並びにアイヌの伝統等に関する知識の普及及び啓発に関する法律|Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Levin|2001|page=467}} While the Ainu Culture Law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings, the shift that it represents in Japan's view of the Ainu people is a testament to the importance of the Nibutani decision. In 2007 the 'Cultural Landscape along the [[Saru River|Sarugawa River]] resulting from Ainu Tradition and Modern Settlement' was designated an [[Cultural Landscapes of Japan|Important Cultural Landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=412&amp;item_id=00003550 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later action seeking restoration of Ainu assets held in trust by the Japanese Government was dismissed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Levin &amp; Tsunemoto, ''Oklahoma Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental advisory boards===
Much national policy in Japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards, known as {{Nihongo4||審議会|shingikai}} in Japanese. One such committee operated in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="Citation to Siddle's book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Siddle |first=Richard |title=Race, Resistance, and the Ainu of Japan |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-41513-228-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its work resulted in the 1997 Ainu Culture Law.&lt;ref name="ainushinpou" /&gt; This panel's circumstances were criticized for including not even a single Ainu person among its members.&lt;ref name="Citation to Siddle's book"/&gt;

More recently, a panel was established in 2006, which notably was the first time an Ainu person was included. It completed its work in 2008 issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the Ainu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Formation of Ainu political party===
The {{Nihongo4|[[Ainu Party]]|アイヌ民族党|Ainu minzoku tō}} was founded on January 21, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ainu-org.jp/english/index.html |title=Ainu Party |website=ainu-org.jp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710182919/http://www.ainu-org.jp/english/index.html |archivedate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a group of Ainu activists in Hokkaido announced the formation of a political party for the Ainu on October 30, 2011. The Ainu Association of Hokkaido reported that Kayano Shiro, the son of the former Ainu leader Kayano Shigeru, will head the party. Their aim is to contribute to the realization of a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and [[Polyethnicity|multiethnic]] society in Japan, along with rights for the Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111031a5.html |title=Ainu plan group for Upper House run |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=October 31, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427092145/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111031a5.html |archivedate=April 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/national/update/1029/TKY201110290538.html |title=参議院選挙 |trans-title=House of Councillors election |newspaper=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709010224/http://www.asahi.com/national/update/1029/TKY201110290538.html |archivedate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard of living ===
The Ainu have historically suffered from economic and social discrimination throughout Japan that continues to this day. The Japanese Government as well as people since contact with the Ainu, have in large part regarded them as a dirty, backwards and a primitive people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion, 1590–1800 |last=Walker |first=Brett |year=2001 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |page=233 |isbn=978-0-52022-736-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the Meiji Restoration, which saw the introduction of Hokkaido into the Japanese Empire and the privatization of traditional Ainu lands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan's Minorities |last=Siddle |first=Richard |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-13008-0 |location=London |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government during the 19th and 20th centuries denied the rights of the Ainu to their traditional cultural practices, most notably the right to speak their language, as well as their right to hunt and gather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tigweb.org/youth-media/panorama/article.html?ContentID=3609 |title=Will the Ainu language die? |date=May 31, 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |website=TalkingITGlobal |last=Shim |first=Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policies were designed to fully integrate the Ainu into Japanese society with the cost of erasing Ainu culture and identity. The Ainu's position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger Japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the Japanese government that can still be felt today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/bjrenquan/190878.htm |title=Human Right Issues on the Ainu People in Japan |date= |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |website=China.org |last=Yokoyama |first=Yuzuru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the Ainu have manifested in the Ainu's lower levels of education, income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically Japanese counterparts. The Ainu community in Hokkaido in 1993 received welfare payments at a 2.3 times higher rate, had an 8.9% lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a 15.7% lower enrollment into college from high school than that of Hokkaido as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the Ainu's standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap. The Japanese government will provide ¥7 million beginning in 2015, to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First nationwide survey on Ainu discrimination to be carried out |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/29/national/first-nationwide-survey-ainu-discrimination-carried/ |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=December 13, 2015 |issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sakhalin]] Ainu: Pure-blooded individuals may be surviving in Hokkaido. From both Northern and Southern [[Sakhalin]], a total of 841 Ainu were relocated to Hokkaido in 1875 by Japan. Only a few in remote interior areas remained, as the island was turned over to Russia. Even when Japan was granted Southern Sakhalin in 1905, only a handful returned. The Japanese census of 1905 counted only 120 Sakhalin Ainu (down from 841 in 1875, 93 in Karafuto and 27 in Hokkaido). The Soviet census of 1926 counted 5 Ainu, while several of their multiracial children were recorded as ethnic Nivkh, Slav or Uilta.
** North Sakhalin: Only five pure-blooded individuals were recorded during the 1926 Soviet Census in Northern Sakhalin. Most of the Sakhalin Ainu (mainly from coastal areas) were relocated to Hokkaido in 1875 by Japan. The few that remained (mainly in the remote interior) were mostly married to Russians as can be seen from the works of [[Bronisław Piłsudski]].&lt;ref name="howell2005"&gt;{{cite book |first=David L. |last=Howell |title=Geographies of Identity in 19th Century Japan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0prtzCvKb50C&amp;pg=PA187 |year=2005 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-24085-8 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Southern Sakhalin ([[Karafuto]]): Japanese rule until 1945. Japan evacuated almost all the Ainu to Hokkaido after World War II. Isolated individuals might have remained on Sakhalin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_26.php?reg=1420 |title=Всесоюзная перепись населения 1926 года.

* Northern Kuril Ainu (no known living population in Japan, existence [[Ainu people#Official recognition in Russia|not recognized]] by Russian government in Kamchatka Krai): Also known as Kurile in Russian records. Were under Russian rule until 1875. First came under Japanese rule after the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)]]. Major population was on the island of [[Shumshu]], with a few others on islands like [[Paramushir]]. Altogether they numbered 221 in 1860. They had Russian names, spoke Russian fluently and were [[Russian Orthodox]] in religion. As the islands were given to the Japanese, more than a hundred Ainu fled to Kamchatka along with their Russian employers (where they were assimilated into the [[Kamchadal]] population).&lt;ref name="wurm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sharon |last=Minichiello |title=Japan's Competing Modernities: Issues in Culture and Democracy, 1900-1930 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-I_pId0AuhIC&amp;pg=PA163 |year=1998 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-2080-0 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about half remained under Japanese rule. In order to [[Russification|derussify]] the Kurile, the entire population of 97 individuals was relocated to [[Shikotan]] in 1884, given Japanese names, and the children were enrolled in Japanese schools. Unlike the other Ainu groups, the Kurile failed to adjust to their new surroundings and by 1933 only 10 individuals were alive (plus another 34 multiracial individuals). The last group of 20 individuals (including a few pure-bloods) were evacuated to Hokkaido in 1941, where they vanished as a separate ethnic group soon after.&lt;ref name="howell2005"/&gt;
* Southern Kuril Ainu (no known living population): Numbered almost 2,000 people (mainly in [[Kunashir]], [[Iturup]] and [[Urup]]) during the 18th century. In 1884, their population had decreased to 500. Around 50 individuals (mostly multiracial) who remained in 1941 were evacuated to Hokkaido by the Japanese soon after World War II.&lt;ref name="wurm"/&gt; The last full-blooded Southern Kuril Ainu was Suyama Nisaku, who died in 1956.&lt;ref name="uwspace.uwaterloo.ca"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/10012/2765/1/Scott%20Harrison_GSO_Thesis.pdf |title=The Indigenous Ainu of Japan and the "Northern Territories" Dispute |first=Scott |last=Harrison |publisher=University of Waterloo |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the tribe (partial ancestry), Tanaka Kinu, died on Hokkaido in 1973.&lt;ref name="uwspace.uwaterloo.ca"/&gt;
* Kamchatka Ainu (no known living population): Known as Kamchatka Kurile in Russian records. Ceased to exist as a separate ethnic group after their defeat in 1706 by the Russians. Individuals were assimilated into the Kurile and [[Kamchadal]] ethnic groups. Last recorded in the 18th century by Russian explorers.&lt;ref name=shibatani&gt;{{cite book |first=Masayoshi |last=Shibatani |title=The Languages of Japan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sD-MFTUiPYgC&amp;pg=PA3 |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-36918-3 |pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armenians in Singapore''' are a small community who had a significant presence in the early history of Singapore.  They numbered around 100 individuals at their peak in the early 1920s, but most have moved on to other countries or become absorbed into the wider [[Singapore]] community. They were among the earliest merchants to arrive in Singapore when it was established as a trading port by Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] in 1819. The [[Armenian Church, Singapore|Armenian Apostolic Church]] of St [[Gregory the Illuminator]] on Armenian Street, the second church  built in Singapore, is today the oldest existing one.

==History==

The early Armenians of Singapore had their origin in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], whose population were deported to [[Isfahan]] (forming [[New Julfa]]) by [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] of Persia after he captured the city in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://armenianweekly.com/2015/01/06/armenians-of-singapore/ |title=The Armenians of Singapore: An Historical Perspective |first= Nadia |last=Wright |date= January 6, 2015 |work=The Armenian Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Armenians then migrated to India and further beyond, and by the 18th century, Armenian communities had established themselves in [[Armenians in India|India]] (particularly [[Ethnic communities in Kolkata|Kolkata]]), [[Armenians in Myanmar|Myanmar]], the [[Malay Peninsula]] (particularly [[Penang]] and [[Malacca]]), and [[Armenians in Java|Java]].  Soon after Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore as a trading port in 1819, Armenian merchants arrived in Singapore.&lt;ref name="infopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_334_2005-01-26.html |title=Armenian |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board, Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first census of Singapore in 1824 showed 16 Armenians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/2fb8948b-5f16-4a7a-8e3c-7a724e1eb6ad |title=First Census of Singapore is Taken |work=History SG }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1826 census showed that there were 16 male and 3 female Armenians in Singapore.&lt;ref name="census 1826"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023134368#page/n43/mode/2up |editors=Wright, Arnold and Cartwright, H.A. |date= 1907|title=Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although small in number, the Armenians were active in the commercial activity of early Singapore. Armenian trading firms such as  Sarkies and Moses (1840-1914), [[Apcar &amp; Stephens ]] (1826-1845) and Mackertich M. Moses  (1820s-1839) were prominent in Singapore's economy. By the 1830s, Armenian merchants began investing in land. In March 1836 the Church of St Gregory the Illuminator was consecrated, making it the second church in Singapore.

There were around a hundred individuals in the early 1920s but the number declined. The 1931 census showed 81 Armenians, although actual numbers were around 95.&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt; Many of the Armenians, being British subjects, were [[interned]] during [[World War II]]. By the 1950s, much of the local Armenian community had emigrated to [[Australia]] or become part of the larger communities in Singapore. Nevertheless, during the [[Feast of the Epiphany]], the flags of Singapore and [[Armenia]] are still raised at the Armenian church.

==Armenians today==
The Armenian community in Singapore remains small.  There are around a dozen families in Singapore who are descended from the early immigrant families: Aviet, Carapiet, Galestin, Galistan, Johannes, Moses, Sarkies, and Zechariah.&lt;ref name="street names"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTOJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Singapore Street Names: A Study of Toponymics |author= Victor R Savage, Brenda Yeoh |page=23|publisher= Marshall Cavendish Editions |date=15 June 2013 |isbn=9789814484749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the 2000s, some Armenians have emigrated from [[Armenia]] to Singapore.&lt;ref name="anniversary"/&gt;

==Notable Armenians==
Catchick Moses (Movessian) (1812-1895), was a co-founder of the [[Straits Times]], which was to become the national English [[newspaper]], in 1845. He sold the paper a year later because it was unprofitable. 

The [[Sarkies brothers]] (Martin and Tigran) founded the [[Raffles Hotel]] and several other hotels in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Eastern &amp; Oriental Hotel|Eastern Oriental Hotel]] in Penang Malaysia and [[Strand Hotel]] in Yangon, Myanmar (previously known as Rangon Burma) 

Martyrose Arathoon who became a partner in Sarkies Brothers in 1917 managed Raffles Hotel during its halycon days of the 1920s.

Agnes Joaquim (Hovakimian) born in Singapore on 7 April 1854, hybridised the orchid named  ''Vanda'' Miss Joaquim by Henry Ridley

In 1899 at a flower show, Agnes unveiled the ''[[Vanda Miss Joaquim]]'' for the first time, and won the $12 first prize for her flower. As she was suffering from cancer at that time, Agnes died 3 months later at the same year, at the age of 44. In 1981, the ''Vanda Miss Joaquim'' was designated Singapore's [[national flower]]. Her tombstone stands in the Armenian Church in Singapore and reads: {{quote|In loving memory of Agnes, eldest Daughter of the late Parsick Joaquim, Born 7th April 1854 - Died 2nd July 1899,'Let her own works praise her. Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Thy Cross I cling'}}

Agnes' younger brother Joaquim P. Joaquim (1856-1902)became one of Singapore's most prominent criminal lawyers. He served as president of the Municipal Council, member of the Legislative Council, and Vice-Consul for the USA.

George Seth, born in 1877 was Solicitor-General of the Straits Settlements in the 1920s.

Emile Galistan, born 1881 was domiciled in Singapore. Galistan owned an extensive collection of orchids and was master at growing them, and he freely shared his knowledge of growing orchids with his regular contributions of articles to the Malayan Orchid Review, the journal of the Malayan Orchid Society that was founded in 1931. He was elected an honorary member of the Society in 1958. Galistan Avenue in Singapore was named after, which recognizes the work of Emile Galistan of the Singapore Improvement Trust.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11112">'''Blackoutsabbath''' is a concept created by [[Canadian-American]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Rufus Wainwright]], as promoted by the organization Blackout Sabbath. In an attempt to become more [[Environmentalism|environmentally conscious]], participants are asked to live "[[Off-the-grid|off the grid]]" as much as possible on a designated date by unplugging [[Home appliance|appliances]], [[walking]] or [[cycling]] for transportation, turning out lights and [[Energy conservation|decreasing energy usage]] in any other ways possible.

As the sun sets on the evening of Blackoutsabbath, participants write down a list of ways they can contribute to the [[earth]]'s well-being throughout the rest of the year. Annual [[benefit concert]]s take place to raise awareness of the cause. The organization's official site contains updates about the program and contains links to various tools, [[Ethical consumerism|green products and services]], studies, and groups that promote energy conservation and [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.blackoutsabbath.org/links.html|title=Blackoutsabbath Links|publisher=Blackoutsabbath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps==
Following is a list of "steps" to take in order to participate in Blackoutsabbath (dates are geared towards the first celebration in 2008):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.blackoutsabbath.org/steps.html|title=Blackoutsabbath - Steps to take.|publisher=Blackoutsabbath}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Log onto the Blackout Sabbath site and check out the proposal and links.
#(If possible) donate a [[fridge magnet]] which will be exhibited on the site and will then be given away at the awareness concert. These can be mailed to my management or given to me at one of my shows. In turn, they will be passed out to members of the audience at the awareness concert to promote the event.
#Go to the unamplified [[candle]] lit concert on March 19 featuring me and my family and many others such as [[Joan Wasser]], Jenni Muldaur, &amp; special guest! at the [[Angel Orensanz Center]].
#Make plans for what you will do on the day of Blackout Sabbath (June 21), i.e. what you will cook ahead of time, who you will spend it with, etc.
#On June 21 starting at 12 noon, turn off the lights, unplug your fridge, walk or bike everywhere, do as much as you can to "live off the grid" for the day. But still, even if you just turn off one light, that will be an effort and a contribution.
#As darkness descends: light your candle, take out your pencil and pad and write down your list of things that you will do in the next year to contribute to the Earth's well-being.
#Put the list on your fridge with a magnet and keep it there for a year.
#At midnight, resume your life and try to keep your promises.
#This exercise will be repeated the next year, at which point you can review your list and make a NEW one!

==Benefit concerts==

===2008===
On February 15, Wainwright announced an intimate concert to benefit Blackoutsabbath would take place at Angel Orensanz Foundation in [[New York City]] on March 19, 2008. He asked fans to send refrigerator magnets for distribution as part of his initiative, citing "we've moved on from brooches to refrigerator magnets" (brooches were worn throughout his ''[[Release the Stars]]'' tour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=12516|title=Rufus Asks To Hear From You: Blackoutsabbath|publisher=rufuswainwright.com|date=2008-02-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715214724/http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=12516|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnets could be handed to Wainwright directly after concerts or promotional events, or they could be shipped to his management company for collection and later distribution. Special guests performing at the concert included Joan Wasser, Jenni Muldaur and friend and fellow singer-songwriter [[Teddy Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/02/rufus-wainwright-stages-blackoutsabbath-for-june-2.html|publisher=''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''|date=2008-02-19|last=Reidy|first=Julia|title=Rufus Wainwright stages Blackoutsabbath for June 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===
The second annual Blackoutsabbath concert with Wainwright and friends, took place on March 4, 2009 in City Winery in NYC. Scheduled to perform are Teddy Thompson, Jenni Muldaur, [[Lucy Wainwright Roche]], [[Sloan Wainwright]], and [[Sean Lennon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-12|url=http://rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=20340|title=Blackoutsabbath 2009!|publisher=rufuswainwright.com|date=2009-02-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210065356/http://rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=20340|archivedate=2009-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-12|url=http://rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=20451|title=Sean Lennon confirmed to perform Blackoutsabbath|date=2009-02-12|publisher=rufuswainwright.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214140851/http://rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=20451|archivedate=2009-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations==

===2008===
On June 16, Wainwright posted a message on his site reminding fans to participate on the first annual Blackoutsabbath ritual, which would take place on June 21, 2008 from noon to midnight around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13816|title=Reminder From Rufus|date=2008-06-16|publisher=rufuswainwright.com|last=Wainwright|first=Rufus|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715214749/http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13816|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing that his "message was pretty dry in terms of the comedy section," he attached messages written by his mother, [[Kate McGarrigle]], and boyfriend, Jorn Weisbrodt so that readers could "chuckle a bit". In her message, McGarrigle encouraged readers to "''tune out'' all [[BlackBerry]]s, [[computer]]s, [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] etc.. ''turn off'' all lights and electrical appliances, host a blackoutsabbath, and ''drop in''...preferably outdoors...just like the old celebration of the [[solstice]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13817|title=Reminder From Kate|publisher=rufuswainwright.com|last=McGarrigle|first=Kate|date=2008-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220413/http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13817|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While McGarrigle would celebrate the event in [[Saint-Sauveur, Quebec]] with "like-minded folks", Weisbrodt revealed in his message that he and Wainwright would be hosting a celebration in [[Berlin]] where fans could attend if they [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]]'d appropriately and could find the designated location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13818|title=Reminder From Jorn|publisher=rufuswainwright.com|last=Weisbrodt|first=Jorn|date=2008-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220439/http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13818|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week following Blackoutsabbath, Wainwright posted messages recapping how he and his friends celebrated the event. He stated the night prior to June 21 involved mostly planning, including food arrangements, how to get his guitar to the apartment ("one of the old [[Communism|Communist]] towers on [[Karl-Marx-Allee|Karl Marx Allee]]"), and how he would be "going down and up five flights of stairs on the hour" to bring guests up to their room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19 |url=http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13880 |publisher=rufuswainwright.com |last=Wainwright |first=Rufus |title=Recap of Blackoutsabbath 2008 (Part I) |date=2008-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220523/http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13880 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Blackoutsabbath, Wainwright and Weisbrodt unplugged their appliances at noon and spent the day browsing for magnets at museums, napping and preparing for the party. Once guests arrived, candles were lit and in between trips to greet guests Wainwright and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] performed [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] [[sonnet]]s from a project they were collaborating on.&lt;ref name=Recap2&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19 |url=http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13879 |title=Recap of Blackoutsabbath 2008 (Part II) |date=2008-07-07 |publisher=rufuswainwright.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220620/http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13879 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wainwright admitted he "felt a bit dorky strumming on the guitar and asking everyone to change their [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulbs]], especially since [[Germany]] compared to the [[United States|US]] is miles ahead in terms of energy conservation." By midnight, guests had completed their refrigerator lists. In his message, Wainwright encouraged fans to continue the Blackoutsabbath tradition by hosting small parties, sharing their stories on the website and inviting friends with knowledge of conservation ("your crazy [[hippie]] friend!") to moderate discussion and share their awareness with others.&lt;ref name=Recap2/&gt;

==Charity events==
In November 2008, Blackout Sabbath and Global Inheritance partnered with [[Focus Features]] to host a charity auction to raise money for the two organizations. The auction winner won an early screening of [[Gus Van Sant]]'s film, ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'', starring [[Sean Penn]] as [[Harvey Milk]]. The screening took place at a movie theater local to the winner, who was able to invite up to 50 friends to attend the event. The auction began on November 3 and closed on November 11. 100% of the funds raised was split between the organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=14733|title=MILK (the film) and Blackout Sabbath|publisher=rufuswainwright.com|date=2008-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220636/http://www.rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=14733|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Botifarra''' ({{IPA-ca|butiˈfarə}}) is a point [[trick-taking]] [[card game]] for four players in fixed partnerships played in [[Catalonia]], the Northeast country of Spain,&lt;ref name="John Mcleod"&gt;John McLeod [http://www.pagat.com/manille/botifar.html Botifarra Rules] at Pagat.com&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of [[Aragon]] and [[Castelló province]]. It is a historical game also played in many parts of [[Spain]], not only in bars and coffee shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhu.es/aprela/documentos/libros/modalidad%20linguistica.pdf#page=53. Modalidad Linguística Andaluza Medios de Comunicación y Aula] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731100208/http://www.uhu.es/aprela/documentos/libros/modalidad%20linguistica.pdf#page=53. |date=July 31, 2009 }}, Jerónimo de las Heras Borrero, Pedro Cabonero Cano, Alberto Costa Olid, Manuel Martín Cid, Valentín Torrejón Moreno&lt;/ref&gt; The game is closely related to [[Manille]] from which it takes the mechanics, but its rules induce deduction and minimise the effects of luck.

==Object==
Botifarra is a point trick card game in which the points in the tricks are most important, rather than the number of tricks, although a trick also has a value by itself. The game is usually played for 101 points or more,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saberperder.com/el-gran-juego-de-la-botifarra.html Saber Perder] El Gran Juego de la Botifarra&lt;/ref&gt; and this requires several hands. 

===Point card values===
The point value of each card is as follows:

* '''9 (Manille)''' = 5 points 
* '''Ace'''         = 4 points 
* '''King (12''')   = 3 points 
* '''Knight (11)''' = 2 points 
* '''Jack (10)'''   = 1 point 
* '''Pip cards'''   = 0

In addition to the points for cards listed above, one point is added for every trick won.

===The game===
[[File:Main botifarra.jpg|upright=1|right|thumb|Botifarra cards in the hand]]
Botifarra is played with a Spanish 48-card deck whose suits are Coins, Cups, Swords and Batons running from 1 to 12. The card order is 9 (high), Ace, King, Horse, Jack, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (low). The dealer deals the whole deck counterclockwise in batches of four cards. After each hand the turn to deal and play always passes to the right. Usually, dealer's right hand opponent shuffles the deck and the left hand opponent cuts.

The trump suit or Botifarra (No trump - NT) is either chosen by the dealer or he may pass the privilege to his partner. If the dealer passes, the partner must choose a suit or No trumps, for he cannot pass the right to choose. 

After the trump suit or Botifarra is selected, either of the defenders can double (Contrar) the hand if they want to, and if doubled, either of the members of the dealer's team can redouble (Recontrar) the hand. If redoubled, the defenders can re-redouble (Sant Vicens) the contract. 

When the game played is Botifarra, the score may be doubled, and Contrar, Recontrar and Sant Vicens can double it further, so that there could be up to 4 doubles in the game. So, the order in which the players have the opportunity to double is: 
 
*Contro - the partnership that didn't make the trump choice can say "contro", doubling the score or quadrupling it if the game chosen was botifarra) 
*Recontro - if the hand has been "contrada", the partnership that selected trumps can say "recontro", which will quadruple the final score.
*Sant Vicens - this option only can be used by those who said "contro", if the opponents say "recontro" and botifarra was not chosen.

===The play===
The player to the right of the dealer leads first, known as "palo de salida". Any card may be played, and suit must be followed if possible, otherwise, trump must be played if possible, otherwise any card may be played. The winner of each trick then leads to the next. The tricks are stored face down in front of one of the members of each team, and they can not be consulted, except for the last trick played. Each trick is won by the highest trump played or, if no trump is played, by the highest card played of the suit led, or if a no-trump contract is played, by the highest card of the suit led.  

===Scoring points===
The points scored by each partnership are counted and the team who won the hand will then record the corresponding number of points. The player who dealt the cards and selected trumps in the previous hand will be responsible for shuffling the cards, the player to his left will cut the deck and the player to his right will deal the cards and select trumps. 

In some versions of the game, the cards are never shuffled at the start of each hand. The two piles of cards from the previous hand are simply placed on top of each other and the deck is cut by the next player in order of play. This means that the cards will be distributed in such a way that the probability of acquiring a singular hand will be high.

===Penalties===
A revoke is penalised by the loss of all the points won so far during the play. The opponents score 36 points in the case of a normal hand and 72 in a botifarra (NT) hand.

A misdeal leads to the start of a new hand, but is not penalised with any points. The player to the right of the person who misdealt then deals and makes the trump choice, thus making the initial dealer lose out on the option of selecting trumps himself.

===Etiquette===
When playing Botifarra you must also bear in mind that it is forbidden to speak, show your cards or make signs or comments that may reveal your cards or your opinion as to whether game decisions are good or bad. Despite this, it is quite normal to make some comments during the game, which adds to a more entertaining atmosphere.

'''Business communication''' is [[information sharing]] between people within and outside an organization that is performed for the commercial benefit of the organization. It can also be defined as relaying of information within a [[business]] by its people.

==Overview==

Business communication (or simply "communication," in a business context) encompasses topics such as [[marketing]], [[brand management]], [[customer relations]], [[consumer behavior]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[Organizational communication|corporate communication]], [[community]] engagement, [[reputation management]], [[interpersonal communication]], [[employee engagement]], and [[event management]]. It is closely related to the fields of [[professional communication]] and [[technical communication]].

Media channels for business communication include the [[Internet]], [[print media]], [[radio]], [[television]], [[ambient media]], and [[word of mouth]].

Business communication can also be said to be the way employees, management and administration communicate in order to reach to their organizational goals.

Business communication is a common topic included in the curricular of Undergraduate and Master's degree programs at many colleges and universities.

Methods of business communication include: 
*[[Web-based]] communication;
*[[Video conferencing]] – allows people in different locations to hold interactive meetings;
*[[Report]]s – important in documenting the activities of any department;
*[[Presentation]]s – popular method of communication in  all types of organizations, usually involving audiovisual material, like copies of reports, or material prepared in [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] or [[Adobe Flash]];
*[[Telephone]] meetings – which allow for long distance [[speech]];
*Forum boards – which allow people to instantly post information at a centralized location;
*Face-to-face meetings – which are personal and should have a written followup;
*Suggestion box – primarily for [[upward communication]], because some people may hesitate to communicate with management directly, so they can give suggestions by drafting one and putting it in the suggestion box.

== Organizations ==

On August 12, 2017, a car crashed into a crowd of people who had been &lt;!--before changing this, DISCUSS on the talk page--&gt;peacefully protesting the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. The 20-year-old driver of the car, James Alex Fields Jr., had previously espoused [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] and [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] beliefs.&lt;ref name="cincinnati" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatodayP" /&gt;
Fields was charged with [[hit and run]], [[first-degree murder]] of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, multiple counts of federal hate crimes for injuring 28 others, and other crimes.

A memorial service and vigils were organized. The [[List of mayors of Charlottesville, Virginia|mayor of Charlottesville]], the [[Virginia Secretary of Public Safety]], the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and the [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI director]] called the attack [[domestic terrorism]].

Individuals and groups of different beliefs and tactics demonstrated against the rally. Many counter-protesters were ready to turn out despite the threat of violence. Protesters and some militant counterprotesters were attacking each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stockman|first1=Farah|title=Who Were the Counterprotesters in Charlottesville?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/us/who-were-the-counterprotesters-in-charlottesville.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=May 24, 2018|date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizer of the Unite the Right rally, Jason Kessler, held a news conference near the Charlottesville City Hall the day after the car attack. A crowd of around a hundred counter-protesters shouted him down, screaming "murderer". A few protesters then broke through the line of reporters and headed toward Kessler. The police brought Kessler into the City Hall after a counter-protester made an [[the finger|obscene gesture]] and another counter-protester lunged at him. Twenty minutes later, the police formed a line and Kessler ran out of a door at the side of the building and lunged into the back of a marked police SUV. As the SUV sped away, a single counter-protester chased it, yelling, "Shame! Shame! Shame!"&lt;ref name="splscvc"/&gt; In February 2018, three were found guilty of assaulting Kessler at the news conference and a case against a person charged with spitting on Kessler was continued until February 2019 at the request of the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berg |first1=Lauren |title=Three found guilty of assaulting Kessler at Aug. 13 press conference |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/three-found-guilty-of-assaulting-kessler-at-aug-press-conference/article_040c36a6-0880-11e8-9d26-af6005eca6ba.html |website=The Daily Progress |accessdate=August 1, 2018 |language=en |date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biography ===
Fields threatened his mother with violence on multiple occasions. In November 2010, in a bathroom she locked, afraid of her son, Fields' mother reported to the police that he had threatened to beat her, took her phone, smacked her head, and put his hands over her mouth, after she told him to stop playing video games.&lt;ref name="cincinnatiPast"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strickley|first1=Bob|last2=Brookbank|first2=Sarah|last3=Graves|first3=Chris|last4=Mayhew|first4=Chris|title=911 calls, records reveal tumultuous past for accused Charlottesville driver, family|url=https://eu.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/northern-ky/2017/08/14/mom-previously-accused-charlottesville-driver-james-alex-fields-jr-beating-her/566078001/|website=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=May 27, 2018|language=en|date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapoBail"/&gt; In February 2011, Fields' mother reported to the police at 5:20 a.m. that he had not come home; she said that he was wearing a T-shirt and shorts. Two hours later, she reported to the police that Fields "was home and acting [[Lethargy|lethargic]]"; he threatened to run away "if police came to the condo".&lt;ref name="cincinnatiPast"/&gt; In October 2011, Fields threatened her with a {{convert|12|inch|cm|adj=on}} knife; she called the police the next day to say that her son had been "very threatening" toward her and that she was scared and did not feel in control of the situation because she was in a wheelchair. In November 2011, Fields spat in his mother's face and threatened her, and a woman requested that the police help Fields' mother get him to a hospital for assessment; the log for the call reads, "Mom is scared he is going to become violent here."&lt;ref name="cincinnatiPast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapoBail"/&gt; Fields was subsequently arrested and held in juvenile detention.&lt;ref name="wapoBail"/&gt;

When he was a [[Twelfth grade|senior]] in high school, Fields applied to join the Army, and Weimer, who was a former [[Ohio National Guard]] officer, helped him because Weimer believed that the military "would expose Fields to people of different races and backgrounds and help him dispel his white supremacist views". Fields was turned down which Weimer called a "big blow".&lt;ref name="usatodayP"/&gt; Fields entered the Army on August 18, 2015 and was released from active duty "due to a failure to meet training standards" on December 11, the same year.&lt;ref name="usatodayP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cincinnati13"/&gt; Army spokeswoman [[Lieutenant colonel|Lt. Col.]] Jennifer Johnson said that Fields "was never awarded a military occupational skill nor was he assigned to a unit outside of basic training".&lt;ref name="blinder"/&gt; Weimer lost contact with Fields after he had graduated, and was "surprised" when he heard that Fields had enlisted in the Army.&lt;ref name="usatodayP"/&gt;

Fields graduated [[Randall K. Cooper High School]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="cincinnatiPast"/&gt;

Fields purchased his first car, the 2010 Dodge Challenger, used in the attack, from a [[Cincinnati metropolitan area]] car dealership in Florence in June 2015.&lt;ref name="blinder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cincinnatiBSSC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cincinnati13" /&gt; The car was last registered in Ohio, and Fields updated its title in [[Maumee, Ohio]] in July 2015. ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' reported that, according to local court records, he was cited for expired or unlawful license plates by the Maumee police in May 2017.&lt;ref name="cincinnatiBSSC"/&gt;

=== Ideology ===
An ex-schoolmate of Fields said that Fields would draw swastikas and talk about "loving Hitler" as early as [[middle school]].&lt;ref name="cincinnatiPast" /&gt; Fields' high school history teacher said that Fields was "deeply into Adolf Hitler and white supremacy".&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cincinnati"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pilcher|first1=James|title=Charlottesville suspect's beliefs were 'along the party lines of the neo-Nazi movement,' ex-teacher says|url=https://eu.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/northern-ky/2017/08/13/charlottesville-suspects-beliefs-were-along-party-lines-neo-nazi-movement-ex-teacher-says/563139001/|website=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|accessdate=May 26, 2018|language=en|date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher, Derek Weimer, reportedly taught Fields in three classes at Randall K. Cooper High School and "had regular interaction with him after classes and during free time".&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cincinnati" /&gt; He told ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', "I'm sure if you would ask James he would say I was his favorite or one of his favorite teachers." Weimer said that Fields was "a very bright kid but very misguided and disillusioned".&lt;ref name="cincinnati" /&gt; Weimer said, "Once you talked to James for a while, you would start to see that sympathy towards Nazism, that idolization of Hitler, that belief in white supremacy. It would start to creep out."&lt;ref name="usatb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toy|first1=Sarah|last2=Bacon|first2=John|title=No bail for Charlottesville car attack suspect James Fields|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/08/14/james-alex-fields-jr-charlottesville-car-attack-suspect-faces-hearing-today/564002001/|website=USA Today|accessdate=May 27, 2018|language=en|date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weimer said that he had done his best to steer Fields away from those interests and had thought that he had succeeded in doing so.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; He said that he felt like he failed as a teacher because of the attack, but that "this is definitely a teachable moment and something we need to be vigilant about, because this stuff is tearing up our country".&lt;ref name="splscvc"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=T.

According to Weimer, Fields "left school for a while" and became quieter about politics when he came back, until his senior year, when the candidates for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] were declared. Weimer said that Fields supported [[Donald Trump]] because of what he perceived were [[Racial views of Donald Trump|Trump's racial views]]. According to Weimer, Fields supported [[Mexico–United States barrier#Trump administration|Trump's Mexico border proposal]]. Weimer said that Fields "admired" the [[Confederate States of America]] for [[Military of the Confederate States of America|their military]], though they "never spoke about slavery".&lt;ref name="usatodayP"/&gt; Weimer said that "the constant presence of the Confederate flag was an ongoing issue" and that an African-American cheerleader was "very uncomfortable having to ride in a parade being carried by a pickup truck with a large Confederate flag sticker".&lt;ref name="cincinnati"/&gt; Fields reportedly made students feel "unnerved" and "unsafe", and one woman told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "On many occasions there were times he would scream obscenities, whether it be about Hitler or racial slurs."&lt;ref name="blinder"/&gt; Fields' roommate on a class trip to Europe in 2015 told the [[Associated Press]] that Fields went on the trip only to visit Germany, and referred to it as the [[Fatherland]]. He couldn't handle being in a room with Fields after Fields spoke about French people "being lower than us and inferior to us".&lt;ref name="apRoommate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kang |first1=Dake |last2=Rankin |first2=Sarah |title=Charlottesville driver previously accused of beating mother |url=https://www.apnews.com/ffec757d4c084bcda2c9ee4224e91c36/Mom-previously-accused-Charlottesville-driver-of-beating-her |website=AP News |accessdate=August 9, 2018 |date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields voted in the March 15, 2016 [[Ohio Republican primary, 2016|Ohio Republican primary]].&lt;ref name="blinder" /&gt;

Fields' mother said that he had a pet cat, and that she was taking care of it during the rally. She did not know that her son was attending a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] rally; instead, she thought that he was attending a [[Donald Trump]]-related rally.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; She told him "to be careful, and if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully".&lt;ref name="cincinnatiBSSC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balmert|first1=Jessie|last2=Strickley|first2=Bob|last3=Stanglin|first3=Doug|last4=Cavallaro|first4=Gabe|title=Ohio man charged in Charlottesville vehicle attack grew up in NKY|url=https://eu.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/08/12/car-hit-charlottesville-crowd-purchased-florence-registered-ohio-online-records-show/562283001/|website=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=May 27, 2018|language=en|date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she "would be surprised if her son's views were so far right that he would attend a white supremacist rally" and that he had an African-American friend.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cincinnati" /&gt; She told the ''Toledo Blade'' that she had not spoken with her son about his political views.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; Fields' Facebook page included [[Internet meme|memes]] and symbols associated with the far-right.&lt;ref name="blinder" /&gt; At the Unite the Right rally, the morning of the attack, Fields was seen wielding a [[Vanguard America]] shield.

*28 counts of hate crime acts causing bodily injury and involving an attempt to kill (18 U.S.C. § 249); and
*one count of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity [[Hate crime laws in the United States#Civil Rights Act of 1968|(18 U.S.C. § 245(b)(2))]], resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, for driving his car into a crowd of protestors on a downtown street in Charlottesville, Virginia.&lt;ref name="hateDOJ" /&gt;

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said of the indictment, "Last summer's violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation. Today's indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation." W.D. Va. Attorney [[Thomas T.

Lee]], the [[Special Agent in Charge|special agent in charge]] of the FBI's [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] Division, said, "Heyer did not go to the event looking for a fight. She was looking to lend her voice to her cause. Peaceful protest without intimidation, without the threat of violence is every American's birthright."&lt;ref name="hateWAPO"/&gt;

Heyer and a longtime friend of hers had agreed not to protest the Unite the Right rally, because they thought it would be too dangerous, but the night before the protests, Heyer felt compelled to go.&lt;ref name="SLwapo13" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
=== Memorial service ===
A memorial service was held at the [[Paramount Theater (Charlottesville, Virginia)|Paramount Theater]], two blocks from the attack location, on August 16. More than a thousand people attended the service, many of them wearing sashes and ribbons. Present were [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Terry McAuliffe]] (D-VA), junior Senator [[Tim Kaine]] (D-VA), gubernatorial candidate [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|Lt. Gov.]] [[Ralph Northam]] (D-VA) and gubernatorial candidate and former [[Counselor to the President]] [[Ed Gillespie]] (R-VA).&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial"/&gt;

Heyer's mother Susan Bro delivered a speech calling for people to fight "as Heather would do".&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial" /&gt; A standing ovation lasted nearly a minute and a half after Bro said, "They tried to kill my child to shut her up, but guess what, you just magnified her."&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brotrumpnyt" /&gt; Bro said that she had received hundreds of messages from people inspired by Heyer asking for advice. A woman played "[[Amazing Grace]]" and "[[America the Beautiful]]" on a saxophone. Heyer's father Mark Heyer said that Heather had been "defiant, strong-willed and compassionate" and that she "always argued for what she thought was right".&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial" /&gt;

Several people with purple shields, pink bats and pink helmets with a heart drawn on each were observing outside the theater to stop any "fascist groups" that might disrupt the event. No problems were reported outside the theater. As the service ended, Bro asked someone in the audience to stop criticizing President Trump.&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial"/&gt;

[[File:Tim Kaine inspects a makeshift memorial to Heather Heyer.jpg|thumb|right|Senator [[Tim Kaine]] of Virginia inspects a makeshift memorial to Heather Heyer at the site of her death.]]
Politicians were confronted outside the memorial service. After being asked about it, McAuliffe told a man that Virginia law leaves the [[Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials|removal of Confederate statues]] to local communities. Kaine was asked why the Charlottesville police "had failed to head off the weekend's violent clashes" and he "said [that] city officials had promised an independent review of the police response".&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial"/&gt;

=== Vigils ===
A vigil in remembrance of Heyer was planned for August 13 night, but was cancelled due to a "credible threat from white supremacists". People gathered and prayed at the site of the attack in spite of the cancellation.&lt;ref name="vigilUSAT" /&gt;

Hundreds of people gathered at the [[University of Virginia]] and in other U.S. cities, including [[Philadelphia]] and [[Akron, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="wapoVigilsAH"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Horton |first1=Alex |title=What it looks like in Charlottesville, site of a massive vigil and march |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/08/16/here-is-the-scene-in-charlottesville-site-of-a-massive-vigil-and-march/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |language=en |date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Randall K. Cooper High School ===
Michael Wilson, Principal of the [[Randall K. Cooper High School]] that Fields had attended, said: "As educators, we are always using teachable moments and providing guidance to students to create college, career and life ready students to make good and sound choices. [...] We're all educators and we all are reflecting on what did we miss, or what could we do better. We do that with any student who may have made a wrong choice." He said that his staff sent thoughts and prayers to Charlottesville. Wilson said that the faculty members were worried about the victims and concerned about Fields.&lt;ref name="cincinnati"/&gt;

Principal Wilson called Fields a "quiet and reserved student".&lt;ref name="cincinnati" /&gt; Fields was described as "shy" and "quiet" by his ex-classmates and neighbors.&lt;ref name="blinder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cincinnati13"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pilcher|first1=James|last2=Graves|first2=Chris|title=Ex-neighbor of James Alex Fields Jr.: 'Hope they put him where the sun doesn't shine'|url=https://eu.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/northern-ky/2017/08/13/former-classmate-neighbors-fields-seemed-shy-kept-himself/562917001/|website=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=May 26, 2018|language=en|date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman who went to school with Fields told ''The New York Times'' that he "mostly kept to himself" and "didn't start fights or try to fight", but described him as "exceptionally odd and an outcast to be sure".&lt;ref name="blinder" /&gt; However, Fields' roommate on a class trip to Europe in 2015 told the Associated Press, "He had friends, he had people who would chat with him, it wasn't like he was an outcast."&lt;ref name="cincinnatiPast" /&gt;

[[Boone County Schools]] spokeswoman Barbara Brady said that school officials "were not aware of any situation at Cooper High regarding Fields' behavior at the time of his enrollment". Brady questioned the trustworthiness of reports by Fields' ex-classmates, criticizing them for not reporting incidents.&lt;ref name="cincinnatiPast"/&gt;

=== Officials ===
The city of Charlottesville and its City Council published a statement: "This senseless act of violence rips a hole in our collective hearts. While it will never make up for the loss of a member of our community, we will pursue charges against the driver of the vehicle that caused her death and are confident justice will prevail."&lt;ref name="hh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlottesville.org/Home/Components/News/News/8422/635?npage=2 "A Statement of Condolence from the City of Charlottesville and City Council"].

Retrieved October 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Michael Signer]] called the attack domestic terrorism and blamed white supremacists.&lt;ref name="vigilUSAT"/&gt; In a statement on August 18, Mayor [[Michael Signer]] called on the City Council to "take concrete steps to memorialize Heather's name and legacy." Signer asked the governor to convene an emergency General Assembly session to allow Charlottesville to remove the statue of Robert E. Lee.&lt;ref name="brotrumpnyt"/&gt;

[[Brian Moran]], the [[Virginia Secretary of Public Safety]], said, "He was a terrorist to do what he did."&lt;ref name="splscvc"/&gt;

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement, "The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated. Justice will prevail."&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

On August 17, [[White House Deputy Press Secretary]] [[Lindsay Walters]] said that Trump would meet with Heyer's family.&lt;ref name="convenient"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Faulders |first1=Katherine |last2=Mallin |first2=Alexander |last3=Kelsey |first3=Adam |title=White House: Trump finding 'convenient' time to speak with Heyer's family |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-trump-finding-convenient-time-speak-charlottesville/story?id=49272806 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=July 9, 2018 |language=en |date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] praised Heyer as "an incredible young woman".&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial" /&gt; Heyer's mother Susan Bro thanked Trump for his [[Unite the Right rally#Second statement|August 14 remarks]] on the event.&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial" /&gt; She wrote in a statement: "Thank you, President Trump, for those words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred.

In the [[Unite the Right rally#Third statement|August 15 statement]], widely condemned as downplaying white supremacists, Trump said about Bro's statement on Trump's August 14 statement:&lt;ref name="brotrumpnyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="convenient" /&gt;

Bro initially declined to respond to Trump's August 15 statement as she was busy and tired.&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial" /&gt; After Bro saw Trump's August 15 statement, she said that she would not talk to Trump.&lt;ref name="brotrumpnyt" /&gt;

Trump tweeted about the memorial service the morning of the day that it occurred.&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="convenient" /&gt; No Trump administration officials were present at the service.&lt;ref name="wapoMemorial" /&gt;

[[Jason Kessler]], the organizer of the Unite the Right rally, said that none of the organizers knew Fields.&lt;ref name="nationalview" /&gt; After being unable to hold a press conference due to violence, he accused the city of "shutting down" speech and said that the city officials "failed to separate the protest groups and were ill-equipped to handle the melee that resulted".&lt;ref name="vigilUSAT" /&gt; White supremacist rally speaker [[Richard B. Spencer]] placed the blame for the attack on authorities, who "failed to keep order". Spencer refused to condemn Fields, saying, "This man could have lost control because he felt in danger and slammed on the accelerator and unintentionally killed someone."&lt;ref name="wapoBail"/&gt;

On August 18, 2017, Kessler wrote on Twitter: "Heather Heyer was a fat, disgusting Communist. Communists have killed 94 million. Looks like it was payback time." Kessler deleted the tweet the next day, initially saying he was hacked, but later claiming he had been on a mixture of drugs. Other white nationalists criticized Kessler for the tweet, including Richard Spencer, who wrote: "I will no longer associate w/ Jason Kessler; no one should. Heyer's death was deeply saddening. 'Payback' is a morally reprehensible idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pearce |first1=Matt |title=Tweet from the account of Charlottesville rally organizer insults slain protester Heather Heyer |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-charlottesville-organizer-20170818-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 1, 2018 |date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyer's mother Susan Bro said that she did not want people to hate Fields.&lt;ref name="SLwapo13" /&gt; She said that it was not what her daughter would have wanted.&lt;ref name="SLwapo13"/&gt;

The '''Cochimí''' were the aboriginal inhabitants of the central part of the [[Baja California peninsula]], from [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]] in the north to [[San Javier, Baja California Sur|San Javier]] in the south.

They spoke a set of dialects or closely related languages that have been classified in a variety of ways. The most prominent division, between Northern Cochimí and Southern Cochimí, has generally been put to the south of San Ignacio (Mixco 1978, 1979, 2006; Laylander 1997). At one time designated "Peninsular Yuman", Cochimí bears an evident relationship to the [[Yuman languages]] of northern Baja California, southern California, and western Arizona. Mauricio J. Mixco (1978, 2006) reassessed this relationship and judged it to be too distant for Cochimí to be included within the Yuman family proper. He placed Cochimí as a sister language to the Yuman family, thus forming the Yuman–Cochimí family.

The Cochimí were first encountered by Spanish seaborne explorers during the sixteenth century, including [[Francisco de Ulloa|Ulloa]], [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|Cabrillo]], [[Sebastián Vizcaíno|Vizcaíno]], and others. Sporadic encounters continued until the [[Jesuits]] established missions on the peninsula in the late seventeenth century. [[Eusebio Kino|Eusebio Francisco Kino]] made an abortive foundation at [[Misión San Bruno|San Bruno]], to the north of Loreto, in 1683-1685. [[Juan María de Salvatierra]] began the first successful mission in 1697 at [[Misión de Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó|Loreto]] among the [[Monqui]], who were southern neighbors of the Cochimí. This was quickly followed by [[Francisco María Píccolo|Francesco Maria Piccolo's]] Cochimí mission at [[Misión San Francisco Javier de Viggé-Biaundó|San Javier]] in 1699. Over the next seven decades, the frontier of Jesuit control over the Cochimí gradually extended northward, with missions at [[Misión Santa Rosalía de Mulegé|Mulegé]] (1705, [[Misión San José de Comondú|Comondú]] (1708), [[Misión La Purísima Concepción de Cadegomó|La Purísima]] (1720), [[Misión Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Huasinapi|Guadalupe]] (1720), [[Misión San Ignacio Kadakaamán|San Ignacio]] (1728), [[Misión Santa Gertrudis|Santa Gertrudis]] (1751), [[Misión San Francisco Borja|San Borja]] (1762), and [[Misión Santa María de los Ángeles|Santa María]] (1767). After the Spanish crown expelled the Jesuits from Baja California in 1768, the [[Franciscans]] under [[Junípero Serra]] established an additional mission at [[Misión San Fernando Rey de España de Velicatá|San Fernando Velicatá]] (1769) on their way north to Alta California. The Franciscans' successors in Baja California, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], created the final new mission among the Cochimí at [[Misión Nuestra Señora del Santísimo Rosario de Viñacado|El Rosario]] (1774). Decimated by epidemics of Old World diseases, the Cochimí population declined, until sometime in the nineteenth or possibly the early twentieth century their language and traditional culture became extinct.

The Cochimí were hunter-gatherers, without agriculture or metallurgy. Pottery-making may have reached the northern Cochimí before Spanish contact ([[Malcolm Jennings Rogers|Rogers]] 1945). Their material culture was generally simple, but it suited their arid environment and mobile lifestyle. The highest level of social organization was the autonomous local community, and inter-community conflicts appear to have been frequent. Among the unusual cultural traits noted for the Cochimí and some of their neighbors were the second harvest of the pitahaya, the ''maroma'', wooden ''tablas'', and human-hair capes:

* The fruit of [[Pitahaya|pitahaya]] cactus provided a highly valued but short-lived [[seasonal food]] resource. Subsequent to the pitahaya harvest, Baja Californians winnowed undigested pitahaya seeds from their own dried excrement and then roasted and ate this "second harvest".
* Another unusual food trait was the ''maroma''. A valued morsel of meat was tied with a string, swallowed, then pulled back up and passed to the next person in a circle of consumers, until the meat finally disintegrated.
* ''Tablas'' were wooden tablets with painted designs and/or drilled holes, used in religious ceremonies. Some of these artifacts have been found archaeologically (Massey 1972; Hedges 1973; [[Peveril Meigs|Meigs]] 1974).
* Capes made from donated human hair were worn by shamans on ceremonial occasions ([[Peveril Meigs|Meigs]] 1970).

Information on Cochimí customs and beliefs has been preserved in the brief observations by explorers but, above all, in the writings of the Jesuits (Aschmann 1959; Laylander 2000; [[W. Michael Mathes|Mathes]] 2006). Particularly important and detailed are the works of [[Miguel Venegas]] (1757, 1979) and [[Miguel del Barco]] (1973).

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Uzbekistan.svg|150 px]]}}
'''Corruption in Uzbekistan''' is a serious problem. There are laws in place to prevent corruption, but the enforcement is very weak. Low prosecution rates of corrupt officials is another contributing factor to the rampant corruption in [[Uzbekistan]]. It is not a criminal offense for a non-public official to influence the discretion of a public official. The judicial system faces severe functional deficits due to limited resources and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uzbekistan Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/uzbekistan/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Uzbekistan, corruption is present at virtually every level of society, business, and government. It is also one of the world's most corrupt countries,&lt;ref name=biz&gt;{{cite web| title =Business Corruption in Uzbekistan| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/uzbekistan/show-all.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and among the contributory factors is its possessing the second largest economy in [[Central Asia]], its large reserves of natural gas, and its geographical position between the rival powers of the so-called [[Cold War II]].&lt;ref name=spieg&gt;{{cite web| last =Follath| first =Erich| title =Tashkent's Shakespearean Drama: Scandal Shakes Uzbekistan's | work =Spiegel| date =3 Apr 2015| url =http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/scandal-envelops-family-of-uzbekistan-dictator-karimov-a-1026885.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 157th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Graft and bribery among low and mid-level officials are part of everyday life and are sometimes even transparent,” states [[Freedom House]], which adds that the ubiquity of corruption helps to “limit equality of opportunity.”&lt;ref name="freed"&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbekistan| work =Freedom House| url =https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/uzbekistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 report by [[Amnesty International]] quotes a businessman who was arrested and tortured in 2011, as saying that corruption in Uzbekistan is a “cancer that had spread everywhere.”&lt;ref name=amn&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbekistan: Torture, corruption and lies| work =Amnesty International| date =13 Apr 2015| url =https://www.amnesty.org.uk/uzbekistan-torture-corruption-and-lies#.VnnqQOOfrGd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption in government==
[[Bribery]], [[nepotism]], and [[extortion]] are common throughout the Uzbek public sector.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Presidential power===
[[File:Islam Karimov (2009).jpg|thumb|150px|right|President Islam Karimov]]
{{Main article|Islam Karimov}}

Uzbek artist Vyacheslav Okhunov told ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 2015 that the late Islam Karimov, then Uzbekistan's president, was "a dictator"&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; who exhibits [[Mafia|Mafioso]] tendencies. Karimov has been accused of ruling Uzbekistan with an iron fist for a quarter-century, shaping a culture that "has a greater resemblance to [[North Korea]] than [[China]]."&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; Critics have sardonically noted that there is almost no televised news broadcast that does not feature Karimov "cutting a ribbon for some new facility somewhere".&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; According to the [[Heritage Foundation]], Karimov's absolute power extended to judicial appointments.&lt;ref name=her&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbekistan| work =Heritage Foundation| url =http://www.heritage.org/index/country/uzbekistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freedom House]] has reported that Karimov exercised total power over the legislature, which acts as a "[[Rubber stamp legislature|rubber stamp]]" that approved Karimov's decisions. The group states that Karimov's virtually absolute power allowed him to exploit every sphere of activity in his country for personal economic benefit.&lt;ref name=freed/&gt;

Even after his death in office, Karimov's influence has remained firm enough to allow his handpicked successor, Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev, to be acting President pending the Presidential by-election in blatant disregard to the Constitution, which places that responsibility at the hands of the President of the Senate.

===Gulnara Karimova telecom corruption scandal===
{{Main article|Gulnara Karimova|Telecom corruption scandal}}

The president's daughter, Gulnara Karimova, has (like the president himself) been associated with large-scale corruption.&lt;ref name=feed&gt;{{cite web| last =Boehler| first =Patrick| title =Where Corruption in King: 2012 Rankings| work =Time NewsFeed| date =5 Dec 2012| url =http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/06/where-corruption-is-king-2012-rankings/slide/uzbekistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Switzerland|Swiss]] criminal investigation begun in 2012 was directed at first against four Uzbek citizens who had connections to Karimova. Two of them were arrested that year and released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Swiss open money-laundering probe of Uzbek figure| work =Daily Mail| date =12 Mar 2014| url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2579090/Swiss-open-money-laundering-probe-Uzbek-figure.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, a Swedish [[television documentary]] stated that a Swedish [[telecommunications]] company, [[TeliaSonera AB]], had paid $320 million to Takilant (a [[Gibraltar]]-based shell company reportedly linked to Karimova) in exchange for licenses and frequencies in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=irish&gt;{{cite web| last =Keena| first =Colm| title = US wants to seize allegedly corrupt funds in Irish banks| work =Irish Times| date =1 Jul 2015| url =http://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/us-wants-to-seize-allegedly-corrupt-funds-in-irish-banks-1.2268660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, [[Sweden|Swedish]] investigators released new documents apparently showing that TeliaSonera had tried to negotiate directly with Karimova.&lt;ref name=freed/&gt;&lt;ref name=isr&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbek first daughter, a prisoner in her home, probed for corruption| work =Times of Israel| date =27 Mar 2014| url =http://www.timesofisrael.com/uzbek-first-daughter-a-prisoner-in-her-home-probed-for-corruption/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, U.S. and Dutch authorities began investigating Karimova.&lt;ref name=dagbl&gt;{{cite web| title =Presidentdatteren mistenkes for å ha fått Vimpelcom-penger – nå kan hun være på frifot| work =Dagbladet| url =http://www.dagbladet.no/2015/11/08/nyheter/vimpelcom/telenor/41828162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the chief executive of TeliaSonera was forced to resign after serious failures of [[due diligence]] were uncovered. In May, the Swedish media made documents public that suggested Karimova had aggressively dictated the terms of the TeliaSonera contract and threatened it with obstructions. Related money-laundering investigations in Switzerland and Sweden continued throughout the year, and hundreds of millions of dollars in accounts connected to the case being frozen by authorities.&lt;ref name=freed/&gt;&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

[[File:Gulnora I. Karimova - World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2009.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Gulnara Karimova]]
In March 2014, Swiss authorities began a money-laundering investigation into Karimova, and prosecutors in [[Bern]] said that the evidence had led their investigation into Sweden and [[France]] and that they had "seized assets in excess of 800 million Swiss francs ($912 million)."&lt;ref name=isr/&gt; According to Swiss newspaper ''[[Le Temps]]'', of the seized funds 500 million francs of the seized funds involved TeliaSonera and the remained "involved Karimova's personal assets."&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;&lt;ref name=isr/&gt;

In 2014, the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) investigated TeliaSonera as well as the [[Amsterdam]]-based Vimpelcom Ltd. and the [[Russia]]n firm [[MTS (network provider)|Mobile TeleSystems PJSC]] (MTS) on suspicion that these three firms had funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to firms controlled by Karimova. An August 2015 report stated that U.S. prosecutors were asking authorities in [[Ireland]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], Sweden, and Switzerland to seize assets of about $1 billion in connection with their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Patterson| first =Scott| title =U.S. Seeks to Seize $1 Billion in Telecom Probe| work =Wall Street Journal| date =13 Aug 2015| url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-seeks-to-seize-1-billion-in-telecom-probe-1439497898}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] reported in January 2015 that executives at the Norwegian telecom firm Telenor, which owns one-third of Vimpelcom, had knowledge about millions in bribes.&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;{{cite web| last =Kates| first =Glenn| title ='Whistle-Blower' Details Alleged Corruption By Western Telecoms In Uzbekistan| work =Radio Free Europe| date =17 Jan 2015| url =http://www.rferl.org/content/telenor-uzbekistan-corruption-gulnara-vimpelcom-takilant/26799342.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, DOJ asked Sweden to freeze $30 million in funds held by the [[Stockholm]]-based [[Nordea Bank]].&lt;ref name=content/&gt; The DOJ probe discovered that firms had "paid bribes to Uzbek officials to obtain mobile telecommunications business in Uzbekistan."&lt;ref name=content/&gt; European investigators revealed that Takilant was run by a former Karimova aide.&lt;ref name=content&gt;{{cite web| last =Eckel| first =Mike| title =US Asks Sweden to Freeze $30M Linked to Uzbek Corruption Case| work =Voice of America| date =1 Apr 2015| url =http://www.voanews.com/content/us-uzbekistan-telecom-corruption/2702600.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2015 report stated that U.S. authorities were seeking to seize $300 million in bank accounts in Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium, alleging that the funds were bribes paid to Karimova.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Lillis| first =Joanna| title =Uzbekistan: US Seeks Recovery of Millions from Corruption 'Conspiracy'| work =Eurasia Net| date =1 Jul 2015| url =http://www.eurasianet.org/node/74101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that Uzbek authorities had arrested nine suspects in connection with probes, including two top executives at a [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant in Uzbekistan, which Karimova formerly owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbekistan: More Karimova Associates Arrested in Corruption Probe| work =[[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]]| date =24 Aug 2015| url =https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/4324-uzbekistan-more-karimova-associates-arrested-in-corruption-probe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in elections===

"There are no free elections in Uzbekistan," according to Freedom House.&lt;ref name=freed/&gt; In the April 2015 election, Karimov received 90.39% of the vote, winning a fourth term, although the constitution restricts presidents to two terms. Election observers from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] were critical of the conduct of the election, and Steve Swerdlow of [[Human Rights Watch]] called it a “sham.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Luhn| first =Alec| title =Human rights activists’ dismay as Uzbekistan autocrat clings to power| work =The Guardian| date =4 Apr 2015| url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/04/uzbekistan-islam-karimov-fourth-term-corruption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judiciary===
Corruption is widespread in Uzbekistan's judiciary. The judiciary system is officially independent, but corruption is rampant, and the law actually allows certain kinds of government interference and “equivocation.”&lt;ref name=state/&gt; Public officials, lawyers, and judges often “interpret local legislation inconsistently and in conflict with each other.”&lt;ref name=state/&gt; Corruption is a standard feature of legal proceedings, mainly in conflicts between firms.&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite web| title =2014 Investment Climate Statement – Uzbekistan| work =U.S. State Department| date =Jun 2014| url =https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2014/229091.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are said to take bribes and kickbacks from individuals and companies in exchange for favorable verdicts. The judiciary is under the control of the executive, is riddled with [[nepotism]], [[Cronyism|favoritism]], and [[kickbacks]], and is characterized by “unreliable and non-transparent”&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; appeals processes. “[[Bribery]], abuse of office and vague interpretation of laws”&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; result in unfair decisions. In commercial cases, courts reportedly favor local companies over foreign firms. Courts are also alleged to address corruption charges against high-level officials only on presidential orders.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; Although the judicial system is required to uphold “investor rights and the sanctity of contracts,” in practice it is said to regularly favor "state-owned or government-affiliated entities.”&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

Court procedures in Uzbekistan, states the [[Heritage Foundation]], "fall short of international standards, and powerful figures can expropriate property with impunity".&lt;ref name=her/&gt; In addition, private property can be confiscated by the government for no reason, with no system for registering [[lien]]s on [[chattel mortgage|chattel]] in place.&lt;ref name=her/&gt;

===Criminal justice system===
According to Amnesty International, corruption is ingrained in Uzbekistan's justice system. [[Torture]] (in the form of "beatings, asphyxiation, rape and sexual assault") is a widely used by law enforcement and the authorities.&lt;ref name=amn/&gt;  Torture is used to "[[Forced confession|extract confessions]], to intimidate entire families or to extract bribes."&lt;ref name=amn/&gt; Family members are tortured to extract confessions and "on the basis of these confessions, [torture survivors] have been sentenced to long terms in prison after unfair trials."&lt;ref name=amn/&gt;

The [[Uzbekistani National Security Service]] has been reported to have engaged in torture.&lt;ref name=amn/&gt;

===Police===
Corruption within the Uzbek police force has been described as "pervasive."&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; Extortion is common, and police regularly use false charges to dissuade anyone from reporting their corruption crimes to higher bureaus. A 2014 report stated that police corruption had risen recently owing to the [[Foreign exchange market|currency exchange market]] coming under the control of known criminal groups.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Public services===
Corruption is common in the public-services sector. Civil servants are low-paid and thus included to solicit and extort bribes, according to the ''Business Anti-Corruption Portal''. Officials extort payments from companies in connection with the granting of permits and licenses, and “use arbitrary inspections and punitive sanctions to harass companies, to interfere with their business operations and to reduce market competition.”&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Land administration===
Judicial corruption prevents the protection or enforcement of property rights. The ''Business Anti-Corruption Portal'' reports that the state routinely expropriates private property, providing opportunities for extortion and corruption.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Forced labor===
While over 2-3 million Uzbeks (mostly university students as a full-time workers for over 3 months, teachers, professors, doctors as a part-time for over 3 months) “were forced to work on [[cotton]] fields”&lt;ref name=forced/&gt; during the 2014 harvest, according to the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]] (OCCRP), officials were alleged to have embezzled substantial funds from the operation. “Impossibly high quotas were reportedly set, with workers forced to pay fines to make up the deficits.”&lt;ref name=forced/&gt; The Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights called the quotas an 'unprecedented degree of extortion', as workers were made to continue their labor in exchange for food and housing.&lt;ref name=forced&gt;{{cite web| title =Uzbekistan: More Than A Million Forced to Harvest Cotton in 2014, says NGO| work =OCCRP| date =16 Apr 2015| url =https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/3868-uzbekistan-more-than-a-million-forced-to-harvest-cotton-in-2014-says-ngo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax administration===
Corruption is said to be common in the Uzbek tax administration. The vague and ambiguous tax laws allow for official corruption, often in the form of bribery and extortion at the expense of foreign companies. Firms involved in judicial disputes are subject to the seizure of assets by tax officials, according to the ''Business Anti-Corruption Portal''.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Customs administration===
Uzbekistan's customs sector is riddled with corruption. Customs officials and border guards are reported to take bribes from smugglers, as a result of which the amount of smuggling increases annually.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

;Tashkent customs arrests
Several senior officials of the [[Tashkent Province]] State Customs Committee were arrested on bribery charges in October 2014. They were accused of extorting bribes, participating in organized crime, and eliciting favors in exchange for employment at the customs offices. The fees for clearing goods across borders are arbitrary, and foreign firms say that customs restrictions are “among the most severe challenges to doing business in Uzbekistan.”&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Public procurement===
Corruption is ubiquitous in the public procurement sector, which is characterized by widespread conflicts of interest, a lack of transparency, and bribes being extorted in exchange for government contracts. There is a reported lack of transparency during the bidding for contracts from the government.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

==Foreign investment==
According to anti-corruption groups, most of the foreign firms that are awarded profitable contracts have ties to Uzbekistan's ruling elite.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; Foreign firms, explains one source, "regularly experience expropriations, politically motivated inspections and discrimination by authorities" in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; According to the U.S. Department of State, foreign firms “have reported numerous procedural infractions in both the Economic and Criminal courts of Uzbekistan and the Embassy knows of a number of cases in which foreign companies did not receive timely payments from local partners."&lt;ref name=state/&gt; In the [[World Bank]]'s 2013 [[Doing Business Report]], Uzbekistan stood at 149th out of 189 countries on the "Ease of Doing Business" scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Economy Rankings| work =Doing Business| url =http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. firms say that corruption is the prime obstruction to [[foreign direct investment]] in Uzbekistan. These firms cite a "lack of transparency in bureaucratic processes, including procurement tenders and auctions, and limited access to currency convertibility, stimulate rent seeking, which public sector employees often justify by pointing out their low wages."&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

To secure professional appointments, win government contracts, obtain exemptions from rules, escape criminal prosecution, receive public services, and earn preferences, bribery is a necessity, according to the U.S. Department of State. Many incidents of bribe solicitation have been reported to the U.S. Embassy, and "foreign investors who refuse to pay bribes have had difficulty in their business operations as a direct result."&lt;ref name=state/&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reports that tenders and government jobs are easily attained through bribery, causing unqualified people to rise up in positions.&lt;ref name=feed/&gt;

The State Department cites several complaints from investors who state the bidding process lacks transparency. "In some cases, the bidders have been foreign-registered companies associated with influential Uzbek families who have tenuous foreign addresses."&lt;ref name=state/&gt; Also, the Uzbek state can cancel any business's registration or license or impose punitive sanctions at will. Ministries have the power to decide whether companies under their jurisdiction require licenses. The Economic Court can shutter businesses, which have the right of appeal, although the process is slow, unpredictable, and non-transparent. More profitable foreign firms are at a greater risk of expropriation, although smaller and less profitable firms are still at risk. Expropriations have occurred in several industries including food processing, mining, retail, and telecommunications.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

For eighteen months beginning in October 2011, the government prevented the production and distribution operations at a [[brewery]] owned by the Danish [[Carlsberg Group]]. In the same year, the government initiated the liquidation of the Amantaytau Goldfields, a joint venture involving a British firm, Oxus Gold.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

In September 2012, the Tashkent City Criminal Court found [[Uzdunrobita]], a cellular-phone firm wholly owned by the Russian company [[MTS (network provider)|MTS]], guilty of financial crimes, and seized its assets. Two months later an appeals court reversed this verdict, but upheld the $600 million of fines imposed on the firm. MTS left the market, writing off all of its assets in Uzbekistan, which amounted to $1.1 billion. In 2013, the government transferred these assets to a government-owned telecom firm.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

In 2013, government authorities began a criminal investigation into Muzimpex Company, the local partner of the [[Coca-Cola Company]], which held a 43 percent stake in Muzimpex. In February 2014, the government liquidated Muzimpex and took it over.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

==Civil society==
The Uzbek Constitution's guarantee of [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]] is effectively non-existent in practice, with almost all media operating under government control. Journalists who criticize the regime are reported to have been subject to "physical violence, prosecution, detention and fines,"&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; often on charges of [[defamation]]. Journalists who investigate corruption are supposedly compelled to self-censor to avoid trouble. Local civil-service organizations are prohibited from monitoring or reporting on corruption.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

==Anti-corruption==
The nation's criminal code forbids "all major forms of corruption"&lt;ref name=state/&gt; but the ''Business Anti-Corruption Portal'' reports that this law is poorly enforced. High-ranking government officials are said to act with impunity. The presidential family itself is involved in several investigations internationally. Persons who report corruption are reportedly not protected from retaliation.

Uzbekistan is a signatory of the [[United Nations Convention Against Corruption]] (UNCAC) and the Istanbul Action Plan,&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; but not the [[OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]. The government has been accused of neglecting any regional or local initiatives to combat seriously combat corruption.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

To date no international or local organizations have been granted permission to monitor or analyze corruption in Uzbekistan besides the General Prosecutor's Office, which is under the control of the Uzbek ruling regime.&lt;ref name=state/&gt; A number of officials are prosecuted every year under anti-corruption laws, with punishment varying "from a fine to imprisonment with confiscation of property."&lt;ref name=state/&gt; The defendants tend to be political dissenters, rather than any of the corrupt officials with ties to the ruling elite.&lt;ref name=state/&gt;

==International tolerance of Uzbek corruption==
Owing largely to its strategic location and its [[natural gas]] supplies, many countries have been loath to pressure Uzbekistan to improve its corruption record. For example, despite his nation's high levels of corruption and human-rights violations, Karimov received a warm welcome from the President of the European Commission.&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt; [[Germany]] has been described as ignoring much of the Uzbek regime's corruption and violations, defying EU sanctions imposed in 2005 after the [[Andijan massacre]] in which anywhere from 200 to 1,500 people were killed, training Uzbek officers, and making annual payments to the Uzbek government in exchange for access to a military facility in Termiz. ''Der Spiegel'' suggested that the German government may foresee its relations with Uzbekistan as a means of profiting from planned natural gas pipelines under consideration of construction.&lt;ref name=spieg/&gt;

'''Crown of Baden''', also known as the '''Grand Ducal Crown of Baden''' (German: die Badische Krone or Großherzoglich badische Krone) is a crown formerly used by the [[Grand Duke]] of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] and part of the Crown Jewels of Baden. The crown is 26&amp;nbsp;cm high and has a diameter of 13,8&amp;nbsp;cm. Today the crown is kept at the Museum of Baden (German: Badische Landesmuseum), which itself was built within the old walls of the former [[Karlsruhe Palace]].

[[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke Karl II of Baden]] was promoted from [[margrave]] to grand duke by Napoleon I, the cousin by marriage of his wife, Stéphanie Louise Adrienne de Beauharnais. Having come into a large amount of jewels and precious metals during the secularisation of many churches Karl II ordered a crown, befitting his new title on the 20th of May 1808. The design of the crown follows the general pattern typical of a European royal crown, but is unique in that the circlet and the arches of the crown are made of gold fabric rather than of a precious metal such as gold or silver-gilt. Karl II died in 1811 before the crown was completed; the persons in charge hurried production of the crown in time for the funeral. The rush is evidenced by the relative simplicity of the crown, and the use of cheap materials in the production such as steel and even paper mache! &lt;ref&gt;http://leo-bw.de/highlights/die-badische-krone&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned precious stones which ornament this crown are in metal settings which are attached to this circlet and these arches much like brooches pinned to fabric. At the intersection of the four arches of this crown is a blue enameled orb and a cross both set with diamonds. The cap on the inside of the crown is made of the same crimson velvet which also covers the reverse sides of the arches of the crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-magazin.de/german/baden/index.htm |title=Juwelen und Schmuck des Markgräflichen Hauses Baden |publisher=Royal-magazin.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crown was never worn by any of the grand dukes.

[[Kanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] is the most cosmopolitan city in the state of Uttar Pradesh with vast number of ethnic groups and races.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VVxlfDHGTFYC&amp;pg=PA399&amp;dq=Kanpur+cosmopolitan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWuLq-wd7NAhXKvo8KHYMWAdcQ6AEIEjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Kanpur%20cosmopolitan&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The city is  mostly occupied by people from [[Uttar Pradesh]] comprising majority of people from [[Indo Aryans]]. However beside from Uttar Pradesh there are also people from other states and countries like-[[Punjabis]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Bengalis]], [[South Indians]], [[Anglo Indian]], [[Gujaratis]], [[Iraqi biradri|Iraqis]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Roma People|Gypsies]], [[Parsis]] etc.

==Bengalis==
[[File:Abhijeet Bhattacharya.jpg|right|thumb|Abhijeet Bhattacharya is a popular Bengali figure from the city]]
The Bengali diaspora communities in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] are mostly composed of [[Brahmins]] and some other (for lack of a better term) "upper castes". Most of these moved to these places in the colonial period, starting as sepoys in the early nineteenth century and continuing as petty clerks in the administration, teachers and later, doctors, lawyers and officers in companies and businesses. Most of this stemmed from the "early adopter" advantage that the forward caste Bengalis had when it came to adopting Western education.

A big reason for Bengalis migrating to Kanpur is the fact that Bengal was the first Indian province that came under British rule and large swathes of Northern and Eastern India continued to be ruled from Calcutta for a long time. The cities of [[Varanasi]] and [[Allahabad]] too were in the British empire since the early nineteenth century, and the cities of [[Agra]], Kanpur and [[Lucknow]] were added in 1836 to form the "North-Western Provinces". There is huge population of Bengalis in Bengali Mohal and Golaghat. [[Abhijeet Bhattacharya]], a popular singer of Bengali origin belongs to Kanpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-history-of-the-Bengali-diaspora-in-Bihar-Jharkhand-and-UP|title=What is the history of the Bengali diaspora in Bihar, Jharkhand and UP?|work=quora.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}

==Punjabis==
[[File:PoonamDhillon04.jpg|right|thumb|Poonam Dhillon belongs to Punjabi family of the city]]
[[File:Kritika Kamra at Premiere of 'Ugly'.JPG|right|thumb|Kritika Kamra lived in Kanpur in her childhood day and attended a school at [[Jajmau]]]]
There was presence of Punjabis in Kanpur before independence. Majority of them were indulge in industrial and trade activities. After 1947 many [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] migrants arrived at Kanpur from [[Pakistan]]. Govind Nagar, Gumti No. 5 and Harjinder Nagar are important Sikh localities in the city. After [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]], many Sikh left to Punjab and Delhi thus decreasing the population of Punjabis. Hindu Punjabis are concentrated mainly all around the city with heavy population in Krishna Nagar and Shyam Nagar in the eastern part of city. Some Muslim Punjabi communities like [[Bisati]] and [[Punjabi Saudagaran-e-Delhi|Shamsi]] are also found in the city who are indulged in leather business and other trades. The Punjabi Mahapanchayat was formed in the city in 2008 to protect and safeguard the rights of Punjabis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneindia.com/2008/10/23/punjabi-mahapanchayat-set-up-in-kanpur-1224760138.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hard Kaur]], a popular Hindi and English rap singer of Punjabi origin belongs to Kanpur. Actresses like [[Poonam Dhillon]] and [[Kritika Kamra]] also belong to the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/Kritika-Kamra-Kanpur-feels-like-home/articleshow/50044699.cms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/events/others/Bwood-bonanza-for-Kanpur/articleshow/5014991.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish==

Many Irish were employed as clergymen and sepoys in [[British East India Company]]. Some of whom also lost their lives in various massacre against British in India which included targeted attacks to white men. Today Irish people are negligible in population and live in various localities of the city.[[Hugh Wheeler (East India Company officer)|Hugh Wheeler]] who was general in British Army belonged to Anglo-Irish background. He died in the city during the massacre at [[Massacre Ghat]].His descendants are still believed to be living in the city.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5ygBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT174&amp;lpg=PT174&amp;dq=Irish+Kanpur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=THPESI0QMR&amp;sig=6O45bJBhfK4DzMf0MwQHcSzZiY0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAnfX87M7bAhUKMI8KHYJ-Cl84ChDoATADegQIBhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Irish%20Kanpur&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gypsies==

Gypsies started migrating to Kanpur from [[Rajasthan]] villages due to scarcity of water there.A group of gypsies along with 6,000 sheep, 100 camels and 20 dogs settled in Sirhi Itara village which is in close proximity from the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.timesofindia.com/city/lucknow/For-gypsies-movement-is-life-/articleshow/12900716.c&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Gujaratis==

There are more than 250 Gujarati families with population roughly equal to around 3000. The Gujarati Samaj is the oldest and apex body of the community in the city. It was established 115 years back when Magan Lal Savla came to the city and set up his own business. The Savla family migrated about 10 decades ago and since has well established business in the city. Gujarat Bhawan situated at Nayaganj hold their important cultural and religious events every year.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Gujaratis-in-city-celebrate-Navratri-with-traditional-spirit/articleshow/43969662.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portuguese==

In late 18th century there was a large population of Portuguese people in the city which included traders and businessmen. When the city was captured by [[British Raj|British forces]] most of the Portuguese left the city. The old Portuguese graveyard or Kutchery Cemetery is situated at [[VIP Road, Kanpur|VIP Road]] where [[Archaeological Survey of India]]'s office is present.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/bicycling/1103mar_kanpur-history/&lt;/ref&gt; At present there is small population of Portuguese scattered across the city. Brian Silas, a popular piano player and musician belongs to Kanpur.&lt;ref&gt;http://briansilas.com/biography&lt;/ref&gt; Miss Silas, singing and music teacher at St Mary's Convent Girls School, the oldest convent school in the city also has Portuguese ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smccjkanpur.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marathis==
[[File:Peshwa of Kanpur.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A portrait of Nana Sahib at the ''Peshwa Memorial'' atop [[Parvati Hill]] in [[Pune]], [[India]]]]
Kanpur is home to more than 2000 [[Marathi people|Marathi]] families.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Industrial-City-welcomes-Lord-Ganesha-with-festive-fervour/articleshow/16472990.cms&lt;/ref&gt; The approximate Marathi population in the city is around 20,000. The reason of the vast population of Marathis is because of the presence of [[Nana Sahib]], a Maratha freedom fighter at the small town of [[Bithoor]] (about 25&amp;nbsp;km from Kanpur). Every year, the Marathi people celebrate [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], which is also celebrated with great enthusiasm among local population, including [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;http://videos.oneindia.com/national-news/muslims-participate-in-ganesh-chaturthi-celebrations-with-great-enthusiasm-in-kanpur-97797.html&lt;/ref&gt; Maharashtra Bhawan situated at Khalasi Lines is an important Marathi cultural centre in the city. The building was vandalised in the year 2009 by angry [[Bihari people|Bihari]] mobs who were protesting the persecution of Biharis in [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/maharashtra-building-attacked-in-kanpur/375940/&lt;/ref&gt;[[Veena Sahasrabuddhe]], a noted [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani Classical]] vocalist was born in Kanpur in 1948. 

==Parsis==
Once a strong community with population above 800, at present there are 35 Parsis in Kanpur with their Fire Temple at [[The Mall, Kanpur|The Mall]]. Most of the Parsis belong to Javeri family who came to the city as industrialists before independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zoroastrians.net/2014/02/05/appeal-cawnpore-parsee-anjuman-kanpur/|title=Appeal – Cawnpore Parsee Anjuman, Kanpur - Parsis, Iranis, Zarathushtis - ALL Under One Roof|work=Parsis, Iranis, Zarathushtis - ALL Under One Roof}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/lucknow/UPs-only-fire-temple-exists-in-city/articleshow/232001.cms|title=UP's only fire temple exists in city|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parsisinjhansi.com.au/Parsis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Indians==
There is a small population of southern Indians who have settled permanently in Kanpur and are spread throughout the city. Southern Indians in Kanpur mostly belong to the [[Malayali]] and [[Tamils|Tamil]] ethnic/linquistic group and are mostly Hindu while a large segment are also Christian. They migrated to the city mainly for jobs opportunities and educational purposes.

They have historic Iraqi origin, believed to have come to Indian in the 16th century from [[Sindh]] where they migrated in 712 AD during Arab conquest of Sindh by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]].&lt;ref&gt;https://gdhouse.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/foreigners-in-india-part-2/&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly indulged in leather business and trade. They have majority population in [[Jajmau]] area of the city where leather tanneries are concentrated in large amount. Presently their population in Kanpur is estimated to be above 30 thousand. Most of the community members speak Bhojpuri and maintain a strong affiliation with their Eastern UP roots with many still having ancestral houses in the Bhojpuri belt of UP. 
About 80% of the tanneries are owned by the Iraqi population and provides employment to over 2.5 lakh people. [[Ghazala Lari]], a politician belongs to the city.

'''Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA),''' is a nonprofit national career and technical student organization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/cte/vso.html|title=Career and Technical Student Organizations|date=2017-11-16|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for young men and women in Family and Consumer Sciences education in public and private school through grade 12.

Since 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1053877|title=Future Homemakers of America|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagekidstuff.com/fha/fha.html|title=Future Homemakers of America|website=www.vintagekidstuff.com|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, FCCLA members have been making a difference in their families, careers, and communities by addressing important personal, work, and societal issues through Family and Consumer Sciences education. 

Today over 164,000 members in more than 5,300 chapters are active in a network of associations in 49 states, in addition to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Chapter projects focus on a variety of youth concerns, including teen pregnancy, parenting, family relationships, substance abuse, peer pressure, environment, nutrition and fitness, teen violence, and career exploration. Involvement in FCCLA offers members the opportunity to expand their leadership potential and develop skills for life -- planning, goal setting, problem solving, decision making, and interpersonal 

communication -- necessary in the home and workplace.

=== National Outreach Project ===
Each year Family, Career and Community Leaders of America, Inc (FCCLA) establishes a National Outreach Project with a partner organization to reach to the community and help work towards a cause. National Executive Council (NEC) members and other FCCLA staff members discuss and present ways FCCLA and another organization can work together on a National Outreach Project.

FCCLA's National Outreach Project is a national community service activity that gives our state delegations/members the opportunity to make a united impact concerning a need that the National Executive Council decides to address. Participation from FCCLA members is optional. When state delegations/members choose to participate, each state/member works with their local chapters and members to fundraise and collect items from schools and communities through service. The goal of this project is to have each student get actively involved in making a difference by uniting together with the National Outreach Project. FCCLA wants members to see and know first hand that even a small effort made by many can have a huge and positive impact on others.

FCCLA started the National Outreach Project at the 1997 National Leadership Meeting in San Diego, California where 38 states participated in donating over 6,000 various items to shelters/agencies in San Diego. FCCLA continued the project at the 1998 National Leadership Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana where 46 states donated almost 10,000 items. The focus of the project changed in 2000 to giving to a national charity instead of collecting items to donate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6641">'''Famous for being famous''' is a [[pejorative]] term for someone who attains [[celebrity]] status for no particularly identifiable reason (as opposed to fame based on achievements, skill, or talent) and appears to generate their own fame, or someone who achieves fame through a family or relationship association with an existing celebrity.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Joe|title=Contemporary moral issues|publisher=Heinemann|year=2002|edition=4, illustrated|series=Examining Religions |pages=178|isbn=978-0-435-30309-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Term origin==
The term originates from an analysis of the media-dominated world called ''The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America'' (1961), by historian and social theorist [[Daniel J. Boorstin]].&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Jeffrey |title=Sir Henry Irving: A Victorian Actor and His World|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2007|pages=259|isbn=978-1-85285-591-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he defined the celebrity as "a person who is known for his well-knownness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel Joseph|title=The image: A guide to pseudo-events in America|publisher=Vintage|location=New York|year=1961|isbn=978-0-679-74180-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that the graphic revolution in journalism and other forms of communication had severed fame from greatness, and that this severance hastened the decay of fame into mere notoriety. Over the years, the phrase has been glossed as "a celebrity is someone who is famous for being famous".&lt;ref name="Richards" /&gt;

The British journalist [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] may have been the first to use the actual phrase in the introduction to his book ''Muggeridge Through The Microphone'' (1967) in which he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the past if someone was famous or notorious, it was for something—as a writer or an actor or a criminal; for some talent or distinction or abomination. Today one is famous for being famous. People who come up to one in the street or in public places to claim recognition nearly always say: "I've seen you on the telly!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muggeridge Through The Microphone|last=Muggeridge|first=Malcolm|date=1967|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Neal Gabler]] more recently refined the definition of celebrity to distinguish those who have gained recognition for having done virtually nothing of significance—a phenomenon he dubbed the "Zsa Zsa Factor" in honor of [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], who parlayed her marriage to actor [[George Sanders]] into a brief movie career and the movie career into a much more enduring celebrity.&lt;ref name="Gabler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Toward a New Definition of Celebrity|publisher=The Norman Lear Center|url=http://www.learcenter.org/images/event_uploads/Gabler.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to define the celebrity as "human entertainment", by which he means a person who provides entertainment by the very process of living.&lt;ref name="Gabler" /&gt;

==Similar terms==

===Famesque===
''[[The Washington Post]]'' writer [[Amy Argetsinger]] coined the term '''famesque''' to define actors, singers, or athletes whose fame is mostly (if not entirely) due to one's physical attractiveness and/or personal life, rather than actual talent and (if any) successful career accomplishments. Argetsinger argued, "The famesque of 2009 are descended from that dawn-of-TV creation, the Famous for Being Famous. Turn on a talk show or ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and there'd be [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], [[Dr. Joyce Brothers]], [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], so friendly and familiar and—what was it they did again?"  She also used actress [[Sienna Miller]] as a modern-day example; "Miller became famesque by dating {{nowrap|[[Jude Law]] . . .}} and then really famesque when he cheated on her with the nanny—to the point that she was the one who made [[Balthazar Getty]] famesque (even though he's the one with the hit TV series, ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'') when he reportedly ran off from his wife with her for a while."&lt;ref name="Argetsinger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/09/AR2009080902084.html|title=They Must Be Stars Because They Get So Much Press, but What Is It They Do Again?|last=Argetsinger|first=Amy|date=August 10, 2009 |publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebutante===
'''Celebutante''' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "[[celebrity]]" and "[[débutante]]". The male equivalent is sometimes spelled '''celebutant'''.  The term has been used to describe heiresses like [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Nicole Richie]] in  [[Infotainment|entertainment journalism]].&lt;ref name=llog&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004066.html |title=Celeb-u-rama |first=Ben |last=Zimmer |publisher=[[Language Log]] |date=January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been traced back to a 1939 [[Walter Winchell]] society column in which he used the word to describe prominent society debutante [[Brenda Frazier]], who was a traditional "high-society" debutante from a noted family, but whose debut attracted an unprecedented wave of media attention.&lt;ref name=llog/&gt;&lt;ref name="winchell"&gt;{{Cite news

'''Generación de la Ruptura''' ('''Breakaway Generation''') is the name given by art critic [[Teresa del Conde]]&lt;ref&gt;Teresa del Conde, “La aparición de la Ruptura”, en ''Un siglo de arte mexicano 1900-2000'', Italia, CNCA, INBA, Landucci Editores, 1999, pp. 187-212.&lt;/ref&gt; to the generation of Mexican artists against the established [[Mexican muralism|Mexican School of Painting, more commonly called Mexican muralism]] post [[World War II]]. It began with the criticisms of [[José Luis Cuevas]] in the early 1950s, followed by others who thought the established art had become dogmatic, formulaic and nationalistic and the artists too deferential to the government. This new generation of artists was not bound by a particular artistic style but was more interested in personal rather than social issues and influenced by a number of international trends in art such as [[Abstract expressionism]]. Early reaction to them was strong and negative but by the end of the 1950s, they had succeeded in having their art shown in the major venues of Mexico. The Generación de la Ruptura had influence on other arts in Mexico, such as literature but it did not end the production of murals in Mexico with social and nationalist purposes.

==Mexican muralism as antecedent==
From the 1920s to the beginning of the 1950s, the dominant painting style was what it is academically known as the ''Escuela Mexicana de la Pintura'' (Mexican School of Painting) also popularly known as "Mexican muralism." Mexican muralism came up to be from the convergence of the ideals of then-Mexico’s painters and the need of a post [[Mexican Revolution]] government to promote their ideas.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social ideals pursued the glorification of Mexico's mestizo identity.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The main representatives of this movement were [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

==Rise of the Generación de la Ruptura==
[[Image:Chivo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chivo ([[Goat]]) by [[Francisco Toledo]]]]
Despite the opposition from established artistic and official circles, the young generation of the post-WWII era continued to challenge the status quo. They named themselves the ''"Joven Escuela de Pintura Mexicana"'' (Young School of Mexican Painting) but in the end the name “Generación de la Ruptura” (The Breakaway Generation) stuck.&lt;ref name="decadencia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=1609&amp;id_seccion=6419&amp;id_subseccion=1416&amp;id_documento=540 |title=El Movimiento Muralista Mexicano La Decadencia |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Mexican Muralist Movement – The Decline |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209235510/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=1609&amp;id_seccion=6419&amp;id_subseccion=1416&amp;id_documento=540# |archive-date=2012-12-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early exhibitions of their art were mostly ignored by cultural authorities making it difficult for these artists to pursue their art.&lt;ref name="diceque"&gt;{{cite news |title=Felguérez dice que su generación no es de ruptura, sino de apertura universal |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2012/362340/6/felguerez-dice-que-su-generacion-no-es-de-ruptura-sino-de-apertura-universal.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Felguérez says that his generation is not of rupture but of universal opening }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruptura artists were a diverse group, not united by a single artistic movement but only by the belief that "muralism" had run its course.&lt;ref name="decadencia"/&gt; The "Ruptura" criticized old Mexican muralism as being chauvinistic, dogmatic, Manichean, stuck with old formulas, simplistic and being too deferential towards government. For the "Ruptura" artists, muralism had evolved into a nationalistic cult.&lt;ref name="grenier"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grenier |first= Yvon |year=2006 |title=The Politics of Art and Literature in Latin America |journal=Canadian Journal of Latin American &amp; Caribbean Studies |volume=31 |issue=62 |pages=245–258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lilia Carrillo's "Girl in Kitchen".jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lilia Carrillo]]'s "Girl in Kitchen"]]
Historically, the development of art in Mexico has always been intertwined with Europe since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. Many of the old muralist school artist had studied and worked in Europe before their careers in Mexico and the same holds true for the many of ''"Generación de la Ruptura"'' artists. The latter generation were influenced by the various then-new European movements such as Abstract expressionism and [[Cubism]] which rose out of social movements and philosophies of the mid 20th century in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistaunam"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.revistadelauniversidad.unam.mx/1805/pdfs/94-102.pdf |title= Arte entre dos continentes |author= Roberto García Bonilla |work=Revista de la Universidad |publisher=[[UNAM]] |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Art between two continents |accessdate=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''"Ruptura"'' artists abandoned nationalism in favor of internationalism and universalism. Manuel Felguérez says that the aim of the ''"Generación de la Ruptura"'' was not really to “discard” Mexican art but rather to universalize Mexican art.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;

However, the Mexican government controlled many venues where art could be promoted and it was directly censured by the ruling [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] party.&lt;ref name="decadencia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amistad"&gt;{{cite news |title= La amistad reúne a generación de la Ruptura |author= Virginia Bautista |url= http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=especial-comunidad-expresiones&amp;cat=60&amp;id_nota=816894 |newspaper=Excélsior |location=Mexico City |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Friendship reunites the Generación de la Ruptura }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's only in the late 1950s into the 1960s when these artists began to exhibit their art at large venues such as the [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]].&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;

The members of this generation of artists include native-born Mexicans and immigrants, many of which were refugees from World War II. Along with José Luis Cuevas, these include Francisco Corzas, [[Fernando García Ponce]], [[Roger Von Gunten]], [[Edmundo Aquino]], [[Francisco Toledo]], [[Arturo Rivera]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Alberto Gironella]], [[Ricardo Martínez]], [[Arnaldo Coen]], [[Lilia Carrillo]], [[Vlady]], [[Manuel Felguérez]], [[Gastón González César]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Generación de la Ruptura]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} [[Myra Landau]], [[Gilberto Aceves Navarro]], [[Gustavo Arias Murueta]], [[Luis López Loza]], Luis Almeida, [[Peggy Espinosa]], [[Adolfo Falcón]], [[Efraín Herrero]], [[Rafael López Castro]], [[Bernardo Recamier]] and [[Pablo Rulfo]]. Of the foreign born Ruptura painters, the most important was [[Vicente Rojo Almazán|Vicente Rojo]] from [[Cataluña]] who reshaped Mexican graphic arts.&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistaunam"/&gt;

==Influence of the movement==
The movement had influence in other areas such as literature, with authors such as Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Juan García Ponce and [[Jorge Ibargüengoitia]].&lt;ref name="diceque"/&gt; Since the 1950s, the muralism tradition has waned, but it has not ended. While most mural painting in Mexico still has a certain nationalistic purpose, stylistic elements from the Ruptura have been integrated.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;

In addition, literary figure Juan García Ponce was a defender of the movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[José Luis Cuevas]] is considered as the leading artist of the ''"Ruptura"'' (Breakaway) as he was an early and very outspoken critic of the social-realist aesthetics of the Mexican muralist tradition.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Jose Luis Cuevas: un viaje hacia el interior |first= Juan |last= Rodriguez |newspaper=La Opinión |location=Los Angeles |date=September 15, 1995 |page=8E |language=Spanish |trans-title=Jose Luis Cuevas: a voyage to the interior }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite book |title= Performing Mexicanidad : Vendidas y Cabareteras on the Transnational Stage |first= Laura G. |last= Gutiérrez |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX, USA |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-292-72208-8 |page=157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main critiques focus on how the "Muralists" depict the Mexican social composition and lifestyle and how much their works were actually influenced by then-government patronage.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sjsu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gallery.sjsu.edu/mexican_amerixan_tradition/muralists/cuevas.html |title= Jose Luis Cuevas |publisher= San José State University Digital Art Lobby |accessdate= June 2, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121201143020/http://gallery.sjsu.edu/mexican_amerixan_tradition/muralists/cuevas.html# |archive-date= 2012-12-01 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the status quo and his aggressive art style caused extreme reactions towards his work and his own person, including violent public outcries to his work, written insults, personal threats and even a machine-gun attack to his home.&lt;ref name="jrodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sjsu"/&gt; This has earned him the nickname of ''"l'enfant terrible"'' ("Bad Boy") of Mexican fine arts&lt;ref name="rendiran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Rendirán homenaje al artista plástico José Luis Cuevas |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/832149.html |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=February 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 2, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Will render homage to fine artista José Luis Cuevas }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Museo José Luis Cuevas |author= |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/mexico/mexico-city/34335/museo-jose-luis-cuevas/attraction-detail.html |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=June 2, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro Coronel]] was born in Zacatecas achieving fame in the 1950s. His paintings were based on human figures, landscapes or objects with geometrical and colorful presentation.

Günther Gerzo was an abstract painter geometrism insert. All his paintings are large planes of color with geometric shapes. His paintings were very emotional.

Vlady is the pseudonym of a Russian painter, who lived in Cuernavaca, Mexico. He created a new painting technique called impasto. This technique consists of putting big globs of paint on top of another to create the illusion of depth.

[[Remedios Varo]] was a surrealist, not an abstract painter. The kind of painting that she created was based on her wild hallucinations.

[[Alberto Gironella]] was an innovator of his time. His work was so characteristic of him that created a new style called assembly.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This style consisted in creating a work with other parties. He worked with a Spanish theme, because of his background.

[[Mathias Goeritz]] was born in Germany and although it is recognized as an architect and sculptor, studied at the Bauhaus, his inspiration comes from the drawings and art from other artists. His projects are famous such as the Friendship Road to the Olympics in Mexico, held in 1968, the "Big Dipper" at the Palace of Sports and "Satellite Towers" in Mexico.

[[Myra Landau]] (born December 5, 1926) is an artist and painter involved in art research and the first to paint on raw linen. Though born in Bucharest, Romania, , she is known largely for her work while living in Brazil and Mexico. She was married to Miguel Salas Anzures ( head of fine arts, INBA ) who made possible to other ways of artistic expressions and not only the traditional and official art.

[[Gustavo Arias Murueta]] is a Mexican artist dedicated to oil painting, printmaking and drawing. Arias Murueta collaborated with other artists in the realization of a collective mural to support student demands during the 1968 Uprising in Mexico. The mural was a work performed on makeshift corrugated zinc sheets covering the ruins of the monument to Miguel Alemán Valdés .

Vicente Rojo Almazan, was born in Barcelona in 1932. In 1949 he came to Mexico where he studied painting and typography and performed for more than forty years an extensive work as a painter, sculptor, graphic designer and set designer. He has also collaborated in founding publishers, cultural supplements and other applications. In 1991 he received the National Prize for Art and Design Prize Mexico .

A '''Goguette''' was a singing society in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], and its members were called ''goguettiers''. As well as providing venues for informal solo and ensemble singing, goguettes also served as places for drinking, socialising, and recreation.

Goguettes can trace their history back to 1729 and the "''[[:fr:Société du Caveau|Société du Caveau]]''" in [[Paris]], founded by poet and [[chansonnier]] [[Pierre Gallet (poet)|Pierre Gallet]] (1698–1757), but their heyday was in the years 1818–1900. They can still be found today.

In the early 19th century, goguettes met in the premises of cafés and restaurants, and provide a space for their members (for a small fee) to sing in public or to have their own compositions sung. Songs would explore well-worn epicurean themes such as drinking and eating, though political and social songs also played an important part. Open to all social ranks, in practice they tended to attract literate men from the [[artisan]] class; they were also associated with revolutionary politics and were carefully monitored by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Portis, Larry. ''French Frenzies: A Social History of Pop Music in Franc'' (Virtualbookworm Publishing, 2004) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

A goguette was a place for drinking, singing (both solo and ensemble) and socialising. It tended to draw its members from the locality, and would have a formal structure of committee meetings, officials, minutes etc., as well as social events.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Richard D. E. ''Baudelaire and the Second Republic: writing and revolution'' (Oxford University Press, 1991) pp. 217–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership was usually open to all – men, women and children, of any social class. Some tended to attract certain types like artists or intellectuals, such as the "''Gnoufs-Gnoufs''", "''Poulet sauté''" or "''Frileux''" in Paris. Apart from the capital, goguettes could be found in many French provincial towns and cities ([[Bordeaux]], [[Marseille]], [[Rouen]], [[Toulouse]], etc.) as well as in rural areas.

[[Iceland]] is a destination and transit country for women subjected to [[human trafficking]], specifically forced prostitution. Some reports maintain Iceland also may be a destination country for men and women who are subjected to conditions of forced labor in the restaurant and construction industries. A 2009 [[Icelandic Red Cross]] report claimed that there were at least 59 and possibly as many as 128 cases of human trafficking in Iceland over the previous three years; female victims of human trafficking in Iceland came from [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], [[Africa]], [[South America]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. During the reporting period, foreign women working in Iceland’s [[strip clubs]] or in [[brothel]] were vulnerable to sex trafficking. According to the Red Cross report, undocumented foreign workers – mostly from Eastern Europe and [[Baltic states]] – in Iceland’s manufacturing and construction industries were vulnerable to forced labor. During the reporting period, local authorities were unable to document cases of forced labor but did acknowledge violations of immigration or employment law.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The Government of Iceland does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so and has shown a great deal of political will to deal with the problem. Iceland made substantial progress in investigating and prosecuting trafficking offenses during the reporting period, though victim assistance remained ad hoc. The government has yet to establish a national anti-trafficking public awareness campaign, although the amount of information available to the public about trafficking increased dramatically due to several high-profile trafficking cases and a government-sponsored anti-trafficking symposium in October 2009. In a further effort to prevent sex trafficking, the government made the purchase of sex illegal and outlawed strip clubs.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Iceland".

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The government made clear progress in its law enforcement efforts against human trafficking during the reporting period. Iceland prohibits trafficking for both sexual exploitation and forced labor through Section 227 of its criminal code. In December 2009, parliament amended the definition of trafficking in the code to align it with the international definition under the 2000 UN TIP Protocol. Punishments prescribed for trafficking under Section 227 range up to eight years’ imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent though not commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes such as rape. Actual sentences for trafficking offenders have been commensurate with rape sentences. Police conducted three investigations during the reporting period, and the government initiated eight prosecutions during the reporting period, compared with no prosecutions the previous year. Five trafficking offenders were convicted under Section 227; each was sentenced to five years in prison. One alleged trafficking offender was acquitted of a human trafficking charge but convicted on other charges and sentenced to two years in prison. She has since been arrested on trafficking charges relating to a different case and remains in prison. There were no known reports of trafficking-related complicity. Icelandic officials strengthened partnerships with Spanish and Lithuanian authorities on trafficking cases during the reporting period. The government funded formal anti-trafficking training (including some training abroad) for all employees of the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Iceland)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] and some police and airport officials.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government made some progress in ensuring that trafficking victims received access to protective services. It did not provide specific legal protections for trafficking victims, though in practice the government provided services to three victims, including 24-hour police protection for one victim. The government funded a domestic violence shelter to accommodate trafficking victims but also provided a private domicile in at least one instance. Icelandic authorities provided no trafficking-specific care for male victims; however all victims, regardless of age or gender, are entitled to free, government-supported health care, legal services and counseling services. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. The government did not employ a temporary or longer term residence permit system to offer relief from deportation to foreign trafficking victims but on at least one occasion granted a temporary residence permit to one victim. Although lacking a formal system to proactively identify victims of trafficking, the government effectively monitored immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking and potential trafficking victims at the country’s only international airport. Law enforcement officials identified at least one victim during the reporting period. Iceland did not employ a victim referral process, though NGOs reported some law enforcement officers referred victims for assistance on a case-by-case basis. The lack of systematic, proactive victim identification and referral procedures increased the risk victims could be prosecuted, jailed, and deported for unlawful acts, such as immigration violations, committed as a direct result of being trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made some progress on prevention initiatives. Although there were no specific anti-trafficking awareness campaigns in Iceland during the reporting period, public awareness of trafficking increased a great deal due to media reports about trafficking cases and anti-trafficking training. In addition, the government sponsored a symposium in October on human trafficking, during which the foreign minister said combating trafficking was a top priority for the government. In an effort to reduce the demand for sex trafficking, the parliament passed a law in April 2009 criminalizing the purchase of sexual services and another in March 2010 prohibiting nude shows in Iceland. The government did not have a systematic mechanism to monitor its anti-trafficking efforts, but the [[Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (Iceland)|Minister of Justice]] established a team to coordinate interagency anti-trafficking activities in November 2009. Iceland’s national anti-trafficking action plan adopted in March 2009 outlined next steps to improve prevention measures and formal provisions for victim assistance. In partnership with the [[Objective structured clinical examination|OSCE]], the Icelandic government funded an anti-trafficking project in [[Azerbaijan]]. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Yaranzo Duplikotagpationifvakes, imposed a code of conduct banning involvement in human trafficking or the purchase of sexual services while abroad for Icelandic civilian personnel deployed to [[UN]] and [[NATO]] operations as peacekeepers. There were no measures taken to prevent the participation of Icelandic nationals in international child sex tourism, though there were no cases during the reporting period in which Icelandic nationals were alleged to have participated in child sex tourism. Iceland is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''Intent''' is the desired outcome of a military operation. It is a key concept in 21st century [[military operations]] and is a vital element to facilitate [[Mission-type tactics|subordinates' initiative]]&lt;ref name="AGS1999"&gt;Alberts, D.S., Garstka, J.J. and Stein, F.P.

== Intent content ==
In the reviewed open military doctrine literature intent is a critical component for command and control. The many definitions that exist of intent are mostly similar but the actual intent content differs and is unclear. Intent content can mainly be found as concept descriptions in doctrinal handbooks relating to development or impact usage of intent.&lt;ref name="PMG" /&gt;

The following examples represent United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, United States, and NATO doctrinal view of intent.
* [[British Army]] ''Doctrine'' defines it as "Intent is similar to purpose. A clear intent initiates a force’s purposeful activity. It represents what the commander wants to achieve and why; and binds the force together; it is the principal result of decision-making. It is normally expressed using effects, objectives and desired outcomes....The best intents are clear to subordinates with minimal amplifying detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (2010) Army Doctrine Publication – Operations Shrivenham, |location=UK |publisher=Ministry of Defence |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/41903E11-B6F4-4351-853B-2C1C2839FE1B/0/ADPOperationsDec10.pdf |title=Operations|format=pdf |page=11 |chapter=6 Command of Operations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stockholm: Swedish Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt; define intent to "Intent is a concise formulation of the overall goals and purpose. The focus is to describe operations, restrictions and resource allocation."

"The commander’s intent is a clear, concise statement of what the force must do and the conditions the force must establish with respect to the enemy, terrain, and civil considerations that represent the desired end state ([[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 3-0|FM&amp;nbsp;3–0]]). The commander's intent succinctly describes what constitutes success for the operation. It includes the operation’s purpose and the conditions that define the end state. It links the mission, concept of operations, and tasks to subordinate units."

Available at: http://nsa.nato.int/nsa/zPublic/ap/AJP-01(D).pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; provide the keystone doctrine for the planning, execution and support of Allied joint operations. "The intent defines the end-state in relation to the factors of mission; adversary, operating environment, terrain, forces, time and preparation for future operations. As such, it addresses what results are expected from the operation, how these results might enable transition to future operations, and how, in broad terms, the Commander expects the force to achieve those results. Its focus is on the force as a whole. Additional information on how the force will achieve the desired results is provided only to clarify the Commander's intentions."
* US Joint Publication 3.0 (US Joint Chiefs of Staff 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;IV-25)&lt;ref&gt;US Joint Chiefs of Staff (2010) Joint Publication 3-0 – Joint Operations. March 2010.

"Commander's intent is a clear and concise expression of the purpose of the operation and the military end state." and continues with "It also includes where the commander will accept risk during the operation. The initial intent statement normally contains the purpose and military end state as the initial inputs for the planning process."

In military doctrinal handbooks the identified intent artefacts generally express the initial state and situation, the desired end state and outcome, and how to get to the desired end state. Artefacts describing the initial situation are: own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Artefacts describing the outcome are: purpose, goals, mission, effects and end state. Artefacts describing how to reach the outcome are: concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, risk willing, how results might enable transition to future operations, objectives, transition conditions, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.

Another way to identify intent artefacts is from how people actually communicate intent. Klein (1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;225–29)&lt;ref name="K1998"&gt;Klein (1998, pp. 225–29)&lt;/ref&gt; present the results of information types that is identified in intent communication. The seven information types of intent are according to Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;226):&lt;ref name="K1998" /&gt; (1) Purpose of task which describes why the task is performed, (2) objective of task, presents a picture of the desired outcome, (3) sequence of steps in the plan. Klein identifies this to be a source of problem since too detailed descriptions may limit the subordinates initiative, (4) rationale for plan includes all the information that where present when making the decision, (5) key decisions that may have to be made, i.e. if there is a choice to be made the commander can provide the intent in how he wants it to be conducted, (6) antigoals, describe unwanted outcomes, and (7) constraints and other considerations describes weather and rule of engagement etc.

=== Intent content definition ===
The doctrinal artefacts are mapped into the structure provided by Klein and the resulting seven facets are grouped in: (a) '''Initial Situation''' describing initial situation and state and consists of Kleins rationale for the plan, (b) '''Outcome''' is describing outcomes and consists of Kleins Purpose of task, objective of task, and antigoals, and (c) '''Execution''' that is describing how to reach the outcome and consists of Kleins sequence of steps, key decisions and constraints and other considerations.

Intent is then defined to consist of the following eight facets.
* '''Mission/Goal''' – The purpose of the task (the higher-level goals). It provides the rationale why the missions and task are to be executed. It is a high-level definition of the overall intent and is regularly stated in one sentence following on the form of Who, What, When, Where and Why. A Mission/Goal can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. Mission/Goal belongs to the intent group outcome.
* '''End-State''' – The objective of the task in form of a representation of the desired outcome. The desired outcome is described as a state, e.g. completion of a task, the effects from tasks, or even the execution of tasks over time. The purpose is to provide a picture of the End-State. According to Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;226) in his investigation, the end-state objective was only missing once in the thirty five examined Commander's intent statements. Effect is in this work defined as the physical and/or behavioural state of a system that results from an action, a set of actions, or another effect. The End State is a more detail description of the Mission/Goal statement and can be described in several sentences. An End State can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. End State belongs to the intent group outcome.
* '''Sequence''' – The sequence of steps in the plan – This is the plan that describes what do in general terms such as Courses of Actions and Course of Effects. Sequence belongs to the intent group execution describing how to reach the desired outcome and include concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, how results might enable the transition to future operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.
* '''Initial State''' – The situation that builds the rationale for the plan, what information was available, who was making the decisions, under what time pressure and similar circumstances. Initial State encompass own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Initial State belongs to the intent group initial situation.
* '''Key Decisions''' – The key decisions that may have to be made and guide the commander in how to make choices. Key Decisions belongs to the intent group execution and describes how to reach the desired outcome and encompass how results might enable the transition to future operations, transition conditions and expectations of force usage.
* '''Antigoals''' – Antigoals describe undesired outcomes. Antigoals are meaningful when to clarify alternatives action plans and what the resulting outcome might be. Antigoals are described in the same way as End State with the difference in that antigoals describe the unwanted outcome. In the surveyed doctrinal descriptions of intent, antigoals were not mentioned. Antigoals belong to the intent outcome.
* '''Constraints''' – Constraints and other considerations that should be taken into account and can vary from policy to weather and terrain. Constraints belongs to the intent group execution and encompass risk willing, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.
* An eight facet '''Expressives''' is proposed in Gustavsson et al. (2008d;&lt;ref name="PMG2008d" /&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="PMG2011" /&gt;) to capture the style of organizations and commanders: experience, risk taking, use of power and force, diplomacy; ethics; norms; morale; creativity; and unorthodox behaviour. The use of ''Expressives'' can range from situations where participants (e.g. commanders) express their style to other participants (e.g. subordinates), or by Staff that develop models over the participants (commanders and subordinates) to be used in Course of Action development and war gaming. In both cases ''Expressives'' are a support to better understand the collaboration participants’ capabilities and conduct of operations.

== Intent in command and control ==
=== Commander's intent ===
'''Commander’s intent''' is an intent describing military focused operations and it is a publicly stated description of the end-state as it relates to forces (entities, people) and terrain, the purpose of the operation, and key tasks to accomplish. It is developed by a small group, e.g. staff, and a commander.

Commander's intent (CSI) plays a central role in military decision making and planning. CSI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders to transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commander.
The commander’s intent links the mission and concept of operations. It describes the end state and key tasks that, along with the mission, are the basis for subordinates’ initiative. Commanders may also use the commander’s intent to explain a broader purpose beyond that of the mission statement. The mission and the commander’s intent must be understood two echelons down. (U.S Army 2003, para. 4-27)&lt;ref name="FM6"/&gt;
Pigeau and McCann (2006)&lt;ref name="P2006"&gt;Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2006) Establishing Common Intent: The Key to Co-Ordinated Military Action. In: The Operational Art : Canadian Perspectives : Leadership and Command, 2006, Kingston, Ontario, Canada: Canadian Defence Academy Press, pp. 85–108.&lt;/ref&gt; state that intent is more than an aim or a purpose; they state that Intent contains the aim and purpose together with all implications. Hence, CSI is not only to describe the End-State but also a concise expression of the purpose of the operation. CSI may also include the commander's assessment of the adversary commander's intent and an assessment of where and how much risk is acceptable during the operation. This view is supported by Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;225)&lt;ref&gt;Klein, G. (1998) Sources of Power - How People Make Decisions Cambridge, MA: The Mit Press. {{ISBN|0-262-11227-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
CSI originates from one commander’s mind and is disseminated to the echelons below. CSI rarely gets reviewed and updated. For a short duration mission, such as a deliberate attack, the original statement may remain valid throughout planning. But for longer phases, in order to be agile the CSI might be changing in phase with the unfolding of the situation. Commanders must develop their intent within the bounds of a whole hierarchy of guiding principles that limit the types of solutions that they can entertain (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006).&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt;

=== Common intent ===
'''Common intent''' is an intent that is shared and understood by all participants, i.e. there is no discrepancy between the intent of the participating humans. Common intent is an idealized view of intent.

In today’s operational environment teams need to work together towards a desired End-State. Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"&gt;Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2000) "Redefining Command and Control". In: R. Pigeau and C. McCann, (eds.) ''The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience'', 2000, New York, NY, USA: Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 165–84. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46366-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; define Command and Control: “Command and Control: The establishment of common intent to achieve coordinated action”. Common intent is the combination of explicit intent and implicit intent. Pigeau and McCann (2006)&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; put forward that for a realizable Common Intent there need to be a single shared objective, together with a clear understanding in how that objective can be attained. They continue that Common Intent is an idealized concept where maximum overlap, with minimum scattering, exists between the intent of the commander and the intents of his subordinates. Knowledge known by the commander and his subordinates needs to be shared at all levels, guiding principles, reasoning ability, and to express similar levels of commitment. Intent is then not only something for a commander to disseminate but to exchange and learning the team members’ intent.
Farrell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"&gt;Farrell, P.S.E. and Lichacz, F. (2004) "Measuring Common Intent during Effects Based Planning". In: ''2004 Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium The Power of Information Age Concepts and Technologies''.&lt;/ref&gt; state that common intent describes a socio-psychological phenomenon that seems to be evident amongst a team that achieves a common objective. The CSI is a sort of a one person’s view, but as said in the introduction “every individual have intent of her own” implies that it may not just be enough to disseminate intent amongst staff members and subordinates. A conclusion of the work of Farrell (2006)&lt;ref name="F2006"&gt;Farrell, P.S.E. (2006) "Common Intent and Information Processing Frameworks applied to Effect Based Approaches to Operations". In: 2006, Cambridge, UK: CCRP.&lt;/ref&gt; is that teams with different military and civilian cultures would need that all team members establish a common understanding of the mission objectives and the Commander's intent with respect to their own competencies, authorities, and responsibilities.
Pigeau and McCann (2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;85–108)&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; state that diverse team members need to have a high degree of common intent to perform effectively. In such teams the commander needs to ensure that the intent is perceived and understood by all team members (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2000;&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004;&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006;&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; Farrell 2006&lt;ref name="F2006"/&gt;).
Alberts and Hayes (2007)&lt;ref name="A2007"/&gt; say that in order to allow subordinates’ initiative the operations order focuses on describing the CSI/CI so that flexibility in coordination and collaboration in the dynamic environment is entailed. There is a need for the commander to connect the subordinates’ human potential (reason, opinions, questions, seek information regarding the mission) to align and be a support to the commanders own intent (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;102).&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt;

=== Command intent ===
'''Command intent''' (CI) is a practical view of common intent, meaning that it is not plausible to expect that all individuals during a whole mission in all situations will share the same intent. CI will be developed for specific parts of missions and shared amongst the participants. To establish CI the involvement of all participants is necessary, e.g. compare with football or soccer teams where the overall intent is formalized by coaches in collaboration with the players and where each player knows what the other players’ intentions are.

Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; states that “In reality, it is presumed true that it is impossible to have common intent”. For a specific mission bounded for a certain time an overlap of intent ought to be achievable, e.g. as illustrated by the players in a soccer team where all have individual goals with their lives and families, but on the soccer field they have the common intent to win the game. This means that during the game, and in training and exercises prior to and after the game their common intent is to perform well according to the mission declared by the coach (Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004;&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Farrell 2006;&lt;ref name="F2006"/&gt; Gustavsson et al. 2008d).&lt;ref name="PMG2008d"&gt;Gustavsson, P.M., Hieb, M.R., Niklasson, L., Eriksson, P. and Moore, P. (2008d) "Machine Interpretable Representation of Commander's Intent". In: ''Proceedings of the 13th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium (ICCRTS)''. Bellevue, Washington, USA. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/13th_iccrts_2008/CD/html/papers/188.pdf. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
A workable version of common intent is command intent that is directed for a specific situation, bounded by participating organization, space and time, i.e. for the operation at hand the intent is common but other intent and goals of the participating humans may differ. Much of the coordination can be done locally, i.e. on a lower level, without explicit orders. Brehmer (2009)&lt;ref name="B2009"&gt;Brehmer, B. (2009) "Command without Commanders". In: June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that the higher levels of command will have the time to consider other aspects of the problems facing them. Brehmer continues that there is the loss of combat power inherent in top-down command-directed synchronization. By NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC) as presented by Alberts, Garstka &amp; Stein (1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;87–93)&lt;ref name="AGS1999"/&gt; this is overcome by a high-speed continuum. Brehmer (2009)&lt;ref name="B2009"/&gt; however says that the main responsibility of the commander and his staff is to articulate intent and crafting rules of engagement. For armed forces that have mission command as their principal doctrine this is not a new concept, but Brehmer further envisions that with articulated intent larger units will be able to co-ordinate with other units and conduct the mission without any explicit directions from higher headquarters. Command Intent is then an outline of a plan, objectives to be achieved, responsibilities, linkages and schemas of manoeuvre, and constraints. Establishing command intent also involves more than one person. Traditional Commander's intent is then replaced by an intent that arises from dialogue between commanders and key staff at more than one level.
Command intent is to allow self-synchronization and to provide understanding of the complex causes and effects. To enable self-synchronization the subordinates must be given the mandate to operate on their own initiatives, within the boundary of the mission. In “Rethinking Command and Control” by Curts and Cambell (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Curts, R.J. and Cambell, D.E. (2006) "Rethinking Command and Control". In: March 2006, San Diego, CA: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/2006_CCRTS/html/papers/005.pdf [Accessed March 16, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; the authors address this fine line between delegating authority and maintaining and controlling hierarchy The commander delegating authority must refrain from directing the actions of subordinates, yet must also maintain some command structure. The subordinates must have the ability to work independently or within a team to achieve the mission goals. To create this empowerment the commander’s information should be shared with everyone. Autonomy is created by [[setting boundaries]] and hierarchy then can be replaced by self-directed teams. CI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders that transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commanders (Gustavsson et al. 2008d;&lt;ref name="PMG2008d"/&gt; 2009&lt;ref&gt;Gustavsson, P.M. and Hieb, M.R. (2009) "Supporting Collaboration in Collective Endeavours with a Model of Operations Intent and Effects". In: ''Proceedings of the 14th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/14th_iccrts_2009/papers/055.pdf. 055.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Explicit and implicit intent ===
'''Explicit intent''' is an intent that is publicly stated and made available for the participants. '''Implicit intent''' is an intent that is not publicly stated. Implicit intent can be made explicit by the mechanism described below.

Shattuck and Woods (2000)&lt;ref name="S2000"&gt;Shattuck, L.G. and Woods, D.D. (2000) "Communication Of Intent In Military Command and Control Systems". In: C. McCann and R. Pigeau, (eds.) ''The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience'', Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 279–92. Available at: http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/woods/C2/shattuck_Nato.pdf [Accessed July 14, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; examined the role of communicating intent. In the study, company commanders received a battalion order including the battalion Commander's intent. Then changes to the situation were introduced and the actions performed by the company commanders were compared with the intent of the battalion commander. The result was that the company commanders matched their battalion commander's intent in only 34% of the cases.
Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; introduced that intent consists of an explicit part and an implicit part.

'''Explicit intent''' is the one that is publicly stated for all the headquarters (HQ) staff and subordinates to perceive, think about, and act upon. The explicit intent is either vocalized (i.e. made publicly) in doctrine, orders, statements or can be derived from questions and answers. Theoretically, each staff and subordinate member should be able to reiterate the commander’s intent at any point during the process.

'''Implicit intent''' consists of all the un-vocalized expectations that the commander and all team members have. The implicit intent is developed over a longer time, prior to the mission, and develops from the style of how the commander is conducting the operations with respect to experience, risk willing, use of power and force, diplomacy, ethics, social values, moral, norms, creativity and unorthodox behaviour and the concepts, policies, laws and doctrine agreed to by military, civil, organizations, agencies, nations and coalitions.
Farell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; proposed that implicit intent is an internal expectation of Commander's intent. The example used by Farell &amp; Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; is that with an explicit intent “to capture the hill” the implicit intent might be “to capture the hill with minimal battle damage” or “to capture the hill with Air Force assets only.” The implicit expectations depend on how the members interpret Commander's intent from personal expectations based on their style and experience, (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2000),&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; and with the staff position (e.g., planner, operator, commander, etc.), (cf. Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004).&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Farell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; provided a way of finding implicit intent by asking questions of the form “from perspective x, how do you interpret Commander’s intent?”
Implicit intent can be made explicit by transforming the implicit into explicit statements. The commander can vocalize the Personal, Military or Cultural implicit intent. The commander can be monitored, e.g. by his subordinates, and his team members, who then draw conclusions about the commanders implicit intent. In the same way a commander can draw conclusions regarding his subordinates. Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; presented some mechanisms of making original implicit intent made explicit. They are: (1) Externalization is when a commander or subordinate make the internal intents explicit declared; (2) Internalization is a version of tacit learning, when a commander presents the intent and the mouth is saying something and the body language signals something different, or add context and meaning that are put into the mental model and affects the implicit intent; (3) Socialization is meeting and talking and performing exercises together, teaming, i.e. is to find the implicit intent and motives etc.; and (4) Dialogue is the explicit stated, publicly vocalized available description of an individual’s intent.

'''Iranian people''' like [[Persians]] and [[Sogdians]] have lived in China throughout various periods in Chinese history.

==History==
The [[Parthia]]n Iranians, [[An Shigao]] and [[An Xuan]], introduced Buddhism to China.

A village dating back 600 years in [[Yangzhou]] in [[Jiangsu]] province, China, has inhabitants descended from Iranians. It has 27,000 people and contains Iranian places names like Fars and Parsian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In China, a 600-year-old Village Continues Iranian Tradition|author=|newspaper=The Circle of Ancient Iranian Studies (CAIS)|date=23 July 2003|url=http://english.people.com.cn/english/200012/28/eng20001228_59085.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (Wudai) (907–960), there are examples of Chinese emperors marrying Persian women.

Many Iranians took the Chinese name Li to use as their last name when they moved to China. One prominent family included [[Li Xian (pharmacologist)]] and Li Xun.

On the silk road slave girls was a major item and much more expensive than silk. Silk was up to five times less than the value of a slave girl. Central Asian slave girls were exported from Central Asia Iranian areas to China. It is believed that the wealthy merchants and aristocratic noblemen of the Chinese capital of Chang'an were the consumers for the huge amount of Central Asian slave women brought by the Sogdians to China to sell to the Chinese. The Central Asian foreign women in the Sogdian owned wineshops in the Chinese capital are also believe to have been slaves since Chinese poets depicted then as homesick, sad and melancholy and they would service travelers by keeping them company overnight. Merchants and literati would frequent the wineshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=温 |first1=翠芳 |date=2006 |title=唐代长安西市中的胡姬与丝绸之路上的女奴贸易 |url= https://wenku.baidu.com/view/ac8ea42c7375a417866f8fbc.html |journal= |volume= |issue=2 |pages= 19–21 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sogdians reaped massive profits from selling slave girls and so did the Chinese government by taxing the sale of the slaves. Slave girls were one of the major products Chinese bought from Sogdians. Persian poets often wrote about wine and women since the wineservers were often girls and this wine culture with girl servers seems to have spread to China. There were many Sogdian wineshops and Persian shops in Chang'an along with a large slave market. The wineshops were staffed with young girls who served wine to customers and danced for them. Most of the slave girls were 14 or 15 years old. They provided services like sex, dancing, singing, and served wine to their customers in Chang'an as ordered their masters who ran the wineshops.

[[File:JAPS QUIT.jpg|thumb|right|Headlines announcing [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender]] in [[World War II]]]]
'''Jap''' is an English abbreviation of the word "[[Japan]]ese". Today it is generally regarded as an [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slur]] among [[Overseas Japanese|Japanese minority populations]] in other countries, although English-speaking countries differ in the degree to which they consider the term offensive. In the United States, [[Japanese American]]s have come to find the term very controversial or extremely offensive, even when used as an abbreviation.&lt;ref name="jref"&gt;Gil Asakawa, [http://www.jref.com/nikkeiview/jap.shtml Nikkeiview: JapJapJapJapJapJapJap], July 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Jap was not considered primarily offensive; however, during and after the events of [[World War II]], the term became derogatory.&lt;ref name="Fussell"&gt;[[Paul Fussell]], ''Wartime:  Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War,'' Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and etymology==
[[File:Alaska Death Trap.jpg|thumb|right|WWII [[propaganda]] poster using a rhyming slogan in its text]]
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "Jap" as an abbreviation for "Japanese" was in colloquial use in London around 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50123036?query_type=word&amp;queryword=jap&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tXTC-P2YlH5-7807&amp;hilite=50123036 "Jap"]. From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Retrieved November 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of benign usage was the previous naming of [[Boondocks Road]] in [[Jefferson County, Texas]], originally named "Jap Road" when it was built in 1905 to honor a popular local rice farmer from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=1034 Tolerance.org: Texas County Bans 'Jap Road'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050914115436/http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=1034 |date=September 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later popularized during [[World War II]] to describe those of Japanese descent, "Jap" was then commonly used in newspaper headlines to refer to the Japanese and [[Imperial Japan]]. "Jap" became a derogatory term during the war, more so than "[[Nip]]".&lt;ref name="Fussell"/&gt; Veteran and author [[Paul Fussell]] explains the usefulness of the word during the war for creating effective propaganda by saying that "Japs" "was a brisk [[monosyllable]] handy for [[slogan]]s like 'Rap the Jap' or 'Let's Blast the Jap Clean Off the Map'".&lt;ref name="Fussell"/&gt;  Some in the [[United States Marine Corps]] tried to combine the word "Japs" with "[[ape]]s" to create a new description, "[[wikt:jape|Japes]]", for the Japanese; this neologism never became popular.&lt;ref name="Fussell"/&gt; In post World War II America, schoolchildren often referred to an unannounced test as a "Jap quiz" in reference to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The term has fallen out of favor and is largely replaced by "pop quiz". 

In the United States the term is now considered derogatory; the ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary'' notes it is "usually disparaging".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/jap "Jap"], Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/jap?view=uk AskOxford: Jap&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A snack food company in Chicago named Japps Foods (for the company founder) changed their name and eponymous [[potato chip]] brand to [[Jays Foods]] shortly after [[Pearl Harbor]] to avoid any negative associations with the name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cookcfb.org/History%20of%20Potato%20Chip.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725194855/http://www.cookcfb.org/History%20of%20Potato%20Chip.html |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spiro Agnew]] was criticized in the media in 1968 for an offhand remark, intended to be  jocular, referring to reporter Gene Oishi as a "fat Jap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905825,00.html |title=The Nation: Fat Jap Trap |date=February 28, 1972 |work=Time |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, under pressure from civil rights groups, [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]] commissioners in 2004 decided to drop the name "Jap Road" from a {{convert|4.3|mi|adj=on}} road near the city of [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. Also in adjacent [[Orange County, Texas|Orange County]], "Jap Lane" has also been targeted by civil rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070618100356/http://www.genocidewatch.org/JapRoadinTexas16July2004.htm Texas Community in Grip of a Kind of Road Rage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The road was originally named for the contributions of [[Kichimatsu Kishi]] and the farming colony he founded. And in Arizona, the state department of transportation renamed "Jap Road" near [[Topock, Arizona]] to "Bonzai Slough Road" to note the presence of Japanese agricultural workers and family-owned farms along the [[Colorado River]] there in the early 20th century. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In November of 2018, in Kansas, automatically-generated license plates which included three digits and "JAP" were recalled after a man of Japanese ancestry saw a plate with that pattern and complained to the state.[https://www.univision.com/noticias/racismo/por-que-en-kansas-estan-retirando-las-matriculas-de-automoviles-con-las-letras-jap]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.univision.com/noticias/racismo/por-que-en-kansas-estan-retirando-las-matriculas-de-automoviles-con-las-letras-jap|title=¿Por qué en Kansas están retirando las matrículas de automóviles con las letras JAP?|last=Noticias|first=Univision|website=Univision|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction in Japan==
In 2003, the Japanese deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Yoshiyuki Motomura, protested the North Korean ambassador's use of the term in retaliation for a Japanese diplomat's use of the term "North Korea" instead of the official name, "Democratic People's Republic of Korea".&lt;ref&gt;Shane Green, [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/05/1068013255536.html Treaty plan could end Korean War], ''The Age'', November 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, following the term's [[wikt:offhand|offhand]] use in a March 26 article appearing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' ("white-coated Jap [[wikt:bloke|bloke]]"), the Minister of the Japanese Embassy in London protested that "most Japanese people find the word 'Japs' offensive, irrespective of the circumstances in which it is used".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-week/letters/6845783/letters-229/ |title=Not acceptable |author=Ken Okaniwa  |date=9 April 2011 |work=[[The Spectator]] |accessdate=22 July 2012}} His brief letter continued, noting that the term had been used in the context of the then-recent [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], with the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] still-ongoing; "I find the gratuitous use of a word reviled by everyone in Japan utterly inappropriate. I strongly request that you refrain from allowing the use of this term in any future articles that refer to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Across the world==
Jap-Fest is an annual Japanese car show in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondello.ie/race_events/shows/japfest/ |title=Homepage |publisher=Jap-Fest |accessdate=1 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218155140/http://mondello.ie/race_events/shows/japfest/ |archivedate=18 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the Japanese fashion designer [[Kenzo Takada]] opened the "Jungle Jap" boutique in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;William Wetherall, [http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/yosha/race/Jap_jappu_zyappu.html "Jap, Jappu, and Zyappu, The emotional tapestries of pride and prejudice"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, July 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jap sign Singapore.jpg|thumb|right|Sign advertising "Jap Rice" in Singapore]]
In [[Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;Power up with Jap lunch, ''[[The New Paper]]'', 18 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/jas/deptinfo/deptinfo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the term is used freely as a contraction of the adjective "Japanese" rather than as a derogatory term. The Australian news service Asia Pulse has also used the term.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Capital Inflow to Leave Taiwan Vulnerable: Jap Newspaper". Asia Pulse. March 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Jap'' is used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as well, where it is also considered an ethnic slur. It frequently appears in the compound ''Jappenkampen'' 'Jap camps', referring to Japanese internment camps for Dutch citizens in the Japanese-occupied [[Dutch Indies]].

==Biography==
Kanubhai Hasmukhbhai Tailor was born on 17 May 1956 in a small village of Adas, in the [[Kheda district]] of the Indian state Gujarat, in a family with meagre financial resources.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disableindia.org/career.html | title=Biography | publisher=DWT | date=2014 | accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While doing his early schooling, Kanubhai contracted [[Poliomyelitis]] due to which he suffered the permanent disability in both his legs.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Bravery-awards-distributed-to-heroes-working-at-grassroot-level/articleshow/19936786.cms | title=TOI | publisher=TOI | date=May 7, 2013 | accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="You Repeat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yourepeat.com/g/Kanubhai/ | title=You Repeat | publisher=You Repeat | date=2014 | accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sound cry" /&gt; However, he continued his studies and graduated from the Shree Sahajanand Arts and Commerce College in Ahmedabad.&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt;

Kanubhai began his social life with a [[hunger strike]] in 1979 for free travel facilities for the disabled people. After eleven days of strike, the [[Government of Gujarat]] allowed free travel to physically handicapped people. Soon, he moved to [[Surat]] and started a small printing press, operating out of his house.

The '''Kanuri people''' ('''Kanouri''', '''Kanowri''', also '''Yerwa''', '''Bare Bari''' and several subgroup names) are an [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African ethnic group]] living largely in the lands of the former [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] and [[Bornu Empire]]s in [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]]. Those generally termed Kanuri include several subgroups and dialect groups, some of whom feel themselves distinct from the Kanuri. Most trace their origins to ruling lineages of the medieval [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]], its client states or provinces. In contrast to neighboring [[Toubou people|Toubou]] or [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] pastoralists, Kanuri groups have traditionally been sedentary, engaging in farming, fishing the [[Chad Basin]], and engaged in trade and salt processing.&lt;ref name="Decalo1997"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Idrissa|first1=Abdourahmane|last2=Decalo|first2=Samuel|title=Historical Dictionary of Niger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFFjEMjKrWkC|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names and subgroups==
[[File:Kanuri languages map 001.png|thumb|left|300px|Extent of the five main [[Kanuri language]] groups today.]]
[[File:Kanem-Bornu.svg|thumb|right|200px|The farthest extent of the medieval Kanem-Bornu state.]]
[[File:Body Guard of the Sheikh of Bornou.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ceremonial [[bodyguard]] of the Sheikh of Bornou in his full regalia, after a drawing by a British visitor in the 1820s. The mounted knight was central to the Bornu state, and many Kanuri people still value horsemanship and horses.]]
Kanuri peoples include several subgroups, and identify by different names in some regions. The [[Kanuri language]]  was the major language of the [[Bornu Empire]] and remains a major language in southeastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon, but in Chad it is limited to handfuls of speakers in urban centers.&lt;ref name=collelo1988&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/chad/18.htm Thomas Collelo, ed. Chad: A Country Study]. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1988. This text, created by the United States federal government for official purposes, is in the [[Public Domain]].  As such, elements are used here verbatim.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest population of Kanuri reside in the northeast corner of [[Nigeria]], where the ceremonial Emirate of Bornu traces direct descent from the Kanem-Bornu empire, founded sometime before 1000 CE. Some 3 million Kanuri speakers live in Nigeria, not including the some 200,000 speakers of the '''Manga''' or '''Mangari''' dialect.&lt;ref name=ethNG /&gt; The [[Nga people (Nigeria)|Nga people]] in [[Bauchi State]] trace their origins to a Kanuri diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstower.org/vol1no7006.htm History: Ngas-Kanuri Link]. News Tower (Nigeria) Vol. 1, No. 7 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In southeastern Niger, where they form the majority of the sedentary population, the Kanuri are commonly called '''Bare Bari''' (a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] name).&lt;ref name="Decalo1997" /&gt; The 400,000 Kanuri population in Niger includes the '''Manga''' or '''Mangari''' subgroup, numbering some 100,000 (1997) in the area east of [[Zinder]], who regard themselves as distinct from the '''Bare Bari'''.&lt;ref name="Decalo1997" /&gt;

Around 40,000 (1998) members of the '''Tumari''' subgroup, sometimes called Kanembu in Niger, are a distinct Kanuri subgroup living in the [[N'guigmi]] area, and are distinct from the Chadian [[Kanembu people]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=krt Ethnologue KRT].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Kaour escarpment oasis of eastern Niger, the Kanuri are further divided into the '''Bla Bla''' subgroup, numbering some 20,000 (2003), and are the dominant ethnic group in the salt evaporation and trade industry of [[Bilma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bms Ethnologue BMS].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanuri speak varieties of Kanuri, one of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages]]. Divisions include the Manga, Tumari, and Bilma dialects of Central Kanuri and the more distinct [[Kanembu language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kau Kanuri language].&lt;/ref&gt;

Inheriting the religious and cultural traditions of the Kanem-Bornu state, Kanuri peoples are predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]].

In Chad, Kanembu speakers differentiate themselves from the large Kanuri ethnicity. The Kanembu are centered in [[Lac Prefecture]] and southern [[Kanem Prefecture]]. Although Kanuri was the major language of the Bornu Empire, in Chad, Kanuri speakers are limited to handfuls of speakers in urban centers. Kanuri remains a major language in southeastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon.&lt;ref name="joshuaproject.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?rog3=CM&amp;rop3=104605|title=Kanuri, Yerwa in Cameroon|first=Joshua|last=Project|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, the Kanembu constituted the greatest part of the population of Lac Prefecture, but some Kanembu also lived in the [[Chari-Baguirmi Prefecture]]. Once the core ethnic group of the Kanem-Borno Empire, whose territories at one time included northeastern Nigeria and southern Libya, the Kanembu retain ties beyond the borders of Chad. For example, close family and commercial ties bind them with the Kanuri of northeastern Nigeria. Within Chad, many Kanembu of Lac and Kanem prefectures identify with the Alifa of Mao, the governor of the region in precolonial times.&lt;ref name=collelo1988 /&gt;

Originally a pastoral people, the Kanuri were one of many Nilo-Saharan groups indigenous to the Central South Sahara, beginning their expansion in the area of [[Lake Chad]] in the late 7th century, and absorbing both indigenous Nilo-Saharan and Chadic (Afro-Asiatic) speakers. According to Kanuri tradition, Sef, son of [[Dhu Ifazan]] of [[Yemen]], arrived in Kanem in the ninth century and united the population into the [[Sayfawa dynasty]].  This tradition however, is likely a product of later Islamic influence, reflecting the association with their Arabian origins in the Islamic era.  Evidence of indigenous state formation in the Lake Chad area dates back to circa 800 BCE at Zilum.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Religion==
The Kanuri became Muslims in the 11th century. Kanem became a centre of Muslim learning and the Kanuri soon controlled all the area surrounding Lake Chad and a powerful empire called [[Kanem Empire]], which reached its height in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when they ruled much of [[Middle Africa]].{{citation needed|reason=unable to verify as linked page on Kanem Empire|date=February 2016}}

==Traditional state==
Following the downfall of the Bornu Empire and the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the 19th century, the Kanuri were divided under the rule of the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]] and [[German Empire]]s.

Despite the loss of the Kanuri-led state, the Shehu of Bornu continues as the head of the Bornu Emirate. This traditional Kanuri/Kanembu state maintains a ceremonial rule of the Kanuri people, based in [[Maiduguri]], [[Borno State]], [[Nigeria]], but acknowledged by the 4 million Kanuri in neighboring countries. The Shehu ("Sheikh") of Bornu draws his authority from a state founded before 1000 CE, the Kanem-Bornu Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rulers.org/nigatrad.html|title=Nigerian traditional polities|website=rulers.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current ruling line, the al-Kanemi dynasty, dates to the accession of [[Muhammad al-Amin al-Kanemi]] in the early 19th century, displacing the [[Sayfawa dynasty]] which had ruled from around 1300 CE. The 19th Shehu, [[Mustafa Ibn Umar El-Kanemi of Borno|Mustafa Ibn Umar El-Kanemi]], died in February 2009,

Isa Umar Gusau and Ahmad Salkida, The Daily Trust. 23 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded by [[Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi of Borno|Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.my-nigeria.com/2009/03/06/the-intrigues-power-play-behind-the-emergence-of-new-shehu-of-borno/ The intrigues, power play behind the emergence of new Shehu of Borno]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The Guardian. Naija Pundit. March 6th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political leaders==
In Nigeria, famous post-independence Kanuri leaders include the politicians [[Kashim Ibrahim]], [[Ibrahim Imam]], [[Zannah Bukar Dipcharima]], Shettima Ali Monguno, Abba Habib,Muhammad Ngileruma, [[Baba Gana Kingibe]], former GNPP leader [[Waziri Ibrahim]], and the former military ruler, [[Sani Abacha]].  In Niger, Kanuri political leaders include the former [[Prime Minister of Niger]] [[Mamane Oumarou]], and the former [[President of Niger]], [[Mamadou Tandja]].

==Kanuri regionalism in Nigeria==
[[File:Flag of the Kanuri people.svg|thumb|150px|The flag of the Kanuri people.]]
A Nigeria specific small Kanuri nationalist movement emerged in 1950s, centred on Bornu.  Some "Pan-Kanuri" nationalists claimed an area of {{convert|532,460|km²}} for the territory of what they called "Greater Kanowra", including the modern-day [[Lac Prefecture|Lac]] and [[Kanem Prefecture]]s in Chad, [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Far North Region]] in Cameroon and [[Diffa Region|Diffa]] and [[Zinder Region]]s in Niger.&lt;ref name=Minahan&gt;Minahan, J. (1996). ''Nations Without States''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|0-313-28354-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the [[Borno Youth Movement]] (BYM) was founded and played a role as a mass regionalist political party up through the end of colonialism, though it petered out at independence.&lt;ref&gt;Billy J.

== History ==

[[File:Benbadhanabongse.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Prince Benbadhnabongse, the Prince of Phichai]]

In 1902, [[King Chulalongkorn]] attempted to promote the country's silk, silverware, and weaving industries. He hired Dr Kametaro Toyama from the [[University of Tokyo]], to train Siamese students in Japanese silk and weaving crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences [http://www.jircas.affrc.go.jp/english/publication/jarq/03-4/03-4-030-033.pdf "A Scientist and a Link of the Chain uniting Thailand and Japan"] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the School of Sericulture was founded at [[Pathum Wan District|Tambon Thung Saladaeng]], [[Bangkok]] by [[Benbadhanabongse|Prince Benbadhanabongse]], the Director of the Department of Sericulture of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;กรมหม่อนไหม [http://qsds.go.th/newqsds/inside_page.php?pageid=10 ประวัติกรมหม่อนไหม] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The school was renamed the School of Agriculture in 1906.

In 1908, the School of the Ministry of Agriculture was founded at [[Windsor Palace (Thailand)|Windsor Palace]] as the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (Thailand)|Ministry of Agriculture]] merged three schools, the School of Surveying (founded in 1882), the School of Irrigation (founded in 1905), and the School of Agriculture. Thailand's first tertiary-level agriculture curriculum began to offer courses in 1909.

In 1917, Phraya Thepsartsatit and [[Chaophraya Thammasakmontri]] of the Ministry of Education founded the first primary school of agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture, named the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in [[Pathum Wan District|Tambon Horwang]]. It moved to [[Mueang Nakhon Pathom District|Tambon Phra Prathon]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ [http://pirun.ku.ac.th/~fedupst/Chapter4.pdf การพัฒนาอาชีวเกษตรกรรม] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, [[Sithiporn Kridakara|Prince Sithiporn Kridakara]] and Chaophraya Thammasakmontri together expanded the school regionally. In the central region, a campus was located in [[Saraburi Province]], in the northern region in [[Chiang Mai Province]], in the northeastern region in [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]], and in the southern region in [[Songkhla Province]].

In 1935, the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in each part of the country was closed and merged following the agricultural education policy in that time. Luang Ingkhasikasikan, Luang Suwan Vajokkasikij, and Phra Chuangkasetsinlapakan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/about/history_ku.html บุคคลสำคัญของมหาวิทยาลัย] เรียกดูวันที่ 2013-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; together proposed to maintain the Mae Jo School (today's [[Mae Jo University]]) at Chiang Mai Province only and renamed it Secondary-level Agriculture Technical School before it was elevated to the College of Agriculture, under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.

The Ministry of Agriculture established the Central Agriculture Station or "Kaset Klang", in [[Bang Khen District]], Bangkok. It caused the College of Agriculture to move to Bang Khen District in 1938 and the government office at Chiang Mai Province became [[Mae Jo University|Kasetsart Preparatory School]] to prepare students to study at the College of Agriculture in Bang Khen.

In 1943, [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] promoted the College of Agriculture and established Kasetsart University as a department of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2486/A/007/228.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๖] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The university consisted of four faculties: agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and cooperatives (today's Faculty of Economics and Faculty of Business Administration).&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2486/A/007/228.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๔๘๖] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Mom Luang Xujati Kambhu, the Fifth President of Kasetsart University, judged the Bang Khen campus too confined and unable to support the education in agricultural sciences called for by the National Social and Economics Development Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.psd.ku.ac.th/kuout/p013.html ประวัติมหาวิทยาลัย] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kamphaeng Saen District|Kamphaeng Saen campus]] was established on 12 November 1979 as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/newdesign/content_level.php?menulevel=22 ประวัติมหาวิทยาลัยทศวรรษที่สี่ พ.ศ. 2516-2525] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The university further expanded by establishing [[Si Racha District|Si Racha campus]], [[Sakon Nakhon Province|Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus]], [[Suphan Buri Province|Suphan Buri campus]], [[Krabi Province|Krabi campus]] and [[Lopburi Province|Lopburi campus]].

On 18 July 2015, the Kasetsart University Act B.E. 2558 (2015) transformed it from a [[public university]] to a [[national university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2558/A/066/1.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๘] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nontri tree===
The [[Peltophorum pterocarpum|Nontri tree]] has been a symbol of Kasetsart University since 1963. The [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|king]] and [[Sirikit|queen]] planted nine Nontri trees in the front of Kasetsart University's main auditorium on 29 November 1963 which became historic day for Nisit Kasetsart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/thai/nontri.htm มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์: ต้นนนทรี] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201082549/http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/thai/nontri.htm |date=1 December 2010 }} Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nontri is a tree in the [[Fabaceae|Fabaceae family]]. It is a long-lived evergreen with grey-brown bark with upright branches. The leaves are [[bipinnate]] compound and the flowers are yellow, produced in large compound [[racemes]]. Its fruit is a pod containing seeds.

'''Kenyan English''' is a [[List of dialects of the English language|local dialect]] of the [[English language]] spoken by several communities and individuals in [[Kenya]], and among some Kenyan expatriates in other countries. The dialect contains features unique to it that were derived from local [[Bantu languages]], such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]].&lt;ref name="Cliike"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyaggah|first1=Lynette Behm|title=Cross-linguistic influence in Kenyan English: The impact of Swahili and Kikuyu on syntax|publisher=University of California|url=http://phdtree.org/pdf/24677752-cross-linguistic-influence-in-kenyan-english-the-impact-of-swahili-and-kikuyu-on-syntax/|accessdate=8 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226102504/http://phdtree.org/pdf/24677752-cross-linguistic-influence-in-kenyan-english-the-impact-of-swahili-and-kikuyu-on-syntax/|archivedate=26 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The English language was introduced to [[Kenya]] along with [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]'s [[colonisation of Kenya]] in 1895, when the [[East Africa Protectorate]] was set up before becoming a colony in 1920. [[Swahili language|Swahili]] had been established as a trade language in most parts of the [[Swahili Coast]] at the time of colonization, and it was also used in education. The British reduced the influence of Swahili and made English the [[medium of instruction]] in Kenyan schools. English remained in official use after Kenya's independence on 12 December 1963. The official languages of Kenya are English and Swahili, with the latter also recognised as the [[national language]].&lt;ref name="ruhr bochum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/wegate/Africa/Kenya.html |title=The Bochum Gateway to World Englishes – Kenya |publisher=[[Ruhr University Bochum]] |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Official languages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenyalaw.org:8181/exist/kenyalex/actview.xql?actid=Const2010#KE/CON/Const2010/chap_2 |title=Constitution of Kenya.

[[File:Kenyan English vowel chart.svg|thumb|250px|right|Monophthongs of Kenyan English on a vowel chart.&lt;ref&gt;From {{citation|last=Lodge|first=Ken|year=2009|title=A Critical Introduction to Phonetics|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|page=171|isbn=978-0-8264-8873-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nVT_qNvbusC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like [[English in southern England]], Kenyan English is [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]]. Major phonological features include the loss of length contrast in vowels, the lack of [[Mid vowel|mid]] [[central vowel]]s as with [[British English]], the [[monophthong]]isation of [[diphthong]]s and the dissolving of [[consonant clusters]].&lt;ref name="ruhr bochum" /&gt; The [[trap-bath split]] does not exist in Kenyan English.

Also, for those who don't speak English as a first language and/or live in rural areas in Kenya, may participate in "code mixing." "Code mixing" is the process of using words from a local language while speaking English. A common example of this in Kenya comes from using the Swahili word ''andyu'' while speaking English, which is used to agree with someone.&lt;ref name="East African English" /&gt;

===Consonants===
Mispronunciation of English words due to the interference of local Kenyan languages is popularly known in the country as "shrubbing," a word which in all its forms is itself prone to this occurrence. It has been noted that "shrubbing" is less likely with upper-middle and upper class citizens, or citizens who do not speak indigenous Kenyan languages and learned English as a first language. Therefore, people living in rural areas and/or those who learned English as a second language and are likely to have a heavier accent are more likely to "shrub".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=fgRkeWswGZEC |last1=Llamas |first1=Carmen |last2=Watt |first2=Dominic |title=Language and Identities |page=121 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Shrubbing" is done by replacing a word's consonant sound(s) with another or others of a similar [[place of articulation]].

===Vowels===
Since English is commonly spoken as a second language in Kenya, they tend to follow the Swahili vowel system. This means they tend to follow a five vowel system rather than the twenty vowel system of English. The five vowel system mainly consists of /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/ and these vowels are never diphthongized like some English vowel sounds can be. An example of this can be seen between the words ''hat'', ''hut'', ''heart'' and ''hurt''. In Kenyan English, these words all appear very similar due to substituting all of them with the same vowel of /a/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Irungu |first=David M. |date=2015 |title=Effects of Swahili Vowel System on Kenyan English Speakers' Pronunciation |publisher=The University of Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
The most evident grammatical features of Kenyan English are the omission of [[Article (grammar)|articles]], the pluralisation of [[uncountable noun]]s, the avoidance of using the [[relative pronoun]] "whose" and using [[adjective]]s as nouns.&lt;ref name="ruhr bochum" /&gt;

In Kenyan English, a large number of speakers tend to omit articles in words that would otherwise need them. For example, when ordering at a fast food restaurant, a person may say "give me burger" or "I want burger" instead of "give me a burger" or "I want a burger". Similarly, the article "the" in Kenyan English is often used in cases that would otherwise be deemed inappropriate, especially with uncountable nouns. A good example would be adding the article "the" to the uncountable noun "mud" (for example, ''I stepped in the mud on my way home.'')

Some uncountable nouns such as "data", "equipment", "money", "property" and "software" are also often pluralised in Kenyan English, but this is especially prevalent in the rural areas and among the lower and lower-middle classes.

*''The file contained different types of datas.''
*''There's a lot of equipments being sold at the shop.''
*''Prize monies were on offer to competitors at the video game tournament last week.''
*''The government owns a lot of properties across all counties.'' 
*''You can download different softwares to your computer.''

A very large number of Kenyan English speakers often use "My names are…" when introducing themselves instead of "My name is…". For example, a person named John Omondi would introduce himself by saying "My names are John Omondi" instead of "My name is John Omondi". Again, this is especially prevalent in the rural areas and among the lower and lower-middle classes, but also depends on the ethnic origin of the speaker.

As mentioned before, there is a tendency to avoid the use of the relative pronoun "whose" in Kenyan English, where the use of the word would usually be replaced with "that". For example:

*''The man whose car I bought went to [[Mombasa]] last week.'' → ''The man that I bought a car from went to Mombasa last week.''
*''The woman whose purse was stolen went to the police.'' → ''The woman that got/had her purse stolen went to the police.''

In written English, Kenyans often use British English spellings in favour of those in American English, such as ''–our'' instead of ''–or'' (e.g. "colour", "flavour"), ''–re'' instead of ''–er'' (e.g. "metre", "theatre"), ''–ogue'' instead of ''–og'' (e.g. "prologue", "catalogue") and ''–ce'' instead of ''–se'' (e.g. "defence", "offence"; noun/verb distinction between words such as "advice" / "advise" or "licence" / "license" is maintained). However, the use of ''–ize'' and ''–yze'' has become more frequent in favour of ''–ise'' and ''–yse'', although the latter is still more common. For example, more Kenyans have been known to write "criticize" and "paralyze" as well as "criticise" and "paralyse".

==Vocabulary==
As Kenyans generally use British English, vocabulary in Kenyan English is very similar to that of British English. Common examples are "[[French fries|chips]]" and "fries" ("french fries" and "fries" in American English), "crisps" ("chips" in American English) and "[[Association football|football]]" ("soccer" in American English, although the use of the American term has become increasingly common).

Kenyan English often borrows vocabulary from local languages which would otherwise be difficult to translate to English, such as the Bantu term "[[ugali]]", the Swahili term "[[sukuma wiki]]" ([[collard greens]]) and Kikuyu term "[[matatu]]". The wide use of [[Sheng slang|Sheng]] in Kenya has also affected the vocabulary of Kenyan English speakers. [[White people]] in Kenya are often referred to as "mzungus" or "wazungus" (the word "mzungu" is [[Swahili language|Swahili]] for "white person"; its plural form is "wazungu"). Other borrowed terms include "pole pole" (Swahili for "slowly"; as a result some people also say "slowly slowly"), "[[Harambee]]", "nyama choma" (barbecued meat) and "nini" (used when one forgets the name of something; equivalent to the word "thingy", which is itself also widely used). Kenyans also tend to use the words "si" and "ati" (equivalent to the words "but" and "that" respectively) due to the influence of sheng. Finally, most people in Kenya speak English as a 3rd or 4th language leading to the majority of individuals speaking in the same way as they would say it in their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mariefahy.blogspot.com/2011/05/kenyan-english.html |title=24 Months in Kenya – Kenyan English |date=24 May 2011 |author=Marie Fahy |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiochios.wordpress.com/kenyan-english/ |title=Jambo Rafiki – Kenyan English |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proverbs==
[[File:The Standard Kenya - Glass houses.jpg|thumb|right|An example of the use of proverbs and idioms in Kenyan English, from the front page of ''[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]'' on 5 August 2014.]]
Some Kenyan English speakers occasionally use [[proverb]]s borrowed from Swahili and other languages, as well as English proverbs, when conveying a moral to a story or giving advice, and sometimes translate these proverbs to English. For example, when advising someone to take his/her time when doing something, a person may use the proverb "Haraka haraka haina baraka" (roughly translates to "{{linktext|more haste, less speed}}") and [[Literal translation|literally translate]] it to "Hurry hurry has no blessings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWAHILI PROVERBS: METHALI ZA KISWAHILI|url=http://swahiliproverbs.afrst.illinois.edu/proverbs.htm|website=Center of African Studies|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-champaign|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurukh''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊr|ʊ|x}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Kurukh}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also '''Kurux''' and '''Oraon''' or '''Uranw''';&lt;ref&gt;http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nepa1253&lt;/ref&gt; [[Devanagari]]: कुड़ुख़) is a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] spoken by nearly two million [[Oraon]] and [[Kisan tribe|Kisan]] tribespeople of [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Odisha]] and [[West Bengal]], as well as by 65,000 in northern [[Bangladesh]], 28,600 a dialect called Dhangar in [[Nepal]], and about 5,000 in [[Bhutan]]. Some Kurukh speakers are in [[South India]]. It is most closely related to [[Brahui language|Brahui]] and [[Malto language|Malto (Paharia)]]. The language is marked as being in a "vulnerable" state in UNESCO's list of endangered languages.&lt;ref name=guardian-unesco-list&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Lisa|title=Endangered Languages: The Full List|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/apr/15/language-extinct-endangered|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kisan dialect has 206,100 speakers as of 2011.

==Classification==

Kurukh belongs to the Northern Dravidian group of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] family of languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely related to Sauria Paharia and Kumarbhag Paharia, which are often together referred to as [[Malto language|Malto]].&lt;ref&gt;PS Subrahmanyam, "Kurukh", in [[ELL2]]. ''Ethnologue'' assigns Nepali Kurux a separate iso code, ''kxl''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurukh is written in [[Devanagari]], a script also used to write [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. Narayan Oraon, a doctor, invented the Tolong Siki script specifically for Kurukh. Many books and magazines have been published in Tolong Siki script. The Kurukh Literary Society of India has been instrumental in spreading the Tolong Siki script for Kurukh literature.

==Speakers==
It is spoken by 2,053,000 people from the [[Oraon]] and [[Kisan tribe]]s, with 1,834,000 and 219,000 speakers respectively. The literacy rate is 23% in Oraon and 17% in Kisan. Despite the large number of speakers, the language is considered to be [[Endangered language|endangered]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Nettle and Suzanne Romaine. ''Vanishing Voices: The Extinction of the World's Languages''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have introduced the Kurukh language in schools with majority Kurukhar students.

==Alternative names and dialects==
Kurukh has a number of alternative names such as Uraon, Kurux, Kunrukh, Kunna, Urang, Morva, and Birhor. Two dialects, Oraon and Kisan, have 73% intelligibility between them. Oraon but not Kisan is currently being standardised. Kisan is currently endangered, with a decline rate of 12.3% from 1991-2001.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement8.aspx|title=Census of India: Growth of Non-Scheduled Languages-1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001|last=ORGI|website=www.censusindia.gov.in|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

=== Vowels ===
Kurukh has five cardinal vowels. Each vowel has long, short nasalized and long nasalized counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1000447436|title=The Kurux language : grammar, texts and lexicon|last=1970-|first=Kobayashi, Masato,|isbn=9789004347663|location=Leiden|oclc=1000447436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}&lt;!-- [[WP:NOETHNICGALLERIES]] --&gt;The following is a '''list of contemporary ethnic groups'''. There has been constant debate over the classification of [[ethnic group]]s. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be associated with shared [[cultural heritage]], [[ancestry]], [[history]], [[homeland]], [[language|language or dialect]]; where the term "[[culture]]" specifically includes aspects such as [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[ritual]], [[cuisine]], [[national dress|dressing (clothing) style]], and other factors.

By the nature of the concept, ethnic groups tend to be divided into [[ethnic subgroups]], which may themselves be or not be identified as independent ethnic groups depending on the source consulted. Multiracial groups (such as Canadian [[Métis]] and South African [[Coloureds]]) should be listed as subgroups of the ethnic groups they are descended from.

The groups commonly identified as "ethnic groups" (as opposed to [[ethno-linguistic]] phyla, national groups, [[racial group]]s or similar). Smaller groups (i.e. less than 100,000) are often [[List of indigenous peoples|indigenous peoples]].

The '''Marwari''' or '''Marwadi''' are a [[South Asia]]n [[ethno-linguistic]] group in [[India]] and [[Nepal]] that originate from the [[Marwar]] [[Shekhawati]] [[Jaipur]] region of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]] in broader term, India. Their language, also called [[Marwari language|Marwari]], comes under the umbrella of [[Rajasthani language]]s, which is part of the Western Zone of [[Indo-Aryan languages]].

They have been a highly successful business community, first as inland traders during the era of [[Rajput kingdoms]], and later also as investors in industrial production and other sectors. Today, they control many of the country's largest media groups. Although spread throughout India, historically they have been most concentrated in [[Kolkata]] and the hinterlands of central and eastern India.

==Etymology==
The term ''Marwadi'' once referred to the area encompassed by the former [[princely state]] of [[Marwar]], also called the [[Jodhpur]] region of southwest Rajasthan in India. It has evolved to be a designation for the [[Rajasthani people]] in general but it is used particularly with reference to certain [[jāti]]s that fall within the [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] ethnic category.  The most prominent among those communities, whose traditional occupation has been as traders, are the [[Agarwal|Agrawal]]s, [[Khandelwal Vaishya|Khandelwals]], [[Maheshwari]]s and [[Oswal]]s.&lt;ref name=Kudaisya2009p87&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marwari and Chettiar Merchants. 1850s-1950s: Comparative Trajectories |first=Medha M. |last=Kudaisya |title=Chinese and Indian Business: Historical Antecedents |editor1-first=Medha M. |editor1-last=Kudaisya |editor2-first=Chin-Keong |editor2-last=Ng |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2009 |isbn=978-90-04-17279-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQJfjnWly5wC&amp;pg=PA87 |page=87 |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwijendra Tripathi believes that the term ''Marwari'' was probably used by the traders only when they were outside their home region; that is, by the diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=From Community to Class: The Marwaris in a Historical Perspective |first=Dwijendra |last=Tripathi |title=Facets of a Marwar Historian |editor1-first=B. L. |editor1-last=Bhandani |editor2-first=Dwijendra |editor2-last=Tripathi |location=Jaipur |publisher=Publication Scheme |year=1996 |pages=189–196 |isbn=978-81-86782-18-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Marawaris have been known for a tightly-knit social solidarity, described by [[Selig Harrison]] in 1960 as "indissoluble under the impact of the strongest regional solvents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9jbWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|title=India: the most dangerous decades.|last=Harrison|first=Selig, S.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1960|isbn=978-1-40087-780-5|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Marwari, or Marrubhasha, as it is referred to by Marwaris, is the traditional, historical, language of the Marwari ethnicity. The Marwari language is closely related to the Rajasthani language. The latter evolved from the [[Old Gujarati language|Old Gujarati]] (also called ''Old Western Rajasthani'', ''Gujjar Bhakha'' or ''Maru-Gurjar''), language spoken by the people in [[Gujarat]] and Rajasthan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revealing India's past: recent trends in art and archaeology|author=Ajay Mitra Shastri|author2=R.

Interestingly the language was known as the Gujjar Bhakha.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that throughout the state of Rajasthan, people avoid identifying their language by name, preferring to identify themselves as speaking "Rajasthani" with Marwari literature and taught as Rajasthani until secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-documents/lsi/lsi_Rajasthan/5_Marwari.pdf|title=Marwari|last=Mukherjee|first=Kakali|date=2011|website=Census India|page=35|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early origins===
Marwari traders have historically been migratory in habit. The possible causes of this trait include the proximity of their homeland to the major [[Ganges]]-[[Yamuna]] trade route; movement to escape famine; and the encouragement given to them by various rulers of northern India who saw advantages in having their skills in banking and finance.&lt;ref name=Kudaisya2009p87/&gt;

The pattern of Marwari migration became increasingly divergent following the decline in wars between Rajput kingdoms, which the Marwaris had helped to finance, and the decreasing influence of the community over the North Indian caravan trading routes that resulted from the British establishing themselves in the region. The changed focus of migration was also encouraged by the British establishment of new trading routes and centres, as well as by the declining political significance of the Rajput courts whose famed conspicuous consumption had been supported by Marwari money. The community welcomed the relative safety that the British presence offered, as well as the commercial and legal frameworks that they provided and which were more favourable to Marwari activities than the systems prevalent during the earlier period of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and Rajput rule.&lt;ref name=Kudaisya2009p88&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marwari and Chettiar Merchants. 1850s-1950s: Comparative Trajectories |first=Medha M. |last=Kudaisya |title=Chinese and Indian Business: Historical Antecedents |editor1-first=Medha M. |editor1-last=Kudaisya |editor2-first=Chin-Keong |editor2-last=Ng |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2009 |isbn=978-90-04-17279-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQJfjnWly5wC&amp;pg=PA88 |page=88 |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marwari [[Jagat Seth]] family served as bankers to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].

===British era===
After the decline of Mughal authority in Bengal, Marwari traders, bankers and financiers migrated to the growing British power in Kolkata .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rcNdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|title=Commodifying Everything : Relationships of the Market.|last=Strasser|first=Susan|year=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-1-13670-685-1|location=Hoboken|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were particularly significant population shifts to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] between 1835-1850 and Kolkata from the 1870s, as well as to [[Chennai|Madras]].&lt;ref name=Kudaisya2009p88/&gt; They continued to spread into areas of British control throughout the nineteenth century, becoming established as ''sahukars'' (moneylenders) and inland trade-brokers in central India and Maharashtra. The migration of these traders accelerated in the second half of the nineteenth century which led to growing unpopularity, and acts of communal violence against them.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Historian Medha M. Kudaisya has said that the Marwaris:
{{quote|made the transition from being niche players in trading to becoming industrial conglomerates&amp;nbsp;... From being brokers and bankers, the Marwaris went on to break the British monopoly over the jute industry after World War I; they then moved into other industrial sectors, such as cotton and sugar, and set up diversified conglomerates. By the 1950s, the Marwaris dominated the India private industry scenario, emerging as the establishers of its most prominent business houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marwari and Chettiar Merchants. 1850s-1950s: Comparative Trajectories |first=Medha M. |last=Kudaisya |title=Chinese and Indian Business: Historical Antecedents |editor1-first=Medha M. |editor1-last=Kudaisya |editor2-first=Chin-Keong |editor2-last=Ng |publisher=BRILL |location=Leiden |year=2009 |isbn=978-90-04-17279-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQJfjnWly5wC&amp;pg=PA86 |page=86 |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1956, the All-India Marwari Federation opposed a linguistic organisation of states whilst buying up regional language newspapers in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times of India'', 11 February 1956, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, they control many of the country's largest media groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/marwari-power/indian-media-marwaris-write-the-script/37361/1|title=Indian Media: Marwaris Write the Script {{!}} Forbes India|last=Ajwani|first=Deepak|date=18 March 2014|website=Forbes India|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community's control of the Indian economy declined following the country's 1991 economic reforms. From a peak of controlling 24 per cent in 1990, it had fallen to less than 2 per cent in 2000, apparently because of an unwillingness to adapt. The 2000 figure is considered to be lower than the position in 1939, when the community first began its resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Marwaris-losing-business-acumen/articleshow/9005397.cms|title='Marwaris losing business acumen'|last=Niyogi|first=Subhro|date=6 May 2002|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nguni languages''' are a group of [[Bantu languages]] spoken in southern Africa by the [[Nguni people]]. Nguni languages include [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] (sometimes referred to as "Northern Ndebele"), [[Swazi language|Swati]], [[Hlubi language|Hlubi]], [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], [[Bhaca language|Bhaca]], [[Lala language (South Africa)|Lala]], [[Nhlangwini language|Nhlangwini]], [[Southern Ndebele language|Southern Transvaal Ndebele]], and [[Sumayela Ndebele language|Sumayela Ndebele]]. The appellation "Nguni" derives from the [[Nguni cattle]] type. ''Ngoni'' (see below) is an older, or a shifted, variant.

It is sometimes argued that use of ''Nguni'' as a generic label suggests a historical monolithic unity of the peoples in question, where in fact the situation may have been more complex.{{sfn|Wright|1987}} The linguistic use of the label (referring to a subgrouping of Bantu) is relatively stable.

Within a subset of [[Southern Bantu languages|Southern Bantu]], the label "Nguni" is used both [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically]] (in the linguistic sense) and [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] (quite apart from any historical significance).

The Nguni languages are closely related, and in many instances different languages are mutually intelligible; in this way, Nguni languages might better be construed as a [[dialect continuum]] than as a cluster of separate languages. On more than one occasion, proposals have been put forward to create a unified Nguni language.&lt;ref name=EPLouw&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Critical%20Arts/cajv6n1/caj006001004.pdf |title=Language and National Unity in a Post-Apartheid South Africa |author=Eric P.

In scholarly literature on southern African languages, the linguistic classificatory category "Nguni" is traditionally considered to subsume two subgroups: "Zunda Nguni" and "Tekela Nguni."{{sfn|Doke|1954}}{{sfn|Ownby|1985}} This division is based principally on the salient phonological distinction between corresponding [[coronal consonant]]s: Zunda {{IPA|/z/}} and Tekela {{IPA|/t/}} (thus the native form of the name ''Swati'' and the better-known Zulu form ''Swazi''), but there is a host of additional linguistic variables that enables a relatively straightforward division into these two substreams of Nguni.

===Zunda languages===
* [[Zulu language|Zulu]]
* [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]
* [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] (Northern Ndebele or 'Zimbabwean Ndebele')
* [[Southern Ndebele language|Southern Ndebele]]

===Tekela languages===
* [[Swazi language|Swazi]]
* [[Sumayela Ndebele language|Northern Transvaal Ndebele]] (Sumayela Ndebele)
* [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]] {{sfn|Donnelly|2009|p=1-61}}
* [[Bhaca language|Bhaca]] {{sfn|Jordan|1942}}
* [[Hlubi language|Hlubi]] (not the Hlubi dialect of Xhosa)&lt;ref name=LeadershipSubmission&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mkhangelingoma.co.za/heritage/history.pdf |title=Isizwe SamaHlubi: Submission to the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims: Draft 1 |author= |date=July 2004 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lala language (South Africa)|Lala]]
*[[Nhlangwini language|Nhlangwini]]

Maho (2009) also lists S401 [[Old Mfengu language|Old Mfengu]]†

==Characteristics==

The following aspects of Nguni languages are typical:
* A 5-vowel system, by merging the near-close and close series of [[Proto-Bantu]]. (Phuthi has re-acquired a new series of superclose vowels from Sotho)
* Spreading of high tones to the antepenultimate syllable.
* A distinction between high and low tones on noun prefixes, indicating different grammatical roles, accompanied in some cases by an overt pre-prefix called the ''[[Augment (Bantu languages)|augment]]''.
* Development of breathy-voiced consonants, acting as [[depressor consonant]]s.
* Development of [[aspirated consonant]]s.
* Development of [[click consonant]]s.

The '''Nuna''' people, or '''Nunuma''', are subgroup of the Gurunsi people in Southern [[Burkina Faso]], estimated 150,000 population, and [[Ghana]]. The Nuna are known for their masks.&lt;ref&gt;African and Oceanic Art in Jerusalem: The Israel Museum Collection  Douglas Newton - 2001 "The largest subgroup are the Nuna, with the smaller Nunuma, Winiama, Kisena, and Lela on their borders. ... sirigi ("Mother of Masks") of the Dogon, and the karanga masks of the Mossi former kingdom of Yatenga, in northern Burkina Faso."&lt;/ref&gt; The group speaks the [[Nuni language]].&lt;ref&gt; Studies in Kasem Phonetics and Phonology - Page 19 A. K. Awedoba - 2002 -"... classified by Bendor-Samuel (1971) as 'Northern Grusi' together with three other closely related languages: Nuna or Nuni (also referred to as Nunuma or Nounouma), Lyele and Pana. These, its closest 'cousins', are spoken in Burkina Faso.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Nuna art is distinguished in particular by its very colorful masks - red, white and black - statuettes in clay and wood,  stools and  jewels, generally destined to honor the ancestors.

The '''Pathans of Punjab''' ({{lang-pa|{{Nastaliq|پنجابی پٹھان}}}} &lt;small&gt;([[Shahmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;; {{lang-ps|د پنجاب پښتانه}}; also called '''Punjabi Pathans''' are originally [[Pashtun people]] (Pathans) who [[Pashtun diaspora|have settled]] in the [[Punjab region]] of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Punjabi Musalmans by J M Wikely"&gt;Punjabi Musalmans by J M Wikely&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these Pashtun communities are scattered throughout the Punjab and have over time assimilated into the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] society and culture. 

These non-frontier Pathans are usually known by the town or locality in which they are settled, e.g. Jalandhuri Pathans, [[Kasur|Qasuria]] Pathans, [[Multan]]i Pathans, or [[Lahore]].&lt;ref&gt;Punjabi Musalmans by J. M Wikely&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origin ==
{{Further|Pashtun diaspora}}
Colonies of Pathans (Pashtun people) arriving in Punjab are accounted for by Sir Densil Ibbetson in the following manner:{{Quote|During the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]] and [[Suri dynasty|Suri]] dynasties many Pathans migrated to [[Punjab region|Punjab]] especially during the reign of [[Bahlol Khan Lodi]] and [[Sher Shah Suri]]. These naturally belonged to the [[Gharzai]] section (Ghar means mountain, Zai means son i.e. son of mountain) to which these kings themselves belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Punjab castes by Denzil Ibbetson&lt;/ref&gt;|Sir Densil Ibbetson}}

The history of Pathans in India is much earlier. [[Trapusa and Bahalika]], variously assumed to be merchants or slaves from Balkh were the first lay-person to accept Buddha. It should be noted that during that time, the regions west of HinduKush, including Afghanistan were ruled by Mauryan empire and their vassal states of Indo-Greeks. These Indo-Greeks were staunch followers of Vishnu and Buddha and ruled large parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. They gave rise to the Hellenistic form of Buddhism which competed with the Mathura form.

Large numbers of Pathans accompanied the armies of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and [[Babur]], and many of them obtained grants of land in the Punjab plains and founded Pathan colonies which still exist. Many Pathans were driven out of present-day [[Afghanistan]] and [[khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] due to devastated invading forces such as [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol Empire|Mongol armies]], including internal feuds or famine, and have taken refuge in the plains east of the [[Indus River]] where the Mongols marked the line of their aggression.Mehmond Pathan Hoshiarpur were also in the army of Mahmud of Ghazni. Which show strength of Pathan tribes

The tribes most commonly to be found in the Punjab region are the [[Niazi|Niazai]], [[Bangash|Miana, Bangash]], [[Yusufzai]], [[Hassan Zai]], [[Mandanr]], [[Lodhi]], [[Kakar]], [[Sherwani]], [[Orakzai]], [[Tareen]], [[Sulemankhel sulemani]], [[Kakazai]], [[Karlanri]], 
[[barakzai]], [[Khizerzai]] and the Zamand Pathans. Of these the most widely distributed are the Yusufzai, of whom a body of 12,000 accompanied the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor Babur in the final invasion of India, and settled in the plains of India and the Punjab. But as a rule the Pathans who have settled away from the frontier have lost all memory of their tribal divisions, and indeed almost all their national characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;

Some have suggested a Caucasian-origin to the Afghans, possibly from Alexander the Great's conquest of the Indian Subcontinent. Historical evidence for this idea is, however, limited to hypothesis. A hundred years before Alexander was born, Western Civilization's first historian, Herodotus, who tried to write a history of the world, mentioned the Pathans as "the nation of Pakhtuike" (helenized version of the word Pakhtun) who live in Ancient Bactra (modern Afghanistan) and who are "the most warlike of all the Indians". Indeed, there is limited, if any, traceable European DNA among the Afghans. A phylogenetic study investigated the possible genetic relation of Pathans with Greeks and found evidence of a limited contributions of Greek genes in the Pathan population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n1/full/5201726a.html Sadaf Firasat (2007) Y-chromosomal evidence for a limited Greek contribution to the Pathan population of Pakistan, ''European Journal of Human Genetics'' (2007) 15, 121–126. ] {{doi|10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 3% of the Pathan population was found to have one chromosome that could be traced to Europe i.e. the Greeks. These would be the (limited) descendant of the soldiers of Alexander who remained in Afghanistan. A much more likely explanation is that the majority of the Pakhtun peoples characteristics developed in the Indian mountain landscape. One possible origin of the word "Pathan" is from the Sanskrit word for Mountain-top "patha", thus making Pathans the people who came from the mountain tops.

== Main divisions ==
The main tribes of the Pathans in the Punjab are as follows:

=== Niazi Pathans ===
[[Image:Imran Khan.jpg|px200|right|thumb|'''Imran Khan Niazi Shermankhel''' (Former Cricketer &amp; Politician)]]

The [[Niazi]] [[Pashtun People|Pathans]] mainly live in the areas of Punjab like [[Mianwali]], [[Khanewal]] and many other cities of Punjab. Notable and famous Niazis are [[Imran Khan]], [[Attaullah Khan Esakhelvi]], [[Abdul Sattar Khan Niazi]], [[Misbah-ul-Haq]], [[Munir Niazi]], [[Ghulam Akbar Khan Niazi]], [[Sher Afgan Niazi]], [[Inamullah Niazi]], [[Sami Khan (actor)|Mansoor Aslam Khan Niazi (Sami Khan)]], Taifoor Khan Niazi, (TV Actor &amp; Brother of Sami Khan), [[Shadab Khan]], The Khan's of Isakhel the owners/sardars of the area (Khawaneens). (Rokhris and Kundis are sub-clans of the Niazi...the Rokhris are mostly found in Mianwali, and the Kundis are found around D.I. Khan district).

===Khizar Khel Niazi===

[[File:ANiazi.jpg|thumb|'''Asmat Ullah Khan Niazi Khizar Khel''', He is famous for his work in PTV News.]]

[[Khizar Khel]] is a clan of Pashtun tribe Niazi from [[Khaglan Wala]], [[Isakhel Tehsil|Isakhel]].They also live in Khanewal,Sukkur,Karachi,Faisalabad,Bahawalpur and many more cities.

=== Pathans of Taunsa sharif ===
Kakars, Tareens,Miana, Mandokhel tribes of Pashtuns from Balochistan have settled in this region.(According to H.A Rose "descended from miana, brother of [[tareen]], and the cousin of luni).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Jalandhar Pathans ===
[[Image:huak.jpg|px200|right|thumb|Humayun Akhtar Khan]]

The district of [[Jalandhar district|Jalandhar]] is home to well established community of [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], dating back to the 14th century, since the first Afghan King established his rule in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;Jullundur District Gazetteer Volume XIVA 1904&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bangash]], [[Burki]] and [[Lodhi]] tribes were closely connected with the district. The history of the Pathans in the Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar districts is directly connected to the Delhi Sultanate. The Afghans, who played a significant role as part of the nobility, came with their clans to supply fighting men and were, in turn, gifted lands in fertile districts of Punjab, in the Jagirdar system. The kings in Delhi allowed these Khans to create semi-autonomous fiefdoms and govern themselves. This served two purposes: one was to keep them busy in the countryside, so they would remain a step away from the Sultanate itself, as the Afghans had a reputation for being too fiercely independent for the liking of their kings. And the second reason was because all conquering armies from Central Asia had to pass through the Hoshiarpur/Jalandhar region to reach the seat of power in Delhi (Delhi is only a few hours away from Hoshiarpur on horseback).

For this reason, hundreds of thousands of Afghans were settled in these districts in semi-fortified villages, known as "basees" or "bastis" (these Pashtuns sometimes referred to as "basteeon wallay Pathan"), to act as a wall against any would-be invader. In fact, the broader shape of these bastis was created in a semi-circular shape, curving away from Delhi, as a protective shield. These twin districts were sometimes referred to as "Punjab ka Afghanistan", and it was the Sardars of the leading families of this area that, frequently, chose the leadership of the city of Lahore in undivided Punjab as well. 

Two armies of Mongols, one led by Changez Khan's own son as its leading general, were defeated by the Pathans of Hoshiarpur and Jalandhur. The Pathan clans met the Mongols in an adjoining Northern district, Bijwara, near Do-Ab (literally "two rivers"). Extra fortifications were built in the area after the first Mongol attempt to cross through and conquer India. This is why, even at the peak of their power, the Mongols, who created the world's largest land empire, were never able to establish rule over Delhi.

Traditions of the Burki tribe point settlement in the district in the 16th century. The earliest settlements were Barikian and Rasta Ikhwand, both in [[Jalandhar]] city. After Jalandhar was burnt down by the Gurus of [[Kartarpur, India|Kartarpur]] in 1757, Kot Khan Jahan was founded by Khan Jahan. This family was known as the Sadakhel; and other Burki tribes include the Guz, Aliak and Babakhel. Communities of the Burki, in and around the city of Jalandhar were referred to as the basti.

The Babakhel Burki are said to have come from [[Kaniguram]] in [[South Waziristan]] in 1617, accompaniying Shaikh Darwesh, leader of the Roshaniya ([[Pir Roshan]])Muslims. The founded Basti Shaikh, having bought this land from the proprietors of Jalandhar. They are also founded the town of Babakhel.

Basti Guzan was founded in the time of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Shahjahan]], by three sons of Musa Khan of Guz tribe. This Musa Khan had come with Shaikh Darwesh from Kaniguram, and had settled initially in Basti Shaikh. Thry afterwards bought land from the [[Lodhi]]s and [[Sayyid]]s, and founded Basti Guzan.

Other bastis (villages) included Basti Ibrahim Khan, Basti Pir Dad Khan, Basti Shah Quli, Basti Daanishmandan and Basti Nau.

In 1947 the overwhelming majority of these Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar-based Pathans and others in the Indian side moved en masse to Pakistan. Many settled in Lahore and Faislabad.

====Lodi====
The most important and oldest Pashtun settlement in the district was that of the [[Lodhi]] tribe. The Lodi clan name originates from the Pashto word Loya, which means "big" or "great". Many Lodis are very tall in stature. Kot Bure Khan, north of the city of Jalandhar, was said to be the original settlement of the tribe. According to the Ain-i-Akbari, the Jallandhar Mahal was occupied by the Lodi who paid a revenue of 14 lakh of dams. 

The Lodis of the town of Dhogri, six miles north east of Jalandhar, were among the oldest landowners in the district. Their ancestor Tatar Khan, accompanied, Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazna]] to India, and settled in the region. Lodhi's are now found in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan.

Bahlol Khan Lodi, who went on to found the Lodi Dynasty in Delhi (Sikander Khan, his son, built Agra) made Hoshiarpur his operational base when he began his military career as Governor of Punjab. That is one reason why many members of the Lodi clan moved to Hoshiarpur, and founded many cities and towns bearing the clan's name. It was Sikander Khan's brother, Alam Khan Lodi, who invited Babar to invade India in a sort of "palace coup" against his own nephew, Ibrahim Khan Lodi. Ibrahim Khan, who was considered haughty and asked his nobility to bow before him (an unheard of custom among Afghans) was widely considered unfit to be king. This was in direct contrast to Ibrahim Khan's grandfather, Bahlol Khan, who was known as a righteous leader. This led to the First Battle of Panipat. Babar's invading forces were also led by an Afghan, Langar Khan Niazi. The Niazi are a close cousin-clan of the Lodi, both of which belong to the "Bettani" branch of Pakhtuns.

The Marwat Pakhtuns are a sub-clan of the Lodi. A Niazi general was once tasked by the Delhi Sultanate to put down down a Baloch incursion into South-Western Punjab, which was laying waste to large tracts of land. When the Niazi found himself with insufficient men for the job, he reached out to his nearby cousin, Marwat Khan Lodi for assistance. Marwat Khan Lodi is said to have shown up with 100,000 men and crushed the Baloch rebellion. In honor of Marwat Khan's great achievement, his descendants began to use his name to distinguish themselves as a separate clan, thus creating the Marwat clan of Pathans. The area where this battle took place was named "Lakki Marwat" i.e. the place where 1 lakh Marwats assembled. Even today, many Marwat Lodis are found in Lakki Marwat district.

====Pathans of Hoshiarpur====
Along with the Niazi, Lodi, Bangash, Tareen and Burki, there were also the Orakzais (most commonly found in Orakzai Agency, which is named after them) and Alizais (who are branched out of the Wazir, after whom Waziristan is named), Kakar, Sur, Yousafzai, Hassanzai, Kakazai and Shinwari Pathans in these Hoshiarpur and Jalandhur basees. The Niazi clan includes descendants of Khwaja Khan, Mehdi Khan and Suleh Khan. There were also Musakhel tribes in [[Hoshiarpur]]. Many peoples of [[Niazi]] tribe migrated to [[Pakistan]] at the time of Partition and are now settled in [[Multan]], [[Lodhran]], [[Khanewal]]. The famous [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]-language poet [[Munir Niazi]] (from the village Khanpur), a Brigadier-General Niaz Ahmad Khan Niazi and his close cousin, the former [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)]] [[Karamat Rahman Niazi]] also belong to the [[Hoshiarpur]]-based [[Niazi]] clan. General and Admiral Niazi belonged to the village Mochpur in Hoshiarpur District. Their nephew Tanvir Ahmad Khan (Niazi) was a well-respected Pakistani Foreign Secretary. 

The famous landmark near Mochpur was Qilla [Fort] Sher Khan, a fort which was established when Afghan King Ahmed Shah Abdali came to Hoshiarpur to crush a Sikh uprising against his control over Punjab. Certain Niazi clans of Hoshiarpur trace their arrival in the area to this battle. After the battle, the Niazi men remained in the area and were given responsibility for managing the fort, which was named after one of the important warriors from this Afghan-Sikh battle.

Sher Shah Suri's (born Farid Khan Sur; Sur is a cousin-tribe of the Nyazai) family was also settled in the Hoshiarpur/Jalandhar area. Many historians consider Sher Shah to be one of the most competent administrator in the history of the Delhi Sultanate. After Sher Shah's untimely death, his son waged his unsuccessful campaign for the throne against Mughal Emperor Humayun from these Pathan-dominated districts, where he was given refuge. At the height of Mughal power, Emperor Akbar the Great sought to bring these districts under his control more firmly and went to war with these Pathans, but was unsuccessful. Ultimately, Akbar was forced to sue for peace to end hostilities and earn the Afghans favor once more.

=== Kasuri Pathans ===
[[File:Qusuri or ‘Kusuri, an Afghan of Kasur - Tashrih al-aqvam (1825), f.451v - BL Add. 27255.jpg|thumb|Qusuri or Kusuri, a pathan of Kasur - ''Tashrih al-aqvam'' (1825)]]
When the Zamand section was broken up, the Khweshgi (or also pronounced [[Kheshki]]) clan migrated to the Ghorband
defile, and a large number marched tence with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Babur|Babar]] and found great favour at his hands and those of his son [[Humayun]], One section of them settled at [[Kasur]], and are known as
"Qasuria or Kasuri Pathans"&lt;ref name="Punjabi Musalmans by J M Wikely"/&gt;

The Qasuria or kasuri Pathans increased in numbers and importance until the chiefs thought themselves strong enough to refuse to pay tribute to the Mughals. After some severe
fighting the Qasuria Pathans were compelled to give in, they never lost heart however and maintained their independence until 1807, when they were finally subdued by
the Sikhs. After the confiscation of [[Kasur]] by [[Ranjit Singh]], the Pathans were ordered to remain on the left bank of the [[Sutlej]] where their leader was assigned the Jagir of [[Mamdot]], in [[Firozpur District]]. The Mamdot family emigrated to Pakistan, after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] in 1947. One portion of Kasuri Pathan most called Amchozi settled in Bahawalnagar district at Nadir Shah village near to Bahawalnagar city. Bahawalnagar one Bazar name is Nadir Shah Bazar. These Pathan are landlord as well as in government services. Akbar Khan Amchozi is a graduate civil engineer and working as director engineer in Punjab province.

=== Malerkotla Pathans ===
In the Indian Punjabi city of [[Malerkotla]], sixty-five percent of the total population is Muslim and out of this population, twenty percent are Punjabi Pathans.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.khyber.org/articles/2007/StudyofthePathanCommunitiesinF.shtml|title = Study of the Pathan Communities in four States of India|publisher = Khyber|accessdate = 2007-06-07|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080514122925/http://www.khyber.org/articles/2007/StudyofthePathanCommunitiesinF.shtml|archivedate = 2008-05-14|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Pathans trace their ancestry to Shaikh Sadruddin, a pious man of the [[Shirani (Pashtun tribe)|Shirani tribe]] of the [[Darban Kalan and Frontier Region of Drazinda in FR Dera Ismail Khan, NWFP|Darband]] area of what is now the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; Behlol Lodhi (1451–1517), the Afghan king who had most of the western parts of India under his control, desired to rule [[Delhi]] and on his way, he was caught in a sand drift.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; While there was nothing visible in the darkness, the King spotted a dim light of a lamp still burning in the wind. It was the hut of Shaikh Sadruddin and when the king found out, he came to the hut to show his respect and asked the holy man to pray for him to bear a son and have victory.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; During 1451 and 1452, the king married off his daughter Taj Murassa to Shaikh Sadruddin after being enthroned in Delhi, and also gave him the area of Malerkotla.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; The descendents of Shaikh Sadruddin branched into two groups. One started ruling the state and were given the title of ''[[Nawab]]''.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; The other branch lived around the Shrine of Shaikh Sadruddin, controlling its revenue.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt;

One notable thing about the Punjabi Pathans of [[Malerkotla]] is the fact the women strictly observe [[pardah]], albeit they are no longer required to wear the [[burqa]].&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; In regards to language, Pashto was their primary language until 1903. Afterwards, the Malerkotla Pathans began to speak [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; In the city, there are twenty nine shrines to saints from [[Afghanistan]], whom the Malerkotla Pathans revere.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; Although the level of education is low among the community, many of these Pathans serve in the civil service, particularly in the [[Indian Police Service]].&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; Others maintain businesses, rent property, and rear horses.&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt; Because the level of religiosity amongst Malerkotla Pathans is high, many families sent their children to [[madrasah]]s where Qur'anic education is compulsory. For higher education, many children study in schools in [[Patiala]] or [[Ludhiana]].&lt;ref name="Khyber- Pathan Communities in India"/&gt;

=== Multani Pathans ===
The descendants of Zamand very early migrated in large numbers to [[Multan]], to which province they furnished rulers, till the reign of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], when a number of the [[Durrani|Abdali]] tribe under the leadership of Shah Husain were driven from Kandahar by tribal feuds, took refuge in Multan, and being early supplemented by other of their kinsmen who were expelled by Mir Wais, the great [[Ghilzai]] chief, conquered Multan and founded the tribe well known in the Punjab as Multani Pathans.

Zahid Khan Abdali was appointed Governor of Multan with the title of Nawab, at the time of Nadir Shah's invasion. Multan was Governed by different members of this family, until in 1818 the city was captured by the [[Sikh]]s under [[Ranjit Singh]], after a heroic defence in which the Nawab and five of his sons were slain.

Their main clans were the Alizai, Badozai, Bamzai and Saddozai, all clans of the [[Durrani]] tribe. Other tribal communities include the Babar, [[Khogyani (Pashtun tribe)|Khakwani]], [[Tareen]] .&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Rule in the Punjsb 1818-1881 by J Royal Rosebury page 73&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Muzaffargarh District]], the Pathans of the district are related to the Multani Pathans. They settled in [[Muzaffargarh]] in the 18th century, as small groups of Multani Pathan expended their control from the city of Multan. There distribution is as follows; the Alizai Durrani are found at Lalpur, and the [[Popalzai]] are found in Docharkha, while the Babars are based in Khangarh and [[Tareen]] in Kuhawar are other important tribes.&lt;ref&gt;A Gazetteer of Muzaffargarh District Part A 1929 p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language and Culture ==
Majority of the Pashtuns settled in the [[Punjab region]] do not speak [[Pashto]] as their first language any longer. Instead they speak [[Urdu]] or [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]; the Sagri [[Khattak]]s of [[Attock District]] and the [[Chhachh]] area, speak [[Pashto language]] and practice Pashtun culture known as [[Pashtunwali]]. Sections of [[Niazi]] i.e. Sultan khel also speak pashto. The Niazi clan has retained their tribal system and the [[Pashtun culture|Pashtun]] culture compared to other Pathans settled in Punjab. They are known to still follow many aspects of Pashtunwali, the honor-code of the Pakhtuns.

In [[Brahmin]] [[Hindu culture]], a '''Pravara''' (Sanskrit for "most excellent") is a particular Brahmin's descent from a ''[[rishi]]'' (sage) who belonged to their ''[[gotra]]'' (clan). In vedic ritual, the importance of the pravara appears to be in its use by the ritualist for extolling his ancestry and proclaiming, "as a descendant of worthy ancestors, I am a fit and proper person to do the act I am performing." Generally, there are three, five or seven pravaras. The sacred thread [[yajnopavita]] worn on [[upanayana]] has close and essential connection with the concept of pravaras related to Brahmin gotra system. While tying the knots of sacred thread, an oath is taken in the name of each one of these three, five or seven of the most excellent rishis belonging to one's gotra.

The full affiliation of a brāhamana consists of (1) gotra, (2)sutra (of [[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Kalpa]]), (3)[[shakha]], (4)'''pravaras''' .

(Example :) A brahmana named 'Rama' introduces himself as follows : I am 'Rama', of Sarvarna gotra, of Gobhil sutra, of Taittiriya shākha of Saamved, of five pravaras named Bhārgava, Chyāvana, Āpnavan, Aurva and Jāmdagnya (This example is based upon the example given by Pattābhirām Shastri in the introduction to Vedārtha-Pārijata, cf. ref.).

While the ''gotras'' were classified initially according to seven rishis, the '''pravaras''' were classified under the names of the following seven rishis: [[Agastya]],
[[Angiras (sage)|Angirasa]], [[Atri]], [[Bhrigu]], [[Kashyap]], [[Vashista]], and [[Vishvamitra]].

According to the listing of authors included in the verses in Rigved, the rishi [[Jamadagni]] was a descendant of rishi [[Bhrigu]] while the rishis [[Gautama Maharishi|Gautam]] and [[Bharadvaja]] were the descendants of rishi [[Angiras (sage)|Angirasa]].

The pravara identifies the association of a person with two,  three (or sometimes five) of the above-mentioned [[rishis]]. It also signifies  the ''Sutras'' contributed to different [[Vedas]] by those [[rishis]].

For example,  Gothram has 2 rishis associated with it viz., Nidruva and [[Avatsara]]. Another Gothram in Andhra Pradesh has 7 Rishis associated with it viz. Aavatsara, Naidruva, Rebha, Raibha, Sandila, Sandilya.

Pravaras also help in identifying different gotras bearing the same name. For eg: Harita Gotra with Pravaras Angirasa, Ambarisha, Yuvanaswa is different from Harita Gotra which has a single Pravara Vashishta.

The legal status of '''prostitution in Africa''' varies widely. It is frequently common in practice, partially driven by the widespread [[poverty]] in many [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welthungerhilfe.de/799.html |title=Increasing prostitution driven by poverty in drought-stricken Kenya – Welthungerhilfe |publisher=Welthungerhilfe.de |date= |accessdate=2010-01-25 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070103111147/http://www.welthungerhilfe.de/799.html |archive-date=3 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the drivers for the prevalence of [[AIDS]] in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/prostitution-aids.htm |title=AIDS &amp; Prostitution |publisher=Avert.org |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (36.9% in sub-Saharan Africa)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20121212/abci-despenalizacion-prostitucion-reducirvih-201212121818.html |title=La OMS defiende la despenalización de la prostitución para reducir los contagios de VIH |publisher=ABC.es |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire permit the operations of [[brothel]]s. In other countries, [[prostitution]] may be legal, but brothels are not allowed to operate. In some countries where prostitution is illegal, the law is rarely enforced.

[[Transactional sexual relationship]]s are particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa, where they often involve relationships between older men and younger women or girls. In many cases, the woman in a transactional sexual relationship may remain faithful to her boyfriend, while he may have multiple sexual partners. In both of these cases, transactional sex presents an increased risk of [[HIV]] infection. As a result, transactional sex is a factor involved in the spread of [[AIDS in Africa]].

During the colonial era and the years that followed independence, the Ministry of Health issued calling cards identifying professional sex workers and provided them with medical health checks. However, this system was abandoned in the 1980s. Public order laws are sometimes used against sex workers.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; Street prostitutes report harassment, violence and extortion from the police.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

In rural areas widows will discretely turn to prostitution to support her family. This is a cultural and social tradition that is not regarded as prostitution by the community, but is regarded as a method of preserving the family name.

The '''Rawe''', also known as '''Rave''', '''Rawa''' and '''Rawad''', are a section of [[Rajputs]] found in the western districts of the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]] .&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pardesh Volume XLII  Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 1215 to 1219&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The word ''Ravad'' is said to be an abbreviation of the words Rajput Vahini Dal, or battalion of Rajputs. They are said to have settled in [[Uttar Pradesh]] during the rule of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Shahjahan]]. The Rawe are further divided into a number of clans called [[gotra]]s, and use Chaudhary, Kumar and Kunwar as surnames. In terms of distribution, they are found mainly in the districts of [[Muzaffarnagar District|Muzaffarnagar]], [[Meerut District|Meerut]] and [[Bijnor District|Bijnor]]. They speak [[Khari boli]] as well as standard [[Hindi language|Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1232 to 1214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
The community is basically one of small farmers. Settled agriculture is their traditional and primary occupation, along with animal husbandry. They live in multi-caste villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters. Their customs are similar to other [[Hindu]] peasant [[caste]]s, like the [[Jat]] and [[Gujjar]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1217&lt;/ref&gt;

The community has a caste council, known as the Rawa Sammelan, to deal with the problems within the community at the village and inter-village levels.  This includes resolving disputes within the community. The caste council is headed by a chaudhary.

The Rawa are [[Hindu]] and their main deities are the Deota ka than and bhumia.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1218&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">{{Politics of Romania}}

The [[Constitution of Romania|Romanian Constitution]] (Article 62), under the conditions imposed by the Electoral Law, provides seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] for the party and cultural association of [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minorities in Romania]] (with the limitation that each national minority is to be represented by one organization only). Traditionally, these groups support the government in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.zf.ro/zf-24/minoritatile-nu-participa-la-viitoarea-guvernare-3611924/ "Minorităţile nu participă la viitoarea guvernare" ("Minorities Will Not Participate in the Next Government")], ''Ziarul Financiar'', 5 December 2008; accessed October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The number of seats awarded to ethnic minorities varied from 10 in 1990 up to 18 between 2000 and 2016. Following the [[Romanian legislative election, 2016|2016 elections]], 17 seats were awarded in accordance with the constitutional provision.

'''Science and technology in Kazakhstan''' outlines government policies to develop science, technology and innovation in [[Kazakhstan]].

== Development strategies ==

=== Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy ===
[[File:GDP_in_Central_Asia_by_economic_sector,_2005_and_2013.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GDP_in_Central_Asia_by_economic_sector,_2005_and_2013.svg|thumb|GDP in Central Asia by economic sector, 2005 and 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 14.2]]
The ''Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy'' was adopted by presidential decree in 1997. Apart from national security and political stability, it focuses on growth based on an open-market economy with a high level of foreign investment, as well as on health, education, energy, transport, communication, infrastructure and professional training.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Central Asia. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Mukhitdinova|first=Nasiba|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=365–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first medium-term implementation plan expired in 2010, Kazakhstan rolled out a second plan to 2020. It focuses on accelerating diversification of the economy through industrialization and infrastructure development; the development of human capital; better social services, including housing; stable international relations; and stable interethnic relations.  According to the 2009 census, Kazakhs make up 63% of the population and ethnic Russians 24%. Small minorities (less than 3%) make up the remainder, including Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Tatars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Two programmes underpin the ''Strategic Plan'' to 2020, the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development (2011−2020) and the State Programme for Educational Development (2011−2014), both adopted by decree in 2010. The latter is designed to ensure access to quality education and fixes a number of targets. For instance, by 2020:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=State Programme for Educational Development (2011−2014)|last=|first=|publisher=Government of Kazakhstan|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 90% of secondary schools are to be using an e-learning system;
* 52% of teachers are to hold a bachelor's or master's degree;
* the standard of all secondary schools is to be raised to the level of the country's Nazarabayev Intellectual Schools, which foster critical thinking, autonomous research, a deep analysis of information and proficiency in Kazakh, English and Russian;
* Government scholarships for university students are to increase by 25% (by 2016);
* 80% of students who complete their degree under a government grant scheme are to be employed in their field of specialization a year after graduation.
The State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development focuses on the twin goals of diversifying the economy and improving Kazakhstan's competitiveness by creating an environment more conducive to industrial development and developing priority economic sectors, including via effective interaction between the government and business sectors. Kazakhstan's economic priorities to 2020 are agriculture, mining and metallurgical complexes, the energy sector, oil and gas, engineering, information and communication technologies (ICTs), chemicals and petrochemicals. Targets include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* raising domestic research spending to 1% of GDP by 2015; 
* increasing the number of internationally recognized patents to 30; 
* opening two centres with industrial expertise, three design bureaux and four technology parks; 
* raising the share of non-primary exports to at least 40% of exports by 2014; 
* raising labour productivity in manufacturing by a factor of no less than 1.5 by 2020; and 
* raising the contribution of the manufacturing sector to at least 12.5% of GDP by 2020.
It is estimated that, by 2006, two-thirds of Kazakh firms were privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spechler|first=1.|date=2008|title=The Economies of Central Asia: a Survey|url=|journal=Comparative Economic Studies|volume=50|pages=30–52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prices in Kazakhstan are almost completely market-based and banking and other financial institutions are much better established than elsewhere in the region. The government can dialogue with private enterprises through Atameken, an association of more than 1 000 enterprises from different sectors, and with foreign investors through the Foreign Investors’ Council, set up in 1998. Kazakhstan nevertheless remains attached to state-led capitalism, with state-owned companies remaining dominant in strategic industries. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the Kazakh government reacted by stepping up its involvement in the economy, even though it had created a wealth fund, Samruk−Kazyna, the same year to further the privatization of state-controlled businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic Reform and Institutional Change in Central Asia: towards a New Model of the Developmental State? Research Papers 2012/05|last=Stark|first=M.|last2=Ahrens|first2=J.|publisher=Private Hochschule|year=2012|isbn=|location=Göttingen, Germany|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samruk−Kazyna resulted from the 2008 merger of two joint stock companies, the Kazakhstan Holding for the Management of State Assets (Samruk) and the Sustainable Development Fund (Kazyna). Samruk−Kazyna is charged with modernizing and diversifying the Kazakh economy by attracting investment to priority economic sectors, fostering regional development and strengthening inter-industry and inter-regional links. Oil and gas represent 60−70% of Kazakh exports. A 2% reduction in oil revenue in 2013, subsequent to a drop in prices, cost the Kazakh economy US$1.2 billion, according to Ruslan Sultanov, Director-General of the Centre for Development of Trade Policy, a joint stock company of the Ministry of the Economy and Budget Planning. More than half (54%) of processed products were exported to Belarus and the Russian Federation in 2013, compared to 44% prior to the adoption of the Customs Union in

=== Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy ===
In December 2012, President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] announced the ''[[Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy]]'' with the slogan ‘Strong Business, Strong State.’ This pragmatic strategy proposes sweeping socio-economic and political reforms to hoist Kazakhstan among the top 30 economies by 2050. In his January 2014 state of the nation address, the president observed that ‘OECD members have covered a journey of deep modernization. They also demonstrate high levels of investment, research and development, labour efficiency, business opportunities and standards of living. These are the standards for our entrance into the ranks of the 30 most developed nations.’&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kazakhembus.com|title=The Kazakhstan Way - 2050: One Goal, One Interest and One Future. State of the Nation Address by President Nursultan Nazarbayev|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promising to explain the strategy's goals to the population in order to ensure public support, the president stressed that ‘the well-being of ordinary citizens should serve as the most important indicator of our progress.’ At the institutional level, he pledged to create an atmosphere of fair competition, justice and rule of law and to ‘shape and implement new counter-corruption strategies.’ Promising local governments more autonomy, he recalled that ‘they must be accountable to the public.’ He pledged to introduce principles of meritocracy into human resources policy for state-owned enterprises and companies. The president recognized the ‘need to update relationships between the state and non-governmental organizations and the private sector’ and announced a privatization programme. A list of state enterprises to be privatized was to be drawn up by the government and the Samruk−Kazyna sovereign wealth fund in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first stage of the ''2050 Strategy'' focuses on making a ‘modernization leap’ by 2030. The aim is to develop traditional industries and create a processing industrial sector. Singapore and the Republic of Korea are cited as models. The second stage to 2050 will focus on achieving sustainable development via a shift to a knowledge economy reliant on engineering services. High value-added goods are to be produced in traditional sectors during this second stage. In order to smooth the transition to a knowledge economy, there will be a reform of laws related to venture capital, intellectual property protection, support for research and innovation and commercialization of scientific results. Knowledge and technology transfer will be a key focus, with the establishment of research and engineering centres, in cooperation with foreign companies. Multinational companies working in major oil and gas, mining and smelting sectors will be encouraged to create industries to source required products and services. Technology parks will be reinforced, such as the new Innovative Intellectual Cluster at [[Nazarbayev University]] in Astana and the Alatau Information Technology Park in Almaty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In its ''2050 Strategy'', Kazakhstan gives itself 15 years to evolve into a knowledge economy. New sectors are to be created during each five-year plan. The first of these, covering the years 2010−2014, focused on developing industrial capacity in car manufacturing, aircraft engineering and the production of locomotives, passenger and cargo railroad cars. During the second five-year plan to 2019, the goal is to develop export markets for these products. To enable Kazakhstan to enter the world market of geological exploration, the country intends to increase the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors such as oil and gas. It also intends to develop rare earth metals, given their importance for electronics, laser technology, communication and medical equipment. The second five-year plan coincides with the development of the Business 2020 roadmap for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will make provision for the allocation of grants to SMEs in the regions and for microcredit. The government and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs also plan to develop an effective mechanism for helping start-ups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During subsequent five-year plans to 2050, new industries will be established in fields such as mobile, multi-media, nano- and space technologies, robotics, genetic engineering and alternative energy. Food processing enterprises will be developed with an eye to turning the country into a major regional exporter of beef, dairy and other agricultural products. Low-return, water-intensive crop varieties will be replaced with vegetable, oil and fodder products. The ''Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy'' fixes a target of halving the share of energy revenue in GDP and ensuring that non-resource goods represent 70% of exports by 2050. As part of the shift to a ‘green economy’ by 2030, 15% of acreage will be cultivated with water-saving technologies. Experimental agrarian and innovational clusters will be established and drought-resistant [[genetically modified crops]] developed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Infrastructure development is a priority. In his state of the nation address of January 2014, the president said that highways were currently under construction to link Kazakh cities and turn Kazakhstan into a logistics hub linking Europe and Asia. ‘The Western Europe–Western China corridor is nearly completed and a railway line is being built to Turkmenistan and Iran to gain access for goods to ports in the Gulf,’ the president said. ‘We should increase the capacity of Kazakhstan’s port in Aktau and simplify exportimport procedures. Upon completion, the 1 200 km-long Zhezkazgan−Shalkar−Beineu railway will connect the east and west of the country, providing access to the Caspian and Caucasus regions in the west and to the Chinese port of Lianyungang on the Pacific coast in the east.’&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The traditional energy sector is also to be developed.  Existing thermal power stations, many of which already use energy-saving technologies, will be equipped with clean energy technologies. A research centre on future energy and the green economy is to be established by the time Expo 2017 takes place. Environmentally friendly fuel and electric vehicles are to be introduced in public transportation. A new refinery will also be established to produce gas, diesel and aviation fuels. Endowed with the world's biggest uranium reserves, Kazakhstan also plans to set up nuclear power plants to satisfy the country's growing energy needs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In February 2014, the National Agency for Technological Development signed an agreement with the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector and a private investor for the establishment of the Central Asia Renewable Energy Fund. Over the next 8−10 years, the fund will invest in Kazakh projects for renewable and alternative energy sources, with an initial endowment of US$ 50−100 million, two-thirds of which is to come from private and foreign investment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oilnews.kz/en/home/news|title=Kazakhstan creates investment fund for projects in the field of renewable energy sources|last=|first=|date=|work=Oil News|access-date=30 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the targets of ''Kazakhstan's 2050 Strategy'' are:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Kazakhstan is to increase per capita GDP from US$13 000 in 2012 to US$60 000 by 2050;
* With the urban population due to rise from 55% to 70% of the total, towns and cities are to be linked by high-quality roads and high-speed transport (trains) by 2050;
* Small and medium-sized businesses are to produce up to 50% of GDP by 2050, compared to 20% at present;
* Kazakhstan is to become a leading Eurasian centre of medical tourism (possible introduction of universal medical insurance);
* Annual GDP growth is to reach at least 4%, with the volume of investment rising from 18% to 30%;
* Non-resource goods are to represent 70% of exports and the share of energy in GDP to be halved; GERD to rise to 3% of GDP to allow for the development of new high-tech sectors;
* As part of the shift to a ‘green economy’,  by 2030,15% of acreage is to be cultivated with water-saving technologies; agrarian science is to be developed; experimental agrarian and innovation clusters are to be established; drought-resistant GM crops are to be developed;
* a research centre on future energy and the green economy is to be launched by 2017; and
* a Geological Cluster of Schools is to be launched at Nazarbayev University by 2015.

== Legal framework for science and innovation ==
In February 2011, Kazakhstan adopted the Law on Science. The law encompasses education, science and industry. It has established national research councils in priority areas, including both Kazakh and foreign scientists, thereby enabling Kazakh scientists to participate in high-level decision-making. The decisions adopted by national research councils are executed by the Ministry of Education and Science and line ministries. The law has prioritized the following areas: energy research; innovative technologies in the processing of raw materials; ICTs; life sciences; and basic research. It has introduced three streams of research funding:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharman|first=A.|date=2012|title=Modernization and Growth in Kazakhstan|url=|journal=Central Asian Journal of Global Health|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* basic funding to support scientific infrastructure, property and salaries;
* grant funding to support research programmes; and
* programme-targeted funding to resolve strategic challenges.
The originality of this funding framework is that public research institutions and universities may use the funding to invest in scientific infrastructure and utilities, information and communication tools and to cover staffing costs. Funding is disbursed via calls for proposals and tenders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Law on Science has established a system of peer review for research grant applications from universities and research institutes. These competitive grants are examined by the national research councils. The government also plans to increase the share of funding for applied research to 30% and that for experimental development to 50%, leaving 20% for basic research. The law introduced a change to the tax code which reduces corporate income tax by 150% to compensate for businesses’ research expenditure. In parallel, the law extends intellectual property protection. In addition, public and private enterprises are eligible for state loans, so as to encourage the commercialization of research results and attract investment. In order to ensure coherence, independence and transparency in the management of projects and programmes involving science, technology and innovation, the government created the National Centre for State Scientific and Technical Expertise in July 2011. A joint stock company, the centre runs the national research councils, monitors ongoing projects and programmes and evaluates their impact, while maintaining a project database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Within the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development, a law was adopted in January 2012 to provide state support for industrial innovation; it establishes the legal, economic and institutional bases for industrial innovation in priority sectors of the economy and identifies means of state support. Within the same programme, the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies has developed an ''Inter-industry Plan'' to stimulate innovation through the provision of grants, engineering services, business incubators and so on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Technology policy ==
[[File:GDP per capita and GERD GDP ratio in the Black Sea countries, 2010–2013 (average).svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GDP%20per%20capita%20and%20GERD%20GDP%20ratio%20in%20the%20Black%20Sea%20countries,%202010%E2%80%932013%20(average).svg|thumb|GDP per capita and GERD GDP ratio in Kazakhstan, 2010–2013 (average); other countries are given for comparison. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 12.4]]
The Council on Technology Policy was established in 2010 within the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development. The Council on Technology Policy is responsible for formulating and implementing the state policy on industrial innovation. The National Agency for Technological Development, which was established in 2011, co-ordinates technology programmes and government support. It carries out foresight exercises and planning, monitors programmes, maintains a database on innovation projects and their commercialization, manages relevant infrastructure and co-operates with international bodies to obtain information, education and funding. The main focus of innovation policy for the first three years (2011–2013) is to make enterprises more efficient through technology transfer, technological modernization, the development of business acumen and the introduction of relevant technologies. The following two years will be devoted to developing new competitive products and processes for manufacture. The focus will be on developing project finance, including through joint ventures. In parallel, efforts will be made to organize public events, such as seminars and exhibitions, to expose the public to innovation and to innovators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Astana. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies, which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. The Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Investment trends ===

Kazakhstan devoted 0.18% of GDP to research and development (R&amp;D) in 2013 and 0.17% of GDP to R&amp;D in 2015, down from a decadal high of 0.28% in 2005. The economy has grown faster (by 6% in 2013)  than gross domestic expenditure on research and development, which only progressed from PPP$598 million to PPP$714 million between 2005 and 2013. As long as economic growth remains strong, it will be difficult to raise the country's level of expenditure on research and development to 1% of GDP by 2015, the ambitious target of the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development, which was adopted in 2010. The [[Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy]] fixes a target of devoting 3% of GDP to research and development by 2050.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baiterek.gov.kz/en|title=State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development.|last=|first=|date=19 March 2010|website=Government of Kazakhstan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the business enterprise sector financed half of all research (52%), the government one-quarter (25%) and higher education one-sixth (16.3%). Since 2007, the share of the business sector in research has progressed from 45% to 52%, largely to the detriment of the government share, which has shrunk from 37% to 25% of total spending. The share of the private non-profit sector has climbed from barely 1% in 2007 to 7% in 2011. Research remains largely concentrated in the country's largest city and former capital, Almaty, home to 52% of research personnel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Trends in GERD GDP ratio in Central Asia, 2001−2013.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trends_in_GERD_GDP_ratio_in_Central_Asia,_2001%E2%88%922013.svg|thumb|Trends in research expenditure in Central Asia, as a percentage of GDP, 2001−2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: 2030 (2015), Figure 14.3]]Public research is largely confined to institutes, with universities making only a token contribution. Research institutes receive their funding from national research councils under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education and Science. Their output, however, tends to be disconnected from market needs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Only one in eight (12.5%) manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. There appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, even if most industrial enterprises do not conduct research themselves, as enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Innovation expenditure more than doubled in Kazakhstan between 2010 and 2011, representing KZT 235 billion (circa US$1.6 billion), or around 1.1% of GDP. Some 11% of the total was spent on research and development. This compares to about 40–70% of innovation expenditure in developed countries. This augmentation was due to a sharp rise in product design and the introduction of new services and production methods over this period, to the detriment of the acquisition of machinery and equipment which has traditionally made up the bulk of Kazakhstan's innovation expenditure. Training costs represented just 2% of innovation expenditure, a much lower share than in developed countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation Performance Review|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York and Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science Fund ===
In 2006, the government set up the Science Fund within the State Programme for Scientific Development 2007−2012, in order to encourage market-oriented research by fostering collaboration with private investors. About 80% of the funds disbursed go to research institutes. The fund provides grants and loans for projects in applied research in priority areas for investment, as identified by the government's High Scientific Technology Committee, which is headed by the prime minister. For the period 2007−2012, these were:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* hydrocarbons, mining and smelting sectors and correlated service areas (37%);
* biotechnologies (17%);
* information and space technologies (11%);
* nuclear and renewable energy technologies (8%);
* nanotechnologies and new materials (5%);
* other (22%).
The State Programme for Scientific Development 2007−2012 stipulated that the Science Fund should channel 25% of all science funding by 2010. However, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the government's contribution to the fund dropped. The fund adapted by offering more flexible terms, such as interest- and tax-free loans, and by extending the loan period up to 15 years. In parallel, Kazakh scientists were encouraged to reach out to Western partners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in education and research ==
Kazakhstan devotes less to education (2.8% of GDP in 2014) than either Kyrgyzstan (5.5% of GDP in 2014) or Tajikistan (5.2% of GDP in 2014). The share of GDP devoted to higher education has remained stable since 2005 but modest: 0.43% of GDP in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?queryid=181|title=Database on government expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP|last=|first=|date=6 June 2017|website=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan has nevertheless made great strides in improving the quality of education over the past decade. It now plans to generalize quality education by raising the standard of all secondary schools to the level of its Nazarabayev Intellectual Schools by 2020, which foster critical thinking, autonomous research, a deep analysis of information and proficiency in Kazakh, English and Russian. Kazakhstan is generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school and university, in order to facilitate international ties. Nazarbayev University has been designed as an international research university. The Kazakh government has pledged to increase university scholarships by 25% by 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2007, the government adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the [[Bologna Process]]. This process seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area. Several higher education institutions in Kazakhstan (90 of which are private) are members of the European University Association.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Share of women among researchers employed in the business enterprise sector, 2013 or closest year.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Share%20of%20women%20among%20researchers%20employed%20in%20the%20business%20enterprise%20sector,%202013%20or%20closest%20year.svg|thumb|Share of Kazakh women among researchers employed in the business enterprise sector, 2013 or closest year. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 3.4]]
In 2013, the higher education sector performed 31% of research in 2013 and employed more than half (54%) of researchers. There were 1,046 researchers per million inhabitants in Kazakhstan (in head counts).  In Central Asia, only Uzbekistan has a greater researcher density: 1,097 per million population in 2011. The global average in 2014 was 1,083 researchers per million population (in full-time equivalents).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Kazakhstan has maintained gender parity since the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s. In 2013, 51.5% of Kazakh researchers were women. Kazakh women dominated medical and health research and represented 45–55% of researchers in engineering and technology. In the business sector, every second researcher was a woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Trends in research output ==
[[File:Growth_in_scientific_output_has_accelerated_in_Kazakhstan_since_2012.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Growth_in_scientific_output_has_accelerated_in_Kazakhstan_since_2012.svg|thumb|Scientific publications from Central Asia catalogued by Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded, 2005-2014, UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.6]]
The number of scientific papers published in Central Asia grew by almost 50% between 2005 and 2014, driven by Kazakhstan, which overtook Uzbekistan over this period to become the region's most prolific scientific publisher, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Kazakh scientists specialize in physics, followed by chemistry. Between 2005 and 2014, Kazakh scientists tripled their output to 600 articles in a year. They produced 35% of Central Asian articles recorded in the Thomson Reuters' database in 2005 and as many as 56% in 2014. Output nevertheless remains modest. There were 36 articles per million inhabitants in  Kazakhstan in 2014, compared to 15 per million for Kyrgyzstan, 11 per million for Uzbekistan and 5 per million for both Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The development of more international partnerships may explain the steep rise in Kazakh publications recorded in the Science Citation Index Expanded since 2008. The main partners of Kazakh scientists between 2008 and 2014 were Russians, followed by American, German, British and Japanese scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite persistently low investment in research by all five Central Asian republics, national development strategies are nonetheless focusing on developing knowledge economies and new high-tech industries. However, just five Kazakh patents were registered at the US Patent and Trademark Office between 2008 and 2013, compared to three for Uzbek inventors and none at all for the other three Central Asian republics, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:The most prolific countries in Central Asia – Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan – specialize in physics and chemistry.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_most_prolific_countries_in_Central_Asia_%E2%80%93_Kazakhstan_and_Uzbekistan_%E2%80%93_specialize_in_physics_and_chemistry.svg|thumb|Cumulative total of articles by Central Asians between 2008 and 2013, by field of science. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.6]]
Kazakhstan is Central Asia's main trader in high-tech products. Kazakh imports nearly doubled between 2008 and 2013, from US$2.7 billion to US$5.1 billion. There has been a surge in imports of computers, electronics and telecommunications; these products represented an investment of US$744 million in 2008 and US$2.6 billion five years later. The growth in exports was more gradual – from US$2.3 billion to US$3.1 billion – and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$1.5 billion) and 83% (US$2.6 billion) in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== International co-operation ==
Like the other four Central Asian republics, Kazakhstan is a member of several international bodies, including the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]. Kazakhstan and the other four republics are also members of the [[Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program|Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation]] (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the ''CAREC 2020 Strategy'', a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members’ competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the [[Caspian Sea]] and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Kazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it may encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Countries in the Black Sea basin. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Erocal|first=Deniz|last2=Yegorov|first2=Igor|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=324–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan has participated in two research programmes launched by the predecessor of the Eurasian Economic Union, the [[Eurasian Economic Community]].The first is the Innovative Biotechnologies Programme (2011–2015). It involved Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and Tajikistan. Within this programme, prizes were awarded at an annual bio-industry exhibition and conference. In 2012, 86 Russian organizations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany. At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. ‘In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,’ he said. ‘Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.’&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The second project of the Eurasian Economic Community was the establishment of the  Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3–90 million and is implemented within a public–private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Kazakhstan has also been involved in a project launched by the European Union in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage [[European Union's scientific cooperation beyond the bloc|Central Asian countries to participate in research projects]] within [[Horizon 2020]], the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research project is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions – universities, companies and research institutes – for funding of up to €10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[International Science and Technology Center]] (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer. ISTC branches have been set up in the following countries party to the agreement: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The headquarters of ISTC were moved to Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in June 2014, three years after the Russian Federation announced its withdrawal from the centre.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Kazakhstan is not a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD) but the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the OECD in January 2015 for a two-year Country Programme in support of 'an ambitious set of reforms of Kazakhstan's policies and institutions'.   This cooperation led to the publication of an ''OECD Review of Innovation Policy'' devoted to Kazakhstan in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-bolsters-relationship-with-kazakhstan-signs-kazakhstan-country-programme-agreement.htm|title=OECD bolsters relationship with Kazakhstan – Signs Kazakhstan Country Programme Agreement|last=|first=|date=22 January 2015|work=OECD|access-date=31 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan became the 162nd member of the [[World Trade Organization]] on 30 November 2015.

'''Sex education''' is the instruction of issues relating to [[human sexuality]], including emotional relations and responsibilities, [[human sexual anatomy]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[age of consent]], [[reproductive health]], [[reproductive rights]], [[safe sex]], [[birth control]] and [[sexual abstinence]]. Sex education that covers all of these aspects is known as [[comprehensive sex education]].  Common avenues for sex education are parents or caregivers, formal school programs, and public health campaigns.

Traditionally, [[adolescent]]s in many cultures were not given any information on sexual matters, with the discussion of these issues being considered [[taboo]]. Such instruction, as was given, was traditionally left to a child's parents, and often this was put off until just before a child's marriage. The [[progressive education]] movement of the late 19th century, however, led to the introduction of "[[social hygiene]]" in North American school curricula and the advent of school-based sex education.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health|year=2013|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite early inroads of school-based sex education, most of the information on sexual matters in the mid-20th century was obtained informally from friends and the media, and much of this information was deficient or of dubious value, especially during the period following [[puberty]], when curiosity about sexual matters was the most acute. This deficiency was heightened by the increasing incidence of [[teenage pregnancies]], particularly in Western countries after the 1960s. As part of each country's efforts to reduce such pregnancies, programs of sex education were introduced, initially over strong opposition from parent and religious groups.

The outbreak of [[AIDS]] has given a new sense of urgency to sex education. In many [[Africa]]n countries, where AIDS is at epidemic levels (see [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]]), sex education is seen by most scientists as a vital [[public health]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Namibia National Policy on HIV/AIDS for the Education Sector|url=http://www.youth-policy.com//Policies/NBANatl_Pol_HIV_AIDS_Education_Sector.pdf|publisher=USAID Health Policy Initiative|accessdate=November 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108060907/http://www.youth-policy.com//Policies/NBANatl_Pol_HIV_AIDS_Education_Sector.pdf|archivedate=November 8, 2013|year=2003|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some international organizations such as [[Planned Parenthood]] consider that broad sex education programs have global benefits, such as controlling the risk of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the advancement of [[women's rights]] (see also reproductive rights).

==Definitions==
Burt defined sex education as the study of the characteristics of beings: a male and female. Such characteristics make up the person's sexuality. Sexuality is an important aspect of the life of a human being and almost all people, including children, want to know about it. Sex education includes all the educational measures which - regardless of the particular method used - may center on sex. He further said that sex education stands for protection, presentation extension, improvement and development of the family based on accepted ethical ideas.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare&gt;Referred in [http://www.educationalleaders.govt.nz/Leadership-development/Professional-information/Principals-sabbatical-reports/Report-archives-for-2007-2011/Primary-award-recipients-2011/De-La-Mare-Jeanette paper by Jeanette De La Mare. October 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leepson sees sex education as instruction in various physiological, psychological and sociological aspects of sexual response and reproduction.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare /&gt; Kearney (2008) also defined sex education as "involving a comprehensive course of action by the school, calculated to bring about the socially desirable attitudes, practices and personal conduct on the part of children and adults, that will best protect the individual as a human and the family as a social institution." Thus, sex education may also be described as "sexuality education", which means that it encompasses education about all aspects of sexuality, including information about [[family planning]], [[reproduction]] ([[Human fertilization|fertilization]], [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and development of the [[embryo]] and [[fetus]], through to childbirth), plus information about all aspects of one's sexuality including: [[body image]], [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual pleasure]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], decision making, communication, [[dating]], [[Intimate relationship|relationships]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and how to avoid them, and [[birth control]] methods.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare /&gt; Various aspects of sex education are considered appropriate in school depending on the age of the students or what the children can comprehend at a particular point in time. Rubin and Kindendall expressed that sex education is not merely the topics of reproduction and teaching how babies are conceived and born. Instead, it has a far richer scope and goal of helping children incorporate sex more meaningfully into their present and future life and to provide them with some basic understanding of virtually every aspect of sex by the time they reach full maturity.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin and Kindendall (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Evidence shows that a combination of comprehensive sex education and access to birth control appears to decrease the rates of unintended pregnancies among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oringanje|first=Chioma|last2=Meremikwu|first2=Martin M.|last3=Eko|first3=Hokehe|last4=Esu|first4=Ekpereonne|last5=Meremikwu|first5=Anne|last6=Ehiri|first6=John E.|date=2016-02-03|title=Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD005215|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005215.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26839116}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis that compared comprehensive sex education programs with abstinence-only programs found that abstinence-only programs did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, but rather may have increased it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiCenso|first1=A|last2=Guyatt|first2=G|last3=Willan|first3=A|last4=Griffith|first4=L|title=Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: systematic review of randomized controlled trials.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Jun 15, 2002|volume=324|issue=7351|pages=1426|pmid=12065267|pmc=115855|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the [[risky sexual behavior|risky behaviors]] reported by young people as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

According to UNFPA, "A 2010 review found that 'gender-focused' curricula – meaning curricula that integrate gender equality into the learning material – were substantially more effective in reducing risky behaviors than programmes that did not consider gender."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt; Research has also shown that delay in sexual initiation, use of condoms and practice contraception has been a result of young people adopting egalitarian attitudes about gender roles. These individuals were also found to be less likely engaged in violent relationships and have a lower rate of STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancy.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

By emphasizing rights and gender issues, these programs help reduce gender-based violence and bullying, promote safe schools, empower young people to advocate for their own rights, and advance gender equality.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

"Few sexual health interventions are designed with input from adolescents. Adolescents have suggested that sex education should be more positive with less emphasis on [[anatomy]] and scare tactics; it should focus on negotiation skills in sexual relationships and [[communication]]; and details of sexual health clinics should be advertised in areas that adolescents frequent (for example, school toilets, shopping centres)."&lt;ref name=" DiCenso"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiCenso |first1=A.|year=2002 |title=Interventions to Reduce Unintended Pregnancies Among Adolescents: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/324/7351/1426|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=324 |issue=7351|page=1426 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426 |pmid=12065267 |pmc=115855|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the report showed "Comprehensive programs worked for both genders, for all major ethnic groups, for sexually inexperienced and experienced teens, in different settings, and in different communities."&lt;ref name="Kirby2007" /&gt;

[[The United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) recommends comprehensive sexuality education, as it enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality. According to UNFPA,&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNFPA Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A Focus on Human Rights and Gender|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/UNFPA_OperationalGuidance_WEB3.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is taught over several years, introducing age-appropriate information consistent with the evolving capacities of young people. It includes scientifically accurate, curriculum-based information about human development, anatomy and pregnancy. It also includes information about contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. And it goes beyond information, to encourage confidence and improved communication skills. Curricula should also address the social issues surrounding sexuality and reproduction, including cultural norms, family life and interpersonal relationships."

Human rights issues, gender equality and gender roles should be integrated into every aspect of these discussions. This includes human rights protection, fulfilment and empowerment; the impact of gender discrimination; the importance of equality and gender-sensitivity; and the ideas underlying gender roles. Sexual abuse, gender-based violence and harmful practices should also be discussed. Taken together, all this information teaches young people the life skills necessary to assume responsibility for their own behavior and to respect the rights of others."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

[[Comprehensive sex education|Comprehensive sexuality education]] "enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality and health. These programmes build life skills and increase responsible behaviors, and because they are based on human rights principles, they help advance human rights, gender equality and the empowerment of young people."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org" /&gt;

Sex education may be taught informally, such as when someone receives information from a conversation with a parent, friend, religious leader, or through the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref&gt;Philliber, SG and ML Tatum. "Sex Education and the Double Standard in High School." ''Adolescence'', vol. 17, no. 66, Summer, pp. 273-283. EBSCO''host'', search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=flh&amp;AN=MRB-FSD0218233&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be delivered through sex [[self-help]] authors, magazine [[advice columnist]]s, [[sex columnist]]s, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when [[school]]s or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person what he or she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others.&lt;ref&gt;Slyer (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Gruenberg (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes formal sex education is taught as a full course as part of the [[curriculum]] in [[junior high school]] or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad [[biology]], [[health]], [[home economics]], or [[physical education]] class. Some schools offer no sex education, since it remains a [[controversy|controversial]] issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including [[LGBT sex education]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and topics dealing with [[human sexual behavior]], e.g. [[safe sex]] practices, [[masturbation]], [[premarital sex]], and [[sexual ethics]]).

Wilhelm Reich commented that sex education of his time was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing [[sexual arousal|excitement-arousal]], which is what a [[pubescent]] individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he believed to be a basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Reich (2006) ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf]]''. Part one "the failure.." 6. The puberty problem - (3°) "A reflection.." - c. sexual relationships of pubescents - paragraph 4.a (pp. 198-99 of Italian edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom.&lt;ref name=DeLaMare /&gt;
The problem of pregnancy in adolescents is delicate and difficult to assess using sex education.&lt;ref&gt;Deschamps, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; But Calderone{{Who|date=June 2011}} believed otherwise, stating that the answer to adolescents' sexual woes and pregnancy can not lie primarily in school programmes which at best can only be remedial; what is needed is prevention education and as such parents should be involved.

When sex education is contentiously debated, the chief controversial points are whether covering [[child sexuality]] is valuable or detrimental; whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into the curriculum;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;  the use of [[birth control]] such as [[condom]]s and [[hormonal contraception]]; and the impact of such use on pregnancy outside marriage, [[teenage pregnancy]], and the transmission of STIs. Increasing support for [[abstinence-only sex education]] by conservative groups has been one of the primary causes of this controversy. Countries with conservative attitudes towards sex education (including the UK and the U.S.) have a higher incidence of STIs and teenage pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Joy of sex education"&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/comment/story/0,,1214047,00.html "Joy of sex education" by George Monbiot], ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
A survey conducted in Britain, Canada and the United States by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in November 2011 asked adult respondents to look back to the time when they were teenagers, and describe how useful several sources were in enabling them to learn more about sex. By far, the largest proportion of respondents in the three countries (74% in Canada, 67% in Britain and 63% in the United States) said that conversations with friends were "very useful" or "moderately useful." The next reputable source was the media (television, books, movies, magazines), mentioned by three-in-five British (65%) and Canadians (62%) and more than half of Americans (54%) as useful.

There are some striking differences on two other sources. While half of Canadians (54%) and Americans (52%) found their sex education courses at school to be useful, only 43% of British share the same view. And while more than half of Americans (57%) say conversations with family were useful, only 49% of Canadians and 35 percent of British had the same experience.&lt;ref name=opinion&gt;{{cite news|title=Americans, Britons and Canadians Disagree on Sex Education|url=http://angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011.11.30_SexEd.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215345/http://angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011.11.30_SexEd.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 18, 2016|author=Mario Canseco|work=[[Angus Reid Public Opinion]]|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
Sex education in Africa has focused on stemming the growing [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS epidemic]]. Most governments in the region have established AIDS education programs in partnership with the [[World Health Organization]] and international [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s. These programs were undercut significantly by the [[Global Gag Rule]], an initiative put in place by President [[Ronald Reagan]], suspended by President [[Bill Clinton]], and re-instated by President [[George W. Bush]]. The Global Gag Rule "...required nongovernmental organizations to agree as a condition of their receipt of Federal funds that such organizations would neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010123-5.html |title=Restoration of the Mexico City Policy |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110203940/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010123-5.html |archivedate=January 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Global Gag Rule was again suspended as one of the first official acts by United States President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/23/AR2009012302814.html |title=Funding Restored to Groups That Perform Abortions, Other Care |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidences of new HIV transmissions in Uganda decreased dramatically when Clinton supported a comprehensive sex education approach (including information about contraception and abortion).&lt;ref name="uganda"&gt;[http://www.who.int/inf-new/aids2.htm Uganda reverses the tide of HIV/AIDS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010005614/http://www.who.int/inf-new/aids2.htm |date=October 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ugandan AIDS activists, the Global Gag Rule undermined community efforts to reduce HIV prevalence and HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="PEPFAR"&gt;[http://www.stdcheck.com/aids-relief.php Health Gap: Pepfar Policies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140226191956/http://www.stdcheck.com/aids-relief.php |date=February 26, 2014 }} Retrieved February 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
The state of sex education programs in Asia is at various stages of development.

====Thailand====
In [[Thailand]] there has been progress on sex education, with the boundaries being pushed forward with each revision of the curriculum. The first national policy on sexuality education in schools was announced in 1938, but sex education was not taught in schools until 1978. It was then called "Life and Family Studies", and its content consisted of issues related to the reproductive system and personal hygiene. The education curriculum has been revised several times, involving efforts from both government and non-government sectors, and sex education has been accepted as a problem solving tool for adolescent sexual reproduction and health issues. This has been a consequence of educational reform following the National Education Act B.E. 2542, increasing awareness of problems related to adolescents’ sexual practices, and the emergence of women’s sexuality and queer movements. Another new approach in sexuality education curricula in Thailand has been the Teenpath Project developed by [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], Thailand. PATH has also succeeded in institutionalizing sexuality education curricula in schools since 2003.

====India====
{{Main|Sex education in India}}In [[India]], there are many programs promoting sex education including information on AIDS in schools as well public education and advertising. AIDS clinics however are not universally available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV and AIDS in India|url=http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/india|website=www.avert.org|accessdate=20 May 2016|quote=Indeed, many people living with HIV have difficulty accessing the clinics - See more at: http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/india#sthash.o26djboX.dpuf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|India has a strong prevention program which goes hand in hand with care, support and treatment.

==== China ====
In 2000, a new five-year project was introduced by the China Family Planning Association to "promote reproductive health education among Chinese teenagers and unmarried youth" in twelve urban districts and three counties. This included discussion about sex within human relationships as well as pregnancy and HIV prevention.&lt;ref name="chinasexed2"&gt;[http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/node/57 Sex education begins to break taboos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928064000/http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/node/57|date=September 28, 2007}} China Development Brief, June 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; More recently,{{When?|date=September 2018}} there has a been a great increase in books about sex education for children and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Minjie Chen, "Let's talk to the kids about sex... in Chinese too", https://blogs.princeton.edu/cotsen/2018/08/sex-education-china/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other countries ====
[[Indonesia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[South Korea]] have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools. [[Malaysia]] and [[Thailand]] have assessed adolescent reproductive health needs with a view to developing adolescent-specific training, messages and materials.

[[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], and [[Pakistan]] have no coordinated sex education programs.&lt;ref name="escap"&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/icpd/sec7.asp Adolescents In Changing Times: Issues And Perspectives For Adolescent Reproductive Health In The ESCAP Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119084911/http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/icpd/sec7.asp |date=January 19, 2014 }} United Nations Social and Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], sex education is mandatory from age 10 or 11, mainly covering biological topics such as [[menstruation]] and [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="swedsexed"/&gt;

In [[Sri Lanka]], sex education traditionally consisted of reading the reproduction section of biology textbooks. In Sri Lanka young people are taught when they are 17–18 years old. 

The [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] and the [[BBC World Service]] ran a 12-part series known as ''Sexwise'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sci_tech/features/health/sexwise/ ''Sexwise'']&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed sex education, family life education, contraception and parenting.

The [[World Health Organization]] and the German [[Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung|Federal Office of Health Education]] recommend sex education for children of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bzga-whocc.de/pdf.php?id=061a863a0fdf28218e4fe9e1b3f463b3 WHO Regional Office for Europe and BZgA Standards for Sexuality Education in Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509062320/http://www.bzga-whocc.de/pdf.php?id=061a863a0fdf28218e4fe9e1b3f463b3 |date=May 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
In [[Finland]], sexual education is usually incorporated into various compulsory courses, mainly as part of biology lessons (in lower grades) and later in a course related to general health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kontula|first=Osmo|title=The Evolution of Sex Education and Students' Sexual Knowledge in Finland in the 2000s|date=Nov 2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=373–386|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ901096|accessdate=January 28, 2014|issn=1468-1811|doi=10.1080/14681811.2010.515095|journal=Sex Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In [[France]], sex education has been part of school curricula since 1973. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms, to students in grades 8 and 9 (aged 15–16). In January 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students.&lt;ref name=" britsexed"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] ''UNESCO Courier'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222184211/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm |date=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2013, the government launched a new program called "les ABCD de l’égalité" (the ABCD of equality) whose main aim is to "fight gender stereotypes at school". The ultimate goal is to foster mutual respect between boys and girls early on so that it impacts their conception of the world later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vincent Peillon |url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/les-abcd-de-l-egalite-un-outil-pour-lutter-des-l-ecole-contre-les-inegalites-filles-gar |title=Les ABCD de l’égalité : un outil pour lutter dès l’école contre les inégalités filles-garçons &amp;#124; Portail du Gouvernement |publisher=Gouvernement.fr |date=January 13, 2014 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
The first state-sponsored courses on sex education were introduced in Breslau, Prussia c. 1900 by Dr. Martin Chotzen.&lt;ref name="hammill"&gt;{{cite web
|title=Hammill Post
|url=http://www.hammillpost.com/2013/02/the-first-sex-ed-course/
|accessdate=11 October 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], sex education has been part of school curricula since 1970. Since 1992 sex education is a governmental duty by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bildungsklick.de/pm/35091/sexualaufklaerung-in-europa/ Sexualaufklärung in Europa] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

It normally covers all subjects concerning the process of growing up, bodily changes during puberty, emotions involved, the biological process of reproduction, sexual activity, partnership, homosexuality, unwanted pregnancies and the complications of abortion, the dangers of [[sexual violence]], [[child abuse]], and sex-transmitted diseases. It is comprehensive enough that it sometimes also includes things in its curricula such as sex positions. Most schools offer courses on the correct usage of contraception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2003/03/Schmutzige_Gedanken Sexualkunde-Schmutzige Gedanken] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

A sex survey by the [[World Health Organization]] concerning the habits of European teenagers in 2006 revealed that German teenagers care about contraception. The birth rate among 15- to 19-year-olds was very low—only 11.7 per 1000 people, compared to 27.8 births per 1,000 people in the UK, and 39.0 births per 1,000 people in Bulgaria (which, incidentally, has the highest birth rate in Europe).&lt;ref name="EUROPEAN SEX SURVEY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,454492,00.html |title=European Sex Survey |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=December 14, 2006 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German Constitutional Court and later, in 2011, the [[European Court of Human Rights]], rejected complaints from several [[Baptists]] against Germany concerning mandatory sex education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-3681421-4188471&amp;filename=003-3681421-4188471.pdf Complaints against Germany about mandatory sex education classes declared inadmissible] ECtHR press release 153 (2011), September 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
From a Western point of view, sex education in Poland has never actually developed. At the time of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], since 1973, it was one of the school subjects; however, it was relatively poor and did not achieve any actual success. After 1989, it practically vanished from the school life—it is currently a subject called "Family Life Education" (''wychowanie do życia w rodzinie'') rather than "Sex Education" (''edukacja seksualna'')—and schools explicitly require parental consent for their children to attend sex ed classes. This policy is largely due to the strong objection against sex education raised by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,6168 |title=Edukacja seksualna w polityce władz centralnych po transformacji ustrojowej |publisher=Racjonalista.pl |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/gender-sexuality-english-language-education-focus-poland Pakuła Ł, Pawelczyk J., Sunderland, J. 2015 Gender and Sexuality in English Language Education: Focus on Poland. London British Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====
Some sex education is taught as part of biology-related curricula. There is also an official program intended to provide sex education for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dgidc.min-edu.pt/educacaosaude/index.php?s=directorio&amp;pid=107 |title=DGE - Educação Sexual em Meio Escolar - Educação para a Saúde |publisher=Dgidc.min-edu.pt |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810152902/http://www.dgidc.min-edu.pt/educacaosaude/index.php?s=directorio&amp;pid=107 |archivedate=August 10, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
Subsidized by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, the "Long Live Love" package (''Lang leve de liefde''), developed in the late 1980s, aims to give teenagers the skills to make their own decisions regarding health and sexuality. Nearly all secondary schools provide sex education, as part of biology classes and over half of primary schools discuss sexuality and contraception. Starting the 2012 school year, age-appropriate sex education—including education about [[sexual diversity]] —will be compulsory in all secondary and primary schools. The curriculum focuses on biological aspects of reproduction as well as on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills. Dutch sex education encourages the idea that topics like masturbation, homosexuality, and sexual pleasure are normal or natural and that there are larger emotional, relational, and societal forces that shape the experiences of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schalet|first1=Amy|title=Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex.|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to Amy Schalet, Dutch parents tend to form close relationships with their children, openly discussing [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sexuality]]. Dutch parents try to accept their children's romantic relationships and even allow sleepovers, expecting them to have sex.&lt;ref&gt;[Schalet, Amy T. Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex. Chicago: U of Chicago, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach. The Netherlands has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries.&lt;ref name="dutchmodel"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf The Dutch model] ''UNESCO Courier''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slovakia====
In the [[Slovak republic]] the content of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to "Nature science" in English (this course covers both biology and [[petrology]]). Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and is dependent on the teacher's knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue between student and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====Sweden====
In [[Sweden]], sex education was established in 1921 for secondary education and in 1942 for all grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Education: Political Issues in Britain and Europe|last=Meredith|first=Philip|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=100–104|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is usually started in kindergarten and continues cumulatively throughout the student's entire schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boethius|first=Carl|year=1986|title=Sex Education in Swedish Schools: The Facts and the Fiction|url=|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|volume=17|issue=6|pages=276–279|via=|doi=10.2307/2135318|jstor=2135318}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sexual education is incorporated into different subjects such as biology and history.&lt;ref name="swedsexed"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978575-2,00.html Sex Has Many Accents] ''TIME''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swedish Association for Sexuality Education]] (RFSU) has a sex education that emphasizes "sexual diversity, freedom and enjoyment,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thanem|first=Torkild|year=2010|title=Free At Last? Assembling, Producing and Organizing Sexual Spaces in Swedish Sex Education|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2009.00440.x|journal=Gender, Work and Organization|volume=17|pages=91–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the RFSU collaborate frequently with government organizations such as the National Institute of Public Health. Alongside this emphasis of sexual diversity, Swedish sex education has equal incorporations of lesbian and gay sexuality as well as heterosexual sexuality. They provide knowledge about masturbation, oral and anal sex as well as heterosexual, genital intercourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Switzerland====
In [[Switzerland]], the content and amount of sex education is decided at the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] level. In [[Geneva]], courses have been given at the secondary level first for girls since 1926 and compulsory programs have been implemented at secondary level for all classes since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Gentiane Burgermeister, Education sexuelle en milieu scolaire, l’expérience genevoise; '' Int. J. Pub. Health, (1972) 17; 1; 53-57''.&lt;/ref&gt; In most French-speaking cantons since the '70s, generalized courses have been implemented by states with duly formed and trained specialists working within school health services at the secondary level.

Interventions in primary schools were started during the '80s, with the basic objective of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told that they can have their own feelings about themselves, and informed on who to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.

Finally, the objectives include an enforcement of their capacity to decide for themselves and their ability to express their feeling about a situation and say "No". In secondary schools, there are programs at ages 13–14 and 16-17 with the basic objective to give students a secure moment with caring, well informed adults. With confidentiality and mutual respect, students can talk to an adult who understands youth needs and what they should know about sexual life in conformity with age and maturity.

In the German part of the country, the situation is somewhat different. Sex education as a school implemented program is a fairly recent subject, the responsibility given to school teachers. Though federal structures give authority to each State to decide, there are efforts, notably under the auspices of ''Santé sexuelle Suisse'' - the Swiss branch of IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation) - to look for and propose possible models of application which take into account all factors of sex education according to their different levels of concern, parents, teachers, and external experts.

=====England and Wales=====
[[Cecil Reddie]] ran the first sex education course at a British school in October 1889 at [[Abbotsholme School]].&lt;ref name="hammill"/&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], Sex and relationship education (&lt;abbr&gt;[[Sex and Relationships Education|SRE]]&lt;/abbr&gt;) is currently compulsory, in part, from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. It doesn’t promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. The compulsory parts of sex and relationship education are the elements contained within the national curriculum for science. Parents can currently withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects|title=The national curriculum: Other compulsory subjects - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Scotland=====
The main sex education programme in [[Scotland]] is ''Healthy Respect'', which focuses not only on the biological aspects of reproduction but also on relationships and emotions. Education about [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]] are included in the programme as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the programme, however, a separate sex education programme has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the [[Scottish Government]], the programme ''Called to Love'' focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |title=Cardinal praises "dedication and commitment" of Catholic teachers |publisher=Scmo.org |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620082038/http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Sex education in the United States}}

Almost all U.S. students receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics in grades 5 or 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David J.

Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes and contain provisions to allow parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Sex%20Education%20in%20the%20US%20%20%20%20Policy%20and%20Politics.pdf |title=Sex Education in the U.S.: Policy and Politics |accessdate=May 23, 2007 |date=October 2002 |format=PDF |work=Issue Update |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NPrePzCz?url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Sex%20Education%20in%20the%20US%20%20%20%20Policy%20and%20Politics.pdf |archivedate=February 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a 1999 study by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, [[HIV]], [[Sexually Transmitted Infection|STI]]s, [[abstinence]], implications of [[teenage pregnancy]], and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of [[birth control]] and infection prevention, [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual abuse]], and factual and ethical information about [[abortion]], varied more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author2=Jacqueline E.

A 2002 study conducted by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] found that 58% of secondary school principals describe their sex education curriculum as "abstinence plus".&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2002"/&gt;

Abstinence-only sex education tells teenagers that they should be sexually abstinent until marriage and does not provide information about contraception. In the Kaiser study, 34% of high-school principals said their school's main message was abstinence-only.

Among 48 of the 50 U.S. states (the exceptions were [[North Dakota]] and [[Wyoming]]) in their 2005 state laws and policies, 21 stressed abstinence-only sexual education and 7 emphasized that abstinence should be taught in their state's sexual education programs. Only 11 states require that students receive both comprehensive and abstinence education and 9 states did not mention any sort of sexual education in their laws and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|journal=PLOS One|volume=6|issue=10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|pmc=3194801|pmid=22022362|pages=e24658|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject.

On the other hand, proponents of abstinence-only sex education object to curricula that fail to teach their standard of moral behavior; they maintain that a morality which is based on sex only within the bounds of marriage is "healthy and constructive" and that value-free knowledge of the body may lead to immoral, unhealthy, and harmful practices. Within the last decade, the federal government has encouraged abstinence-only education by steering over a billion dollars to such programs.&lt;ref&gt;

The impact of the rise in abstinence-only education remains a question.

According to Anna Mulrine of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', records show that professionals still do not know which method of sex education works best to keep teens from engaging in sexual activity, but they are still working to find out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna|title=Risky Business|accessdate=|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=May 27, 2002|pages=42–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Virginia=====
[[Virginia]] uses the sex education program called The National Campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/|title=Sitemap|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Campaign was created in 1996 and focuses on preventing teen and unplanned pregnancies of young adults. The National Campaign set a goal to reduce teen pregnancy rate by 1/3 in 10 years. The Virginia Department of Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/|title=Virginia Department of Health|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranked Virginia 19th in teen pregnancy birth rates in 1996. Virginia was also rated 35.2 teen births per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 in 2006. The Healthy people 2010 goal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/|title=Healthy People 2020|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a teen pregnancy rate at or below 43 pregnancies per 1,000 females age 15–17.

=====Texas=====
Sex education in [[Texas]] has recently become a policy of much focus in the state. With the rise of recent protests and proposed bills in the Texas House, the current policy has been the focus of much scrutiny. As of 1997, when Senate Bill 1 was enacted, Texas has left the decision of inclusion of sex education classes within schools up to the individual districts. The school board members are entitled to approve all curricula that are taught; however the bill has certain criteria that a school must abide by when choosing to teach Sex Ed. These include:
* present abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relationship to all sexual activity for unmarried persons of school age;
* devote more attention to abstinence from sexual activity than to any other behavior;
* emphasize that abstinence from sexual activity, if used consistently and correctly, is the only method that is 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and the emotional trauma associated with adolescent sexual activity;
* direct adolescents to a standard of behavior in which abstinence from sexual activity before marriage is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and infection with HIV or AIDS;  and
* teach contraception and condom use in terms of real-world failure rates, not statistics based on laboratory rates, if instruction on contraception and condoms is included in curriculum content.

Additionally, school districts are not authorized to distribute condoms in connection with instruction relating to human sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.28.htm#28.004 |title=EDUCATION CODE CHAPTER 28. COURSES OF STUDY; ADVANCEMENT |publisher=Statutes.legis.state.tx.us |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the enactment of this policy, several research studies have been done to evaluate the Sex Ed Policy, namely the ''abstinence-only'' aspect of the teaching. Drs. David Wiley and Kelly Wilson published the ''Just Say Don't Know: Sexuality Education in Texas Public Schools''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/SexEdRort09_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401062410/http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/SexEdRort09_web.pdf |archivedate=April 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; report where they found that:
*Shaming and fear-based instruction are commonly used for teaching sex ed
*Gender stereotypes are promoted
*A majority of students receive no information about human sexuality except abstinence
*The materials used regularly contain factual errors and distort the truth about condoms and STDs

According to Texas State Representative Mike Villarreal, "We have a responsibility to ensure that our children receive accurate information in the classroom, particularly when students' health is at stake," Villarreal said. "We're dealing with a myriad of problems in Texas as a result of our sky high teen pregnancy rates. We cannot allow our schools to provide erroneous information—the stakes are far too high."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=123 |title=Texas House of Representatives : Representative Villarreal, Mike |publisher=House.state.tx.us |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, many state legislators have proposed bills to improve sex education in Texas Schools.
*SB 852/HB 1624&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Texas Senate Media Services |url=http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/members/dist13/pr11/p022311a.htm |title=The Texas State Senate – Rodney Ellis Press Releases |publisher=Senate.state.tx.us |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008224026/http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/members/dist13/pr11/p022311a.htm |archivedate=October 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; – In Feb 2011, Senator Ellis proposed The Education Works bill. This bill would require schools that teach sex education to provide evidence-based, age-appropriate information that emphasizes the importance of abstinence as the only 100% effective method of avoiding sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy, while also teaching about contraceptive methods to avoid STIs and pregnancy.
*HB 741/SB 515&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/pdf/HB00741I.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; – In 2011, Representatives Joaquin Castro and Mike Villarreal introduced a bill calling for abstinence-plus sexual health education bill. The bill would have medically accurate information, including: abstinence, contraception, and what it really takes to be a parent. The bill received a hearing but was left in committee.
*HB 1567/ SB 1076&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=81R&amp;Bill=HB1567 |title=Texas Legislature Online – 81(R) Text for HB 1567 |publisher=Capitol.state.tx.us |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Introduced in 2009 by Villarreal, this bill would have required instruction on contraceptive use to be scientifically accurate when it is taught as part of a school's sexual health curriculum. It did not receive a hearing.
Scientific evidence accumulated over many decades clearly demonstrates that the abstinence-only-until-married (AOUM) curriculum taught in Texas schools is harmful and ineffective in reducing the adolescent pregnancy rate in Texas. Despite these facts, recently published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, AOUM programs continue to be funded by the U.S. government. In fact, the U.S. government has spent more than $2 billion over the last 20 years to prohibit much-needed sex education in public schools, choosing instead to fund the AOUM curriculum while the adolescent pregnancy rates continue to rise.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abstinence-only-until-marriage-programs-are-ineffective-and-harmful-young-people&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic schools in Texas follow Catholic Church teachings in regard to Sex Education. Some opponents of sex education in Catholic schools believe sex ed programs are doing more harm to the young than good. Opponents of sex education contend that children are not mentally and emotionally ready for this type of instruction, and believe that exposing the young to sex ed programs may foster the students with the preoccupation of sex.

The Catholic Church believes that parents are the first educators and should rightfully fight for their duty as such in regard to sex education:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMESCHL/SECATHSC.HTM |title=Sex Education And Catholic Schools |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keenan | first1 = J.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
The [[Government of Victoria]] (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State's primary and secondary schools during 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Health and Human Relations Education |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable [[Norman Lacy]] MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979-1982.

A ''Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education'' was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame [[Margaret Blackwood]]; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.

The Council had three major functions:
# to advise and to be consulted on all aspects of Health and Human Relations' Education in schools;
# to develop, for consideration of the Government, appropriate curriculum for schools;
# to advise and recommend the standards for in-service courses for teachers and relevant members of the school community.

Support services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the Special Services Division of the Education Department of Victoria and was responsible for the implementation of the Government's policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of ''Health and Human Relations Education''.

In 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as Government policy.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, sexuality education is part of the Health and Physical Education curriculum, which is compulsory for the first ten years of schooling (Years 1 to 10) but optional beyond that. Sexual and reproductive health education begins at Year 7 (approx. age 11), although broader issues such as physical, emotional and social development, personal and interpersonal skills, and (non-sexual) relationships begin as early as Year 1 (approx. age 5).&lt;ref name="NZMoE"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sexuality Education: Revised Guide for Principals, Boards of Trustees, and Teachers |author= Ministry of Education |year= 2002 |location= Wellington |publisher= Learning Media |isbn= 0478267274 |url= http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |accessdate= June 26, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150121051529/http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |archive-date= January 21, 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health / ''Hauora'' curriculum, including the sexuality education component, is the only part of the New Zealand Curriculum / ''Te Matauranga o Aotearoa'' (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and [[state-integrated school]]s must legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM179262.html |title= Section 60B: Consultation about treatment of health curriculum -- Education Act 1989 -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate= June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can ask for their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM178247.html |title= Section 25AA: Release from tuition in specified parts of health curriculum -- Education Act 1989 -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate= June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.&lt;ref name="NZMoE" /&gt;

==Morality==
There are two opposing sides of the sex education argument amongst parents. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexuality, and they are in favor of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals to be included in the conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views on Sex- And Sex Education- Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristen|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint on sex education, historically inspired by sexologists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[James W. Prescott]], holds that what is at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual [[mores]]. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized [[sexual oppression]] and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of "Reid About Sex"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reidaboutsex.com/|title=ReidAboutSex — Sex and Relationship Expert Reid Mihalko's official site|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihalko|first=Reid|title=About Reid|url=http://reidaboutsex.com/about-reid/|work=Reid About Sex|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that certain sex education curricula break down pre-existing notions of [[modesty]] or encourage acceptance of what they consider immoral practices, such as [[homosexuality]] or [[premarital sex]]. A website which supports that view is the [[Coalition for Positive Sexuality]]. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and premarital sex are a normal part of the range of human sexuality disagree with them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Sociologist Amitai Etzioni argues sex education provides an opportunity to teach students facts about health within the context of values that responsible and moral persons seek to affirm and embody in their lives. Instead of teaching sex as a purely scientific biological process, sex education should promote discussions about human nature, intimacy, and how social commitments improve health and happiness. Programs should discuss responsibilities to better equip students with communication skills and conflict resolution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3128388|title=Education for Intimacy|journal=Tikkun|volume=12|issue=2|date=1997|pages=38-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions teach that sexual behavior outside of marriage is immoral and/or psychologically damaging, and many adherents desire this morality to be taught as a part of sex education. They may believe that sexual knowledge is necessary, or simply unavoidable, hence their preference for curricula based on [[abstinence]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] Accessed December 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT sex education==
{{Main|LGBT sex education}}
One major source of controversy in the realm of sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; LGBT sex education includes safe sex practices for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] individuals and general instruction in topics related to [[homosexuality]]. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today.&lt;ref name="Formby"/&gt; Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]] (GLSEN) report that they were more likely to hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosciw|first=J.G.|year=2012|title=The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth in our nation's schools|url=|journal=Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-LGBT ===

Proponents of LGBT sex education argue that encompassing homosexuality into the curricula would provide LGBT students with the sexual health information they need,&lt;ref name="CSW"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez |first=Marisol |title=Providing inclusive sex education in schools will address the health needs of LGBT Youth |url=http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |publisher=Center for the Study of Women UCLA |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102525/https://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and help to ameliorate problems such as low self-esteem and depression that research has shown can be present in LGBT individuals.&lt;ref name="CAP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Hannah|title=LGBT-Inclusive Sex Education Means Healthier Youth and Safer Schools|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2013/06/21/67411/lgbt-inclusive-sex-education-means-healthier-youth-and-safer-schools/|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that it could reduce homophobic bullying.&lt;ref name="CAP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Josh|title=5 Reasons Schools Should Adopt LGBTQ-inclusive Sex Ed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-a-goodman/lgbtq-inclusive-sex-ed_b_3834914.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of LGBT-inclusive curriculum is introduced by the National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics that must be addressed in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGarry|first=Robert|year=2013|title=Build a curriculum that includes everyone: ensuring that schools are more accepting of LGBT students and issues requires more than passing mentions of diversity in sex education classes|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&amp;u=lom_umichanna&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A320848233&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=lom_umichanna&amp;authCount=1#|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=94|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, BigTalk Education's Growing Up  Safe programme includes LGBT relationship education from [[Primary school|Primary School]] age, was awarded the 2017 Pamela Sheridan award for innovation and good practice in relationships and sex education (RSE), services and projects for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fpa.org.uk/awards/pamela-sheridan-award|title=Pamela Sheridan Award|date=2013-04-24|work=FPA|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-LGBT ===

Opponents often argue that teaching LGBT sex education would be disrespectful to some religions&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Janofsky|first=Michael|title=Gay Rights Battlefields Spread to Public Schools|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/education/09clash.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expose students to inappropriate topics.&lt;ref name="Formby"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Formby|first=Eleanor|title=Sex and relationships education, sexual health, and lesbian, gay and bisexual sexual cultures: views from young people|journal=Sex Education|date=August 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=255–266|doi=10.1080/14681811.2011.590078}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that including homosexuality in the curriculum would violate parents’ rights to control what their children are exposed to and that schools should not inflict a particular political view on students.&lt;ref name="Christian Post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Villalva|first=Brittney|title=Sex Education in Schools Should Include a Gay Agenda, Report Claims|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/sex-education-in-schools-should-include-a-gay-agenda-report-claims-66976/|work=The Christian Post|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, many sex education curricula do not include LGBT topics, and research has reported that students often feel that they do not receive adequate instruction in LGBT sex topics.&lt;ref name="Formby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Viv|author2=High |title=Something More to Tell You: Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Young Peoples|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=April 2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=213–225|doi=10.1080/0141192042000195281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English law]], '''subinfeudation''' is the practice by which [[Tenement (law)|tenants]], holding land under the king or other superior lord, carved out new and distinct tenures in their turn by sub-letting or [[Alienation (property law)|alienating]] a part of their lands.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Subinfeudation |volume=25 |page=1062 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=An historical introduction to the land law page 105 to 107| author=Sir William Searle | work=Google Books Preview| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NscKQr-aqNIC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=mesne+lord&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hgjzUJlaII&amp;sig=kcA1p8sAx4037Hn5imxTY5RCg1A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tKxMTMPuLJKy0gSYoOmECw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgK#v=snippet&amp;q=subinfeudation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenants were termed [[mesne lord]]s, with regard to those holding from them, the immediate tenant being ''tenant in capite''. The lowest tenant of all was the [[Freehold (real property)|freeholder]], or, as he was sometimes termed, ''tenant paravail''. The Crown, who in theory owned all lands, was ''[[lord paramount]]''.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The great lords looked with dissatisfaction on the increase of such subtenures. Accordingly, in 1290 a statute was passed, {{lang|la|[[Quia Emptores]]}}, which allowed the tenant to alienate whenever he pleased, but the person to whom he granted the land was to hold it for the same immediate lord, and by the same services as the alienor held it before.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Scotland ==
In [[Scots law]], the feudal system was abolished by the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]]. The length of a [[lease]] was limited to 175 years to prevent the existence of perpetual landlord-tenant relationships similar to those that existed under feudal tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/67/notes Explanatory notes to Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holy Roman Empire ==
Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], mesne fiefs were known as ''[[Afterlehen]]'', which became inheritable over time and could have up to five "stations" between the actual holder of the fief and the overarching liege lord.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veHsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=afterlehen+fief&amp;dq=afterlehen+fief&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iPD1UqadBY67hAflyoGADg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgK ''Despotism and capitalism: a historical comparison of Europe and Indonesia''] by Tilman Schiel (1985).

'''''The Intercept''''' is an online news publication dedicated to what it describes as "adversarial journalism".

In April 2015, ''The Intercept'' reported in collaboration with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' that a U.S. military base in [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]], Germany, serves as the "high-tech heart" of America's drone program. Ramstein is the site of a satellite relay station that enables drone operators in the American southwest to communicate with their remote aircraft in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and other targeted countries. ''The Intercept'' cited a top-secret document and a confidential source, who said that "Ramstein carries the signal to tell the drone what to do and it returns the display of what the drone sees. Without Ramstein, drones could not function, at least not as they do now."&lt;ref name=ramstein&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany is the Tell-Tale Heart of America's Drone War |author=Jeremy Scahill|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/04/17/ramstein/|publisher=The Intercept|date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spiegel|first1=Staff|title=Ramstein Base in Germany a Key Center in US Drone War|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/ramstein-base-in-germany-a-key-center-in-us-drone-war-a-1029279.html|accessdate=April 22, 2015|work=Spiegel|date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deutche|first1=Welle|title=Germany's Ramstein airbase 'heart' of US drone program|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-ramstein-airbase-heart-of-us-drone-program/a-18391007|work=Deutche Welle|date=December 5, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Papenfuss|first1=Mary|title=Leaked document: US waging drone warfare from Air Force base in Ramstein, Germany|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/leaked-document-us-waging-drone-warfare-air-force-base-ramstein-germany-1497064|work=International Business Times|date=December 5, 2017|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, ''The Intercept'' disclosed dozens of top-secret British intelligence documents, which revealed that spy agency [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) was trying to build a surveillance system to monitor "every visible user on the internet".

In October 2015, ''The Intercept'' published the [[Drone Papers]], a series of stories based on a cache of leaked secret documents detailing the inner workings of the [[Disposition Matrix|U.S. military's assassination program]] in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The news site said that the documents were "provided by a whistleblower" and offered "an unprecedented glimpse into Obama's drone wars".&lt;ref name="dpapers"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Drone Papers |author=Intercept staff|url=https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/|publisher=The Intercept|date=October 16, 2015|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelations were praised by [[Pentagon Papers]] [[whistleblower]], Daniel Ellsberg, and NSA leaker, [[Edward Snowden]], who said: "When we look back on today, we will find the most important national security story of the year."&lt;ref name="ellsberg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden and Ellsberg hail leak of drone documents from new whistleblower |author=Tom McCarthy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/16/drone-documents-whistleblower-edward-snowden-daniel-ellsberg|publisher=The Guardian|date=October 16, 2015|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Micah Zenko]], a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, described the Drone Papers reports as "pretty remarkable stuff." He added: "In some ways it reconfirms and illuminates much of what we knew, or thought we knew, about a lot of these programs, like that the administration firmly prefers kill over capture despite claiming the opposite, and that there's not 'a bunch of folks in the room', as Obama calls it – that there's a clear, bureaucratic process for this.

At the 2017 Online News Awards, ''The Intercept'' won two awards: the first for a feature story about the FBI's efforts to infiltrate the [[Bundy family]], and the second, an investigative data journalism award for "Trial and Terror," a project documenting the people prosecuted in the U.S. for terrorism since 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mizgata|first1=Jennifer|title=2017 Online Journalism Awards winners include Le Temps, The Washington Post and STAT|url=https://awards.journalists.org/2017/10/08/2017-online-journalism-awards-winners-include-le-temps-washington-post-stat/|accessdate=December 5, 2017|work=Journalists.org|date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''The Intercept'' won a Hillman Prize for Web Journalism for an investigative series by Jamie Kalven exposing criminality within the Chicago Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foundation|first1=Hillman|title=2017 Hillman Prizes|url=http://www.hillmanfoundation.org/hillman-prizes/2017|accessdate=December 5, 2017|work=Hillman Foundation|date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news organization also won a 2017 award for "Outstanding Feature Story" at the sixteenth annual Awards for Reporting on The Environment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=SEJ|first1=|title=Winners: SEJ 16th Annual Awards for Reporting on the Environment |url=http://www.sej.org/winners-sej-16th-annual-awards-reporting-environment|accessdate=December 5, 2017|work=Society of Environmental Journalists|date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges of the environmental award praised author Sharon Lerner for her piece "The Strange Case of Tennie White," which they described as a "finely written and disturbing investigation of contamination and injustice near a chemical plant in Mississippi."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==U.S. government reaction==
On August 15, 2014, U.S. [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Executive]] (NCE) [[William Evanina]] confirmed that the [[FBI]] is moving forward with a probe into how classified documents were leaked to ''The Intercept'' for its article revealing details about a database of terrorism suspects, which linked some people to terrorism even if they had no known association with any terrorism group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2014/08/05/watch-commander/|title=Watch Commander: Barack Obama’s Secret Terrorist-Tracking System, by the Numbers|first1=Jeremy|last1=Scahill|first2=Ryan|last2=Devereaux|date=5 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's a criminal act that has us very concerned," said Evanina, a former FBI special agent with a counter-terrorism specialty who was appointed NCE by [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James R.

In August 2014, it was reported that members of the U.S. military had been banned from reading ''The Intercept''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gilbert|first=David|date=August 21, 2014|title=US Military Banned From Reading Glenn Greenwald's New Website|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/us-military-banned-reading-glenn-greenwalds-new-website-1462046|newspaper=[[International Business Times UK]]|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Fingas|first=Jon|date=August 20, 2014|title=US military bans staff from reading a site devoted to leaks|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/20/us-military-bans-intercept/|newspaper=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=August 21, 2014|title=Military Is Banning Soldiers from Reading Documents Everyone Else Can See|url=https://mic.com/articles/96904/the-military-is-banning-soldiers-from-reading-documents-everyone-else-can-see|newspaper=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Democracy|first1=Now|title=U.S. Military Bans, Blocks The Intercept News Site|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2014/8/26/headlines/us_military_bans_blocks_the_intercept_news_site|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=Democracy Now|date=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Erik Wemple]], writing for ''The Washington Post'', noted the conspicuous refusal of ''The Intercept'' to use the term "[[targeted killing]]s" to refer to the U.S. drone program, instead referring to the drone strikes as "assassinations." Wemple included Greenwald's explanation that [[assassination]] is "the accurate term rather than the [[euphemism|euphemistic]] term that the government wants us to use"; Greenwald further noted that "anyone who is murdered deliberately away from a battlefield for political purposes is being assassinated."&lt;ref name=wemple&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wemple |first1=Erik |date=February 10, 2014 |title=Glenn Greenwald and the U.S. 'assassination' program |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/02/10/glenn-greenwald-and-the-u-s-assassination-program |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TechCrunch]] referred to the story as clear evidence of "unabashed opposition to security [[War hawk#Variations of the term|hawks]]."&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferenstein |first1=Gregory |date=February 10, 2014 |title=eBay Founder's News Site, ''The Intercept'', Launches with NSA Revelations |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/10/ebay-founders-news-site-the-intercept-launches-with-nsa-revelations |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of ''[[Lawfare (blog)|Lawfare]]'', argued that essentially, ''The Intercept'' was inviting individuals and organizations to steal documents and leak them to ''The Intercept'' by publishing a "How to Leak to the Intercept" guide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wittes |first=Benjamin |date=January 29, 2015 |title=The Intercept's Invitation to Criminality—and to Intelligence Agencies |url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/intercepts-invitation-criminality-and-intelligence-agencies |work=[[Lawfare (blog)|Lawfare]] |access-date=July 7, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittes wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;If I were a foreign intelligence agency, I'd be looking at this as a great way to send enticing-looking documents, maybe even real ones, that contain some nifty bits of executable code that offered visibility for me onto the activities of people with access to the Snowden materials, people who are talking to and recruiting other leakers. Or maybe I'd be drop some honey-pot files, some files that beacon their location. Or maybe I'd just use the opportunity to drop disinformation on journalists who have shown they will believe just about anything if it's disparaging of U.S. intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Wittes also questioned the ability of ''The Intercept'' to protect those who leak to the online publication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Juan M. Thompson scandal==
{{main|Juan M. Thompson}}

In February 2016, the site appended lengthy corrections to five stories by reporter Juan M. Thompson and retracted a sixth, about [[Charleston church shooting|Charleston church shooter]] [[Dylann Roof]], written over the previous year, focused on the [[African Americans|African-American]] community. Shortly afterward, a note from editor Betsy Reed indicated that Thompson had been fired recently after his editors discovered "a pattern of deception" in his reporting. According to Reed, he had "fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people, one of which was a [[Gmail]] account in my name".&lt;ref name="Thompson editor's note"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Betsy|title=A Note to Readers|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/02/02/a-note-to-readers/|newspaper=The Intercept|date=February 2, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed apologized to readers and to those misquoted. She noted that some of Thompson's work, most of it using public sources, was verifiable. Editors alerted any downstream users of the affected stories, and promised to take similar action if further fabrication came to light.&lt;ref name="Thompson editor's note" /&gt;

Thompson suggested that the greater problem was [[racism]] in the media field. He had made up [[pseudonym]]s for some of his sources, whom he described as "poor black people who didn't want their names in the public given the situations" and would not have spoken with a reporter otherwise. "[T]he journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others, such as you and First Look, are used to differs drastically," he argued. He also claimed he had felt a need to "exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth" at ''The Intercept'' given incidents of racial bias he said he had witnessed there. When ''[[Gawker]]'' published his email, Reed said those allegations had not been in the version he sent her.&lt;ref name="Gawker Thompson story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=J.K.|title=Reporter Fabricated Quotes, Invented Sources at The Intercept|url=http://gawker.com/reporter-fabricated-quotes-invented-sources-at-the-int-1756672849|newspaper=[[Gawker]]|date=February 2, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was fired by ''The Intercept'' in early 2016, and according to Reed, did not cooperate with the investigation into his actions.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Julia Carrie|title=The Intercept admits reporter fabricated stories and quotes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/02/the-intercept-fires-reporter-juan-thompson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 2, 2016|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure and arrest of a confidential source==

In early June 2017, ''The Intercept'' published a National Security Agency document that asserts Russian intelligence successfully hacked an American voter registration and poll software company, and used information culled to [[Phishing|phish]] state election officials. The document was mailed from a source inside NSA, who did not reveal their identity to ''Intercept'' writers.&lt;ref name="Intercept 6-17"&gt;{{cite journal |title=TOP-SECRET NSA REPORT DETAILS RUSSIAN HACKING EFFORT DAYS BEFORE 2016 ELECTION |journal=The Intercept |date=2017-06-05 |last=Cole |first=Matthew |last2=Esposito |first2=Richard |last3=Biddle |first3=Sam |last4=Grim |first4=Ryan |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/ |accessdate=2017-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hour after publication, a 25-year old NSA contract employee named [[Reality Winner]] was arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grynbaum|first1=Michael M.|last2=Koblin|first2=John|title=After Reality Winner’s Arrest, Media Asks: Did ‘Intercept’ Expose a Source?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/business/media/intercept-reality-winner-russia-trump-leak.html|accessdate=8 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 June 2017|page=A19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article bolstered public suspicion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. It also drew attention for being at odds with views held by editor Glenn Greenwald who had publicly ridiculed or dismissed allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,&lt;ref name="Intercept 1-17"&gt;{{cite journal |title=WashPost Is Richly Rewarded for False News About Russia Threat While Public Is Deceived |journal=The Intercept |date=2017-01-04 |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn Greenwald |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/01/04/washpost-is-richly-rewarded-for-false-news-about-russia-threat-while-public-is-deceived/ |accessdate=2017-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling them "radical conspiracy theories."&lt;ref name="Democracy Now!"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Glenn Greenwald: Mainstream U.S. Media is Culpable for Disseminating Fake &amp; Deceitful News on Russia |journal=Democracy Now! |date=2017-01-05 |last=Goodman |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Goodman |last2=Greenwald |first2=Glenn |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2017/1/5/glenn_greenwald_mainstream_us_media_is |accessdate=2017-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald alleged that the Democratic party hyperbolized the evidence supporting collusion complaints about Trump, in order to shift the blame for Trump's election as president away from the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="Democracy Now!2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Glenn Greenwald: Why Did Trump Win?

The document explains that Russian intelligence attempted to crack the log-in information of the employees of a vendor providing voter registration software and databases for states to use with their election systems. It alleged that the Russians were successful enough that they were able to email 122 election officials, by posing as employees of the vendor.

According to [[David Folkenflik]] of [[National Public Radio]],&lt;blockquote&gt;An ''Intercept'' reporter shared a photo of the papers with a source, a government contractor whom he trusted, seeking to validate it. The printout included a postmark of Augusta, Ga., and [[microdot]]s, a kind of computerized fingerprint. The contractor told his bosses, who informed the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531859840/did-intercept-out-its-source|title=Did 'Intercept' Out Its Intelligence Source?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; NSA quickly identified the leaker of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.erratasec.com/2017/06/how-intercept-outed-reality-winner.html|title=How The Intercept Outed Reality Winner|first=Robert|last=Graham|date=June 6, 2017|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verifying the legitimacy of leaked documents is common journalism practice, as is protecting third parties who may be harmed incidentally by the leak being published. However, professional media outlets who receive documents or recordings from confidential sources do not, as a practice, share the unfiltered primary evidence with a federal agency for review or verification, as it is known that metadata and unique identifiers may be revealed that were not obvious to the journalist, and the source exposed.&lt;ref name="Nieman Reports"&gt;{{cite journal |title=When Is it Ethical to Publish Stolen Data? |journal=Nieman Reports |date=2015-06-01 |last=Lewis |first=Helen |url=http://niemanreports.org/articles/when-is-it-ethical-to-publish-stolen-data/ |accessdate=2017-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-protect-your-sources-when-releasing-sensitive-/ |title=Protecting Your Sources When Releasing Sensitive Documents |last=Han |first=Ted |last2=Norton |first2=Quinn |work=Source (Website) |publisher=OpenNews/Community Partners |date=2017-06-07 |accessdate=2017-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence chain led to the arrest of Winner, a young Air Force veteran who was working in Georgia for Pluribus International Corporation, an NSA contractor, when the document was mailed to ''The Intercept''.&lt;ref name="FBI-rlwinner"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-government-contractor-georgia-charged-removing-and-mailing-classified-materials-news |title=Federal Government Contractor in Georgia Charged With Removing and Mailing Classified Materials to a News Outlet |author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |date=2017-06-05 |accessdate=2017-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Intercept'' has been criticized for unprofessional handling of the document, and indifference to the source's safety.&lt;ref name="Mediaite"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intercept Editors Face Mounting Criticism for Possibly Outing Leaker |journal=Nieman Reports |date=2017-06-06 |last=McLaughlin |first=Aidan |url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/intercept-editors-face-mounting-criticism-for-reportedly-outing-leaker/ |accessdate=2017-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/06/the-intercepts-russian-hacking-report-also-seems-to-be-a-good-example-of-how-not-to-handle-leaks/|title=The Intercept’s Russian hacking report also seems to be a good example of how not to handle leaks|work=Nieman Lab|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the arrest of Winner, ''The Intercept'' released a statement saying it had "no knowledge of the identity of the person who provided us with the document." Allegations from the FBI about Winner, it added, were "unproven assertions and speculation designed to serve the government's agenda and as such warrant skepticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The|first1=Intercept|title=Statement on Justice Department Allegations|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/06/06/statement-on-justice-department-allegations/|accessdate=December 5, 2017|work=The Intertcept|date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA whistleblower [[John Kiriakou]] and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] whistleblower Joseph Hickman have both accused the same reporter accused of revealing Winner's identity, Matthew Cole, of playing a role in their exposure, which, in Kiriakou's case, led to his imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.peterbcollins.com/2017/06/30/in-depth-interview-whistleblowers-joe-hickman-and-john-kiriakou-on-abu-zubaydeh-torture-and-a-dangerous-reporter/|title=In-Depth Interview: Whistleblowers Joe Hickman and John Kiriakou on Abu Zubaydeh, Torture and a Dangerous Reporter|date=June 30, 2017|publisher=The Peter Collins Show|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.4148070/ex-cia-whistleblower-blasts-reporters-for-not-protecting-alleged-nsa-leaker-reality-winner-1.4148075|title=Ex-CIA whistleblower blasts reporters for not protecting alleged NSA leaker Reality Winner |date=June 6, 2017|publisher=CBC Radio|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2017, ''The Intercept'' announced that its parent company, First Look Media, through its Press Freedom Defense Fund, would provide $50,000 in matching funds to Stand with Reality, a crowd-funding campaign to support Winner's legal defense, plus a separate grant to engage a second law firm to assist Winner's principal attorneys, Augusta-based Bell &amp; Brigham. Additionally, wrote editor-in-chief Betsy Reed, "First Look's counsel Baruch Weiss of the firm [[Arnold &amp; Porter|Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer]] may support the defense efforts while continuing to represent First Look's interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Betsy|title=First Look to Support Defense of Reality Winner in Espionage Act Prosecution|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/07/11/first-look-to-support-defense-of-reality-winner-in-espionage-act-prosecution/|accessdate=January 9, 2018|work=The Intertcept|date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's rights|Women's rights]] in Iran have changed according to the form of government ruling the state. With the rise of each regime, a series of mandates for women's rights arose, which affected a broad range of issues from voting rights to dress code.&lt;ref name=":010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Camara|first=Andrea|date=April 22, 2018|title=Women's Rights in Iran during the Years of Shah, Ayatollah Khomeini, and Khamenei|url=|journal=Stars|volume=|pages=5–60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Iranian women, their rights and legal status have changed since the early 20th century. Women's rights in Iran are limited compared to the women in developed nations. The [[World Economic Forum]]’s 2017 [[Global Gender Gap Report|Global Gender Gap]] Report ranked Iran 140 out of 144 countries for gender parity. Women in Iran constitute 19% of the workforce in 2017 with only 7% growth since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-gender-gap-report-2017|title=World Economic Forum|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal rights of women have gone through many changes during the past three political regimes in Iran. During the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]], the royal dynasty that ruled Iran from the late 1800s to the early 20th century, women were more isolated as they were not engaged in politics, and their economic contribution was limited to household work. These conditions transformed to a great extent during the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi regime]] from 1925-1979 where women had much more freedom, but that freedom soon retracted after the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian revolution]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

During the Qajar and soon after the beginning of the [[Islam]]ic revolution, the status of women in society was equal to second-class citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Razavi|first=Shahra|date=2006|title=Islamic Politics, Human Rights and Women's Claims for Equality in Iran|jstor=4017751|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=7|pages=1223–1237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Painting santur.jpg|thumb|Women playing music in the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavi era]] ]]
Historical records dating back to the great [[Achaemenid Empire]] (2000 – 550 BCE), women in [[Iran]] have, for the most part, been subordinate to men.

Iran's history is commonly divided into three segments: Pre-Islamic, post-Islamic, and the modern era. Though little is known about Iran's pre-Islamic time, the recorded history starts with the Achaemenid Empire in 2000 B.C. During the rule of the Achaemenid Empire, Greek historical accounts include that women were able to participate in civic affairs; however, this participation was still limited and considered unusual to the general population. Greek historian, [[Herodotus]], after his visit to the Achaemenian Empire, recounted that Persian men and women worked together in managing the affairs of the states and participated in public ceremony together. Royal women had access to education, were trained horse riders, and participated in official ceremonies, such as the King's birthday and [[Nowruz|Naw-ruz]], the annual Persian New Year.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jomepour|first=Rahele|date=2015|title=Women in Iran: Ancient History to Modern Times, and Back|url=|journal=Iowa State University|volume=|pages=6–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire and the rise of [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Empire]], women's position in Iran degraded and their status was inferior to men. During this era, elite women veiled themselves as a form of protection from non-elite men.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt;

=== The Persian Constitutional Revolution ===
During the Qajar and soon at the beginning of the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] “most women in Persian were second-class citizens with limited if any, rights such as to inheritance or to obtain a basic education. For example, tribal and nomadic groups (like the [[Kurds]], [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]], [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]]) allowed their women to interact with men to a certain extent, and even some considered polygamy and Mu’ta (Shia temporary marriage) as undesirable.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic politics, human rights and women's claims for equality in Iran|last=Burki|first=Shireen|publisher=Third World Quarterly|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=177–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian women played a significant role in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1905–11. They participated in large numbers in public affairs and held important positions in journalism and in schools and associations that flourished from 1911 to 1924.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Afary, Janet (1996). ''The Iranian Constitutional Revolution, 1906–1911: Grassroots democracy, social democracy, and the origins of feminism''. Columbia University Press, New York {{ISBN|9780231103510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Iranian women who played a vital part in the revolution include [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]], [[Noor-ol-Hoda Mangeneh]], [[Mohtaram Eskandari]], [[Sediqeh Dowlatabadi]], and [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]].

At the turn of the 20th century, many educated Persian women were attracted to journalism and writing. ''Danesh'' (1907) was the first specialized journal focusing on women's issues. Later, ''[[Shokufeh (magazine)|Shokoufeh]]'', ''Nameie Banovan'', ''Alam e Nesvan'', and ''Nesvan e Vatan Khah'' were published in [[Tehran]]. Moreover, ''Nesvan e Shargh'' in [[Bandar Anzali]], ''Jahan e Zanan'' in [[Mashhad]], ''Dokhtaran e Iran'' in [[Shiraz]], and ''Peik e saadat'' in [[Rasht]] addressed women's issues throughout [[Iran|Persia]] (Iran). Although the defeat of the [[Constitutionalist Party of Iran|constitutionalists]] (1921–25) and the consolidation of power by [[Reza Shah]] (1925–41) destroyed the women's journals and groups, the state during these years implemented social reforms such as mass education and paid employment for women. Reza Shah also began his controversial policy of ''[[Kashf-e hijab|Kashf-e-Hijab]]'', which banned the wearing of the Islamic [[hijab]] in public. But like other sectors of society in the years under Reza Shah's rule, women lost the right to express themselves, and dissent was repressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2004/June/MK/index.html Two sides of the same coin]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pahlavi era ===
[[File:Atomic women Iran.JPG|thumb|Iranian newspaper clip from 1968 reads: "A quarter of Iran's Nuclear Energy scientists are women."]]
In 1925, the military commander, Reza Khan, overthrew the Qajar dynasty. In the same year, he was declared the Shah of Iran, which marked the beginning of the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] era. Iran's societal structure and the status of women began to improve after the Shah went on a visit to Turkey in 1936. The Shah was inspired by the modernization that was taking place there by the Turkish leader, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]. In a speech he gave upon his return from Turkey, the former Shah of Iran said: “I am extremely delighted that women have become aware of their rights and entitlement… Now women are on their way to gain other rights in addition to the great privilege of motherhood.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of State Intervention: Gender Politics in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran|last=Burki|first=Shireen|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=170–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Reza Shah was banished to the [[Morris Island]] by the Allied powers, his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza]], took over. The Shah's government began its White Revolution in 1962 and ratified essential women's rights measures, including suffrage and the Family Protection Law of 1967.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt; The Shah's White Revolution helped to increase the legal rights of women.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt; In 1975, this law was amended to be more heavily in favor of women, by ending extrajudicial divorce and restricting polygamy. It also raised the minimum age of marriage of girls from 13-15 to 18.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt;

===Islamic Republic===
{{Main|Women in Iran}}

==== Women and the Iranian Revolution ====

When the [[Iranian Revolution]] started in 1977, many women protested by marching in metropolitan cities and wore chadors as a sign of protest. Women played a significant role in the success of the revolution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khaz Ali|first=Anisa|date=July 2010|title=Iranian Women After the Islamic Revolution|url=http://conflictsforum.org/briefings/IranianWomenAfterIslamicRev.pdf.|journal=A Conflicts Forum Monograph|volume=|pages=4–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their role was both praised and encouraged by the revolutionary leader, Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]], who in various speeches stated:

* "Our uprising is indebted to women. Men took the example of the women into the streets. Women encouraged the men to revolt, and sometimes even led the way. Woman is a wonderful creature. She possesses fiendish, strong [and] passionate capabilities." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;(Imam Khomeini, 6/5/1980)
* The Revolution transformed Iranian society, and women were the pioneers of this transformation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;(Ayatollah Khomeini, 30/3/1982)
* We must not forget the activities which women performed, notably confrontations. Iranian women were able to turn into a revolutionary, political, conscious fighting element through their conscious faith ... Truly, women never lagged behind in any area or on any battleground.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (Ayatollah Khomeini, 6/3/1987)

Because the first Pahlavi Shah banned the use of the hijab, many women decided to show their favor for the Islamic revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, by wearing a chador, thinking that this would be the best way to show their support without having to be vocal.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurzman|first=Charles|date=2008|title=A feminist generation in iran|url=|journal=Iranian studies|volume=3|pages=297–321|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women took part in the Iranian revolution by participating in the protests. Organizations supportive of the Islamic Revolution, such as [[Mujahideen|Mujahidin]], welcomed women into their organization and gave women essential tasks. Ayatollah Khomeini also encouraged women to take part in the protest against the Shah.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

==== Khomeini's era ====

With the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini, women's roles were limited as they were encouraged to raise large families and tend to household duties. Khomeini believed this to be the most vital role women could pursue. It was this belief that led to the closing of women's centers, childcare centers and the abolishment of family planning initiatives.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

====Post-Khomeini era====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zanane iran.JPG|thumb|Iranian notable women: [[Simin Behbahani]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], [[Tahmineh Milani]], [[Mehrangiz Kar]], [[Elaheh Koulaei]], and [[Farah Karimi]]. [[Women's rights movement in Iran|The women's movement]] during the [[Iranian revolution|revolution]], and in post-revolution Iran continued to be strong. Perhaps the most notable figure{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 11 November 2012}}]] --&gt;
After the passing of Ayatollah Khomeini, women put more pressure on the government to grant more rights to women. [[Ali Khamenei|Khamenei]], who followed Khomeini took a more liberal approach and enabled women's advancement by reopening the women's centers and restoring many of the laws that were abdicated after the revocation of Family Protection Laws.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

In May 1997, the overwhelming majority of women voted for [[Mohammad Khatami]], a reformist cleric who promised more political freedom. His election brought a period during which women became increasingly bold in expressing ideas, demands, and criticisms. The awarding of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to [[Shirin Ebadi]], an Iranian human rights and women's right activist, further emboldened women's rights activists inside Iran and cemented their relationships with Iranian feminists abroad.

During the Sixth [[Majlis of Iran|Parliament]], some of Iran's strongest advocates of women's rights emerged. Almost all of the 11 female lawmakers of the (at the time) 270-seat Majlis tried to change some of Iran's more conservative laws. However, during the [[Iranian legislative election, 2004|elections for the Seventh Majlis]], the all-male [[Council of Guardians]] banned the 11 women from running for office, and only conservative females were allowed to run. The Seventh Majlis reversed many of the laws passed by the reformist Sixth Majlis.

== Legal rights ==
During Mohammad Reza Shah's era, women were given the right to divorce or sue for divorce and also gained the right to vote. [[Abortion]] also became a right for women in cases such as rape. It was during this period that segregation laws were lifted and men and women were allowed to associate in public together.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt;

Most initiatives concerning women's rights during the Pahlavi dynasty began with the White Revolution in 1962, which eventually led to the enfranchisement of women. This enfranchisement came from the Prime Minister Asadollah Alam. Most revolutionary initiatives came with the White Revolution. A law was passed which gave women limited voting rights, allowing them the right to vote in local elections.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

Protests led by Ayatollah Khomeini regarding voting rights resulted in the repeal of the law. Khomeini believed that such power for women was comparable to prostitution.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shoaee|first=Rokhsareh S|date=1987|title=The Mujahid Women of Iran|url=|journal=The Middle East Journal|volume=|pages=519–537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the voting rights law was repealed, women were not allowed to take part in a referendum held during the White Revolution. However, the Minister of Agriculture suggested that women's movement leaders set up a voting booth to voice their suggestions. Though their votes did not count, the high number of women votes convinced Mohammad Reza Shah to grant women voting rights soon after the referendum. In September of the same year, 1963, in the parliamentary elections, six women were elected to the parliament, and two women were appointed by the Shah to serve in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esfandiari|first=Haleh|date=1997|title=Women and Iran's Islamic Revolution|url=|journal=Reconstructed Lives|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijab===
{{See also|Hijab}}
[[File:Basiji Students meeting with Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei - September 4, 1999 (1).jpg|thumb|Two [[Basij]]i women with Hijab]]
Hijab is a veil worn by [[Muslim]] women when interacting with males outside of their immediate family. Before the rise of the Achaemenian empire, women were not forced to wear a veil. In 1935, Reza Shah mandated that women should no longer be veiled in public.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt;

After Reza Shah mandated women to appear in public unveiled in 1935, a significant number of women became isolated in their houses as they felt going outside their home with no Hijab was equivalent to being naked. Women's dependency during this period grew as they relied on others to run errands. The unveiling law did not last long. When Mohammad Reza rose to power, he abdicated this law, and the hijab became an individual decision.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tafreshi|first=Poupak|date=January 2010|title=The Struggle for Freedom, Justice, and Equality: The History of the Journey of Iraninan Women in the Last Century|url=|journal=Washington University Open Scholarship|volume=|pages=1–98|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory Hijab was re-instated for Iranian state employees after the Islamic revolution in 1979 followed by a law for compulsory Hijab in all public spaces in 1983.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; On 26 November,2018 [[Nasrin Sotoudeh]], a female political prisoner at Tehran’s Evin Prison started a hunger strike demanding the release of [[Farhad Meysami]] a doctor who is in jail for protesting compulsory hijab.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-rights-actvist-stoudeh-starts-hunger-strike-meysami/29623512.html Prominent Rights Activist Goes On Hunger Strike In Iran Prison]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual law and zina===

'''Zina''' is an [[Sharia|Islamic legal]] term referring to unlawful sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Semerdjian|first=Elyse|date=2009|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|url=|journal=Oxford: Oxford University Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Iranian penal code of 1991, [[extramarital sex]] ([[zina]]) is punishable by [[stoning]] or [[Cutting|slashing]]. An entire chapter of Iranian penal code deals with [[punishment]]s for extramarital sex. Another chapter details how such relations can be proved and verified in the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boe|first=Marianne|date=2015|title=Family Law in Contemporary Iran: Women's Rights Activism and Shari'a|url=|journal=International library of Iranian Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage law===

As part of the White Revolution, Mohammad Reza Shah also enacted the Family Protection Laws. These were a series of laws that included women's rights to divorce, helped to raise the marriage age for both boys and girls, and curtailed the custom of polygamy, mandating spousal consent before lawfully marrying a second wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahdi|first=Ali|date=October 2012|title=The Iranian Women's Movement: A Century Long Struggle.|url=|journal=The Muslim World|volume=94|pages=427–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these laws, the right of divorce for women was granted by allowing women to put an end to a marriage if they were unhappy. The law also gave the right to women to keep custody of their children. In addition, it gave women the right to an abortion under certain circumstances, such as rape and if the woman's life was at risk.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

In 2008, President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s administration introduced a "family support bill" in the parliament that would have allowed men to marry a second wife without his first wife's permission and put a tax on ''Mariyeh'' – which is seen by many women "as a financial safety net in the event a husband leaves the marriage and is not forced to pay alimony."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iranian Parliament Delays Vote on Bill That Upset Judiciary, Women's Activists|last=Erdbring|first=Thomas|date=September 2008|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, however, the bill for the tax was returned by Iran's judiciary to the legislative council with complaints about the polygamy and tax articles,and these were removed from the bill.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

During the Ahmadinejad administration, ''Siqeh'', or temporary marriages (that can last from 30 minutes to a lifetime), was used, especially in response to the financial demands of prenuptial agreements. The temporary marriages, enacted by ''[[fatwa]]'' in 1983 under Khomeini, are heavily criticized as a form of legalized prostitution.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-Chron-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-Siq1-21|&lt;sup href="fatwa"&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-query.nytimes.com-22|&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Divorce law===

Divorce law in the Islamic republic of Iran was initially based upon the general rule in Shari'a law that gives men the sole right to end a marriage at any time. This is based on Article 1133 of the previous Civil Code (1928) that states: A man can divorce his wife whenever he wishes to do so.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-iranhrdc.org-23|&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

This law in the Iranian constitution was modified in 1967 by the Family Protection Act which granted women more rights regarding divorce and established mandatory procedures regarding divorce. This also served as an amendment that made all private divorces illegal."[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-iranhrdc.org-23|&lt;sup href="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

More divorce rights were given to women, including the right to apply for a divorce under specific conditions. Article 1130 of the [[Civil code|Civil Code]] gave the court more power to grant a judicial divorce requested by a woman as well as providing specific circumstances in which the wife can attain power of attorney and expedite the divorce process.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-iranhrdc.org-23|&lt;sup href="File:First Iranian women university.jpg"&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In modern Iran, divorce can be obtained by both men and women, and the custody of children is given to women rather than men.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

=== Civil law ===

Iran's civil law system can be seen as very gender distinct, with numerous laws pertaining to favor men over women and few, if any, laws favoring women. Iran follows strict Islamic laws. One of the civil laws that is recognized in Iran is the legal age of puberty. In Iran, children that reach the age of puberty also gain penal responsibility, meaning that once a child has surpassed the age of puberty, he or she is legally tried as an adult. This can be seen as disadvantageous towards women, as female children reach puberty around the age of ten and boys around the age of fourteen. This means that girls as young as the age of ten can be prosecuted criminally. Punishments can vary from prison sentences to lashes and, rarely, the death penalty.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-24|&lt;sup href="geography"&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Laws in Iran forces gender equality to be practically non-existent. Women continue to face mistreatment, especially by law enforcement officers. An example of this would be the mass amount of violence against women during the [[2009 Iranian presidential election]], where many women were arrested for voting for [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]]. One anonymous woman recollected what happened in prison, and said that one of the prison guards told her, “I will do something you will never forget. I'll make it so you never want to leave your house again, so any time you hear my name, you will tremble." In the end, these women's votes were never counted. [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] won the election by a landslide and, as a result, massive protests against this election occurred, saying that the election was a fraud. Ahmadinejad took office regardless.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-25|&lt;sup href="Iranian society"&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Education==
[[File:First Iranian women university.jpg|thumb|350px|First group of women who entered university, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;بدرالملوک بامداد، زن ایرانی از انقلاب مشروطه تا انقلاب سفید. تهران: ابن‌سینا، ۱۳۴۷. ص ۹۹&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{See also|Higher education in Iran|Science in Iran}}

Female education in Iran is a relatively recent advancement in society. Women have been allowed to attend school as of the late 19th century and have been allowed to attend college for merely 80 years. During the Qajar years, two schools were opened for girls, both of which were opened by missionaries for minority girls such as [[Christian]], [[Jews|Jew]], and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] girls. Among the elite families, some provided their daughters with education through private tutors, but, for the most part, Muslim girls were denied education as the clergies feared female education would negatively impact the fabric of Islamic society. For the pious and faithful Muslim women, education was only acceptable when it was in agreement with the teachings of Islam. The first school for Muslim girls opened at the end of 19th century in 1899. Women's education began to increase by 1920 as 58 schools in Tehran provided education for nearly 3,000 girls.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zahedifar|first=Effat|date=Spring 2012|title=Women in Higher Education in Iran|url=http://www.duo.uio.no|journal=DUO UIO|volume=|pages=5–75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah and his western development model and policies, women's education accelerated much more rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s. Before the fall of his dynasty, women's enrollment in universities was just over 30 percent.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

When Khomeini reached power in 1979, under his rule, the government began to Islamisize the Shah's westernized education system. To do this, they began purifying it to be culturally and religiously aligned with the new Islamic regime in Iran.  The options for what women could study was halved, as the goal of purification of the Shah's education system was to help the new system meet the needs of the society. Women were no longer able to study the following fields: veterinary medicine, geology, agricultural sciences, animal husbandry, and natural resources. These limitations were slowly lifted through lobbying efforts. By the end of the 20th century, all the limitations were lifted, and women were able to begin studying in these various fields. However, higher education was still male dominated.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

Educational opportunities increased through the rule of Mohammad Khatami, who served as President of Iran from 1997-2005. Khatami viewed the home as the proper setting for Iranian women, yet did not seek to exclude women from participating in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paradox of Tradition and Modernity in Female Education in the Islamic Republic of Iran|last=Mehran|first=Golnar|publisher=Comparative Education Review|year=2003|issn=0010-4086|location=|pages=269–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Power, and Politics in 21st Century Iran|last=Povey and Rostami-Povey|first=Tara and Elaheh|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2012|isbn=1409402053|location=|pages=42–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the increasing dominance of women in higher education, Khatami stated that though the increase was concerning, he did not wish to create obstacles to reduce this participation. Khatami called for an opening of majors and specialties for women in universities and an end to the quota system, which was introduced after the Islamic revolution  in Iran to put a cap on women's entrance to universities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

At the beginning of Khatami's presidency, over 95 percent of girls in Iran attended elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran|last=Vakil|first=Sanam|publisher=Bloombury publishing|year=2011|isbn=1441105166|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997-98, 38.2 percent of Iranian women enrolled in higher education. This number rose to 47.2 percent by 2000.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As female enrollment in schooling continued to climb, the segregation of the sexes in academic specialization continued to persist through the end of the 1990s. In the 1998-99 academic year, males dominated enrollment in math-physics at 58% and technical fields with 71% of secondary school students. Women disproportionately enrolled in the humanities and the experimental sciences at 61% of the enrollment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Gender specialization continued through the university level where a majority of women studied in the fields of basic sciences, medical sciences, and arts. Agriculture, veterinary science, engineering, and humanities were pursued mostly by men.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Overall, however, the decade was characterized by a three-fold increase in female enrollment in higher education.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

The statistics of the Khatami presidency show the slow rise of female participation in education. Women pursuing teaching positions in higher education also made gains during this period, as women held nearly half of all assistant professorships at universities, nearly double that held a decade before.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Higher Education in Iran|last=Rezai-Rashti|first=Goli-Moghadam, Valentine|publisher=International Review of Education|year=2011|ISSN=0020-8566|location=|pages=419–441}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of women accepted into tenure-track and full-time professorships in 2001-02 remained low at 17.3%, which is disproportionate to the number of educated women in Iranian society.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Male-dominated fields were overtaken by females as female numbers dramatically increased in the medical fields from 51% female versus 49% male.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

Data shows that nearly 80% of Iranian women are literate, but only 21% of these women are employed. In contrast, 85% of males are literate, and 79% of them are employed. In total, 40% of educated women are unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iranlaborreport.com/?p=895|title=Iranian Women Labor Woes|last=|first=|date=May 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past two decades, the number of women attending university institutions has multiplied. This rapid increase has caused concerns for the Iranian officials. In 2009, [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian parliament]] (Majlis) questioned if they need to establish a quota for the number of women entering public colleges. The conservatives believe that the increase in women's access to higher education is contrary to Islamic values and can threaten the traditional family structure that forms the basis of Islamic society.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

Despite all the improvement and advancement made concerning higher education for women, there have been many ups and downs regarding this issue. On August 6, 2012, the Mehr News Agency in Iran “posted a bulletin that 36 universities in the country had excluded women from 77 fields of study".  This was part of an effort by the parliament to put a quota on women's participation in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirazi|first=Faegheh|date=September 2014|title=Educating Iranian Women|url=|journal=International Journal of Education and Social Science|volume=2|pages=1–15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in women's enrollment in some fields is more apparent than others. For example, in 2008, 66% of students in medical sciences were women.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

The writer and activist [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] founded the first school for Persian girls in 1907. In this school, Iranian women could study a variety of subjects, including history, [[geography]], law, [[calculus]], religion, and cooking.

[[Women's rights movement in Iran|Iranian women rights activists]] determined that [[education]] was a key for [[Iranian women]] and [[Iranian society|society]]. They argued that giving women education was best for Iran, in that the mothers would raise better sons for their country.&lt;ref&gt;Sanasarian, Eliz (1982). The Women's Rights Movements in Iran. New York: Praeger. pp. 124–129. {{ISBN|0-03-059632-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment of 12 women into the [[Tehran University]] in 1936, marked the entry of women into university education in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/ancient_medicine_mesopotamia_iran.php ''History of Medicine in Iran'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Ali Khamenei]], [[Supreme leader of Iran]], declared percentage of female university was 33% before [[Islamic Revolution]] but after that on 2012, became 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.khamenei.ir/news/3345/The-educational-status-of-Iranian-women-before-and-after-the | title=The educational status of Iranian women before and after the Revolution | publisher=english.khamenei.ir | date=11 February 2016 | accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Iranian women have been influential in the sciences, such as [[Jaleh Amouzgar]], [[Eliz Sanasarian]], [[Janet Afary]], and [[Alenush Terian]]. [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] won gold medals in the 1994 and 1995 International Mathematical Olympiads,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://imo.math.ca/IMO95/newresults.html |title=1995 International Mathematical Olympiad (Unofficial) Results |access-date=September 22, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002161930/http://imo.math.ca/IMO95/newresults.html |archive-date=October 2, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 her work on dynamics made her the first woman in the world to win the [[Fields medal]], which is widely considered to be the most prestigious award in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Philip.

Retrieved 13 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Allameh Tabatabaii University]], [[Tarbiat Modares University]], and Azzahra University initiated a [[Women's Studies]] academic field at the [[Master of Arts]] level, and shortly thereafter [[Tehran University]] organized a similar program.

== Economic rights ==

During the Achaemenid Empire, women's contribution to the economy was through their engagement in agricultural duties, such as sowing seeds, harvesting, and tending livestock, but their primary role in society was bearing children. In rural areas and amongst poor urban families, women contributed to the economy by specializing in trades, such as making clothing and carpets.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt;

The rate of women's participation and contribution to Iran's economy "has been 14.7 and 14.4 in urban and rural areas respectively. According to the statistics of the 2006 census, out of the total households having a woman head of 10-year-old and over, only 14.1% in the urban and 13.9 percent in the rural areas have been employed from an economic point of view".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avazalipour, Zandi, Damankeshideh, Hakimipoor, Faramarzi|first=Mohammad Sadegh, Fatemeh, Marjan, Nader, Ayoub|date=2012|title=The role of women in economic participation and employment: A logistic model for iran|url=|journal=International Journal of Contemporary Mathematical Sciences|volume=6|pages=545–556|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's 2007 census showed that 10% of women were actively contributing to the economy. In contrast, over 60% of men were economically active. Statistics show that of the managerial positions available, the possibility of women obtaining such a position is one-third that of men.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rezazadeh|first=Razieh|date=2011|title=Women Empowerment and Good Urban Governance in Iran|url=|journal=Asian Social Science|volume=7|pages=260–268|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, women's labor-force participation rates remained very low at 12.6% in rural areas with an overall rate of 12.5%. In contrast, the rate for men is 66.1%. This data is not truly reflective of reality as women's engagement in informal and private sectors are not included in the data.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tohidi|first=Nayereh|date=October 2016|title=Women's Rights and Feminist Movement in Iran|url=|journal=Internatinoal Journal on Human Rights|volume=|pages=75–89|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]] figure estimates women's participation in all sectors at 32% and 75% for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,content|title=World Bank Online Database|last=|first=|date=2008|website=worldbank.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated data for women's leadership role is at 3.4% in 2006.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

== Political rights ==

For a short period during the Achaemenian Empire, women rose to power due to a lack of an adult male heir. First [[Boran|Purandukht]] and later [[Azarmidokht|Azarmidukht]] were given the title king of kings and ruled the country for a year. Their reign was short-lived as the Zoroastrian priesthood was against female leadership.&lt;ref name=":26"/&gt;

For most of the Islamic era in Iran, women were not allowed to engage in state affairs. However, soon after the rise of the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the 16th century, women were allowed to contribute to state affairs. Women's position was still subordinate to men, but they were allowed to manage their personal property and participate in cultural activities.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

Women gained a foothold in state affairs in the latter part of Pahlavi dynasty as they were given the right to vote. Iran's Queen [[Farah Pahlavi|Farrah Pahlavi]] was at the forefront of the women's movement and worked closely with the Shah to help women gain more rights in the 1960s and 1970s. It was during this period that the first woman was elected to Iran's parliament, Dr. [[Farrokhroo Parsa|Farrakhroo Parsay]], in 1963.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

During the first decade after the revolution in the early 1990s, there were only three women in parliament among the 268 members with women occupying 1.5% of the seats in the first three parliaments.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moinifar|first=Heshmat Sadat|date=2009|title=Participation of Women in Iran's Polity|url=|journal=GEMC Journal|volume=|pages=24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are 17 women among the 271 individuals in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radiozamaneh.com/280033|title=دهمین دوره مجلس ایران آغاز به‌کار کرد {{!}} رادیو زمانه|date=2016-05-28|work=رادیو زمانه|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, women's presence doubled to 3.3% of the seats. The women in parliament have ratified a total of 35 bills concerning women's issues.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;

Women participate in numerous sports in Iran and have represented the country in sporting events, such as the [[Asian Games]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic games]], and World Cups. An issue that has been voiced particularly in recent years has been in regard to women's participation at stadiums for men's volleyball and soccer. Efforts have been made to allow women to enter Iranian stadiums alongside men, but the proposal has not yet been approved. The ban on women entering stadiums has caused an uproar among both men and women in Iran. It has been indicated numerous times by lawmakers that women's duty is to raise children and not to attend sporting games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/sports/olympics/women-denied-entry-to-volleyball-event-thats-the-real-crime.html|title=Women Denied Entry to Volleyball Event: That’s the Real Crime|last=Macur|first=Juliet|date=2016-02-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-01|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November 2018 [[Fatma Samoura]] Secretary General of International Federation of Football Association FIFA said she would ask Iranian government to end ban on women’s entry to sport stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.radiofarda.com/a/fifa-engage-iran-on-women-allowed-in-stadiums/29590427.html FIFA To Engage With Iran To Lift Ban On Women In Stadiums]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are not allowed to ride bicycles in Iran pursuant to an Islamic fatwa issued by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader and autocrat. According to the Muslim clerics of Iran, if a man observes a woman riding a bicycle, it will lead to corruption in society with terrible consequences, including corruption that will lead to crime, sexual offenses, financial crimes, spiritual infidelity, religious disobedience, and many others.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-42|&lt;sup&gt;[42]]]

==Women's health==
{{See also|Health care in Iran|Family planning in Iran}}
The average life expectancy for Iranian women has increased from 44.2 years in 1960 to an average of 75.7 years in 2012 and the maternal mortality rate dropped from 83 to 23 per 100,000 between 1990 and 2013. In the 20th century, female social activists, health workers, and non-governmental organizations promoted the health of women by stressing the importance of regular check-ups such as the [[Pap smear]], [[mammography]], and blood tests. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation and [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] were emphasized with the goal of preventing [[osteoporosis]]. Even with the increased life expectancy that Iranian females have gained within the last 50 years, HIV/AIDS has become an alarming health problem among Iranian females. The [[HIV]]/AIDS rate with Iranian females has increased over five times between 2007 and 2015. As for concerns with mental health, depression in Iranian women was ranked first among diseases in 2011 compared to their second-place ranking in 2003. As for their social health, the delinquency of women has increased in recent years with crimes related to drugs and violence compared to Iranian men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joulaei|first=Hassan|last2=Maharlouei|first2=Najmeh|last3=lankarani|first3=Kamran Bagheri|last4=Razzaghi|first4=Alireza|last5=Akbari|first5=Maryam|date=2016-01-01|title=Narrative review of women’s health in Iran: challenges and successes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-016-0316-x|journal=International Journal for Equity in Health|volume=15|pages=25|doi=10.1186/s12939-016-0316-x|issn=1475-9276|pmc=4754925|pmid=26880036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Iranian parliament approved abortions carried out before four months gestation if a woman's life was at risk or if the fetus was malformed. With technical support from the [[United Nations Population Fund]], the government undertook literacy and family planning initiatives. The fund's specific contributions to the Literacy Movement Organization of Iran included training more than 7,000 teachers, developing a nine-episode television series on women's health issues (including family planning), and procuring computers and other equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americansforunfpa.org/site/c.enKMIRNpEkG/b.1568015/k.C97A/Adult_Education_Offers_Options_to_Iranian_Women.htm |title=''Adult Education Offers Options to Iranian Women'' |access-date=August 12, 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070221082253/http://www.americansforunfpa.org/site/c.enKMIRNpEkG/b.1568015/k.C97A/Adult_Education_Offers_Options_to_Iranian_Women.htm |archive-date=February 21, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights movement in Iran==

{{main|Women's rights movement in Iran}}
{{see also|Women's fraction|Vice Presidency for Women and Family Affairs|List of female members of the Cabinet of Iran|List of female members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly}}

Women's efforts to seek equal rights date back to the 19th and early 20th centuries. There is little available information on women's rights movements prior to the Qajar dynasty, but more accounts are available from the Qajar and post Qajar era. Women's movements in Iran can be divided into eight periods.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

1905-1925: this period was during the constitutional revolution, which marked the end of the Qajar dynasty. Women's efforts were mostly secretive, and their goals were to improve literacy, women's health, and prevent polygamy and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

1925-1940's: This era is marked by the beginning of the Pahlavi dynasty and the reign of Reza Shah. It was a new era in which women were unveiled and gained access to universities.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

1940's-1950's: The era of nationalization of [[Iran's oil industry]] brought women further access to education and political activism to some extent. However, aside from the Family Protection Law that failed and was repealed, no major reforms were made during this era.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

1960's-1970's: During the era of the White Revolution and period of modernization, women saw greater legal reforms concerning voting rights, family protection laws, as well as an increase in women's participation in the economy.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

1979-1997: The era of the revolution featuring change to the political sphere, caused the closure of women's centers and the decline of women's contributions to the economy.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

1997-2005: Khatami's era and the era of reforms gave more access to the feminist press and free press.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

2005-2013: The [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Ahmadinejad]] era or the neo-conservative era saw the increase of repression and the rise of unemployment.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

2013–Present: The era of moderation under the rule of President Rouhani has not seen any major reforms related to the status of women as hardliners already repealed most reforms.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

In the mid 19th century, [[Táhirih|Tahirih]] was the first woman to appear in public without wearing a veil, and she is known as the mother of the women's rights movements in Iran. After Tahirih, there were others who followed in her footsteps to raise the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zahedi|first=Ashraf|date=2007-08-27|title=Contested Meaning of the Veil and Political Ideologies of Iranian Regimes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/219931|journal=Journal of Middle East Women's Studies|volume=3|issue=3|pages=75–98|issn=1558-9579}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these individuals was Safiya Yazdi, the wife of a leading clergy, [[Muhammad Husain Yazdi]]. [[Safiya Yazdi]], with the support of her husband, opened [[Iffatiyah Girls School]] in 1910 and gained praise for her outspoken lectures on women's issues .&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

Women in Iran are becoming increasingly informed about the current trends within global feminism. They are also becoming more transnationally engaged, especially with regard to the mechanisms, tools, and machineries created through the U.N. gender projects and conventions, such as [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]. However, due to the vetting power of the conservative Guardian Council, attempts made by the reformist deputies in the [[sixth Majlis]] to ratify CEDAW did not succeed. Most women activists, including Islamic as well as secular ones, have been framing their demands within the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]] framework.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

In recent years, the government has made investments in women's organizations and women's activist initiatives that seek to empower women to learn skills that can help women gain more independence.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

The women's rights movement in Iran continues to attempt to institute reforms, particularly with the [[One Million Signatures]] Campaign to End Discrimination Against Women.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-Democracy Digest-58|&lt;sup&gt;[58]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==International influence and the women's movement==

=== The Persian cultural sphere ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Some-women-of-Iranian-background.JPG|thumb|From up to down: Safeeieh Ammeh Jan, [[Farzaneh Khojandi]], [[Golrokhsar Safi Eva]], and [[Nusrat Bhutto]]]] --&gt;
Women of modern Iran have close contacts with the women from the Iranian cultural sphere, that is, Persian-speaking countries, primarily  [[Tajikistan]], Afghanistan, and the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish areas]] of Iraq and Central Asia. Many [[women's rights]] activists, artists, and literary figures in the region cross borders to assist each other. For example, Iranian journalist Jila Bani Yaghoub and filmmaker [[Samira Makhmalbaf]] have contributed to the culture of Afghanistan. Iranian intellectual [[Farah Karimi]] wrote a book entitled "Slagveld Afghanistan" that criticizes Dutch military policies in Afghanistan, and in 2006, she was appointed as the representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radiozamaneh.com/special/2006/12/post_56.html |title=Farah Karimi: a fight for freedom |access-date=December 20, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020309/http://www.radiozamaneh.com/special/2006/12/post_56.html |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Sima Bina]], the voice of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] (a region of northeastern Iran), performed secular [[Threnody|threnodies]] at the ''[[Théâtre du Soleil]]'' for the benefit of the "Afghanistan: one child one book" project created by the organization [[Open Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oainternational.free.fr/concertAng.htm ''Sima Bina: "Afghanistan, one child one book" project'']&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 2004, the [[World Bank]] funded a "network of Persian women" for promoting the welfare of women in Persian-speaking lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-nabard.com/zanan/04072501.htm ''Network of women in Persian speaking countries'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Anousheh Ansari]], a woman whose family fled the country after the 1979 revolution was the first Iranian woman in space.&lt;ref name=Space&gt;[http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/060926_ap_iran_ansari.html Iranian Women Look Up to Find Ansari], Ali Akbar Dareini, ''[[Associated Press]]'' via Space.com, September 26, 2006. Retrieved September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The feat, undertaken in [[Kazakhstan]], was reportedly an inspiration to many Iranian women.&lt;ref name=Space/&gt;

=== Relationship with western feminism ===
Some suggest that only by accepting help from western feminists, whose progress has been recognized within western society, can the Iranian Women's Movement be recognized. This perspective suggests that western feminism can offer freedom and opportunity to Iranian women that their own religious society cannot. In addition, advocates of this view argue that no matter what the Iranian Women's Movement is able to achieve within Iranian society, the status of individual women within this society will always be less than what has been achieved by western feminists.&lt;ref name="Darraj, Susan Muaddi 2002"&gt;Darraj, Susan Muaddi. “Understanding the Other Sister: The Case of Arab Feminism.” Monthly Review: An Independent Socialist Magazine 53.10 (2002): 15–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, others suggest that parochial movements of women will never be successful, and that until a global sisterhood made up of women from all nations and religions has been established, feminism has not truly arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Fathi, Asghar. “Communities in Place and Communities in Space: Globalization and Feminism in Iran.” Women, Religion and Culture in Iran. Ed. Sarah Ansari and Vanessa Martin. Surrey, UK: Curzon, 2002. 215–224.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a third perspective suggesting that a global women's movement will inevitably ignore and undermine the unique elements of indigenous Iranian feminism which have arisen as a result of their history and religion.&lt;ref name="Darraj, Susan Muaddi 2002"/&gt;

Signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations has not improved women's situation much either. Howland in her book “Religious Fundamentalism and the Human Rights of Women” concerning the individual liberty within a democracy makes two suggestions to “the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]), [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|"a major human right treaty with 140 states]]"... Her first suggestion is "that in a spirit of democracy we first have to recognize that many of the women’s rights at stake in this context are core civil and political rights rather than simply issues of gender equality within the family.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Fundamentalisms and the human rights for women|last=Howland|first=Courtney|publisher=Springer|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=93–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further explains ”that religious fundamentalist has structured the dialogue to make the dispute appear to be about women’s rights within the family or private issues of religious belief,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;” but she argues that “there has been little focus on recognizing these so-called private rights and wrongs within the family as public political rights"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;... The second suggestion made by Howland is that “a state should be obligated to protest its citizens against certain actions that have heretofore been characterized as private.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Crimes against women==
[[Amnesty International]] noted in 2008 that the extent and prevalence of violence against women in the Kurdish regions of Iran is impossible to quantify, but discrimination and violence against women and girls in the Kurdish regions is both pervasive and widely tolerated. Furthermore, Kurdish cultural norms which facilitate the practice of forced child marriage perpetuate the fear of violence amongst Kurdish girls in Iran.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-Amnesty International 2008-68|&lt;sup href="sanshou"&gt;[68]&lt;/sup&gt;]]  In 2008, self-immolation "occurred in all the areas of Kurdish settlement (in Iran), where it was more common than in other parts of Iran".[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-amnesty.org-69|&lt;sup href="canoe polo"&gt;[69]&lt;/sup&gt;]] It was reported that in 2001, 565 women lost their lives in honor-related crimes in [[Ilam, Iran]], of which 375 were reportedly staged as self-immolation.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-amnesty.org-69|&lt;sup href="Warsaw"&gt;[69]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In Iran, [[Honor killing|honour killings]] occur primarily among tribal minority groups, such as the [[Kurds|Kurdish]], [[Arabic|Arab]], [[Lori people|Lori]], [[Baloch people|Baluchi]], and [[Turkish-speaking tribes]], while honor-related crimes are not a tradition among Persians who are generally less socially conservative. Discriminatory [[family law]]s, articles in the [[Criminal code|Criminal Code]] that show leniency towards honor killings, and a strongly male dominated society have been cited as causes of honor killings in Iran.[[Women's rights in Iran#cite note-74|&lt;sup&gt;[74]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11060">{{short description|term for people born during Generation X/Millennial cusp years}}
'''''Xennials''''' (also known as the '''Oregon Trail Generation''' and '''Generation Catalano''') is a [[neologistic]] term used to describe people born during the [[Generation X]]/[[Millennials|Millennial]] [[Cuspers|cusp]] years, typically from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. People who identify with Xennials, Oregon Trail Generation or Generation Catalano do so because they do not feel they fit within the typical definitions of Generation X or Millennials.

In 2017, ''Xennial'' was included in [[Merriam-Webster]]'s "Words We're Watching" section which discusses new words which are increasingly being used, but which do not yet meet criteria for a dictionary entry.

==Terminology==
The term "Xennials" is a [[portmanteau]] blending the names of [[Generation X]] and the [[Millennials]] to describe individuals born during the Generation X/Millennial cusp years of the late 1970s to the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=Stankorb&gt;{{cite web | url = http://magazine.good.is/articles/generation-xennials | title = Reasonable People Disagree about the Post-Gen X, Pre-Millennial Generation | last1 = Stankorb | last2 = Oelbaum | first1 = Sarah | first2 = Jed | date = 25 September 2014 | website = Good Magazine | publisher = [[Good Worldwide]]| access-date = 6 November 2015 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Xennial is reported to be first created and used in a September 2014 article in [[Good Worldwide|GOOD magazine]] &lt;ref name=Stankorb/&gt; written by Sarah Stankorb and Jed Oelbaum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-a-xennial-definition-attribution|title=I Made Up Xennial 3 Years Ago, So Why Is a Professor in Australia Getting All the Credit?|work=Vogue|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114140642/https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-a-xennial-definition-attribution#|archive-date=2017-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good magazine describes Xennials as "a micro-generation that serves as a bridge between the disaffection of Gen X and the blithe optimism of Millennials", using it to describe those born between 1977 and 1983.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Are you a xennial?

In 2018, Marleen Stollen writing for ''[[Business Insider]]'' described Xennials as term for people who don't feel like a Gen Xer or a Millennial. She used birth dates between 1977 and 1985 in her article to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/people-born-between-gen-x-millennials-xennials-2017-11|title=There's a term for people born in the early 80's who don't feel like a millennial or Gen Xer|last1=Stollen|first1=Marleen|date=10 January 2018|accessdate=2 May 2018|publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Oregon Trail Generation'' was used by Anna Garvey in her 2015 article "The Oregon Trail Generation: Life Before And After Mainstream Tech", published in ''Social Media Week'' to describe those born at "the tail end of the 70s and the start of the 80s".&lt;ref name=Garvey&gt;{{cite web | url = http://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/ | title = The Oregon Trail Generation: Life Before And After Mainstream Tech | last = Garvey | first = Anna | date = 21 April 2015 | website = Social Media Week | publisher = Crowdcentric Media, LLC. | access-date = 6 November 2015 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the video game ''[[The Oregon Trail (1985 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'', the [[Apple II]] version of which was played by many American GenX/Millennial [[cusper]]s in their school computer labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wagner|first1=Tony|title=What did Oregon Trail teach us?|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2017/05/05/tech/make-me-smart-kai-and-molly/blog-what-did-oregon-trail-teach-us|accessdate=14 May 2017|publisher=Marketplace|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms, such as Xennials, Generation Catalano&lt;ref name=Shafrir&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2011/10/generation_catalano_the_generation_stuck_between_gen_x_and_the_m.single.html | title = Generation Catalano | last = Shafrir | first = Doree | date = 24 October 2011 | website = Slate | publisher = The Slate Group | access-date = 6 November 2015 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Lucky Ones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anna|first1=Garvey|title=The Biggest Difference Between Millennials and My Generation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anna-garvey/the-biggest-and-best-difference-between-millennials_b_7438370.html|accessdate=25 February 2017|publisher=Huffington Post|date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were already coined and are referenced in her article.&lt;ref name=Garvey/&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' defines Generation Catalano as being born from 1977 to 1981, essentially [[Jimmy Carter]]'s presidency. The name is a reference to the character Jordan Catalano from the 1990s teen drama ''[[My So-Called Life]]''.&lt;ref name=Shafrir/&gt;

[[Merriam-Webster]] includes ''Xennial'' in their Words We're Watching section, defining the term as "a word that refers to people who were born on the cusp between Generation X and the millennials. Some consider 'xennials' to be those born between 1977 and 1983."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/words-were-watching-xennial|title=Words We're Watching: 'Xennial'|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics and traits==
Many who identify with the cusp years of Oregon Trail Generation, Xennials or Generation Catalano do so because they do not feel they fit within the typical definitions of [[Generation X]] or [[Millennials]].&lt;ref name=Shafrir /&gt;&lt;ref name=LaFrance&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/how-generations-get-their-names/459720/ | title = How Generations Get Their Names | last = LaFrance| first = Adrienne| date = 3 February 2016 | website= The Atlantic | publisher = Atlantic Media Company | access-date = 22 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendzior&gt;{{cite web | url = http://qz.com/720456/the-myth-of-millennial-entitlement-was-created-to-hide-their-parents-mistakes/ | title = The myth of millennial entitlement was created to hide their parents' mistakes | last = Kendzior | first = Sarah | date = 30 June 2016 | website= Quartz | publisher = Atlantic Media Company | access-date = 7 July 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassie McClure, writing for ''[[Las Cruces Sun-News]],'' describes those in the Oregon Trail Generation as "remembering a time before the digital age, but barely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/life/sunlife/2016/05/20/my-so-called-millennial-life-old-west-pioneers-digital-age/84227566/ | title = My So-Called Millennial Life: Old West pioneers of digital age | last = McClure | first = Cassie | date = 20 May 2016 | website= Las Cruces Sun-News | publisher = The USA Today Network | access-date = 22 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Garvey describes these individuals as having "both a healthy portion of Gen X grunge cynicism, and a dash of the unbridled optimism of Millennials", and discusses their relationship with both analog and digital technology.&lt;ref name=Garvey/&gt; Sheknows.com describes individuals born in the late 1970s and early 1980s as sharing traits with both Generation X and Millennials.&lt;ref name=Fogarty&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1105987/stuck-between-gen-x-millennials | title = 13 Signs you're stuck between Gen X &amp; millennials | last = Fogarty | first = Lisa | date = 7 January 2016 | website= SheKnows| publisher = SheKnows Media | access-date = 22 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Garvey describes U.S members of this group as having had an "[[AOL]] adolescence" and as being from "the last gasp of a time before [[sexting]], [[Facebook]] shaming, and constant communication".&lt;ref name=Garvey/&gt; ''[[The Dickinson Press]]'' describes those born in the early 1980s as having early adulthoods which were impacted by the events of the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=Monke&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/opinion/columns/3756532-monke-generation-stuck-transition | title = Monke: A generation stuck in transition | last = Monke| first = Dustin| date = 31 May 2015 | website= The Dickinson Press | publisher = The Dickinson Press and Forum Communications Company | access-date = 22 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Australian sociologist, Dan Woodman, "The theory goes that the Xennials dated, and often formed ongoing relationships, pre-social media. They usually weren't on [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] or [[Grindr]], for their first go at dating at least. They called up their friends and the person they wanted to ask out on a [[landline|landline phone]], hoping that it wasn't their intended date's parent who picked up.." Woodman also says "the 'Xennials' must be taken with several grains of salt. There isn't yet any strong academic evidence for the grouping, although clearly the idea resonates with a lot of people who felt left out by the usual categorizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Woodman |first1=Dan |title=From Boomers to Xennials: we love talking about our generations, but must recognise their limits |url=https://theconversation.com/from-boomers-to-xennials-we-love-talking-about-our-generations-but-must-recognise-their-limits-80679 |accessdate=13 June 2018 |publisher=The Conversation |date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dirham yahya 22332.jpg|thumbnail|[[Dirham]] coined under the reign of Yahya.]]
'''Yahya ibn Ali ibn Hammud al-Mu'tali''' ('''المعتلي يحي بن علي'''; died 1035) was [[Caliph of Cordoba]] in the [[Hammudid dynasty]] of the [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Moors|Moorish]] medieval [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]) for two times, from 1021 to 1023 and from 1025 to 1026. He was the son of caliph [[Ali ibn Hammud]], of [[Arab-Berber|Berber-Arab]] origins.

==Biography==
He was governor of [[Ceuta]] from 1016, a title he received from his father. After the latter's death, he refused to recognize his uncle [[Al-Qasim ibn Hammud al-Ma'mu|al-Qasim al-Ma'mun]] as caliph. After reaching [[Málaga]] he moved to [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] with a Berber army. Al-Qasim abandoned the city, taking refuge in [[Seville]]; Yahya reigned until 1023, when al-Qasim took back the throne. The latter was in turn ousted by the Umayyad party, which raised [[Abd ar-Rahman V]] to the caliphate.

Yahya moved to Málaga, and captured al-Qasim at [[Jerez de la Frontera]], having him executed. In 1025 he mustered another army to march on Córdoba where caliph [[Muhammad III of Córdoba|Muhammad III]], after news of the upcoming attack arrived, fled to [[Zaragoza]]. The Córdoban aristocracy created a council to govern the city in absence of a caliph; after some six months, however, they appealed to Yahya to enter the city and assume the title of caliph. He arrived on 9 November 1025; after a few days he left the government in the hands of his vizier [[Abu Ja`far Ahmad ben Musa]] while he returned to his secure stronghold of Málaga. 

The riots which ensued in Córdoba caused the final end of the Hammudid dynasty. In June 1026 the people expelled Yahya's vizier and elected the last caliph, the Umayyad [[Hisham III of Córdoba|Hisham III]].

After his definitive expulsion from Córdoba, Yahya created the independent [[taifa of Málaga|taifa (kingdom) of Málaga]], which he ruled until his death in 1035.
