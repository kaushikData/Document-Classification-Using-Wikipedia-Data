'''John Dadzie''', better known by his musical aliases '''12th Planet''' and '''Infiltrata''' is a [[Los Angeles]] based [[dubstep]] and [[drum and bass]] producer and DJ.

==Biography==
Born John Christopher Dadzie, he grew up in South Los Angeles, the youngest of four children.&lt;ref name="urb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/12th-planet-is-the-johnny-appleseed-of-dubstep-2174054 |title=12TH Planet is the Johnny Appleseed of Dubstep |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date = February 23, 2012|first = Liz|last = Ohanesian|website = laweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first introduced to the electronic music scene in high school. After forming Imperial Recordings with DJ Lith, he launched his production skills on his own terms, originally producing [[drum and bass]] under the alias Infiltrata. In 2006, he decided that he was going to make [[dubstep]]. It was then that his new alias 12th Planet was created, in reference to [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s book, 12th Planet. All production under the name 12th Planet is original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebigupmagazine.com/blog/about/music/12th-planet/ |title=12th Planet interview in Big magazine |publisher=thebigupmagazine.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314185607/http://thebigupmagazine.com/blog/about/music/12th-planet/ |archivedate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the first individuals to bring the dubstep culture to America (in one of the USA's electronic meccas, [[Los Angeles]]) 12th Planet has frequently been cited as the General of the Riddim Gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urb.com/2010/10/19/12-things-about-12th-planet-and-his-new-music-video-too/ |title=12 Things About 12th Planet (and his new music video too!) |publisher=URB |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803201159/http://www.urb.com/2010/10/19/12-things-about-12th-planet-and-his-new-music-video-too/ |archivedate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1899">'''Abassa''' (also known as '''Abbasa''') (born {{circa}} 765 – died after 803) was an [[Arabian]] noblewoman.

She was the daughter of [[Al-Mahdi]]. Her mother was a concubine by the name of Rahim. She was the [[half-sister]] of [[Al-Hadi]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], [[‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī|Ulayya]], and [[Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi]]. Harun al-Rashid was known for being unhappy with the fact that he was a relative of Abassa's, as he was attracted to her. To keep Abassa in his life, he had her marry [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]]. The marriage was supposed to be one of convenience, but Abassa fell in love with her arranged husband. At night, a [[slave]] woman would be sent to Ja'far's bedroom, and Abassa took the slave woman's place one evening. Her husband was surprised. Abassa would get pregnant and give birth to [[twin]] boys in secret. The twins would be raised in [[Mecca]]. Harun eventually found out about the relationship, and had Ja'far killed. Abassa was either killed, or, sent into [[exile]].&lt;ref name=gale&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Gale|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591300042.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Betham&gt;{{cite book|last=Betham|first=Matilda|title=Dictionary of the Celebrated Women, Every Age and Country|year=1804|publisher=B.

'''Abd al-Qadir''' also known as Abdulkadir, was [[Sokoto Grand Vizier]] (1842–1859). He was preceded by his father, [[Gidago dan Laima]] (1817–1842) and succeeded by [[Ibrahim Khalilu]] (1859-c. 1874). Prior to his appointment as vizier, Abdulkadir participated in 25 raids under Sultan [[Muhammed Bello]]&lt;ref&gt;Last, M. D. The Sokoto caliphate. Humanities Press. P. 156&lt;/ref&gt; and four raids with his uncle, [[Abu Bakr Atiku]]. He was a close confidant of Sultan [[Ali Babba bin Bello|Ali]] and a son of [[Nana Asma'u]]&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Mack, Jean Boyd. Educating Muslim Women: The West African Legacy of Nana Asma'u 1793-1864 (2013. Kube Publishing. P. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vizier==
His reign as vizier was effective but it had some limitations. Abdulkadir was involved in removing Umar Nagwamatse as ruler of Katuru, Umar's reputation was that of a high living, independent and successful prince but was proving unsuitable as ruler. Umar later moved southwards and founded a [[Fulbe|Fulani]] emirate in [[Kontagora Emirate|Kontagora]].&lt;ref&gt;Last. P. 159&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were limitations to his power. When Bukhari, the Emir of [[Hadejia]] obtained power by force, Abdulkadir was charged to deal with the situation. He proceeded to [[Katagum]] and summoned Bukhari but the latter threatened him with his troops, Bukhari was declared a rebel and his brother, Ahmad was appointed Emir. Bukhari sought help from [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. But two expeditions, one led by Ahmad, Abdulkadir's brother and the second by Abdulkadir himself were unsuccessful, meanwhile, Bukhari later killed his brother and took charge of Hadejia.

Abdulkadir's  role also included recommending the appointment of Emirs to the Sultan. During this period, presents presented to the vizier and also to the Sultan were regularized as taxes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8576">'''Flavius Ablabius'''&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'', pp.100, 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millar-210"&gt;Millar, ''The Roman Near East, 31 B.C.-A.D. 337'', p.210&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Ablabius'''&lt;ref name="Nordgren-385"&gt;Nordgren, ''The Well Spring Of The Goths: About The Gothic Peoples in The Nordic Countries And On The Continent'', p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Ablavius'''&lt;ref name="Budge-163"&gt;Budge, ''Paradise of the Holy Fathers Part 1'', p.163&lt;/ref&gt; (flourished 4th century, died 338) was a high official of the [[Roman Empire]].

==Family and early life==
Ablabius was a [[Greeks|Greek]] from the island of [[Crete]] and a man of humble birth.&lt;ref name="Jones-3"&gt;Jones, ''The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire: Volume 1, AD 260-395'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; When his mother was pregnant with him, she allegedly received a prophecy from an [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egyptian]] astrologer about him, that she would almost have borne an Emperor.&lt;ref name="Jones-3"/&gt; 

His date of birth is unknown, the identities of his parents are unknown, and it is unknown whether he had any siblings or relatives and his early life is largely a mystery. Ablabius was of a non-aristocratic and non-[[Roman Senate|senatorial]] background,&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'', pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salzman-100"&gt;Salzman, ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'', p.100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coon-28"&gt;Coon, ''That Gentle Strength: Historical Perspectives on Women in Christianity'', p.28&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was at birth a pagan who converted later to [[Christianity]]. Ablabius became one of the officials of the Roman Governor of Crete.&lt;ref name="Jones-3"/&gt; At some point, Ablabius left Crete and travelled to [[Constantinople]] to make his fortune.&lt;ref name="Jones-3"/&gt;

==Constantine I and his family==
After arriving at Constantinople, Ablabius by chance acquired great influence over the [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and became one of the most important senators of Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eunapius]], ''The Life of Philosophers and Sophists'', Book VI. Three. 1-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coon-28"/&gt; 

Ablabius served as ''[[vicarius]]'' of the [[Diocese of Asia]], held the [[praetorian prefecture of the East]] from 329 to 337/338, and served as [[Roman consul|ordinary consul]] in 331.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire: Volume 1, AD 260-395'', pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; Ablabius was active in the Roman East and West&lt;ref name="Salzman-100"/&gt; and during his political career, he was based at [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Millar-210"/&gt;

Considering his provincial background,&lt;ref name="Salzman-100"/&gt; Ablabius seemed to be attached to Constantine I, making him one of a small number of Easterners who held high offices&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'', p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the Roman Empire. 

Ablabius convinced Constantine that the failure of grain supplies to arrive at Constantinople had been caused by the magical arts of the pagan sage [[Sopater of Apamea]], who had verbally attacked the Emperor and Ablabius for their dissolute behavior. Constantine followed the advice of Ablabius and had Sopater put to death. In 333 Constantine addressed a letter to Ablabius&lt;ref name="Jones-3"/&gt; which is still preserved, in which he decreed that each party in a trial could appeal to a bishop’s judgment. 

In 336, Constantine ordered a Greek inscription carved on a pedestal of a statue representing himself in Antioch, where Ablabius is named with his fellow senators [[Lucius Papius Pacatianus]], [[Valerius Felix]], [[Annius Tiberianus]] and [[Nestorius Timonianus]].&lt;ref name="Millar-210"/&gt; Constantine also made Ablabius tutor and preceptor of his son [[Constantius II]].&lt;ref name="Jones-4"&gt;Jones, ''The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire: Volume 1, AD 260-395'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; When Constantine died in May 337, Constantius succeeded him. Later in 337, Ablabius sided with [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], the [[Nicene]] [[Bishop of Alexandria]] who had powerful enemies at the court of the pro-[[Arianism|Arian]] Constantius. Due to Ablabius’ support for Athanasius, Constantius dismissed him from the imperial court, and Ablabius retired to his estates in [[Bithynia]].&lt;ref name="Jones-4"/&gt; In 338, Constantius condemned Ablabius to death following false accusations of intending to usurp the throne; the emperor had him executed in front of his own house.&lt;ref name="Jones-4"/&gt; His house in Constantinople later belonged to the Empress [[Galla Placidia]].&lt;ref name="Jones-4"/&gt;

==Family==
Ablabius had married an unnamed noblewoman by whom he had two known children: 
* A daughter, [[Olympias of Armenia|Olympia, also known as Olympias]]&lt;ref name="Nordgren-385"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faustus of Byzantium, ''History of the Armenians'', Book IV, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;
* A son, [[Seleucus (son of Ablabius)|Seleucus]].&lt;ref name="Budge-163"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire: Volume 1, AD 260-395, Parts 260-395'', pp. 3, 4 &amp; 818&lt;/ref&gt; Through Seleucus, Ablabius would have further descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Moret, ''Sertorius, Libanios, iconographie: a propos de Sertorius, journée d'étude, Toulouse, 7 avril 2000 [suivi de] autour de Libanios, culture et société dans l'antiquité tardive : actes de la table ronde, Avignon, 27 avril 2000'', p.207&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he would be the paternal grandfather of the great Saint [[Olympias the Deaconess]].&lt;ref name="Budge-163"/&gt;

'''Agape''' ([[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|ἀγάπη}}, ''agapē'') is a [[Greeks|Greco]]-[[Christian]] term referring to love, "the highest form of love, charity" and "the love of God for man and of man for God".&lt;ref name="LiddellScott2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=H. G. Liddell|author2=Robert Scott|title=An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon: Founded Upon the Seventh Edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon|date=October 2010|publisher=Benediction Classics|isbn=978-1-84902-626-0|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is not to be confused with [[philia]], [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|brotherly love]], as it embraces a universal, unconditional love that transcends and persists regardless of circumstance. The noun form first occurs in the [[Septuagint]], but the verb form goes as far back as [[Homer]], translated literally as [[affection]], as in "greet with affection" and "show affection for the dead".&lt;ref name="LiddellScott1871"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry George Liddell|author2=Robert Scott|title=A Lexicon Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon|year=1901|publisher=Oxford : Clarendon Press|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient authors have used forms of the word to denote love of a spouse or family, or affection for a particular activity, in contrast to [[Eros (concept)|eros]] (an affection of a sexual nature).

Within Christianity, ''agape'' is considered to be the [[love of God|love originating from God]] or [[Christ]] for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Matt 3:17, Mark 10:21&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], it refers to the covenant love of God for humans, as well as the human reciprocal love for God; the term necessarily extends to the love of one's fellow man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/662884/agape "agape."] Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 17 Sep. 2011.
&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary writers have sought to extend the use of ''agape'' into non-religious contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oord|first1=Thomas Jay|title=The love racket: Defining love and ''agape'' for the love-and-science research program|journal=Zygon|date=December 2005|volume=40|issue=4|pages=919–938|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2005.00717.x|url=http://www.calvin.edu/~jks4/city/Oord~Defining%20Love.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''agape'' has been widely examined within its Christian context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anders Nygren|Nygren, Anders]] ([1938–39] 1953). ''[[Eros and Agape]]'', Part I: A Study of the Christian Idea of Love; Part II The History of the Christian Idea of Love, trans. P.S. Watson.

==Early uses==
There are few instances of the word agape in polytheistic Greek literature. [[Bauer's Lexicon]] mentions a sepulchral inscription, most likely to honor a polytheistic army officer held in "high esteem" by his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick William|title=A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==
[[File:Agape feast 03.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of a female figure holding a chalice at an early Christian [[Agape feast]]. [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter|Catacomb]] of Saints [[Marcellinus and Peter]], [[Via Labicana]], [[Rome]]]]{{See also|1 Corinthians 13}}
A journalist in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]  describes [[John 3:16]] as "one of the most famous and well-known Bible verses. It has been called the 'Gospel in a nutshell' because it is considered a summary of the central doctrines of [[Christianity]]."

{{quote|For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.|John 3:16|''[[King James Version|KJV]]''}}

The word ''agape'' received a broader usage under later Christian writers as the word that specifically denoted Christian love or [[charity (virtue)|charity]] ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|13:1–8|KJV}}), or even [[God in Christianity|God]] himself. The expression "God is love" (ὁ θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν) occurs twice in the [[New Testament]]: [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] {{Bibleref2-nb|1 John|4:8,16|KJV;SBLGNT}}. ''Agape'' was also used by the early Christians to refer to the self-sacrificing love of God for humanity, which they were committed to reciprocating and practicing towards God and among one another (see ''[[kenosis]]'').

''Agape'' has been expounded on by many Christian writers in a specifically Christian context. C. S. Lewis uses ''agape'' in ''[[The Four Loves]]'' to describe what he believes is the highest level of love known to humanity: a selfless love that is passionately committed to the well-being of others.&lt;ref name=Kreeft&gt;Kreeft, Peter. [http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0019.html "Love"]. Retrieved May 22, 2009.
* {{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |authorlink=C. S. Lewis |title=The Four Loves |publisher=Fount |location=London |date=June 5, 2002  |origyear=1960 |isbn=0-00-628089-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian use of the term comes directly from the canonical [[Gospel]]s' accounts of the teachings of [[Jesus]]. When asked what was the [[Great Commandment|great commandment]], "Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second ''is'' like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." ({{bibleverse||Matthew|22:37-40|KJV}}) In [[Judaism]], the first "love the {{LORD}} thy God" is part of the [[Shema Yisrael|Shema]].

[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''The Sermon on the Mount'', [[Carl Bloch]], 1877]]
In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], Jesus said:

{{quote|You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love (''agapēseis'') your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, Love (''agapāte'') your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you?|Matthew 5:43-46|[[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]}}

[[Tertullian]] remarks in his 2nd century defense of Christians that Christian love attracted pagan notice: "What marks us in the eyes of our enemies is our loving kindness. 'Only look,' they say, 'look how they love one another' " (''[[Apologetics|Apology]]'' 39).

Anglican theologian [[Oliver Chase Quick|O.C. Quick]] writes that this ''agape'' within human experience is "a very partial and rudimentary realization," and that "in its pure form it is essentially divine." 

{{quote|If we could imagine the love of one who loves men purely for their own sake, and not because of any need or desire of his own, purely desires their good, and yet loves them wholly, not for what at this moment they are, but for what he knows he can make of them because he made them, then we should have in our minds some true image of the love of the Father and Creator of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Quick, O.C. ''Doctrines of the Creed'', Scribners, 1938 p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[New Testament]], the word ''agape'' is often used to describe God's love. However, other forms of the word are used in a negative context, such as the various forms of the verb ''[[wikt:ἀγαπάω|agapaō]]''. Examples include:

* {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:10|KJV}}— "for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved [''agapēsas''] this present world...".
* {{bibleverse||John|12:43|KJV}}— "For they loved [''ēgapēsan''] the praise of men more than the praise of God."
* {{bibleverse||John|3:19|KJV}}— "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved [''ēgapēsan''] darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."

[[Karl Barth]] distinguishes ''agape'' from ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' on the basis of its origin and unconditional character. In ''agape'', humanity does not merely express its nature, but transcends it. ''Agape'' identifies with the interests of the neighbor "in utter independence of the question of his attractiveness" and with no expectation of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Dogmatics IV.2'', as translated by G. W Bromiley (1958), p. 745.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meal===
{{Main|Agape feast}}
The word ''agape'' is used in its plural form (''agapai'') in the New Testament to describe a meal or feast eaten by early Christians, as in [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] {{bibleverse-nb||Jude|1:12|KJV}} and [[Second Epistle of Peter|2nd Peter]] {{bibleverse-nb|2|Peter|2:13|KJV}}.

'''Bat-fowling''' is an archaic method of catching [[bird]]s at night,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/slideshows/8-amusing-stories-behind-common-expressions/5/ |title=8 Amusing Stories Behind Common Expressions &amp;#124; Reader's Digest |publisher=Rd.com |date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while they are at [[Bird#Resting and roosting|roost]]. The process involves lighting straw or torches near their roost. After awakening them from their roost, the birds fly toward the flames, where, being amazed, they are easily caught in nets, or beaten with bats. The phrase "beating about the bush" is said to be derived from this practice as the [[Trapping|trapper's]] accomplices would go around the bushes to disturb the birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2107 curious word origins, sayings and expressions from white elephants to a song and dance|author=Funk, Charles Earle|authorlink=Charles Earle Funk|year= |isbn=0-88365-845-3| page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was also called '''lanciatoia''' in [[Italy]] and a variation was called '''low-belling'''.

Validated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to [[life extension|extend lifespan]], because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism.&lt;ref name="BakerGT" /&gt;  Although [[maximum lifespan]] would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] would take far too much time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harrison, Ph.D. | first = David E. | title = V.

Although [[Human hair color#Gray and white hair|graying of hair]] increases with age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Van Neste D, Tobin DJ | title=Hair cycle and hair pigmentation: dynamic interactions and changes associated with aging | journal=MICRON | volume=35 | issue=3 | year=2004 | pages=193–200 | id= | pmid=15036274 | doi=10.1016/j.micron.2003.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, [[wrinkle|skin wrinkles]] and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. [[Gerontology#Biogerontology|Biogerontologists]] have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 [[memory T cell]]s and [[naive T cell]]s have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miller RA | title=Biomarkers of aging: prediction of longevity by using age-sensitive T-cell subset determinations in a middle-aged, genetically heterogeneous mouse population| journal=Journals of Gerontology | volume=56 | issue=4 | year=2001 | pages=B180–B186 | id= | pmid=11283189 | doi=10.1093/gerona/56.4.b180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[big data]] analysis allowed for the new types of "aging clocks" to be developed.

It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the [[transcriptomic clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The transcriptional landscape of age in human peripheral blood |journal=Nature Communications |volume=6 |pages=8570 |year=2015 |author= Peters M |url= http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9570 |doi=10.1038/ncomms9570 |pmid=26490707 |pmc=4639797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A broader acceptance of biomarkers of aging, however, will depend on a better understanding of the observed correlations to the incidence of specific diseases, improved transferability of the models across populations and reduction of costs of the studies. The recent introduction of low-power and compact sensors, based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) has led to a new breed of the wearable and affordable devices providing unparalleled opportunities for the collecting and cloud-storing personal digitized activity records. 
Consequently, modern [[deep learning]] techniques could be used to produce a proof-of-concept digital biomarker of age in the form of all-causes-mortality predictor from a sufficiently  large collection of one week long human physical activity streams augmented by the rich clinical data (including the death register, as provided by, e.g., the [[NHANES]] study).&lt;ref name="pmid 29581467"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tim Pyrkov, Konstantin Slipensky, Mikhail Barg, Alexey Kondrashin, Boris Zhurov, Alexander Zenin, Mikhail Pyatnitskiy, Leonid Menshikov, Sergei Markov, and Peter O.

[[Image:Body bag.jpg|thumb|A body bag in 2006. It is being folded by some policemen and soldiers.]]

[[File:13-11-12-rechtsmedizin-berlin-charite-by-RalfR-20.jpg|thumb|A body bag in the morgue of the [[Charité]].]]

A '''body bag''', also known as a '''cadaver pouch''' or '''human remains pouch''' ('''HRP'''), is a non-porous bag designed to contain a [[human body]], used for the storage and transportation of [[Dead body|corpse]]s. Body bags can also be used for the storage of corpses within [[morgue]]s. Before purpose-made body bags were available, [[cotton]] [[mattress]] covers were sometimes used, particularly in combat zones during the [[Second World War]]. If not available, other materials were used such as bed sheets, blankets, shelter halves, ponchos, sleeping bag covers, tablecloths, curtains, parachute canopies, tarpaulins, or discarded canvas—“sealed in a blanket”—slang. However, the subsequent [[rubber]] (and now [[plastic]]) body bag designs are much superior, not least because they prevent leakage of body fluids, which often occurs after someone dies. The dimensions of a body bag are generally around 36 inches by 90 inches (91&amp;nbsp;cm by 229&amp;nbsp;cm). Most have some form of carrying handles, usually webbing, at each corner and along the edges.

In modern warfare, body bags have been used to contain the bodies of dead soldiers. Disaster agencies typically have reserves of body bags, both for anticipated wars and natural disasters. During the [[Cold War]], vast reserves of body bags were built up in anticipation of millions of fatalities from [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This was the subject of [[Adrian Mitchell]]'s protest poem "Fifteen Million Plastic Bags".

Body bags are sometimes portrayed in films and television as being made of a heavy black plastic. Lightweight white body bags have since become popular because it is much easier to spot a piece of evidence that may have been jostled from the body in transit on a white background than on a black background. Even so, black body bags are still in general use. Other typical colors include orange, blue, or gray. Body bags used in the Vietnam War were heavy-duty black rubberized fabric. Regardless of their color, body bags are made of thick plastic and have a full-length [[zipper]] on them. Sometimes the zipper runs straight down the middle. Alternatively, the path of the zipper may be J-shaped or D-shaped. Depending on the design, there are sometimes handles (two on each side) to facilitate lifting. It is possible to write information on the plastic surface of a body bag using a marker pen, and this often happens—either in situ (particularly when a large number of bodies are being collected) or at the [[mortuary]], before being stored in refrigerated cabinets. Alternatively, some designs of body bags have transparent label pockets as an integral part of the design, into which a name-card can be inserted. In any case, a conventional [[toe tag]] can easily be tied to one of the lifting handles if required. Body bags are not designed to be washed and re-used. Aside from the obvious hygiene concerns, re-use of body bags could easily contaminate evidence in the case of a suspicious death. As a result, body bags are routinely discarded and incinerated after one use. In Afghanistan US forces have used body bags to deliver ammunition, medical supplies, and rations to troops in the field. Fifty or so pounds of supplies are packed loose in a body bag and pulled out of the helicopter delivering them to be easily and rapidly dragged to cover by one or two soldiers.

Although body bags are most often used for the transport of human remains from their place of discovery to a [[funeral home]] or [[mortuary]], they can also be used for temporary burials such as in a combat zone. In such situations, proper funerals are impossible because of imminent enemy attack. This was the situation during the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, during which British dead were placed in gray plastic body bags and then laid in mass graves. Some months after the conflict ended, all remains were exhumed from their temporary graves to receive a conventional funeral service with full military honors.

The term "body bag" is sometimes used for fashion or other bags worn on the body (''sling body bag'' or ''across body bag'') and this sense has no connection with either of the two above senses.

With the addition of provision for breathing, specially adapted body bags are also used for the [[BDSM]] practice of [[mummification (BDSM)|mummification]].

{{about|the occupation in agriculture, animal husbandry, or animal fancy}}

A '''breeder''' is a person who [[selective breeding|selectively breeds]] carefully selected  [[mating|mates]], normally of  the same [[breed]] to [[sexually reproduce]] offspring with specific, consistently replicable qualities and characteristics. This might be as a [[farmer]], [[agriculture|agriculturalist]], or [[hobby]]ist, and can be practiced on a large or small scale, for food, fun, or profit.

==About==
A breeder can breed purebred pets such as cats or dogs, livestock such as cattle or horses, and may show their animals professionally in assorted forms of competitions In these specific instances, the breeder strives to meet standards in each animal set out by organizations. A breeder may also assist with the breeding animals in the zoo. In other cases, a breeder can be referred to an animal scientist who has the capabilities of developing more efficient ways to produce the meat and other animal products humans eat.&lt;ref name=Breeder&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Breeder: Information About Starting a Career as an Animal Breeder|url=http://education-portal.com/articles/Animal_Breeder_Information_About_Starting_a_Career_as_an_Animal_Breeder.html|publisher=Education Portal|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earnings as a breeder vary widely because of the various types of work involved in the job title. Even in breeding small domestic animals, the earning differ. It mostly depends on the type of animal being bred and whether or not the breeder has a reputation of breeding champions. The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] reports that large animal breeders that work as veterinarians earned a median annual income of $61,029 in 2006.{{dubious|date=February 2013}}&lt;!-- that looks like a veterinarian's salary, not what a breeder might earn--&gt; The other individuals employed in the field of animal science earned $47,800.&lt;ref name=Breeder/&gt;

==Required education==
To breed small and domestic animals, no formal training or credentials are required, though it is recommended they familiarize themselves with the desired and standard characteristics of the breed they work with. For those who are seeking to breed more exotic animals, such as those in a zoo, a bachelor's degree in veterinary science is needed. It is also recommended that an individuals also goes onto graduate school and specializes in zoology. To breed agricultural animals, a 4-year degree in agricultural science is needed for most entry-level positions.&lt;ref name=Breeder/&gt;

{{pp-vandalism|expiry=indef|small=yes}}
{{more footnotes|date=March 2015}}

A '''cabbit''' is a fictional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a [[cat]] and a [[rabbit]].  They have appeared in fiction and fantasy stories including [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] and [[manga]], and have also been dubiously purported to have been observed in the wild.  Most if not all observations are attributable to either misidentified Manx cats or outright hoaxes.

A cat-rabbit hybrid creature was first incorrectly documented by [[Joseph Train]] of Castle Douglas, Galloway, Scotland, in his "An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man", where he opined that the local Manx cat was such a hybrid: "My observations on the structure and habits of the specimen in my possession, leave little doubt on my mind of its being a ''mule'', or cross between the female cat and the buck rabbit."&lt;ref name="Train"&gt;{{Harvnb|Train|1845}}, volume 1, p.21n; By ''mule'', Train means only figuratively of course, he's not suggesting the manx is a cross between horse and ass&lt;/ref&gt; Train also refers to the tufty tail on the posterior of the "Manks" cat as being a ''fud'' ({{lang-sco|[[wiktionary:fud#Scots|fud]]}}), "or brush like that of a rabbit." Scientific study has determined that such a hybrid is genetically impossible.&lt;ref name="cantbreed"&gt;Sarah Hartwell.  [http://www.messybeast.com/cabbit3.htm "Cabbits - Why Cats Can't Breed With Rabbits"].  2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[portmanteau]] term "cabbit" is used for such imagined hybrids.  The exact year of coinage is uncertain.  The term was used in 1977 to describe a specimen found in New Mexico and exhibited in Los Angeles.  The specimen was showcased on [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]] and was later determined to be a cat with a deformed pelvis.&lt;ref name="messybeast"&gt;[http://www.messybeast.com/cabbit.htm Cabbits - What Are They]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cat mutations==
[[Manx cat]]s and other cats with tailless or bobtailed mutations account for many alleged cabbit sightings.  The mutation that causes taillessness can also cause skeletal and/or nerve abnormalities that result in the cat's using a hopping motion.  This was once accepted by breeders as a feature of the Manx's look, but is now considered a serious fault in the show-ring and does not form part of the modern Manx standard of points.  Modern breeders of the Manx are careful to breed only from cats that have normal locomotion.  The relatively long hind legs of the Manx, combined with taillessness or a very short tail, give the impression of a rabbit.

In 1947, Grace Cox-Ife wrote: "There are several points about a Manx that make it anything but ordinary. The chief one is, of course, its taillessness; but this is not quite the whole story. Not only must a Manx have no tail but it should really be a further joint or more short on the spinal column; that is to say there should be a hollow where the tail would normally begin. Then there is the gait &amp;ndash; a rabbity hop rather than a walk- which is caused by the height of the hindquarters: according to the Manx Cat Club these "cannot be too high, and the back cannot be too short, while there must be great depth of flank.

Rose Tenent wrote: "No cat is more fascinating than the tailless Manx, with its rabbit-like hoppity gait [...] .

Occasionally the flap of loose skin from the belly to the haunches is absent, enhancing the visual similarity to a rabbit.

Cats with radial [[hypoplasia]] (abnormal short forelegs) may also adopt a rabbit-like gait.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}

The '''Cairo Gang''' was a group of British intelligence agents who were sent to [[Dublin]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]] to conduct intelligence operations against prominent members of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA)&amp;nbsp;– according to Irish intelligence with the intention of assassinating them. Twelve men including [[British Army]] officers, [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] officers and a civilian informant were killed on the morning of 21 November 1920 by the [[Irish Republican Army]] in a planned series of simultaneous early-morning strikes engineered by [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. The events were the first killings of [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]].

Some Irish historians (such as [[Tim Pat Coogan]] and [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]]) dispute assertions of a common history of service in the Middle East as the reason for the unit's ''nom de guerre''. It has been suggested that they received the name because they often held meetings at Cafe Cairo at 59 Grafton Street in Dublin. Earlier books on the 1919–1923 period do not refer to the Cairo Gang by that name.

==Background==
By 1920, the IRA's Dublin headquarters, under the direction of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] had effectively eliminated, through targeted assassination and intelligence penetration, the G Division of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]], previously the mainstay of the Crown's intelligence operations against Irish Republicans. In response the [[Dublin Castle administration in Ireland|Dublin Castle administration]], the then headquarters of the British government in [[Ireland]] were forced to look for external intelligence support.

In January 1920, the British Army Intelligence Centre in Ireland stood up a special plainclothes unit of 18–20 demobilized ex-army officers and some active-duty officers to conduct clandestine operations against the IRA. The officers received training at a school of instruction in London, most likely under the supervision of Special Branch, which had been part of Britain's Directorate of Home Intelligence since February 1919. They may also have received some training from [[MI5]] officers and former officers working for Special Branch. Army Centre, Dublin, hoped these officers could eventually be divided up and deployed to the provinces to support its 5th and 6th Division intelligence staffs, but it decided to keep it in Dublin under the command of the Dublin District Division, General Gerald Boyd, commanding. It was known officially as the Dublin District Special Branch (DDSB) and also as "D Branch". In May 1920, Lieutenant Colonel Walter Wilson arrived in Dublin to take command of D Branch.

Following the events of Bloody Sunday, 21 November 1920, when twelve D Branch officers were assassinated by the [[Irish Republican Army]] under the command of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], D Branch was transferred to the command of Brigadier-General Sir [[Ormonde Winter]] in January 1921.  Winter had been placed in charge of a new police intelligence unit, the Combined Intelligence Service, in May 1920, and his charter was to set up a central intelligence clearing house to more effectively collate and coordinate army and police intelligence. Those members of D Branch who survived Bloody Sunday were very unhappy to be transferred from army command to CIS command, and for the next six months, until the [[Truce of July 1921]], D Branch continued to maintain regular contact with Army Intelligence Centre while undertaking missions for Winter's CIS.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial War Museum, General Hugh Jeudwine Papers, ''A Record of the Rebellion in Ireland, 1919–1921 and of the part played by the Army in it''. Volume II'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Woodcock, ''Experiences of an Officer's Wife in Ireland''(London and Edinburgh: Blackwood and Sons, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Townsend, ''The British Campaign in Ireland 1919–1921'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cairo gang.jpg|250px|thumb|A photo purportedly of the Cairo Gang, but more probably the [[Igoe Gang]]]]

The famous photograph that is widely accepted as showing members of the Cairo Gang is lodged in the [[National Library of Ireland]] photographic archive [[Piaras Béaslaí]] collection (five copies). An inscription describes the men as "the special gang F company Auxiliaries". There are no names or details on the back of the photos. Three other photos in the collection show Auxiliaries posing on vehicles in the grounds of [[Dublin Castle]]. These three photos are similarly numbered.

The Cairo Gang members lived unobtrusively at nice addresses, in boarding houses and hotels across Dublin while preparing a hit list of known [[Irish republicanism|Republicans]]{{fact|date=August 2017}}. However, the IRA Intelligence Department (IRAID) was one step ahead of them and was receiving information from numerous well-placed sources, including Lily Merin, who was the confidential code clerk for British Army Intelligence Centre in Parkgate Street, and Sergeant Jerry Mannix, stationed in [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]]. Mannix provided the IRAID with a list of names and addresses for all the members of the Cairo Gang. In addition, Michael Collins's case officers on the intelligence staff—[[Liam Tobin]], Tom Cullen and Frank Thornton—were meeting with several D Branch officers nightly, pretending to be informers. Another IRA penetration source participating in the nightly repartee with the D Branch men at Cafe Cairo, Rabiatti's Saloon and Kidds Back Pub was Detective Constable [[David Neligan]], one of Michael Collins's penetrations of [[G-Division]], the secret detectives of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]. Additionally, the IRA had co-opted most of the Irish servants who worked in the rooming houses where the D Branch officers lived, and all of their comings and goings were meticulously recorded by servants and reported to Collins's staff.

All the members of the gang were kept under surveillance for several weeks, and intelligence was gathered from sympathisers (for example, concerning people who were coming home at strange hours, which would indicate that they were being allowed through the [[British army|military]] [[curfew]]). The IRA Dublin Brigade and the IRAID then pooled their resources and intelligence to draw up their own hit list of suspected gang members and set the date for the assassinations to be carried out on [[Timeline of the Irish War of Independence|21 November 1920]] at 9:00&amp;nbsp;am.

==Assassinations==
The operation was planned by several senior IRA members, including [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Dick McKee]], [[Liam Tobin]], [[Peadar Clancy]], [[Tom Cullen (Irish nationalist)|Tom Cullen]], [[Frank Thornton (Irish nationalist)|Frank Thornton]] and [[Oscar Traynor]]. The killings were planned to coincide with a [[Gaelic football]] match between [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] and [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]], because the large crowds around Dublin would allow easier movement for the Volunteers and make it more difficult for the British to detect Collins's [[The Squad (IRA unit)|Squad]] members as they carried out the assassinations.

Clancy and McKee were picked up by Crown forces on the evening of Saturday, 20 November. They were tortured and later shot dead "while trying to escape".

Tortured and killed with them was Conor Clune (the nephew of Archbishop [[Patrick Clune|Clune]] of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], who had been senior chaplain to the Catholic members of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in World War I).&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish War of Independence'' by Michael Hopkinson ({{ISBN|978-0717137411}}), page 91&lt;/ref&gt; Clune was manager of the seed and plant nursery owned by [[Edward MacLysaght]] near Quin, and Clune and MacLysaght travelled to Dublin on the morning of Saturday, 20 November 1920, bringing with him the books of the Raheen Co-op for its annual audit. Clune was arrested in a raid on Vaughan's Hotel in Dublin, where he was a registered guest.

===28 Pembroke Street Upper===
The operation began at 9:00&amp;nbsp;am, when members of the Squad entered 28 Pembroke Street. The first British agents to die were Major Charles Milne Cholmeley Dowling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/75227761 |title=Casualty Details: Charles Milne Cholmeley Dowling |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |date=1920-11-21 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Captain Leonard Price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2758778/PRICE,%20L |title=Casualty Details: L Price |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |date=1920-11-21 |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Cooney]] of the Dublin Brigade removed documents from their rooms.

Three more members of the Gang were shot in the same house: Captain Brian Christopher Headlam Keenlyside, Colonel Wilfrid Woodcock, and Lieutenant-Colonel [[Hugh Montgomery (Royal Marines officer)|Hugh Montgomery]]. Woodcock was not connected with intelligence and had walked into a confrontation on the first floor of the Pembroke Street house as he was preparing to leave to command a regimental parade at army headquarters. He was in his military uniform, and, when he shouted to warn the other five British officers living in the house, he was shot in the shoulder and back, but survived. As Keenlyside was about to be shot, a struggle ensued between his wife and Mick O'Hanlon. The leader of the unit, Mick Flanagan, arrived, pushed Mrs Keenlyside out of the way and shot her husband.

===117 Morehampton Road===
At 117 [[Morehampton Road, Dublin|Morehampton Road]], [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]], 2.3&amp;nbsp;km from the scene of the first shootings, another member of the Cairo Gang, Lieutenant Donald Lewis MacLean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/900302 |title=Casualty Details: Donald Lewis MacLean |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |date=1920-11-21 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with suspected informer TH Smith and MacLean's brother-in-law, John Caldow, were taken into the hallway and about to be shot, when MacLean asked that they not be shot in front of his wife. The three were taken to an unused bedroom and shot. Caldow survived his wounds and fled to his home in [[Scotland]].

===92 Lower Baggot Street===
Just 800 metres away, at 92 Lower Baggot Street, another member, Captain William Frederick Newberry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/387908 |title=Casualty Details: William Frederick Newberry |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |date=1920-11-21 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife heard their front door come crashing down and blockaded themselves into their bedroom. Newberry rushed for his window to try to escape but was shot while climbing out by Bill Stapleton and Joe Leonard after they finally broke the door down.

===38 Upper Mount Street===
Two key members of the Gang, Lieutenant [[Peter Ashmun Ames]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2905996 |title=Casualty Details: Peter Ashmun Ames |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |date=1920-11-21 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Captain George Bennett,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2906000 |title=Casualty Details: G Bennett |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |date=1920-11-21 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; were made to stand facing the wall on a bed in a downstairs rear bedroom and shot by [[Vinny Byrne]] and others in his squad. A maid had let the attackers into 38 Upper Mount Street and indicated, at gunpoint, the rooms occupied by the two targeted men. Despite many accounts to the contrary, Byrne was not involved in the killings in Morehampton Road that morning.

===28 Earlsfort Terrace===
Sergeant John J Fitzgerald,&lt;ref name="Royal Irish Constabulary Roll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policememorial.org.uk/Forces/IRELAND/RIC_Roll.htm |title=National Police Officers Roll of Honour: Royal Irish Constabulary 1867–1922 |publisher=Police Roll of Honour Trust |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], also known as "Captain Fitzgerald" or "Captain Fitzpatrick", whose father was from [[County Tipperary]], was killed a kilometre away at 28 Earlsfort Terrace. He had survived a previous assassination attempt when a bullet grazed his head. This time he was shot twice in the head. The documents found in his house detailed the movements of senior IRA members.

===22 Lower Mount Street===
An IRA unit led by [[Tom Keogh]] entered 22 Lower Mount Street to kill Lieutenant Henry Angliss, ''alias'' Patrick Mahon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/381009 |title=Casualty Details: Henry James Angliss |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |date=1920-11-21 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lieutenant Charles Ratsch Peel. The two intelligence specialists in the Gang, Angliss and Peel, had been recalled from Russia to organise British intelligence operations in the South Dublin area. Angliss had survived a previous assassination attempt when he had been shot at in a billiard hall. He was targeted for killing [[Sinn Féin]] fundraiser John Lynch, mistaken for [[Liam Lynch (general)|General Liam Lynch]], Divisional Commandant of the [[1st Southern Division, IRA]]. Angliss was shot as he reached for his gun.

Peel, hearing the shots, managed to block his bedroom door and survived even though more than a dozen bullets were fired into his room. When members of [[Fianna Éireann]] on lookout reported that the [[Auxiliary Division]] were approaching the house, the unit of eleven men split up into two groups, the first leaving by the front door, the second through the laneway at the back of the house.

===119 Baggot Street===
At 119 Baggot Street, a three-man unit killed Captain Geoffrey Thomas Baggallay,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/75228122 Casualty Details: Baggallay, Geoffrey Thomas]. Commonwealth War Graves Commission. 1920-11-21. Retrieved 2009-12-29.&lt;/ref&gt; a barrister who had been employed as a prosecutor under the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]] regulations,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 November 1920&lt;/ref&gt; and who had been a member of military courts that sentenced IRA volunteers to death.

===Gresham Hotel===
Captain Patrick McCormack and Lieutenant Leonard Wilde were in the classy [[Gresham Hotel]] in [[O'Connell Street]]. The IRA unit gained access to their rooms by pretending to be British soldiers with important dispatches. When the men opened their doors they were shot and killed. A ''Times'' listing for McCormack and Wilde does not list any rank for the latter. McCormack's killing was a mistake. He was a member of the [[Royal Army Veterinary Corps]] and was in Ireland to buy horses for the British Army. He was shot in bed and Collins himself later acknowledged the error. Unlike the other British officers, McCormack, a Catholic from [[Castlebar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairogang.com/murdered-men/mccormack.html |title=Capt Patrick McCormack |website=Cairogang.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was buried in Ireland, at [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], ''Murdered Officers' Last Journey'' 25 November 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitzwilliam Square===
Captain John Scott Crawford, in charge of motor repair of the British [[Army Service Corps]], narrowly escaped death after the IRA entered a guesthouse in Fitzwilliam Square where he was staying, looking for a Major Callaghan. On not finding their target, they debated whether or not to shoot Crawford. They decided not to shoot him as he was not on their list; instead they gave him 24 hours to leave Ireland, which he promptly did.

===Eastwood Hotel===
In the Eastwood Hotel at 91 Lower [[Leeson Street]] the IRA failed to find their target, Captain Thomas Jennings. Other targets who escaped were Captain Jocelyn Hardy&lt;ref&gt;Tim Pat Coogan, ''Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland'', p.160&lt;/ref&gt; and Major William Lorraine King, a colleague of Hardy who was missing when Joe Dolan burst into King's room. According to the prim [[Todd Andrews]], Dolan took revenge by giving King's half-naked mistress "a right scourging with a sword scabbard", and setting fire to the room afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Andrews, ''Dublin Made Me'', Mercier Press, 1979, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Frank Murray Maxwell Hallowell Carew, an intelligence officer who with Captain Price had almost cornered [[3rd Tipperary Brigade]] commander [[Seán Treacy]] a month before, was on the list. (Treacy had been killed by G men as he tried to shoot his way out of a trap on 14 October, a week before the day of the Cairo Gang assassinations.)

When the IRA came calling for Murray, he had moved to an apartment across the street. He heard the gunfire at his former lodging and fired his revolver at an IRA sentry outside. The sentry was hit and took cover inside the house. The Volunteers moved on.

Several IRA men carried sledgehammers with them the morning of 21 November, as they expected to encounter bolted doors. They did not find any, but T Ryle Dwyer claims that they used them to smash the skulls and faces of some of the officers they had shot.&lt;ref&gt;T Ryle Dwyer, ''The Squad and the Intelligence Operations of Michael Collins'' (Cork: Mercier, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two members of the Auxiliary Cadet Division, Temporary Cadets Frank Garniss, aged 34, and Cecil Augustus Morris, aged 24, were among a patrol of Auxiliaries who responded to the scene of one of the attacks, armed with .45 calibre Webley revolvers and a carbine. Garniss and Morris were shot and killed as they sought to cordon off the rear of one of the scenes of assassination.&lt;ref&gt;James Mackay, ''Michael Collins, A Life'' (Edinburgh and London: Mainstream Publishers, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hopkinson, ''The Irish War of Independence'' (Montreal: McGill Queens University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Times'' listing of killed and wounded reports that in addition to Caldow, Captain Brian Keenlyside, [[Hugh Montgomery (British officer)|Colonel Hugh Montgomery]], Major (Wilfrid) Woodcock, and Lieutenant Randolph Murray were wounded, but not killed. Montgomery died 10 December 1920 of the wounds he received on Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/75200175 |title=Casualty Details: Hugh Ferguson Montgomery |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |date=1920-12-10 |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatalities==
Nineteen men were shot. Fourteen were killed on 21 November; Montgomery died later, making fifteen in all. Five were wounded (including King's mistress). Ames, Angliss, Baggallay, Bennet, Dowling, Fitzgerald, McCormack, MacLean, Montgomery, Newberry, Price, Wilde, Smith, Morris and Garniss were killed. Keenlyside, Woodcock, Murray and Caldow were wounded. Peel and others escaped.
The dead included members of the "Cairo Gang", British Army [[Courts-Martial]] officers, the two Auxiliaries and a civilian informant.

==Aftermath==
Of the IRA men involved, only [[Frank Teeling]] was captured during the operation. He was court-martialled and sentenced to hang, but escaped from [[Kilmainham Gaol]] before the sentence could be carried out. [[Patrick Moran (Irish republican)|Patrick Moran]] and [[Thomas Whelan]] were arrested later and, despite their protestations of innocence and witnesses attesting to alibis, were hanged for murder in connection with the killings on 14 March 1921.

The remaining Cairo Gang members, along with many other spies, fled to either [[Dublin Castle]] or England, fearing they were next on the IRA's hit list. Another member committed suicide in Dublin Castle. The deaths and flights dealt a severe blow to British intelligence gathering in Ireland.

==Igoe Gang==
Eventually another group of intelligence operatives led by [[Head Constable]] Eugene Igoe from [[County Mayo|Mayo]] took the fight to the IRA. Officially known as the Identification Branch of the Combined Intelligence Service (CIS), Igoe reported to Colonel Ormonde Winter.

The Igoe Gang consisted of RIC personnel drawn from different parts of Ireland who patrolled the streets of Dublin in plain clothes, looking for wanted men.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Pat Coogan, ''Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Igoe Gang posed a serious threat to Collins's apparatus and in fact caught a Volunteer whom Collins had brought to Dublin to identify Igoe.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry [2012] Blood For Blood: The Black and Tan War in Galway. Mercier Press, Cork p.178–181&lt;/ref&gt; They were never penetrated by the IRA. Igoe later conducted secret service operations for Special Branch over many years in other countries, but never returned to his farm in Mayo out of fear of reprisal. Brigadier General Winter appeared on Igoe's behalf to obtain an increase in his pension in view of his many services to the Crown in Ireland and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Ormonde Winter, ''A Report of the Intelligence Branch of the Chief Police Commissioner'' 1921, Public Record Office (PRO).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calcium [[metabolism]]''' refers to the movements and regulation of [[calcium]] ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ''in'' and ''out'' of various body compartments, such as the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the [[blood plasma]], the [[extracellular fluid|extracellular]] and [[intracellular fluid|intracellular]] fluids, and [[bone tissue]]. An important aspect of calcium metabolism is plasma calcium [[homeostasis]], the regulation of calcium ions in the [[blood plasma]] within [[reference ranges for blood tests#Calcium|narrow limits]].&lt;ref name=Brini&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Marisa | last1 = Brini | first2 = Denis | last2 = Ottolini | first3 = Tito | last3 = Calì | first4 = Ernesto | last4 = Carafoli | editor-first1 = Astrid | editor-last1 = Sigel  | editor-last2 = Helmut | editor-first2 = Roland K.

The level of the calcium in humans' plasma is regulated by [[calcitonin]] and [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH); calcitonin is released by the [[thyroid gland]] once its plasma level is above its set normal point (in order to lower calcium level); PTH is released by the [[parathyroid glands]] when calcium level falls below set point (in order to raise it).

== Calcium concentrations ==

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the [[Composition of the human body|human body]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The average adult body contains in total approximately 1&amp;nbsp;kg, 99% in the skeleton in the form of [[calcium phosphate]] salts {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

J. |year=1995 |title=Clinical Chemistry | edition = 3rd |publisher=Mosby | location= London | isbn=0-7234-2190-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of calcium ions inside the cells (in the [[Cytosol#Properties and composition|intracellular fluid]]) is more than 7,000 times lower than in the blood plasma (i.e. at &lt;0.0002&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, compared with 1.4&amp;nbsp;mmol/L in the plasma)

== Function ==
{{Main |Calcium in biology}}

Calcium has several main functions in the body. It readily binds to proteins, particularly those with amino acids whose side chains terminate in carboxyl (-COOH) groups (e.g. glutamate residues). When such binding occurs the electrical charges on the protein chain change, causing the protein's tertiary structure (i.e. 3-dimensional form) to change. Good examples of this are several of the [[clotting factors]] in the blood plasma, which are functionless in the absence of calcium ions, but become fully functional on the addition of the correct concentration of calcium salts. The [[Sodium channels|voltage gated sodium ion channels]] in the cell membranes of nerves and muscle are particularly sensitive to the calcium ion concentration in the plasma.&lt;ref name=CMArmstrong1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armstrong CM, Cota G | title = Calcium block of Na+ channels and its effect on closing rate | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 7 | pages = 4154–7 | date = Mar 1999 | pmid = 10097179 | pmc = 22436 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.7.4154 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.4154A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively small decreases in the plasma ionized calcium levels ([[hypocalcemia]]) cause these channels to leak sodium into the nerve cells or axons, making them hyper-excitable ([[Bathmotropic|positive bathmotropic effect]]), thus causing spontaneous muscle spasms ([[tetany]]) and [[paraesthesia]] (the sensation of "pins and needles") of the extremities and round the mouth.&lt;ref name=harrison&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Harrison TR | title =Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = third | pages = 170, 571–579 | location = New York | publisher =  McGraw-Hill Book Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the plasma ionized calcium rises above normal ([[hypercalcemia]]) more calcium is bound to these sodium channels having a negative bathmotropic effect on them, causing lethargy, muscle weakness, anorexia, constipation and labile emotions.&lt;ref name=harrison /&gt;

Because the intracellular calcium ion concentration is extremely low (see above) the entry of minute quantities of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum or from the extracellular fluids, cause rapid, very marked, and readily reversible changes in the relative concentration of these ions in the [[cytosol]]. This can therefore serve as a very effective intracellular signal (or "[[second messenger]]") in a variety of circumstances, including [[muscle contraction]], the release of hormones (e.g. [[insulin]] from the beta cells in the [[pancreatic islets]]) or neurotransmitters (e.g. [[acetylcholine]] from pre-synaptic terminals of nerves) and other functions.

=== Bones ===
Calcium acts structurally as [[Bone mineral|supporting material]] in bones as [[calcium hydroxyapatite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Muscles ===
In [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[heart muscle]] calcium ions, released from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] of [[striated muscle tissue|striated muscles]]) binds to the [[troponin C]] protein present on the [[actin]]-containing thin filaments of the [[myofibril]]s. The troponin's [[allosteric regulation|3D structure changes]] as a result,  causing the [[tropomyosin]] to which it is attached to be rolled away from the [[myosin]]-binding sites on the [[Actin|actin molecules]] that form the back-bone of the thin filaments. [[Myosin]] can then bind to the exposed myosin-binding sites on the thin filament, to undergo a repeating series of conformational changes called the [[Sliding filament theory#Cross-bridge mechanism|cross-bridge cycle]], for which [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] provides the energy. During the cycle, each myosin protein ‘paddles’ along the thin actin filament, repeatedly binding to myosin-binding sites along the actin filament, ratcheting and letting go. In effect, the thick filament moves or slides along the thin filament, resulting in [[muscle contraction]]. This process is known as the [[sliding filament model]] of muscle contraction.&lt;ref name="Silverthorn 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last = Silverthorn | first = Dee Unglaub | authorlink = | chapter = Muscles | title = Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach | publisher = Pearson | series = | volume = | edition = 7th | date = 2016 | location = San Francisco, CA | pages = 377–416 | isbn = 0-321-98122-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooke|first1=R.|title=The sliding filament model: 1972-2004|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|year=2004|volume=123|issue=6|pages=643–656|doi=10.1085/jgp.200409089|pmid=15173218|pmc=2234572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geeves|first1=Michael A.|title=Stretching the lever-arm theory|journal=Nature|year=2002|volume=415|issue=6868|pages=129–131|doi=10.1038/415129a|pmid=11805818|bibcode=2002Natur.415..129G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spudich|first1=JA|title=In pursuit of myosin function|journal=Cell Regulation|year=1989|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–11|pmid=2519609|pmc=361420|doi=10.1091/mbc.1.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yanagida|first1=Toshio|last2=Arata|first2=Toshiaki|last3=Oosawa|first3=Fumio|title=Sliding distance of actin filament induced by a myosin crossbridge during one ATP hydrolysis cycle|journal=Nature|year=1985|volume=316|issue=6026|pages=366–369|doi=10.1038/316366a0|pmid=4022127|bibcode=1985Natur.316..366Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Normal ranges}}

=== Normal plasma levels ===

The plasma ''total calcium'' concentration is in the range of 2.2-2.6&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (9-10.5&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), and the normal ''ionized calcium'' is 1.3-1.5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (4.5-5.6&amp;nbsp;mg/dL).&lt;ref name=diem /&gt;  The amount of total calcium in the blood varies with the level of [[Serum albumin|plasma albumin]], the most abundant protein in plasma, and therefore the main carrier of protein-bound calcium in the blood.  The biologic effect of calcium is, however, determined by the amount of ''ionized calcium'', rather than the total calcium.  It is therefore the plasma [[ionized]] calcium level which is [[Homeostasis#Plasma ionized calcium|tightly regulated]] to remain within very narrow limits by homeostatic [[negative feedback]] systems.

Between 35-50% of the calcium in plasma is protein-bound, and 5-10% is in the form of complexes with organic acids and phosphates. The remainder (50-60%) is ionized. The ionized calcium can be determined directly by [[colorimetry]], or it can be read off from [[nomogram]]s, though the usefulness of the latter is limited when the pH and protein content of the plasma deviate widely from the normal.&lt;ref name=diem /&gt;

Not all the calcium in the diet can be readily absorbed from the gut. The calcium that is most readily absorbed is found in dairy product and eggs, as well as in tinned fish products. The calcium contained in vegetable matter is often complexed with [[Phytic acid|phytates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graf|first1=Ernst|year=1983|title=Calcium binding to phytic acid|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=31|issue=4|pages=851|doi=10.1021/jf00118a045|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxalic acid|oxalates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Watts PS|year=2009|title=Effects of oxalic acid ingestion by sheep.

{{Anchor|The role of bone}}

=== Bone storage ===
Although calcium flow to and from the [[bone]] is neutral, about 5–10&amp;nbsp;mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains 99% of the total body calcium. Calcium release from bone is regulated by [[parathyroid hormone]] in conjunction with [[calcitriol]] manufactured in the kidney under the influence of PTH. [[Calcitonin]] (a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland when plasma ionized calcium levels are high or rising; not to be confused with "calcitriol" which is manufactured in the kidney) stimulates incorporation of calcium into bone.

== Absorption from the intestine ==
The normal adult diet contains about 25&amp;nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|mmol]] of calcium per day. Only about 5&amp;nbsp;mmol of this is absorbed into the body per day (see below).&lt;ref name=ganong&gt;Barrett KE, Barman SM, Boitano S, Brooks H, "Chapter 23. Hormonal Control of Calcium &amp; Phosphate Metabolism &amp; the Physiology of Bone" (Chapter). Barrett KE, Barman SM, Boitano S, Brooks H: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 23e: http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=5244785 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075939/http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=5244785# |date=2011-07-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium is absorbed across the intestinal epithelial cell's [[brush border]] membrane and is immediately bound to [[calbindin]], a [[vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein]]. Calbindin transfers the calcium directly into the epithelial cell's [[endoplasmic reticulum]], through which the calcium is transferred to the [[Epithelial cell#Basement membrane|basal membrane]] on the opposite side of the cell, without entering its [[cytosol]] or intracellular fluid. From there [[TRPV6|protein-coding gene TRPV6]] and calcium pumps ([[Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase|PMCA1]]) [[Active transport|actively transport]] calcium into the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balesaria S, Sangha S, Walters JR | title = Human duodenum responses to vitamin D metabolites of TRPV6 and other genes involved in calcium absorption | journal = American Journal of Physiology. Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology | volume = 297 | issue = 6 | pages = G1193-7 | date = Dec 2009 | pmid = 19779013 | pmc = 2850091 | doi = 10.1152/ajpgi.00237.2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active transport of calcium occurs primarily in the [[duodenum]] portion of the intestine when calcium intake is low; and through passive [[paracellular transport]] in the [[jejunum]] and [[ileum]] parts when calcium intake is high, independently of Vitamin D level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/smallgut/absorb_minerals.html|title=Absorption of Minerals and Metals|author=|date=|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The active absorption of calcium from the gut is regulated by the [[calcitriol]] (or 1,25&amp;nbsp;dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1,25&amp;nbsp;dihydroxyvitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration in the blood. Calcitriol is a cholesterol derivative. Under the influence of ultraviolet light on the skin, cholesterol is converted to previtamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which spontaneously isomerizes to vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (or cholecaliferol). It is then converted from cholecaliferol to calcifediol in the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandi|first=M.L.|date=2010|title=Indications on the use of vitamin D and vitamin D metabolites in clinical phenotypes|journal=Clinical Cases in Mineral and Bone Metabolism|volume=7|issue=3|pages=243–250|issn=1724-8914|pmc=3213838|pmid=22460535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of [[parathyroid hormone]], the [[kidneys]] convert calcifediol into the active hormone calcitriol, which acts on the epithelial cells ([[Enterocyte|enterocytes]]) lining the small intestine to increase the rate of absorption of calcium from the intestinal contents. In short the cycle is following:
: &lt;p class="center"&gt;[[Cholesterol]] {{overset|[[ultraviolet]]|→}} [[Previtamin D3|Previtamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] {{overset|isomerization|→}} [[cholecalciferol|Vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] {{overset|Liver|→}} [[Calcifediol]] {{overset|[[Parathyroid hormone|PTH]] + Kidneys|→}} [[Calcitriol]]&lt;/p&gt; 

Low PTH levels in the blood (which occur under physiological conditions when the plasma ionized calcium levels are high) inhibit the conversion of cholecalciferol into calcitriol, which in turn inhibits calcium absorption from the gut. The opposite happens when the plasma ionized calcium levels are low: parathyroid hormone is secreted into the blood and the kidneys convert more calcifediol into the active calcitriol, increasing calcium absorption from the gut.&lt;ref name="stryer"&gt;Stryer L. ''Biochemistry'' (Fourth Edition). Chapter 27 "Vitamin D is derived from cholesterol by the ring-splitting action of light". New York, W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reabsorption ==
Since about 15&amp;nbsp;mmol of calcium is excreted into the intestine via the bile per day,&lt;ref name="diem" /&gt; the total amount of calcium that reaches the duodenum and jejunum each day is about 40&amp;nbsp;mmol (25&amp;nbsp;mmol from the diet plus 15&amp;nbsp;mmol from the bile), of which, on average, 20&amp;nbsp;mmol is absorbed (back) into the blood. The net result is that about 5&amp;nbsp;mmol more calcium is absorbed from the gut than is excreted into it via the bile. If there is no active bone building (as in childhood), or increased need for calcium during pregnancy and lactation, the 5&amp;nbsp;mmol calcium that is absorbed from the gut makes up for urinary losses that are only partially regulated.&lt;ref name="ganong" /&gt;

=== The kidneys ===

The [[kidney]] filters 250&amp;nbsp;mmol of calcium ions a day in pro-urine (or [[glomerular filtrate]]), and resorbs 245&amp;nbsp;mmol, leading to a net average loss in the urine of about 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/d. The quantity of calcium ions excreted in the urine per day is partially under the influence of the plasma [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) level - high levels of PTH decreasing the rate of calcium ion excretion, and low levels increasing it.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The main determinant of the amount of calcium excreted into the urine per day is the plasma ionized calcium concentration. The plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration only increases or decreases the amount of calcium excreted at any ''given plasma ionized calcium concentration''. Thus, in primary [[hyperparathyroidism]] the quantity of calcium excreted in the urine per day is ''increased'' despite the high levels of PTH in the blood. This is because hyperparathyroidism results in [[hypercalcemia]], which increases the urinary calcium concentration ([[hypercalcuria]]) despite the modestly increased rate of calcium re-absorption from the renal tubules caused by PTH's effect on those tubules. [[Renal stones]] are therefore often a first indication of hyperparathyroidism, especially since the hypercalcuria is accompanied by an increase in urinary phosphate excretion (a direct result of the high plasma PTH levels). Together the calcium and phosphate tend to precipitate out as water-insoluble salts, which readily form solid “stones”.&lt;/ref&gt; However, parathyroid hormone has a greater effect on the quantity of [[phosphate|phosphate ions]] (HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) excreted in the urine.&lt;ref name="pmid25287933" /&gt; Phosphates form insoluble salts in combination with calcium ions.  High concentrations of HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; in the plasma, therefore, lower the ionized calcium level in the extra-cellular fluids. Thus, the excretion of more phosphate than calcium ions in the urine raises the plasma ionized calcium level, even though the total calcium concentration might be lowered. The kidney influences the plasma ionized calcium concentration in yet another manner. It processes [[vitamin D]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into [[calcitriol]], the active form that is most effective in promoting the intestinal absorption of calcium. This conversion of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into calcitriol, is also promoted by high plasma parathyroid hormone levels.&lt;ref name="stryer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tortora GJ, Anagnostakos NP. ''Principles of Anatomy and Physiology'' (Fifth Edition) p. 696. New York, Harper &amp; Row Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excretion ==
Most excretion of excess calcium is via the bile and feces, because the plasma calcitriol levels (which ultimately depend on the plasma calcium levels) regulate how much of the biliary calcium is reabsorbed from the intestinal contents. Urinary excretion of calcium is relatively modest (about 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/day) in comparison to what can be excreted via the feces (15&amp;nbsp;mmol/day).

{{Anchor|Regulation of calcium metabolism}}

== Calcium metabolism regulation ==
[[File:Calcium regulation.png|thumb|250px|[[Human homeostasis#Calcium|Calcium regulation]] in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Parathyroid Glands and Vitamin D |author1=Boron, Walter F. |author2=Boulpaep, Emile L |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |year=2003 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |page=1094}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The plasma ionized calcium concentration is regulated within narrow limits (1.3–1.5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L). This is achieved by both the  [[parafollicular cells]] of the thyroid gland, and the [[parathyroid glands]] constantly sensing (i.e. measuring) the concentration of calcium ions in the blood flowing through them. 

=== High plasma level ===
When the concentration rises the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland increase their secretion of [[calcitonin]] (a proteinaceous hormone) into the blood. At the same time the parathyroid glands reduce their rate of parathyroid hormone (or PTH, also a proteinaceous hormone) secretion into the blood. The resulting high levels of calcitonin in the blood stimulate the skeleton to remove calcium from the blood plasma, and deposit it as bone.

The reduced levels of PTH inhibit removal of calcium from the skeleton. The low levels of PTH have several other effects: they increase the loss of calcium in the urine, but more importantly inhibit the loss of phosphate ions via that route. Phosphate ions will therefore be retained in the plasma where they form insoluble salts with calcium ions, thereby removing them from the ionized calcium pool in the blood. The low levels of PTH also inhibit the formation of [[calcitriol]] (not to be confused with [[calcitonin]]) from cholecalciferol (vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by the kidneys. 

The reduction in the blood calcitriol concentration acts (comparatively slowly) on the epithelial cells ([[enterocyte]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) of the duodenum inhibiting their ability to absorb calcium from the intestinal contents.&lt;ref name="Brini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter F. |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year=2003|chapter=The Parathyroid Glands and Vitamin D in: |page=1094 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guyton"&gt;Guyton A (1976). ‘’Medical Physiology’’. p.1062; New York, Saunders and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The low calcitriol levels also act on bone causing the [[osteoclast]]s to release fewer calcium ions into the blood plasma.&lt;ref name="pmid25287933"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blaine J, Chonchol M, Levi M |title=Renal control of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium homeostasis |journal=Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1257–72 |year=2015 |pmid=25287933 |doi=10.2215/CJN.09750913|pmc=4491294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Low plasma level ===
When the plasma ionized calcium level is low or falls the opposite happens. Calcitonin secretion is inhibited and PTH secretion is stimulated, resulting in calcium being removed from bone to rapidly correct the plasma calcium level. The high plasma PTH levels inhibit calcium loss via the urine while stimulating the excretion of phosphate ions via that route. They also stimulate the kidneys to manufacture calcitriol (a steroid hormone), which enhances the ability of the cells lining the gut to absorb calcium from the intestinal contents into the blood, by stimulating the production of [[calbindin]] in these cells. The PTH stimulated production of calcitriol also causes calcium to be released from bone into the blood, by the release of [[RANKL]] (a [[cytokine]], or [[Paracrine|local hormone]]) from the [[osteoblast]]s which increases the bone resorptive activity by the osteoclasts. These are, however, a relatively slow processes&lt;ref name="Brini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25287933" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guyton" /&gt;

Thus fast short term regulation of the plasma ionized calcium level primarily involves rapid movements of calcium into or out of the skeleton. Longer term regulation is achieved by regulating the amount of calcium absorbed from the gut or lost via the feces.&lt;ref name="Brini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guyton" /&gt;

== Pathology ==
{{main|Disorders of calcium metabolism}}

[[Hypocalcemia]] (low blood calcium) and [[hypercalcemia]] (high blood calcium) are both serious medical disorders.  [[Osteoporosis]], [[osteomalacia]] and [[rickets]] are bone disorders linked to calcium metabolism disorders and effects of [[vitamin D]].  [[Renal osteodystrophy]] is a consequence of [[chronic renal failure]] related to the calcium metabolism.

A low calcium intake may be a risk factor in the development of [[osteoporosis]] in later life.  In one [[meta-analysis]], the authors found that in fifty out of the fifty-two studies that they reviewed, a diet adequately rich in calcium reduced calcium loss from bone with advancing (post-[[menopausal]]) age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Heaney RP|date=Apr 2000|title=Calcium, dairy products and osteoporosis|url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10759135|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|volume=19|issue=2 Suppl|pages=83S-99S|doi=10.1080/07315724.2000.10718088|pmid=10759135}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diet with sustained adequate amounts of calcium reduced the risk of osteoporosis.

== Research into cancer prevention ==

The role that calcium might have in reducing the rates of colorectal cancer has been the subject of many studies. However, given its modest efficacy, there is no current medical recommendation to use calcium for cancer reduction.
Several epidemiological studies suggest that people with high calcium intake have a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. These observations have been confirmed by experimental studies in volunteers and in rodents. One large scale clinical trial shows that 1.2 g calcium each day reduces, modestly, intestinal polyps recurrence in volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron JA, Beach M, Mandel JS, van Stolk RU, Haile RW, Sandler RS, Rothstein R, Summers RW, Snover DC, Beck GJ, Bond JH, Greenberg ER | title = Calcium supplements for the prevention of colorectal adenomas.

'''''Calcutta''''' was launched in 1798 as an [[East Indiaman]]. She made four voyages for the British [[East India Company]] (EIC), and disappeared while homeward bound from Bengal on her fifth voyage.

==EIC voyage #1 (1798–1800)==

Captain William Maxwell acquired a [[letter of marque]] on 1 May 1798.&lt;ref name=LoM/&gt; He sailed from Portsmouth on 8 June 1798, bound for [[Saint Helena|St Helena]], Bengal, [[Mumbai|Bombay]], and [[Chennai|Madras]]. ''Calcutta'' reached St Helena on 19 August and arrived at [[Diamond Harbour]] on 21 December. She was at [[Sagar Island|Saugor]] on 28 January 1799, [[Kannur|Cannanore]] on 7 March, Bombay on 26 April, and Madras on 4 July. She returned to Diamond Harbour on 18 August. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 23 September and Madras again on 21 October and the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 31 December. She reached St Helena on 27 January 1800 and arrived at Long Reach on 2 June.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

==EIC voyage #2 (1801–1802)==

Captain Maxwell sailed from Portsmouth on 31 March 1801, bound for Madras and Bengal. ''Calcutta'' reached Madras on 26 July and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 20 August. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 13 January 1802 and Madras on 7 February. She reached St Helena on 14 May and arrived at Long Reach on 19 July.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt; 

==EIC voyage #3 (1803–1804)==

Captain Maxwell sailed from Portsmouth on 12 April 1803, bound for Madras and Bengal.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt; The [[Treaty of Amiens|Peace of Amiens]] had failed and [[Napoleonic Wars|war with France]] had resumed. Maxwell received a letter of marque on 2 July.&lt;ref name=LoM/&gt;

''Calcutta'' reached Madras on 4 August and [[Visakhapatnam|Vizagapatam]] on 22 August before she arrived at Diamond Harbour on 29 August. She was at [[Khejuri II#Khijri|Kedgeree]] on 24 September and Saugor on 14 October, before returning Kedgeree on 24 December. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 22 January 1804, reached St Helena on 28 June, and arrived at Long Reach on 16 October.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;  

==EIC voyage #4 (1805–1807)==

Captain John Reddie acquired a letter of marque on 9 February 1805. He sailed from Portsmouth on 8 March 1805, bound for St Helena, Bengal and Madras. ''Calcutta'' reached St Helena on 5 June and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 27 September. She was at Saugor on 29 October and [[Bencoolen Presidency|Bencoolen]] on 22 December before she returned to Diamond Harbour on 13 May 1806 and Calcutta on 18 June.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

As ''Calcutta'' was leaving Bengal in July, she grounded. It was expected that she would have to return to the dock to repair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735023?urlappend=%3Bseq=23 ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' №4121.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 30 August, Madras on 7 October, [[Trincomalee]] on 18 October, and the Cape on 30 December. She reached St Helena on 23 January 1807 and arrived at Long Reach on 15 April.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

==EIC voyage #5 (1808)==

Captain William Maxwell sailed from Portsmouth on 5 March 1808, bound for Madras and Bengal.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

==Fate==
On 14 March 1809 ''Calcutta'', {{ship||Bengal|1799 EIC ship|2}}, {{ship||Jane, Duchess of Gordon|1805 EIC ship|2}}, and {{ship||Lady Jane Dundas|1800 EIC ship|2}}, parted company with the main homeward bound convoy of East Indiamen off Mauritius in a gale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735024?urlappend=%3Bseq=119 ''Lloyd's List'' №4370.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lloyd's List'' reported on 26 September 1809 that they had not been heard of since parting from the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735024?urlappend=%3Bseq=161 ''Lloyd's List'' №4391.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The four ships were never heard of again. The hull of one of them was sighted overturned off Mauritius the following October, but sank before it could be identified.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman (2001), p.66-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The EIC valued the cargo that it lost on ''Calcutta'' at £124,452.&lt;ref&gt;''Reports...''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3076">'''Compositional pattern-producing networks''' ('''CPPNs''') are a variation of [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) that have an architecture whose evolution is guided by genetic algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Kenneth O. "Compositional pattern producing networks: A novel abstraction of development." Genetic programming and evolvable machines 8.2 (2007): 131-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

While ANNs often contain only [[sigmoid function]]s and sometimes [[Gaussian function]]s, CPPNs can include both types of functions and many others. The choice of functions for the canonical set can be biased toward specific types of patterns and regularities. For example, periodic functions such as [[sine]] produce segmented patterns with repetitions, while symmetric functions such as Gaussian produce symmetric patterns. Linear functions can be employed to produce linear or [[fractal]]-like patterns. Thus, the architect of a CPPN-based genetic art system can bias the types of patterns it generates by deciding the set of canonical functions to include.

Furthermore, unlike typical ANNs, CPPNs are applied across the entire space of possible inputs so that they can represent a complete image. Since they are compositions of functions, CPPNs in effect encode images at infinite resolution and can be sampled for a particular display at whatever resolution is optimal.

CPPNs can be evolved through [[neuroevolution]] techniques such as [[neuroevolution of augmenting topologies]] (called CPPN-NEAT).

CPPNs have been shown to be a very powerful encoding when evolving the following:
* Neural networks, via the [[HyperNEAT]] algorithm,
* 2D images, on [http://picbreeder.org/ "PicBreeder.org"],
* 3D objects, on [http://EndlessForms.com/ "EndlessForms.com"],

'''Kenton Joel Carnegie''' (February 11, 1983 – November 8, 2005) was a 22-year-old [[Canadians|Canadian]] geological engineering student from Ontario on a work term from the [[University of Waterloo]] who died in a predatory animal attack while he was walking in the snow near [[Points North Landing]]. Subsequent investigations did not reach a consensus about whether his death was caused by [[Wolf|wolves]] or [[American black bear|black bear]]s.

==Fatal attack==
===Background===
[[Points North Landing]] in the province of [[Saskatchewan]] is a service centre for uranium mines. Timber wolves and bears fed on camp refuse and were seen nearby.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;Boyd, Diane K. "[http://sites.sinauer.com/groom/article.php?id=24 (Case Study) Wolf Habituation as a Conservation Conundrum"]. In: Groom, M. J. et al (n.d.) ''Principles of Conservation Biology'', 3rd ed., Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geist2"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://graywolfnews.com/pdf/dr_valarius_geist_re_carnegie.pdf
| title= Statement by Valerius Geist pertaining to the death of Kenton Carnegie | publisher= graywolfnews.com| accessdate= 2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten months prior to Carnegie's death, a lone wolf attacked a fifty-five-year-old uranium miner named Fred Desjarlais who was jogging home from work in [[Key Lake mine|Key Lake]]. He wrestled with it until a busload of his colleagues arrived to rescue him by frightening the wolf away. They subsequently took Desjarlais to a nearby medical facility. A few hours later, an air ambulance took Desjarlais to [[Saskatoon]]'s [[Royal University Hospital]] where he had a series of rabies treatments. After the assault on Desjarlais, Cameco built an electric fence around Key Lake's landfill to prevent further predatory animal assaults on miners. Authorities hunted and shot the wolf that attacked Desjarlais. They tested the wolf's body for rabies, but the test was negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca./news/canada/wolf-attacks-saskatchewan-man-1.542415|title=Wolf attacks Saskatchewan man - CBC News|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, 2005, one naturalist who reviewed photographs taken during an incident in which wolves that were supposed to have menaced two walkers other than Carnegie, said it appeared to be consistent with animals having a food-conditioned lack of fear in proximity to humans.&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;''A Review of Evidence and Findings Related to the Death of Kenton Carnegie on 8 November 2005 Near Points North, Saskatchewan'' by Mark E. McNay, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Fairbanks, Alaska, 25 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geist2"/&gt; It was suggested that one wolf's posture indicated it was aroused and capable of an attack. Another expert disputed the characterisation of the wolf's attitude.&lt;ref name="Torch"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.paherald.sk.ca/index.cfm?sid=75747&amp;sc=4

===Death===
Carnegie was on his autumn cooperative term in his third year of geological engineering at [[University of Waterloo]]. He and a colleague were in the Athabasca basin performing airborne surveying work for Ottawa-based [[Sander Geophysics]].&lt;ref name="Denial"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://lists.miningwatch.ca/pipermail/news/2005-November/000310.html| title= Saskatchewan gov't denies wolf attack| publisher= [[MiningWatch Canada]]| accessdate= 2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carnegie told colleagues he was going for a walk. According to official statements made to RCMP, he was "implored" not to go.&lt;ref name="Svarckopf 2"&gt;Svarckopf, Todd. 15 March 2006. "Statement #2 to the RCMP (Corporal Marion), phone interview from St. John’s Newfoundland." Audio transcribed.&lt;/ref&gt; His family say that Carnegie was known to be interested in the geology around the lake, and he was given permission.&lt;ref name="Geist2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Torch"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.paherald.sk.ca/index.cfm?sid=75747&amp;sc=4
| title= Victim was gifted and smart: father | publisher= Prince Albert Daily Herald| accessdate= 2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Kenton asked and received approval from his supervisor to go for that last walk alone. Kenton was not a risk taker, had plans for his future and never would have taken that walk if he realized any potential danger.|Kim Carnegie, 2008}}

On 8 November at 5:30 P.M., Carnegie left, saying to his geophysicist Chris Van Galder that he would return by 7:00 for supper. His bush pilot Todd Svarckopf warned him to not walk in the snow and play hockey in the [[Points North Landing Airport|airport]]'s hangar instead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/regina-leader-post/20071030/281586646238705|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Carnegie disregarded the warning. He went for a walk in the snow, but did not return to the surveyor camp. At 7:30, a search was mounted. The camp's co-owner Mark Eikel drove out in a truck with Van Galder and Svarckopf searching for him. Carnegie's tracks were followed to the lake shore. On noticing wolf tracks on the shore, the three searchers went back for a rifle before continuing. Carnegie's body was found a little further on, but there were no wolves in sight at that time. Using a flashlight, the body was viewed from about 10&amp;nbsp;m (32&amp;nbsp;ft), many wolf tracks were visible around the body.  Later, when the body was being recovered, two sets of eyes were seen glowing in the dark close by. In addition, party searchers heard a wolf pack howling around the camp's vicinity.&lt;ref name="Paquet 2"&gt;"Death of a Student in Northern Saskatchewan Caused by a Wolf – Reality or Fiction?"  Fourth International Symposium on Canids. Behaviour and Conservation. A challenge to Mankind’s Tolerance. 31 October 2008 Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brent"&gt;''Re: Review of evidence pertaining to the death of Kenton Carnegie'', Brent Patterson, Trent University, Wildlife Research &amp; Development Section&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosalie Tsannie-Burseth, the province’s local [[coroner]] who had arranged the removal of Carnegie's body, gave a hypothetical reconstruction of what happened. Her reconstruction was based on tracks of people and animals she observed near the site of the attack the day after the event occurred. She speculated that Carnegie had walked from the camp and by the time he was a kilometer away near Lake Wollaston, a wolf began following his tracks. One wolf stalked Carnegie from the forest and another wolf stalked him from the lake. Boot prints in the snow showed that Carnegie quickened his pace, as two more wolves approached him from the sides. The first apparent struggle occurred 2.2&amp;nbsp;metres (7&amp;nbsp;ft) from where the chase began. Four more scuffle sites were found leading to where his body was discovered. Tsannie-Burseth believed that Carnegie probably fought hard before finally succumbing.&lt;ref name="cbc2"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cbc.ca/sask/features/wolves/2.html | title= The death of Kenton Carnegie | publisher= CBC Saskatchewan| accessdate= 2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Carnegie's death, there had been at least one verified case of a fatal wolf attack on a person in North America, namely Canada, where [[Patricia Wyman wolf attack|Patricia Wyman]] died on April 18, 1996. More than 300 occurrences of black bears behaving aggressively toward humans have been documented in the province, including three fatal attacks. The main evidence against a bear attack was that Carnegie's body was surrounded by the tracks of wolves, while no bear tracks were found near his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/family-of-wolf-attack-victim-waiting-for-answers-1.576814|title=Family of wolf-attack victim waiting for answers - CBC News|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie's interment was at Thornton Cemetery in [[Oshawa]], Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genlookups.com/canada/webbbs_config.pl/noframes/read/1266 Canadian Obituary and Death Notice Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official investigation===
{{quote|Lacking an eyewitness account, all we know for certain is that Carnegie's body was found on a lakeside trail near Points North Landing, a northern outpost with an airstrip. A large predator had scavenged him. We conclude from circumstantial evidence that Carnegie’s death was not a homicide as no indications of foul play were found at the scene of the accident. Moreover, we concur with the autopsy and forensic reports, which state unequivocally that no other signs, injuries, or cause of death, were observed other {{sic|then}} those consistent with an animal attack. The type of wounds and feeding pattern confirm predation as the probable cause of death. Most likely, Carnegie was surprised by a violent predacious assault and sustained fatal wounds at an early stage during the attack..|Paquet &amp; Walker 2006}}

The RCMP determined that Kenton Carnegie's death was not the result of a homicide. The official Government of Saskatchewan investigation was headed by internationally renowned carnivore biologist and behavioral ecologist Dr. Paul Paquet and RCMP forensic anthropologist Dr. Ernest Walker, who oversaw Carnegie's autopsy, which was performed by Dr. N. Brits in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Brits stated that Carnegie's injuries were consistent with those expected in a predatory animal attack. Paquet and Walker concluded that the only likely candidates were wolves and [[American black bear|black bear]]s, as [[northeastern coyote|coyote]]s, [[grizzly bear]]s, and [[North American cougar|puma]]s were not known to frequent the Points North Landing area. The report, however, was equivocal as to which predator was responsible, noting that most of the evidence, all of which was circumstantial, was unavoidably confounded by search and recovery efforts. Conservation Officers  who investigated the accident site two days after the event and several snowfalls, wrote in their report "Officers investigated the site and found numerous wolf tracks in the area. No other large animal tracks could be found." Bears had not been sighted at Points North Camp for over a month, and the death occurred during what some suggest is their annual [[hibernation]] cycle.&lt;ref name="paquetreport"&gt;''Review of Investigative Findings Relating to the Death of Kenton Carnegie at Points North, Saskatchewan'' by Dr. Paul Paquet, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, and Dr. Ernest G.

===Other opinion===
It is unusual for wolves, and typical for bears, to drag the carcass of a prey animal in the way Carnegie's body was dragged. Among the photographed injuries present on the body, was a bite mark on the right side of Carnegie’s right calf/shin which some authorities considered  consistent with the wolf bite marks researchers commonly observe on ungulate prey carcasses.&lt;ref name="Brent"/&gt;  Paquet and Walker identified the mark as occurring post mortem and indistinguishable from those left by black bears.&lt;ref name="Mark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brent"/&gt;

A naturalist retained by the Carnegie family reviewed accounts of 80 events in Alaska and Canada where wolves closely approached or attacked people, found 39 cases of aggression by apparently healthy wolves, and 29 cases of fearless behavior by non-aggressive wolves.&lt;ref name="McNay"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/pubs/techpubs/research_pdfs/techb13p1.pdf | title= A Case History of Wolf-Human Encounters in Alaska and Canada| publisher= Alaska Department of Fish and Game Wildlife Technical Bulletin | accessdate= 2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After examining photographs of Carnegie's body and the area around it, a naturalist concluded that the argument in favour of a bear culprit was weak: many black bears may have been hibernating, an active bear would have concentrated on an ample food supply from the nearby landfill 2&amp;nbsp;km from the kill site, and none of the camp employees saw bears or bear tracks, either the month before or after the attack occurred. A bruise on Carnegie’s right lower leg (measured 4 × 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm), with what appeared to be bite mark impressions associated with the bruising was said to be consistent with injuries observed in 13 survivors of wolf attacks in Alaska and Canada. In many of these cases, the initial bites were fleeting and occurred in the hands or legs, and left only torn clothing, scratched skin, or minor puncture wounds.&lt;ref name="McNay"/&gt; A photo, featuring the injured lower back of a six-year-old Alaskan boy attacked by a wolf near Icy Bay showed bite marks ½-3&amp;nbsp;cm in length; many of which were similar to those found near the nose, eyes, and right arm of Carnegie’s body.&lt;ref name="Mark"/&gt;

{{quote|Constable Noey noted that Mr. Carnegie's tracks reversed course from the lake, the tracks moved up the trail a short distance and then there was a large disturbance in the snow as if something rolled in the snow. That may have been where Mr. Carnegie was first attacked and possibly bitten in the leg or shin early in the encounter. Beyond the disturbed snow in the trail, Kenton’s track breaks into a run and ventures off the trail into the surrounding muskeg and forest. At that point he was being pursued, or possibly the act of running stimulated the pursuit. Then there is a lot of blood in the snow, both drops and pooled blood. Constable Noey said it appears Carnegie stood at that point for some time because Kenton’s wide-stanced footprints straddled a large amount of blood on the vegetation and on the ground. That sequence is exactly what we would expect with a wolf attack, i.e., initial attack, pursuit, wounding bites inflicted, then a retreat of the wolves while the prey is weakened by blood loss. The drops and undisturbed pooling of blood do not suggest a bear attack where the bear would maintain constant contact with its prey and overpower it with physical force.|"A Review of Evidence and Findings Related to the Death of Kenton Carnegie on 8 November 2005 Near Points North, Saskatchewan" by Mark E. McNay, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Fairbanks, Alaska, 25 May 2007&lt;ref name="Mark"/&gt;}} 

However, as Carnegie was their first human victim, it would have been impossible to extrapolate normal, specific feeding behaviours.&lt;ref name="Kenton"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wolfsongnews.org/news/Alaska_current_events_2448.html| title= Fairbanks wolf expert helps debunk Canadian bear attack theory| publisher= newsminer.com | accessdate= 2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reconstruction of the attack suggested that Carnegie repeatedly broke free and struggled to his feet after being taken down. Bears are adept at pinning prey.&lt;ref name="Mark"/&gt;

===Inquest===
The Chief Coroner's confidential investigative report was completed in the summer of 2006 and given to the Carnegie family for review. The report determined Carnegie was killed by either wolves or a black bear, and that the poorly conducted initial investigation and uncertainty of circumstantial evidence precluded a definitive conclusion. An Inquest date of February 2007 was then called by the Chief Coroner, but was rescheduled for 29 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiopca.com/pdfs/insight/endangered_species/bears3.pdf|title=Townhouses Compiled|website=www.ohiopca.com|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Province of Saskatchewan chose not to present an affirmative case supporting the findings of the Chief Coroner. Accordingly, the lawyer representing the crown did not carry out in depth examinations of witnesses. Further, judicial inquests in Saskatchewan apply a much lower standard for determining cause of death (balance of probabilities or 51%) than do determinations by the Chief Coroner (reasonable doubt or 95%). On 1 November 2007, following three days of testimony and examination of photographs of Carnegie's body and the site of the incident, a six-member jury concluded that wolves were responsible for Carnegie's death.&lt;ref name="Peace"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.thestar.com/News/article/276591| title= Parents find peace in jury's findings| publisher= TheStar.com | accessdate= 2008-07-30 | location=Toronto | first=Carola | last=Vyhnak | date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace2"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.paherald.sk.ca/index.cfm?sid=76887&amp;sc=4| title= Wolves killed student: jury| publisher= Prince Albert Daily Herald | accessdate= 2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A scholarship fund at the University of Waterloo   was established as a memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtechservices.ca/Kenton/Kenton.html Kenton Joel Carnegie Memorial] retrieved 27/8/14&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[L. David Mech]], an internationally recognized wolf expert, stated; "Mr. Carnegie's death is a terrible tragedy but one fatal wolf attack in the recorded history of North America does not warrant widespread alarm".&lt;ref name="explore"&gt;''Wolves at the Door'' by Moira Farr, Explore Magazine, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Carnegie's family, the  official investigation was too focused on establishing Carnegie’s cause of death, while ignoring wider policy issues.  Further criticism concerned an alleged failure of some biologists to notice that an unnatural garbage-scavenging lifestyle meant wolves around the camp had flourished only to the extent they lacked fear of humans, and a proliferation of wolves thus selected was depleting the local deer population. Carnegie's father expressed concern that Saskatchewan's response was inadequate and that there was no real action being taken to tackle the circumstances which he believed had led to the attack.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

After Carnegie's death, an electric fence was built around Points North Landing's landfill to prevent future predatory animal incidents. Eleven years later, a lone timber wolf attacked a young male twenty-six-year-old worker in [[Cigar Lake Mine|Cigar Lake]]. The worker was on his midnight break when it jumped and mauled him less than one hundred meters from the main camp. A nearby female security guard frightened the wolf away. She administered first aid and called for an air ambulance, which airlifted him six hundred and seventy-five kilometres to a hospital in Saskatoon, where he recovered. After the attack, authorities ordered that wolves in the area be tracked down and shot. In addition, authorities required food disposal systems and inspected the fence around Cigar Lake's landfill, as well as providing more education to the mining staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatchewan-wolf-attack-1.3740927|title=Worker mauled by wolf near Cameco's Cigar Lake, Sask., mine 3rd northern attack in 12 years - CBC News|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''future map''' is a method for building scenarios based on the collection of anticipated events.

The concept is based on the idea that a group of people who integrate the partial visions of its members into a common, shared, discussed, large enough, collection of anticipated events it can eventually reveal its own "shared future".

Because the [[Policy Analysis Market|FutureMap]] methodology is dynamic and implemented on a [[wiki]]-platform the Future projected by the group is constantly under revision. By process, the community learns how to adapt to future changes and increases its ability to face "unexpected events", it improves what the author calls its '''future-readiness'''.

She persuaded Henry to renounce Protestantism in favour of Catholicism in 1593. Later she urged French Catholics to accept the [[Edict of Nantes]], which granted certain rights to the Protestants. It was legally impossible for the king to marry her, because he was already married to [[Margaret of Valois]], but he acknowledged Gabrielle as the mother of three of his children, and as "the subject most worthy of our friendship".{{sfn|Wellman|2013|p=341}}

==Birth==

She was born at either the [[Château de la Bourdaisière]] in [[Montlouis-sur-Loire]], in [[Touraine]], or at the château de [[Cœuvres-et-Valsery|Cœuvres]], in [[Picardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Desclozeaux, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal mistress==
In November 1590, Henry IV fell in love with Gabrielle d'Estrées.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Knecht|first=R.J.|title=The French Civil Wars, 1562-1598|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became one of his many mistresses in the middle of his bitter struggle with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]].  Although he was married to [[Margaret of Valois]], Henry and Gabrielle were openly affectionate with each other in public. Fiercely loyal, Gabrielle accompanied Henry during his campaigns. Even when heavily pregnant, she insisted on living inside his tent near the battlefield, making sure his clothing was clean and that he ate well after a battle, handling the day to day correspondence while he fought. As she was an intelligent and practical woman, Henry confided his secrets to her and followed her advice. When the two were apart, Henry frequently wrote her letters while on his sojourn trips at war camps.{{sfn|Wellman|2013|p=343}}

[[File:Gabrielle de Estrees6.jpg|thumb|left| Portrait of Gabrielle d’Estrées]]
Born a [[Catholic]], Gabrielle knew that the best way to conclude the religious wars was for Henry himself to become a Catholic. Recognizing the wisdom in her argument, on 25 July 1593 Henry declared that "Paris is well worth a Mass" and permanently renounced [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elizabeth Webber|first=Mike Feinsilber|title=Merriam-Webster's dictionary of allusions|page=404|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACB81ZeNN5sC&amp;pg=PA404}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled him to be crowned [[King of France]] on 27 February 1594. Henry also arranged for Gabrielle's marriage to Liancourt to be annulled the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabrielle d'Estrées, Duchess of Beaufort|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/193655/Gabrielle-dEstrees-duchess-de-Beaufort|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 7 June 1594, their first child was born, a son, [[César, Duke of Vendôme|César de Bourbon]], future [[Duke of Vendôme]].  On 4 January 1595, Henry IV officially recognized and legitimized his son in a text validated by the ''[[Parlement de Paris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calames.abes.fr/pub/#details?id=IF1C11061|title=Lettres de légitimation de César de Vendôme ; Paris, 4 janvier 1595|work=www.calames.abes|publisher=In french}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that text, he also recognized Gabrielle d'Estrées as the mother of his son and as "the subject the most worthy of our friendship"; in other words, Henry IV had the ''Parlement de Paris'' officially ratify Gabrielle's position as his mistress. In 1596, he made her ''marquise de Monceaux'' and, the following year, ''duchesse de Beaufort''.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Bayrou|Bayrou, François]], ''Le Roi libre'', Flammarion, Paris, 1994, p. 438 (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry IV also recognized and legitimized two more children he had with Gabrielle: [[Catherine-Henriette de Bourbon]], a daughter born in 1596, and Alexandre de Bourbon, a son born in 1598. The relationship between Henry and Gabrielle did not sit well with some members of the French [[aristocracy]], and malicious pamphlets circulated that blamed the new duchess for many national misfortunes.  One of the most vicious nicknames ascribed to Gabrielle was ''la duchesse d'Ordure'' ("the Duchess of Filth").&lt;ref&gt;[[Yves-Marie Bercé|Bercé, Yves-Marie]], 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabrielle became Henry's most important [[diplomat]], using her female friends amongst the various Catholic League families to bring about peace. In March 1596, Henry gave both Gabrielle and his sister Catherine a set of gold keys which bestowed upon them seats on his council. This gift pleased Gabrielle so much that she took to wearing the little keys on a chain around her neck.{{sfn|Wellman|2013|p=345}}

In 1598, Henry issued the [[Edict of Nantes]], which gave the [[Huguenot]]s certain rights while deferring to Catholics. Joining forces, the Huguenot Catherine and Catholic Gabrielle went to work overriding the objections of powerful Catholics and Huguenots and forcing compliance with the edict. Henry was so impressed with her efforts that he wrote "My mistress has become an orator of unequaled brilliance, so fiercely does she argue the cause of the new Edict."{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Death==
After applying to [[Pope Clement VIII]] for an annulment of his marriage and authority to remarry, in March 1599 Henry gave his mistress his coronation ring. Gabrielle, so sure that the wedding would take place, stated, "Only God or the king's death could put an end to my good luck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horne|first=Alistair|title=La Belle France|year=2007|publisher=Vintage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zj2qOWXUU4MC&amp;pg=PT103&amp;dq=%22Only+God+or+the+king's+death+could+put+an+end+to+my+good+luck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F8hoT6TQE82utwfDluGXCQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Only%20God%20or%20the%20king's%20death%20could%20put%20an%20end%20to%20my%20good%20luck&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days later, on 9 April, she suffered an attack of [[eclampsia]] and gave birth to a stillborn son.  King Henry was at the [[Château de Fontainebleau]] when news arrived of her illness. The next day, 10 April 1599, while Henry was on his way to her, she died in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Bercé, Yves-Marie, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The King was grief-stricken,&lt;ref&gt;Bayrou, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; especially given the widely held rumor that Gabrielle had been poisoned. He wore black in mourning, something no previous French monarch had done. He gave her the funeral of a queen; her coffin was transported amidst a procession of princes, princesses, and nobles to the [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]] church in Paris, for a requiem mass. Remembered in French history and song as ''La Belle Gabrielle'', she was interred at the Notre-Dame-La-Royale de Maubuisson Abbey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cistercian Abbey|first=Maubuisson|title=Cartulaire De L'abbaye De Maubuisson (Notre-Dame-La-Royale): Ptie.

A [[publication]] after her death called the ''Mémoires secrets de Gabrielle d'Estrée'' (“The Secret Memoirs of Gabrielle d’Estrée”) is believed to have been written by one of her friends.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Children==
Her four children by Henry were:
* [[César, Duke of Vendôme]] (1594–1665),{{sfn|Wellman|2013|p=308}} married [[Françoise de Lorraine (1592–1669)]] and had issue. In 1626, he participated in a plot against [[Cardinal Richelieu]].  César was captured and held in prison for three years. In 1641 he was accused of conspiracy again and this time fled to [[England]].
* [[Catherine Henriette de Bourbon]] (1596–1663),{{sfn|Wellman|2013|p=345}} married [[Charles II, Duke of Elbeuf]].
* Alexandre, Chevalier de Vendôme (1598–1629).{{sfn|Wellman|2013|p=347}}
* stillborn son (1599).

==Representation in art==
[[Image:Scuola di fontainebleau, presunti ritratti di gabrielle d'estrées sua sorella la duchessa di villars, 1594 ca. 06.jpg|thumb|250px|The painting presumed to depict Gabrielle d'Estrées]]
She is the presumed subject of the painting ''[[Gabrielle d'Estrées et une de ses sœurs]]'' by an unknown artist (c. 1594). Gabrielle sits up nude in a bath, holding (presumably) Henry's coronation ring, whilst her sister sits nude beside her and pinches her right [[nipple]]. Henry gave Gabrielle the ring as a token of his love shortly before she died. The painting is in the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=1105 Official site of the Louvre Museum - Portrait présumé de Gabrielle d'Estrées et de sa sœur la duchesse de Villars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through horticultural therapy sessions, the charity aims to maximise a veteran’s physical, psychological and social strength, and enhance general health and [[well-being]].

Gardening Leave was founded in March 2007 and opened its headquarters and first project at [[Auchincruive]], Scotland. On 3 September 2007, Lance Sergeant (then Lance Corporal) [[Johnson Beharry|Johnson Beharry VC]], opened the Poppy Collection at the Ayr site.

The organisation now also runs projects at [[Erskine (charity)|Erskine Hospital]] (near [[Glasgow]]), [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] ([[London]]) and an outreach project in [[East Acton]] (London). It has announced plans to open a new project in [[Dundee]] in 2015.

==Horticultural therapy==
{{see also|Horticultural therapy}}
"Horticultural therapy is a professionally conducted client-centred treatment modality that utilises horticultural activities to meet specific therapeutic or rehabilitative goals of its participants. The focus is to maximise social, cognitive, physical and/or psychological functioning and/or to enhance general health and wellbeing."&lt;ref name="HallerKramer2006"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Haller|editor-first1=Rebecca|editor-last2=Kramer|editor-first2=Cramer|date=2006-11-08|title=Horticultural therapy methods: Making connections in health care, human service, and community programs|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781560223269|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0F4JXSpbpAUC|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present work==
In 2014 Gardening Leave launched an Honesty campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardeningleave.org/index.php/honesty/ |publisher=Gardening Leave |title=Honesty pledge |accessdate=25 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118051858/http://www.gardeningleave.org/index.php/honesty/ |archivedate=18 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Honesty (plant)|honesty plant]] seed head as its emblem, to raise awareness of [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding veterans' mental health.

As of October 2014, the [[chairman]] of Gardening Leave is Luke Borwick and the [[chief executive officer]] is Heather Budge-Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardeningleave.org/index.php/about/who-we-are/ |publisher=Gardening Leave |title=Who we are |accessdate=25 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116183828/http://www.gardeningleave.org/index.php/about/who-we-are/ |archivedate=16 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Wilson's ''Holon'' was originally commissioned in 1978–1979 and dedicated to the late Dr. Gordon Hearn, the first dean of [[Portland State University]]'s School of Social Work.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Holon, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!324181~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=July 10, 2015}} Note: This record is for the original sculpture (1978–1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from the Greek ''holos'', which means "whole, entire, complete in all its parts – something that has integrity and identity at the same time as it is a part of a larger system".&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;&lt;ref name=PPR&gt;{{cite web|title=South Park Blocks|url=http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?&amp;propertyid=674&amp;action=ViewPark|publisher=[[Portland Parks &amp; Recreation]]|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was carved from white [[Indiana Limestone]]. It measured approximately {{Convert|60|in|m}} x {{Convert|33|in|m}} x {{Convert|12|in|m}} and rested on a brick base that measured around {{Convert|30|in|m}} x {{Convert|24|in|m}} x {{Convert|19.25|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; When the [[Smithsonian Institution]] surveyed the sculpture for its "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in April 1993, the organization categorized the piece as [[Abstract art|abstract]], its condition as "treatment needed", and noted that Wilson had removed graffiti previously.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

The sculpture was re-carved from granite in 2003–2004 and installed in Portland's [[South Park Blocks]], between Southwest Harrison and Southwest Hall streets in front of the [[Branford Price Millar Library]], in 2004.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SI2&gt;{{cite web|title=Holon, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!368929~!0#focus|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=July 9, 2015}} Note: This record is for the re-carved sculpture (2003–2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]], which administers the work, describes it as reflective of the university's "holistic" design.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt; The sculpture measures {{Convert|54|in|m}} x {{Convert|36|in|m}} x {{Convert|18|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt; Its base includes a plaque that reads, "{{Small|HOLON / RECOGNIZING THE ESTABLISHMENT / OF SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION AT / PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY IN 1961 / AND HONORING GORDON HEARN / FOUNDING DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF / SOCIAL WORK FROM 1962–1977.}}"&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The work is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council.&lt;ref name=CN&gt;{{cite web|title=Holon, 2004|url=http://culturenow.org/entry&amp;permalink=06440&amp;seo=Holon_Donald-Wilson-and-City-of-Portland-and-Multnomah-County-Public-Art-Collection-courtesy-of-the-Regional-Arts-Culture-Council|publisher=cultureNOW|accessdate=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Horse Isle''''' is a browser-based [[MMORPG]] first released in 2007. The game is developed and published independently by American duo Joe and Miranda Durbin.&lt;ref name="Passi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-166941599.html|title=Couple's business all fun and games.|last=Passi|first=Peter|date=July 30, 2007|work=[[Duluth News-Tribune]]|accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, a second version of the game was released with completely different gameplay and graphics: '''Horse Isle: Legend of the Esrohs'''.

''Horse Isle'' is set in a fictional world that centers on [[horses]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpgland.com/games/reviews/horse-isle-the-secret-land-of-horses/|title=Horse Isle: The Secret Land of Horses|last=Wilson|first=Tim|date=July 1, 2007|work=[[RPG Land]]|accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is on individual player's capture and care of horses, mini games, arena competitions and the dozens of horse breeds the game offers. The game is geared to include gamers of all ages so it has parental filters in place. In 2010, the game had a player base of around 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpgland.com/news/horse-isle-2-out-of-the-gate-tops-10k/|title=Horse Isle 2 out of the gate, tops 10k|author=Heath|date=November 9, 2010|work=RPG Land|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest features of the game is that it is completely browser based, but is a fully graphical online RPG. The artwork in Horse Isle has a 2D style with hand drawn images.

The ''Horse Isle'' series uses educational elements involved in progressing through the games. These focus around reading comprehension, spelling, mathematics, science, and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;''Super Smart Games'', December 30th, 2007, "[http://www.supersmartgames.com/Big_Kids/Life_Skills/Horse_Isle/]", Retrieved 11/19/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life Cycle'''

''Horse Isle'' also introduced a new version of Legend of the Esrohs called Life Cycle in 2012. The game has the same virtual world but the focus is now on breeding. In Life Cycle your horses can age, breed and die. This is the only difference between the two servers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">The  '''imperial ban''' ({{lang-de|Reichsacht}}) was a form of [[outlaw]]ry in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Starn|1982|p=23}} At different times, it could be declared by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], or by courts like the [[League of the Holy Court]] (''Vehmgericht'') or the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]''.

People under imperial ban, known as ''Geächtete'' (from about the 17th century, colloquially also as ''Vogelfreierei'', lit. "free as a bird"), lost all their rights and possessions. They were legally considered dead, and anyone was allowed to rob, injure or kill them without legal consequences. The imperial ban automatically followed the [[excommunication]] of a person, as well as extending to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.

Those banned could reverse the ban by submitting to the legal authority. The ''Aberacht'', a stronger version of the imperial ban, could not be reversed.

The imperial ban was sometimes imposed on whole [[Imperial State|Imperial Estates]]. In that case, other estates could attack and seek to conquer them. The effect of the ban on a city or other Estate was that it lost its [[Imperial immediacy]] and in the future would have a second overlord in addition to the emperor.

Famous people placed under the imperial ban included:

* 1180 [[Henry the Lion]], for refusing military support to [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] against the cities of the [[Lombard League]].
* 1225 Count [[Frederick of Isenberg]], for killing his uncle [[Engelbert II of Berg]], Archbishop of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]].
* 1235 King [[Henry (VII) of Germany]], for his rebellion against his father the [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]].
* 1276 King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]], for his capture of imperial lands from [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I]].
* 1309 [[John Parricida]], for the murder of his uncle King [[Albert I of Germany]].
* 1415 [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]] for aiding the flight of [[Antipope John XXIII]] from the [[Council of Constance]].
* 1512 and 1518 [[Götz von Berlichingen]], the first time for [[robbery]], the second for [[kidnapping]].
* 1521 [[Martin Luther]] and his supporters, for spreading [[heresy|heretic beliefs]] and for splitting the church.
* 1546 [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse]], for leading the [[Schmalkaldic League]].
* 1566 [[Wilhelm von Grumbach]], for [[insurgency]].
* 1621 [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], and his supporters [[Christian I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg|Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg]] and [[Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim]], for seizing power in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]].
* 1706 [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]], and [[Joseph Clemens of Bavaria|Joseph Clemens, Elector of Cologne]], for supporting France in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (ban reversed in 1714)
* 1793 [[Georg Forster]], for collaboration with the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].

The imperial ban imposed by the [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]] on the city of [[Donauwörth]] after an anti-Catholic riot was one of the [[Catholic League (German)#The foundation of the Catholic League|incidents]] leading to the [[Thirty Years' War]].

'''KL-ONE''' (pronounced "kay ell won") is a well known [[knowledge representation]] system in the tradition of [[semantic networks]] and [[Frame (Artificial intelligence) | frames]]; that is, it is a [[frame language]]. The system is an attempt to overcome semantic indistinctness in semantic network representations and to explicitly represent conceptual information as a structured inheritance network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = W. A. | authorlink1 = William Aaron Woods| last2 = Schmolze | first2 = J.

J. | authorlink1 = Ronald J. Brachman| last2 = Schmolze | first2 = J.

Duce | first = G.A. Ringland  | title = Approaches to Knowledge Representation, An Introduction | year = 1988 | publisher = Research Studies Press, Ltd. | isbn = 0-86380-064-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a whole family of KL-ONE-like systems. One of the innovations that KL-ONE initiated was the use of a [[deductive classifier]], an automated reasoning engine that can validate a frame ontology and deduce new information about the ontology based on the initial information provided by a domain expert. 

Frames in KL-ONE are called [[concepts]]. These form hierarchies using subsume-relations; in the KL-ONE terminology a [[superclass (computer science)|super class]] is said to subsume its [[Subclass (computer science) | subclasses]]. 
[[Multiple inheritance]] is allowed. Actually a concept is said to be well-formed only if it inherits from more than one other concept. All concepts, except the top concept (usually THING), must have at least one super class. 

In KL-ONE descriptions are separated into two basic classes of concepts: primitive and defined. Primitives are domain concepts that are not fully defined. This means that given all the properties of a concept, this is not sufficient to classify it. They may also be viewed as incomplete definitions. Using the same view, defined concepts are complete definitions. Given the properties of a concept, these are [[necessary and sufficient]] conditions to classify the concept.

The slot-concept is called roles and the values of the roles are role-fillers. There are several different types of roles to be used in different situations. The most common and important role type is the generic RoleSet that captures the fact that the role may be filled with more than one filler.

'''Life Sciences Greenhouse of Central Pennsylvania''' (LSGPA) is a [[biotechnology]] initiative and [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] specializing in the advancement of [[Biology|life sciences]] through [[technology]] to improve the [[healthcare]] and enhanced economic opportunity of Pennsylvanians. The initiative began in 2001, funded with money from the state's settlement with the [[tobacco industry]].&lt;ref name="lsgpa"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lsgpa.com/index.cfm?act=aboutus| year=2006| title=About the LSGPA|first=| last=Life Sciences Greenhouse of Central PA| publisher=lsgpa.com/| accessdate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other life sciences greenhouses in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse|Pittsburgh]] also received seed money from the settlement.&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghlifesciences.com/content.aspx?id=02c4a4fe-a599-438c-a883-d0e8a88fb007 |year=2002 |title=Governor Schweiker Launches PA's Landmark Life Sciences Greenhouse |first= |last=Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse |publisher=pittsburghlifesciences.com/ |accessdate=2007-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017220016/http://www.pittsburghlifesciences.com/content.aspx?id=02c4a4fe-a599-438c-a883-d0e8a88fb007 |archivedate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSGPA partners with a range of institutions, including local [[University|research universities]], [[colleges]], [[Hospital|medical centers]], [[Community economic development|economic development agencies]] and companies both small and large, to identify needs and opportunities.&lt;ref name="lsgpa"/&gt; The organization then works to help transfer technologies, to develop new companies, to provide support for existing companies (particularly those seeking to expand or relocate), and to ensure that the [[infrastructure]] necessary to support a thriving life sciences industry keeps pace with development.&lt;ref name="lsgpa"/&gt;

Central Pennsylvania has three large research universities which contribute to the initiative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59093">This is an index of films that deal with the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] in Europe. Films dealing with the subject of the Holocaust include both documentary and narrative films. These films were produced from the early 1940s before the extent of the Holocaust was widely known and have continued to be made since then.&lt;ref name=Reimer&gt;{{cite book | last=Reimer | first=R.C. | last2=Reimer | first2=C.J. |

 series=Historical Dictionaries of Literature and the Arts | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-8108-7986-7 |
 page=xiii |}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The films span multiple genres, with documentary films including footage filmed both by the Germans for their propaganda purposes and by the Allies, compilations, survivor testimonies and docudramas, and narrative films including war films, action films, love stories, psychological dramas and even comedies.&lt;ref name=Reimer/&gt;

|''[[Un spécialiste, portrait d'un criminel moderne]]''
|[[Eyal Sivan]]
|Documentary film directed by [[Rony Brauman]] and [[Eyal Sivan]], originally released in 1999 to theaters worldwide. Made entirely out of the restored original video recordings of [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s trial at Jerusalem edited down to 120 minutes, the film focuses especially on the desk murderer's psychology. No narration or commentary is used, albeit the material is at times edited visually and acoustically to disturbing effect, to reflect the most disturbing nature of the events related in the words of the witnesses, the court, and the defendant, and scored with disturbing [[musique concrete]] or [[ambient music]].

Official Selection of the 1999 [[Berlin International Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="sivan"&gt;[http://eyalsivan.info/index.php?p=fichefilm&amp;id=11 ''The Specialist, portrait of a modern criminal 1999''], eyalsivan.info (click ''Awards'' tab at the top of the article)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dafilms"&gt;[http://dafilms.fr/film/8853-the-specialist-portrait-of-a-modern-criminal/ ''Un Spécialiste - Portrait d'un Criminel Moderne // The Specialist, Portrait of a  Modern Criminal''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213142850/http://dafilms.fr/film/8853-the-specialist-portrait-of-a-modern-criminal/ |date=2014-02-13 }}, Doc Aliance: Votre Cinéma Documentaire en Ligne (click drop-downs for ''Fesivals'' and ''Prix'')&lt;/ref&gt; winner of the [[Grimme-Preis]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="sivan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dafilms" /&gt; Was criticized for tendentious editing making Eichmann appear in a more positive light and especially making prosecutor [[Gideon Hausner]] appear to display rude and unfair behavior in court, by [[Stewart Tryster]], director of the [[Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive]], in his 2005 documentary ''Editing the Truth Away: The Eichmann Trial and ''The Specialist'' ''.&lt;ref&gt;(2013).

They were hiding in the woods and in attics, making homemade candy to sell on the black market, until 1942 when they were captured.

'''Marie Rose Cavelan''' (1752-unknown) was a French-[[Afro-Grenadian]] or possibly French-Amerindian-African-Grenadian planter and revolutionary. A free woman of color, she married Julien Fédon, a French Catholic, like herself of mixed ancestry. Together, she and her husband bought a plantation and engaged as planters and slave owners in the colonial period. Grenada changed hands between the French and British several times during the couple's life, causing persecution for the couple when the British were in authority. Cavelan was arrested in 1787 and forced to provide evidence of her free status, though she was well known to the British, having conducted numerous business transactions with British business men. Though large landowners, Cavelan and her husband were increasingly denied the right to engage in public affairs. In the 1790s they began manumitting their slaves and in 1795 staged a revolt against British rule. Branded traitors, they led a revolt which lasted nearly two years, but were never captured by the British. Cavelan's whereabouts after the rebellion ended are unknown.

==Early life==
Marie Rose Cavelan was born around 1752 in the [[French colonial empire|French colony]], Le Grenade{{#tag:ref|Candlin &amp; Pybus state that Cavelan was born on [[Martinique]]{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=23}} and that her father was a Frenchman.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=21}} However, Jacobs states that Marguerite Cavelan, Marie Rose's sister, and their mother were natives of Grenada and that their father was a native of Martinique. If Michel Cavelan traveled with the French jeweler, Pierre Fédon and his Martiniquan wife, Brigitte Veuve to Grenada in 1849, it seems likely that Marie Rose was born in Grenada.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}}|group="Notes"}} to Marianne Lemico and Michel Cavelan. Her father had immigrated from [[Martinique]] and moved to Le Grenade around 1750. Her mother was originally from the Sainte Rose Parish of Le Grenade. Documents of her heritage are conflicting, as some refer to her as a ''mulatresse libre'', free [[mulatto]] woman and others show her to be ''femme mestive'', a woman of mixed [[Amerindian]] and mulatta descent.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} 

At the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, the French ceded La Grenade to the British.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|pp=15–16}} The British regime allowed free persons of colour to own land and weapons, marry, and exercise free movement, all of which had been restricted under the French governors.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=17}} During this volatile time, three of the Cavelan sisters, Elizabeth, Marguerite and Marie Rose, would marry brothers of the Fédon family. In 1774, Cavelan married [[Julien Fédon]] in an English ceremony,{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} as the British forbade them a Catholic ceremony.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=22}} In 1779, the French [[Capture of Grenada (1779)|recaptured Grenada]],{{sfn|Marley|2008|p=493}} and the following year, the couple remarried under French authorities on 31 January 1780 in a Catholic ceremony.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}}{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=22}} Later, they had a daughter born in December of that year.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}}  

==Lead up to revolt==
In 1784, the British retook the island and an exodus of French planters to Trinidad ensued.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} Repressive laws passed by the British towards French Catholics, between 1784 and 1795, increasingly closed free blacks from participating in the public affairs of the colony.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} Originally, the laws were aimed at curtailing French Catholic autonomy,{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=23}} but as the place the French planters had occupied was taken over by free people of colour,{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} the laws began being applied to them as well.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=23}} Cavelan and Fédon initially lived in Grand Pauvre (now [[Saint Mark Parish, Grenada|Saint Mark Parish]]), where they ran a small plantation, known as ''Lancer''.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} In February 1787, Cavelan was arrested under a law passed the previous year, which required her to show evidence of her status as a "free coloured" to the authorities in the capital, [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. She was well known to the authorities, as the owner of the plantation, ''Lancer'', who had transacted business in her own name, and as the wife of Fédon. When the law was passed, she saw no reason to travel the fourteen miles from her home to the capital to register her free status, as the legal intent was ostensibly to curtail vagabonds.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|pp=22–23}} 

The law supposedly applied to all free coloureds but was typically enforced only upon women, as a means of discouraging [[miscegenation]] and reinforcing white superiority.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|pp=22–23}} If Cavelon was unable to prove her free status within six weeks, the authorities were empowered to sell her into slavery.{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=21}} Fédon used his network, contacting Joseph Verdet, who had served as best man at their wedding and François Philip, who was a wealthy white planter, to vouch for her status. John Hay, the acting justice of the peace, accepted their oaths and released Cavelan after several weeks of incarceration,{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=23}} issuing her a certificate of freedom.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}}

The [[French Revolution]] broke out in 1789, spawning revolts across the wider [[French Caribbean]].{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} In 1790, Fédon, along with thirty-five other Frenchmen, predominantly free coloured, signed a "Public Declaration of Loyalty",{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} which professed that though French, their loyalty lay with Britain.{{sfn|Dubesset|Benjamin-Labarthe|2010|p=176}} That same year, Cavelan and Fédon relocated to [[Saint John Parish, Grenada|Saint John Parish]]. Selling ''Lancer'', which contained 38.5 acres of land and ten slaves for three thousand one hundred and fifty pounds (₤3,150). They simultaneously bought the ''Belvidere Estate'', a [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] and [[coffee plantation]] from James Campbell, "a Senior Member of the Council and former Acting Governor" of the colony. For the price of fifteen thousand pounds (₤15,000), the purchase included 450 acres of land and the buildings, 16 cows, 5 horses, and 80 slaves.  Beginning in 1790, the couple began to manumit the slaves that they owned, releasing Guillaume La Grange; Louis; and Mary Jeanne from [[Cabresse Island]] along with her children, Francois Louis, Edward and Rose in 1791. The acquisition of such a large estate, evidences that the couple had moved from nominally successful to part of the emerging free coloured elite.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}}

The appointment of the ultra-Protestant planter, Ninian Home, as Lieutenant Governor in 1793, ensured that none of the colonists of French descent would be allowed to participate in the Legislative Assembly.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}}{{sfn|Crask|2009|p=8}}{{sfn|Duffy|2004|p=128}} The following year, the [[French National Convention]] abolished slavery and extended citizenship to all former slaves in all of the French colonies. The Convention sent out emissaries to make contact with those colonies, which had long-standing ties to France, to regain loyalties in the eastern Caribbean. By the time the agents reached Grenada, a revolt was already well-organized, with Fédon as the leader of the insurgents, which included free coloureds, slaves and [[Maroon (people)|maroons]]. The French agents offered to provide military assistance and guidance, which included the use of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] [[Reign of Terror|terror tactics]].{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}}

==Rebellion==
[[Fédon's rebellion]] started at the beginning of March 1795.{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=1}} Taking the British by surprise, the rebels quickly captured Governor Home on 2 March{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}} and within two days had forty-three prisoners secured at ''Belvidere''.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}}{{sfn|Candlin|2012|p=3}} Cavelan was as deeply invested as her husband in the revolt, as attested by eyewitness testimonies,{{sfn|Candlin|Pybus|2015|p=23}} which place both she and her daughters at the Battle of Mt. Qua-Qua.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}} Fédon sent a demand for surrender to the British, who rejected the demands, instead promising amnesty to those who gave up the fight.{{sfn|Craton|2009|p=186}} Fédon was named in the September Act of Attainder which declared the insurgents traitors. The British officially extinguished the revolution on 19 June 1796 and thereafter the Fédon estates were confiscated. Rumors surfaced that Fédon had escaped to Cuba, but record of Cavelan after 8 April 1795 has not been found.{{sfn|Jacobs|2002}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">'''Mary Channing''' was a [[Dorset]] women convicted of [[Mariticide|poisoning her husband]] and [[burnt at the stake]].{{Sfn|''Serious Admonitions''}}

==Biography==
Mary Brooks was born in early May 1687 to Richard and Elizabeth Brooks of Dorchester. The lack of proper parental control is said to have lowered her character. She soon established a friendship with a young neighbour to whom she often presented lavish gifts and together they spent their evenings outside. After receiving frequent complaints from neighbours, Brook's parents decided that she should be married; they thought a husband would have more control over her than they commanded. So she married, albeit reluctantly, a grocer named Thomas Charring on 15 January 1704. Even after being married, she continued meeting her lover.{{Sfn|''Serious Admonitions''}} Channing is said to have poisoned her husband's milk.{{Sfn|Durston|2014|p=143}} 

Before dying on 21 April, Thomas Channing wrote his will, leaving everything to his father except a shilling for Mary. Her father-in-law grew suspicious and upon post-mortem of Channing's body, he was found to have been poisoned. Mary fled Dorchester and was on the run until she found a distant relative she could stay with.{{Sfn|''Serious Admonitions''}}

When apprehended, Channing denied having killed her husband and asked the examining committee headed by Dorchester mayor to let her [[Cruentation|touch her deceased husband's body]]. If it did not bleed, she should be deemed innocent.{{Sfn|Durston|2014|p=54}} Her trial began on 28 July 1705 at Dorchester Assizes and she conducted her own defence. Channing was declared guilty but the sentence was suspended when she was found to be pregnant. In prison she gave birth to a son on 19 December.{{Sfn|''Serious Admonitions''}}

Channing was burnt at [[Maumbury Rings]] on 21 March 1706. Her execution was witnessed by about 10,000 people.{{Sfn|Hardy|1997|p=387}}{{Sfn|Musselwhite|2003|p=80}}

==Legacy==
[[Thomas Hardy]] was somewhat "fascinated" by and "obsessed" of Channing's execution.{{Sfn|Hardy|1997|p=387}}{{Sfn|Musselwhite|2003|p=82}} Critic [[David Musselwhite]] points out that Nance Mockridge, Mother Cuxsom and Mrs. Goodenogh, three character's in Hardy's ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'', were an "avatar or surrogate of Channing.{{Sfn|Musselwhite|2003|p=85}} The Ring at Casterbridge mentioned in the novel was actually in Maumbury.{{Sfn|Hardy|1997|p=387}} In his article published in ''[[The Times]]'' (1908), Hardy noted the lack of evidences in proving that Channing poisoned her husband.{{Sfn|Hardy|1997|p=388}} Two of Hardy's poems ''The Mock Wife'' and ''The Bridge-Night Fire'' make references to her.{{Sfn|Musselwhite|2003|p=82}} David James' play ''White Mercury, Brown Rice'' (1995) enacted the trial of Channing.{{Sfn|Musselwhite|2003|p=201}}

''Neopets: The Darkest Faerie'' is set in "Neopia", the land of the Neopets universe, which is inhabited by [[anthropomorphic]] versions of various Neopets species. The adventure is based on a story written by Neopets founder [[Adam Powell (game designer)|Adam Powell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467411/fullcredits |title=Neopets: The Darkest Faerie (Video Game 2005) - Full Cast &amp; Crew |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long ago, a dark faerie was imprisoned at the bottom of the Maraquan sea as punishment for attempting to take over the realm, her name having been erased from history and the faerie remembered only as 'the Darkest Faerie'. However, after a thousand years, the spell imprisoning the Darkest Faerie has become weak and breaks, and the faerie escapes, returning to the surface intent on taking over the realm of Neopia and exacting revenge upon the Faerie queen Fyora who imprisoned her.

The game begins with Tormund Ellis (nicknamed "Tor"), a young Lupe farm boy who has long dreamed of being a knight in the city of Meridell. After being accepted into the ranks and training under the discipline of the castle's master-at-arms, Torak, Tormund is knighted after saving the village of Cogham from The Ixi Raiders. But when answering a plea to defend the nearby forest glade of Illusen, the earth faerie, from an invading tribe of Werelupes, the mission fails, and Tormund returns to Meridell to discover both it and its inhabitants under a cloud of dark magic and the control of the Darkest Faerie. Though unaffected himself, he is driven out of the castle and city by the faerie's minions.

The neighboring kingdom of Brightvale notices the dark clouds, and sends a diplomatic envoy to the city of Faerieland, home to the Faerie queen Fyora, to investigate. A young Acara, Roberta, the niece of Brightvale King Hagan, is among the diplomats. The Darkest Faerie attacks Faerieland that night, capturing and binding the Faerie queen and covering the castle in a dark aura. Roberta is able to escape the castle but is pursued and falls to the countryside of Neopia below.

Roberta and Tormund meet each other and then proceed to warn the king of Brightvale about the Faerie. It is revealed that both were given amulets to protect against the Darkest Faerie's power, and upon research discover that the Darkest Faerie was once sealed away by the power of Fyora's magical rod, now lying deep underneath the city of Meridell. After freeing the neighboring regions from control of dark magic, they are able to infiltrate the castle of Meridell and find a way deep underground, recovering Fyora's ancient rod. With its power they are able to drive the darkness out of the city, and then return to Faerieland to stop the Darkest Faerie. It is a trap, however, as the Darkest Faerie seizes the rod and a fight between the two Faeries ensues. Fyora is able to teleport Tormund and Roberta to safety before being captured and imprisoned again.

==Development==
A PlayStation version of the game was being developed by The Code Monkeys and was cancelled for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uvlist.net/game-166849-Neopets+The+Darkest+Faerie|title=Neopets: The Darkest Faerie by The Code Monkeys PS game|website=Universal Videogame List|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the protagonists were largely the same and a new antagonist to the series would have been present, who was named Master Nola, and spanned two discs, one for each protagonist.

==Gameplay==
In the game, only Roberta can use magic attacks, but each of them has the power to use specials, or motes. When used in a powerup attack, they unveil special effects ranging from poisoning the enemies to creating a beam of light. Magic power does become weaker as more magic is used. However, Purple Juppies, and other fruits/potions, replenish your magic gauge when they're eaten/used.

In Neopia, there are many motes that assist Tor and Roberta in their fight to bring light to the shadows. These motes can be equipped to Tor and Roberta's weapons, shields, and armor. The motes throughout Neopia include; Light, Sun, Fog, Wind, Fire, Lava, Nova, Supernova, Dark, Shadow, Leaf, Rock, Bubble, and Water.

Players can feed a petpet so that he can follow them. When fed, it will follow the character for a certain time depending on food type that it was fed and its inherent species. It will give a range of special effects: seeing the invisible/health restore/etc. After feeding the petpet the same kind of food for too long, it will not accept it.

'''Norman Jaffe''' (April 3, 1932 &amp;ndash; August 19, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]] widely noted for his [[Contemporary architecture|contemporary]] [[house|residential]] [[architecture]],&lt;ref name="nym"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbcBAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=The Vanishing - Behind the Mysterious Drowning of the Hamptons Architect Norman Jaffe|last= O'Malley|first=Suzanne|date=17 January 1994|work=New York Magazine |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his "strikingly sculptural [[beach house]]s" on [[Long Island|Eastern Long Island]], in southeastern [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/news/libraries/2008/2008-12-18.jaffe.html|title=Avery Library Acquires Norman Jaffe Archives|date=December 18, 2008|work=Columbia University Libraries|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with pioneering the "design of rustic Modernist houses in the Hamptons",&lt;ref name="nytemk"&gt;{{cite news|title= Drama in the Dunes: Act 2 for a Norman Jaffe Classic |last=Kahn|first=Eve M. |date=August 11, 2005|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with being an innovator in using natural materials and [[Passive solar building design|passive solar]] forms of design,&lt;ref name="thc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Reception, Talk and Book Signing with Alastair Gordon, Robert Lehman Curator and Curator of the exhibition, at the hamptons.com|work=thehamptons com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[urban design]].&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/8559386|title=Romantic modernist: the life and work of Norman Jaffe, architect / Alastair Gordon|work=National Library of Australia|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Norman Jaffe was born in 1932 in [[Chicago]] to poor immigrant parents from [[Poland]] and [[Latvia]].&lt;ref name="aod"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oppenheimer Dean|first=Andrea|date=January 3, 2007|title= Romantic Modernist: The Life and Work of Norman Jaffe Architect 1932-1993|journal=Architectural Record |volume=195|issue= 3|pages=29–29|issn=0003-858X }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the [[Great Depression|depression]], he was sent to live with relatives in [[Seattle]] where he attended high school. After finishing school, he joined the military in 1954,&lt;ref name="aia"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Architects Directory 1970|publisher=The American Institute of Architects|year=1970|pages=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] in Japan during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Alastair |title=Romantic modernist : the life and work of Norman Jaffe, architect|publisher=Monacelli Press|year=2005|isbn=1-58093-156-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Jaffe finished his military service and returned to the United States.&lt;ref name="aia"/&gt; He began studying architecture at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]],&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aia"/&gt; later transferring to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where he received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="aia"/&gt; Jaffe went on to complete study at [[Art Students League of New York]] and [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt; While at Berkeley, Jaffe studied under noted residential architects [[William Wurster]] and [[Joseph Esherick (architect)|Joseph Esherick]] who co-founded the [[College of Environmental Design, UC Berkeley|College of Environmental Design]] at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref name="agid"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon |first=Alastair|date=1 March 2007|title=Building on the Past; Renovating a house in Bridgehampton, New York, Steven Harris and Lucien Rees-Roberts stay true to the spirit of Norman Jaffe|journal=Interior Design|volume=78|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his degree, Jaffe began working for Esherick and in 1961, he left his wife and son and moved to New York to work for [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]], one of the largest architectural firms in the world, and later, for [[Philip Johnson]].&lt;ref name="aod"/&gt;

In 1965, Jaffe's estranged wife, Barbara Cochran, was living in [[Glen Ellyn, Illinois|Glen Ellyn]], [[Illinois]] with their 7-year-old son Miles and her parents when she was killed in a [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle accident]]. Miles moved to New York to live with his father.&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebel in Paradise Nukes the Hamptons on the Web|last=Goldman |first=Andrew |date=May 28, 2001|work=New York Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaffe had begun visiting Long Island in the 1960s, and in 1973 he moved to Bridgehampton where he opened an architectural practice. He became the most prolific architect in the [[The Hamptons|Hamptons]] at that time, designing more than 50 local houses, from small summer homes to large estates. His work in the Hamptons included a [[Golf club (institution)|golf club]], [[synagogue]] and [[restaurant]].&lt;ref name="hamptons"/&gt;  The New York Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] gave Jaffe an award in 1977 for a beach house he designed on Long Island.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;  Jaffe and [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] were the architects of the Guardian Life Building, built in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="empo"/&gt;

In 1985, Jaffe met Sarah Stahl at a [[Hampton Jitney]] bus stop. They were married in 1986 and had two sons.&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt;

In 1987, Jaffe donated his services to the [[Jewish Center of the Hamptons]] and designed their new synagogue. The [[Gates of the Grove Synagogue]] has been described as Jaffe's "masterpiece...(with) a remarkable blend of material and spiritual substance",&lt;ref name="hahnyt"/&gt; and "one of the finest examples of modern synagogue design in America".&lt;ref name="Stolzman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stolzman|first=Henry |others=Tami Hausman, Daniel Stolzman|title=Synagogue Architecture In America: faith, spirit and identity|publisher=Images Publishing|date=August 2, 2006|pages=205–207|isbn=978-1-86470-074-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tfJNHoiMDSoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffe's design won awards for contemporary religious design.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; [[Paul Goldberger]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning architecture writer from ''[[The New Yorker]]'', later described the Gates of the Grove as Jaffe's "greatest work" and a "truly sacred space...",&lt;ref name="pgmem"&gt;{{cite news|title=Norman Jaffee Made a Mark on the Landscape of the East End|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=3 October 1993 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture historian Alastair Gordon said Jaffe's design for the Gates of the Grove "was the jewel in the crown of his turbulent career".&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2007|title=Book Review: ''Romantic Modernist: The Life and Work of Norman Jaffe Architect 1932-1993''|journal=Architectural Record|volume=195|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaffe was inducted as a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1991; the [[Smithsonian Institution]] honored the occasion by exhibiting his work.&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt; It was reported he was "commanding design fees of as much as half a million dollars."&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt;

One of Jaffe's final designs was the office building at 565 Fifth Avenue, [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="empo"/&gt; It was finished in 1993.&lt;ref name="nytpg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Norman Jaffe Made a Mark on the Landscape of the East End |last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=October 3, 1993|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture critic Paul Goldberger from ''The New Yorker'', described the building as "quite remarkable...a stunning modernist object (which) respects the street, and in so doing, it enriches the city."&lt;ref name="pgarchview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Architecture View; On Fifth Avenue, Two New Buildings Come to the Rescue|last=Goldberger|first= Paul |date=4 July 1993|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaffe assisted a number of charities, including medical relief programs in [[East Africa]] and local charities on Long Island. He also donated his professional services to charities and completed a design for a [[children's hospital]] in [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

== Death ==
Early in the morning of August 19, 1993, Jaffe disappeared while swimming off a beach in Bridgehampton, New York, where he was known to often swim alone.&lt;ref name="nyts"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Straight Lines That Came Full Circle|last=Gordon|first=Alastair|date=September 2, 2004|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His clothes and other personal items were found unattended on the beach.&lt;ref name="nytsearch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Search Continues for Architect Who Disappeared at L.I. Beach|date= 24 August 1993|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had only learned to swim in his 50s, and his friends and family were reported as saying he was an overconfident but poor swimmer.&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt; A month later, fishermen found a human pelvic bone on the beach near where Jaffe disappeared. The [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], New York, [[Medical examiner]] used medical records and [[x-ray]]s to confirm the remains belonged to Jaffe. His death was presumed to be an accidental [[drowning]].&lt;ref name="nytnj"&gt;{{cite news|title=Norman Jaffe, an architect famed for home designs, is dead|date= 23 September 1993|work=New York Times|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 1993, he was buried at Shaare Pardes Accabonac Grove Cemetery.&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt; Norman Jaffe was survived by his wife, Sarah Jaffe Turnbull, and three sons.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;

==Legacy==
During his 35-year career as an architect, Norman Jaffe built more than 600 projects and received numerous architecture awards.&lt;ref name="bbar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broome|first=Beth |date= 1 June 2005|title=New &amp; Upcoming Exhibitions|journal=Architectural Record|volume=193|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; That comes out to one project every three weeks.  His work was displayed in museums exhibitions around the United States and overseas, including at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="avery"/&gt; Between 1967 and his death in 1993 he designed more than 50 houses in the Hamptons.&lt;ref name="emk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Retrospective a first for major designer|last=Kahn|first=Eve M.|date=August 17, 2005 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2008, the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York announced it had acquired Jaffe's architectural archives.

The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] is named after the English-born Virginian botanist [[John Clayton (botanist)|John Clayton]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernald's "Gray's Manual of Botany" (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; "Interrupted" describes the gap in middle of the blade left by the fertile portions after they wither and eventually fall off.&lt;ref&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum, [http://uwarboretum.org/foa/plant_sale/Interrupted%20Fern.pdf Interrupted fern profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant is known from [[fossil]]s to have grown in [[Europe]], showing a previous [[circumboreal]] distribution. Fragmentary foliage resembling ''Osmunda claytoniana'' has been found in the fossil record as far back as the [[Triassic]], and is known as †''[[Osmunda claytoniites]]''.  ''O. claytoniana'' is a paramount example of evolutionary stasis.  Paleontological evidence indicates it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.&lt;ref name="pmid24653037"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bomfleur B, McLoughlin S, Vajda V |title=Fossilized nuclei and chromosomes reveal 180 million years of genomic stasis in royal ferns |journal=Science |volume=343 |issue=6177 |pages=1376–7 | date=March  2014 |pmid=24653037 |doi=10.1126/science.1249884 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I think that may be a misinterpretation of the source, the abstract of which seems to be talking about the Royal Fern family, not Osmunda claytoniana specifically--&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:OFH-018 Osmunda claytoniana fertile frond.png|thumb|upright|The fertile middle pinnae give the frond an "interrupted" gap]]

===North America===
In eastern North America it occurs in: the [[Great Lakes region]]; eastern Canada – in southern [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] (north to [[tree line]]); and east to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]; eastern United States – upper [[New England]] south through the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and Atlantic seaboard,  into the [[Southeastern United States]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]]; and west across the [[Southern United States]] to [[Mississippi River]], and back up the [[Mississippi embayment]] through the [[Midwestern United States]] to the Great Lakes.

===Asia===
In eastern Asia, the fern is found in the [[subtropical]] and [[temperate]] Asia in: the [[Eastern Himalaya]],  [[South Central China]] and [[East China|Eastern China]], [[Taiwan]], the [[Korean Peninsula]], the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and [[Japan]].

===Ecology===
''Osmunda claytoniana'' is found in humid zones, mostly in forests, but also in more open [[habitat]]s and [[biome]]s, although rarely in [[bog]]s. The interrupted fern is often found alongside [[Ostrich fern|ostrich]], [[Osmundastrum cinnamomeum|cinnamon]] and [[sensitive fern]]s.

==Description==
''Osmunda claytoniana'' [[frond]]s are [[bipinnate]], {{convert|40|–|100|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} tall and {{convert|20|–|30|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} broad, the blade formed of alternate segments forming an arching blade tightening to a pointed end. The lower end is also slightly thinner than the rest of the frond because the first segments are shorter. Three to seven short, cinnamon-colored fertile segments are inserted in the middle of the length, giving the plant its name.

In their absence, the plant in all its stages appears similar to ''[[Osmundastrum cinnamomeum]]'' (cinnamon fern). The base of the segments distinguishes the two species: where ''O. cinnamomeum'' has typical felt-like [[trichome|hairs]], the few hairs present on ''O. claytoniana'' are extremely short, usually requiring a [[magnifying glass]] to see well.

Like other species in the family Osmundaceae, it grows a very large [[rhizome]], with persistent stipe bases from previous years. It forms small, dense [[clonal colony|colonies]], spreading locally through its rhizome, and often forming [[fairy ring]]s.

[[File:Interruptedfern-evening.jpg|left|thumb|Interrupted fern in evening light]]

===Hybrids===
''[[Osmunda × ruggii]]'', is a hybrid between ''O. claytoniana'' and ''[[Osmunda spectabilis|O. spectabilis]]'' (American royal fern). The hybrid is considered important because it suggests a closer genetic relationship between ''O. claytoniana'' and ''O. spectabilis'' than between ''O. claytoniana'' and ''O. cinnamomeum'' (a fact which has led to moving ''O. cinnamomeum'' out of ''Osmunda'' and into its own genus ''Osmundastrum'').  ''Osmunda'' × ''ruggii'' is sterile and is known from only about two natural populations, despite the many areas in which both ''O. claytoniana'' and ''O. spectabilis'' are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=233500836 | title = 4. Osmunda ruggii R. M. Tryon | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Medicinal===
The [[Iroquois]] used the plant as [[medicinal plant|treatment]] for blood disorders and venereal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maquah.net/BritBrn/ethnobotanical/Osmundaceae.htm Univ. Mich.-Dearborn College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters: Native American Ethnobotany: ''Osmunda'' species] (scroll for ''O. claytoniana'') . accessed 12.1.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culinary===
Unlike those of the ostrich fern, the interrupted fern's [[fiddlehead]]s are not readily edible, due to their bitter taste and a tendency to cause diarrhea. The base of the stipe and very young buds are edible. Overuse may kill the crown.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Cultivation===
''Osmunda claytoniana'' is cultivated as an [[ornamental plant]] for use in traditional, [[native plant]], and [[wildlife garden]]s; for woodlands and [[natural landscaping]]; and for [[habitat]] [[ecological restoration|restoration]] projects. Their spreading [[Colony (biology)|colonizing]] habit can be used for some slope stabilization and erosion control measures.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

{{nihongo|'''''Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs'''''|ポケモンレンジャー 光の軌跡|Pokemon Renjā Hikari no Kiseki|"Pokémon Ranger: Tracks of Light"}} is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Creatures Inc.]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and distributed by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]]'' and it is the third installment of its series. It was released in Japan on March 6, 2010, North America on October 4, 2010, and Europe on November 5, 2010. It was released on the European Wii U Virtual Console on June 9, 2016. Gameplay revolves around capturing Pokémon with the Capture Styler by drawing circles around them. The game received mixed or average reviews, with [[Metacritic]] and [[GameRankings]] both giving it a 69%.

==Gameplay==
''Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which gameplay revolves around capturing Pokémon with the Capture Styler by drawing circles around them. If the Pokémon breaks through the drawn circles by using attacks on them, then the styler's health goes down, and runs out of energy. When energy reaches 0, the styler breaks and the game resumes from the last save point. However, if, for example, the Pokémon walks through the styler's line without using an attack, the styler's line will break, but the styler does not take damage. Capturing Pokémon and completing missions increases XP, which can lead to styler upgrades, such as power upgrade and energy upgrade. After a certain point, the styler can be charged in order to be more effective.&lt;ref name="IGN review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/04/pokemon-ranger-guardian-signs-review|title=Pokemon Ranger: Guardian Signs Review - Nintendo DS Review at IGN|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|author=Kristine Steimer|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the new features lets you call out your Pokémon for support and to help in captures.&lt;ref name="IGNJan15"/&gt; The player can use "Guardian Signs" (also referred to in the game as "Ranger Signs" or "Emblems" by drawing certain symbols, to summon [[Legendary Pokémon]] like [[Entei]], [[Raikou]], and [[Suicune]] and use them outside of battle. Other features include four player [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative play]] with unique missions.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; The game also includes [[Wi-Fi]] mission downloads, one of which gives you access to [[Deoxys]], which can be moved to the DS's other Pokémon games.&lt;ref name="IGNJan13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/13/pokemon-ranger-returns|title=Pokemon Ranger Returns - Nintendo DS story - at IGN|author=Anoop Gantayat|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|date=January 13, 2010|accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game takes place on the island region of Oblivia. The player, and a friend and fellow Ranger, Ben (Summer, if the player is  male), are flying on Staraptors in the clouds, chasing after Pokémon Pinchers after Latias (Latios for male players). The player allows Latios/Latias to escape by distracting the Pinchers. However, when their squad leader, Red Eyes comes in, the player's partner taunts Red Eyes. He responds by shooting a plasma gun. The player moves forward and shields their partner from the blow, and is sent into the sea below, where the player loses and eventually recovers their styler. (The player's partner is then kidnapped.) The player washes up on a beach- the shores of Dolce Island. The player meets a [[Pichu]] with a [[ukulele]],&lt;ref name="IGNJan13"/&gt; who is known throughout the game as the Ukulele Pichu. This Pichu becomes the partner Pokémon of this game. It will join the player as their Partner Pokémon, after they fix its broken ukulele. As a newly recruited ''Pokémon Ranger'', the player would go on various missions and encounter friends, foes, and rivals, not to mention hordes of Pokémon. The new enemy, the Pokémon Pinchers, are controlling Pokémon and using them to their advantage. With newly found Pokémon companions at their side, the player begins their journey to put a stop to the Pokémon Pinchers and restore peace in Oblivia.

'''Robert Adams''' (1810–1870) was a 19th-century British [[gunsmith]] who patented the first successful [[trigger (firearms)|double-action]] [[revolver]] in 1851.  His revolvers were used during the [[Crimean War]], the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]], the [[U.S. Civil War]], and the [[Anglo-Zulu War]].

[[File:Adams cal 36 Revolver.jpg|thumb|Adams cal .36 revolver]]
Adams was the manager for the London arms manufacturers George &amp; John Deane. On August 22, 1851, he was granted a British patent for a new revolver design.&lt;ref name=kinard/&gt;

The .436 Deane and Adams was a five-shot [[percussion cap|percussion]] (cap-and-ball) revolver with a spurless hammer, and the first revolver with a solid frame. The revolver used a double-action only system in which the external hammer could not be cocked by thumbing it back, like most other pistols of the era, but instead cocked itself when the trigger was pulled.  This made it possible to fire the gun much more rapidly than contemporary [[trigger (firearms)|single-action]] revolvers, such as the [[Samuel Colt|Colt]], which had to be cocked before each shot.&lt;ref name="Cunningham2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Grant|title=Gun Digest Shooter's Guide to Handguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzWJh6OCR4QC&amp;pg=PA30|date=27 December 2012|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-3272-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deane and Adams' revolver was shown at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 and subsequently approved by the British Army's Small Arms Committee in addition to being adopted by the [[East India Company]] for use by their cavalry. Orders for the revolver were great enough to prompt the Deane brothers to make Adams a partner in their firm, which became Messrs. Deane, Adams, and Deane.&lt;ref name="Boorman2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorman|first=Dean K.|title=Guns of the Old West: An Illustrated History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EMF4l14xbMC&amp;pg=PA25|date=1 November 2004|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-1-59228-638-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although highly regarded, the hand-crafted Adams revolver was more expensive than Colt's mass-produced guns.&lt;ref name="Cunningham2012"/&gt; It lacked a  recoil shield behind the cylinder, which left the shooter's hand subject to powder burns resulting from "blowback" caused by the sometimes unpredictable [[Gunpowder|black powder]] of the era.  The lack of a hammer spur was criticized since the longer trigger pull of the Adams made it less accurate than the Colt.  Furthermore, the Adams' nipples, upon which the percussion caps were set, were unhardened and sometimes burst upon firing.&lt;ref name="Cunningham2012"/&gt;

An "Improved Frame" model was offered in 1854, presenting both a sleeker look and more comfortable grip. In that same year the [[Board of Ordnance|British Board of Ordnance]] reviewed the Adams together with other percussion revolvers with a view to adopting one as an official service sidearm.  Concerns about the gas escape between the cylinder  and barrel during discharge resulted in no decision being made.  Nevertheless, British officers purchased the Adams privately and the gun proved its worth in battle during the Crimean War.&lt;ref name="Flatnes2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flatnes|first=Oyvind|title=From Musket to Metallic Cartridge: A Practical History of Black Powder Firearms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4p8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT227|date=30 November 2013|publisher=Crowood|isbn=978-1-84797-594-2|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beaumont–Adams===
{{main|Beaumont–Adams revolver}}
In 1855 a veteran of the Crimean conflict, [[Frederick Edward Blackett Beaumont|Lieutenant Frederick E.B. Beaumont]], improved the gun by linking the trigger to a spurred hammer, permitting both single- and double-action fire.  A new version of the revolver, the [[Beaumont–Adams revolver|Beaumont–Adams]], was produced and became so popular that it is said Samuel Colt was forced to shut down his London manufactory as a result.&lt;ref name=kinard&gt;{{cite book | last = Kinard | first = Jeff | authorlink = | title = Pistols: an illustrated history of their impact | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2004 | location = | pages = 75–76 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-85109-470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===London Armoury Company===
Adams had a falling out with the Deane brothers the following year and founded a new arms concern, the [[London Armoury Company]], on February 9, 1856.  Another important [[stockholder]] was Adams' cousin, James Kerr, who later invented the [[Kerrs Patent Revolver]].  The factory was established on the former site of the [[South-Eastern Railway Company]] in the [[Bermondsey]] section of London.

[[The Indian Mutiny]] of 1857 established the Adams as the official revolver of the [[British Army]]. In the bitter fighting it was found that rapid fire was more important than accuracy, and the man-stopping power of the Adams' large caliber bullet was also valued.

[[File:British Army Mark III Model of 1872.JPG|thumb|British Army Mark III, Model of 1872]]  
 
Several variations and improvements were made upon the Adams, which was manufactured in Europe and briefly in the United States under license. The majority of British-made Adams guns seem to have been in 54 bore (approximately .44 caliber), but several smaller and at least one larger bore were also offered. In 1857 the U.S. government purchased 100 revolvers in .36 caliber and another 500 from the Adams-licensed [[Massachusetts Arms Company]]. The 100 British-made guns were issued to the [[U.S. Army]] with the rest held in storage until issued at the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War. In addition Adams revolvers were purchased from the London Armoury prior to and during the war by individual states and the U.S. and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] governments.&lt;ref name="Jones2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gordon L.|title=Confederate Odyssey: The George W.

The London Armoury Company flourished due to the manufacture of the Adams revolver, however, in 1859 the company's board of directors decided to increase the production of [[infantry]] rifles,  decreasing revolver production. Adams disagreed with the decision, selling his [[stock]] and leaving the company. Kerr then became the armoury's dominant figure and his revolver, together with a large number of rifles, were sold to the Confederate government which became the armoury's principal client.  With the fall of the Confederacy the fortunes of the company declined and it went into receivership in 1866.&lt;ref name="Graf2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graf|first=John F.|title=Standard Catalog of Civil War Firearms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXCIG7NDcmcC&amp;pg=PA187|date=11 March 2009|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola|isbn=1-4402-2696-2|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2014"/&gt;
 
Adams owned the rights to his revolver, which the London Armoury Company had only produced under license, and he now manufactured them in [[Birmingham]], with minor improvements keeping his revolvers in competition with other designs.

===John Adams===
In 1867, Robert Adams' brother John Adams patented a breech-loading revolver which was adopted by the British government in place of the Beaumont–Adams. It was a solid frame pistol with six chambers, in .450 caliber. After official acceptance of his pistol, Adams left the London Armoury Company and established his own factory, the Adams Patent Small Arms Company. His pistol was manufactured in three distinct variations (differences related mainly to methods of spent cartridge ejection) between 1867 and about 1880. The models were tested and adopted by the British Army and Navy, with the last, the M1872 Mark III, seeing the widest use.

The John Adams revolver remained the official sidearm of the British Army until replaced by the [[Enfield revolver|Enfield Mark I]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chamberlain | first = William Henry Jason | authorlink = |author2=A.

'''Selection''' is the stage of a [[genetic algorithm]] in which individual genomes are chosen from a population for later breeding (using the [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover operator]]).

A generic selection procedure may be implemented as follows:
#The [[fitness function]] is evaluated for each individual, providing fitness values, which are then normalized. Normalization means dividing the fitness value of each individual by the sum of all fitness values, so that the sum of all resulting fitness values equals 1.
#The population is sorted by descending fitness values.
#Accumulated normalized fitness values are computed:  the accumulated fitness value of an individual is the sum of its own fitness value plus the fitness values of all the previous individuals; the accumulated fitness of the last individual should be 1, otherwise something went wrong in the normalization step.
#A random number ''R'' between 0 and 1 is chosen.
#The selected individual is the last one whose accumulated normalized value is greater than or equal to ''R''.

For a large number of individuals the above algorithm might be computationally quite demanding. A simpler and faster alternative uses the so-called stochastic acceptance.

If this procedure is repeated until there are enough selected individuals, this selection method is called [[fitness proportionate selection]] or ''roulette-wheel selection''. If instead of a single pointer spun multiple times, there are multiple, equally spaced pointers on a wheel that is spun once, it is called [[stochastic universal sampling]].
Repeatedly selecting the best individual of a randomly chosen subset is [[tournament selection]]. Taking the best half, third or another proportion of the individuals is [[truncation selection]].

There are other selection algorithms that do not consider all individuals for selection, but only those with a fitness value that is higher than a given (arbitrary) constant. Other algorithms select from a restricted pool where only a certain percentage of the individuals are allowed, based on fitness value.

Retaining the best individuals in a generation unchanged in the next generation, is called ''elitism'' or ''elitist selection''. It is a successful (slight) variant of the general process of constructing a new population.

The '''Sharpeville massacre''' was an event which occurred on 21 March 1960, at the police station in the [[South Africa]]n [[township (South Africa)|township]] of [[Sharpeville]] in [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] (today part of [[Gauteng]]). 

After a day of demonstrations against [[pass laws]], a crowd of about 5,000 to 7,000  protesters went to the police station. The [[South African Police]] opened fire on the crowd, killing 69 people and injuring 180 others. Sources disagree as to the behaviour of the crowd; some state that the crowd was peaceful, while others state that the crowd had been hurling stones at the police, and that the shooting started when the crowd started advancing toward the fence around the police station. There were 249 casualties in total, including 29 children. Many sustained back injuries from being shot as they fled.&lt;ref name="Reeves"/&gt;

In present-day South Africa, 21 March is celebrated as a public holiday in honour of human rights and to commemorate the Sharpeville massacre.

[[File:Protestors discarding passbooks in South Africa.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators discarding their passbooks to protest apartheid, 1960]]
South African governments since the eighteenth century had enacted measures to restrict the flow of black South Africans into cities. Pass laws intended to control and direct their movement and employment were updated in the 1950s. Under the country's [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government, black residents in urban districts were subject to influx control measures. Individuals over sixteen were required to carry [[pass laws|passbooks]], which contained an identity card, employment and influx authorisation from a labour bureau, name of employer and address, and details of personal history.&lt;ref name="zastudy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Irving|title=Area Handbook for the Republic of South Africa|page=603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the Sharpeville massacre, the National Party administration under the leadership of Dr. [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] used these laws to enforce greater racial segregation&lt;ref name="TimeArticle"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Sharpeville Massacre | publisher=Time Magazine | date=4 April 1960 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869441-1,00.html | accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1959-1960, extended them to include women.&lt;ref name="TRCReport"&gt;{{cite book | title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report, Volume 3, Chapter 6 | date=28 October 1998 | pages=531–537 | url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/report/finalreport/Volume%203.pdf| accessdate=30 October 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.14,528}} From the 1960s, the pass laws were the primary instrument used by the state to detain and harass its political opponents.&lt;ref name="TRCReport"/&gt;{{rp|p.163}}

The [[African National Congress]] (ANC) prepared to initiate a campaign of protests against pass laws. These protests were to begin on 31 March 1960, but the rival [[Pan-Africanist Congress]] (PAC), led by [[Robert Sobukwe]], decided to pre-empt the ANC by launching its own campaign ten days earlier, on 21 March, because they believed that the ANC could not win the campaign.&lt;ref name="aboutArticle"&gt;{{cite web | last=Boddy-Evans | first=Alistair | title=Sharpeville Massacre, The Origin of South Africa's Human Rights Day | publisher=about.com | url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa-SharpevilleMassacre-a.htm | accessdate=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sowetan.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=1125732 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328210712/http://www.sowetan.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=1125732 |date=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massacre==

On March 21, a group of between 5,000 and 10,000 people converged on the local police station in the township of Sharpeville, offering themselves up for arrest for not carrying their passbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/sharpeville/menu.htm Remember Sharpeville] at South African History&lt;/ref&gt; The Sharpeville police were not completely unprepared for the demonstration, as they had already been forced to drive smaller groups of more militant activists away the previous night.&lt;ref name="vaque1989"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Charles C. |editor1-last=Thomas McGhee |editor2-first=N/A |editor2-last=N/A |title=The plot against South Africa |year=1989|edition=2nd |publisher=Varama Publishers |location=Pretoria |isbn=0-620-14537-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the civilians present attended to support the protest, but there is evidence that the PAC also used intimidating means to draw the crowd there, including the cutting of telephone lines into Sharpeville, the distribution of pamphlets telling people not to go to work on the day, and coercion of bus drivers and commuters.&lt;ref name="TRCReport" /&gt;{{rp|p.534}}

By 10:00, a large crowd had gathered, and the atmosphere was initially peaceful and festive. Fewer than 20 police officers were present in the station at the start of the protest. Later the crowd grew to about 20,000,&lt;ref name="TimeArticle"/&gt; and the mood was described as "ugly",&lt;ref name="TimeArticle"/&gt; prompting about 130 police reinforcements, supported by four [[Alvis Saracen|Saracen]] [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, to be rushed in. The police were armed with firearms, including [[Sten]] submachine guns and [[Lee–Enfield]] rifles. There was no evidence that anyone in the gathering was armed with anything other than rocks.&lt;ref name="TimeArticle"/&gt;

[[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] jets and [[North American T-6 Texan|Harvard Trainers]] approached to within a hundred feet of the ground, flying low over the crowd in an attempt to scatter it. The protesters responded by hurling stones (striking three policemen) and menacing the police barricades. Tear gas proved ineffectual, and policemen elected to repel these advances with their batons.&lt;ref name="vaque1989"/&gt; At about 13:00 the police tried to arrest a protestor, resulting in a scuffle, and the crowd surged forward.&lt;ref name="TimeArticle"/&gt; The shooting began shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="TimeArticle"/&gt;

===Death and injury toll===
The official figure is that 69 people were killed, including 8 women and 10 children, and 180 injured, including 31 women and 19 children. Many were shot in the back as they turned to flee, causing some to be paralyzed.&lt;ref name="Reeves"/&gt;

===Pretext for firing===
Police reports in 1960 claimed that young and inexperienced police officers panicked and opened fire spontaneously, setting off a chain reaction that lasted about forty seconds. It is likely that the police were nervous as two months before the massacre, nine constables had been assaulted and killed, some disembowelled, during a raid at [[Cato Manor]].&lt;ref name="vaque1989"/&gt; In addition, few of the policemen present had received public order training. Some of them had been on duty for over twenty-four hours without respite.&lt;ref name="vaque1989"/&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Pienaar, the commanding officer of the police reinforcements at Sharpeville, said in his revealing statement that "the native mentality does not allow them to gather for a peaceful demonstration. For them to gather means violence."&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;{{cite web | last=Reeves | first=Rt. Reverend Ambrose | title=The Sharpeville Massacre - A watershed in South Africa | publisher=sahistory.org.za | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/articles_papers/1960-sharpeville-massacre-rev-ambrose.html | accessdate=15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also denied giving any order to fire and stated that he would not have done so.

Other evidence given to the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] 38 years later in 1998 by two of the victims claimed "a degree of deliberation in the decision to open fire".&lt;ref name="TRCReport"/&gt;{{rp|p.537}}

==Response==
[[File:Murder at Sharpeville 21 March 1960.jpg|thumb|200px|Painting depicting victims of the massacre]]
The uproar among South Africa's black population was immediate, and the following week saw demonstrations, protest marches, strikes, and riots around the country. On 30 March 1960, the government declared a state of emergency, detaining more than 18,000 people, including prominent anti-apartheid activists who were known as members of the [[Congress Alliance]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A storm of international protest followed the Sharpeville shootings, including sympathetic demonstrations in many countries&lt;ref&gt;"Outside South Africa there were widespread reactions to Sharpeville in many countries which in many cases led to positive action against South Africa".&amp;mdash;Reeves Rt-Rev A.''[http://africanhistory.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/misc/shareve.html The Sharpeville Massacre--a Watershed in South Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719023626/http://africanhistory.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/misc/shareve.html |date=19 July 2012 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g., "[I]mmediately following the Sharpeville massacre in South Africa, over 1000 students demonstrated in Sydney against the apartheid system".&amp;mdash;Barcan A. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Student+activists+at+Sydney+University+1960-1967:+a+problem+of...-a0164112253 Student activists at Sydney University 1960-1967] in ''History of Education Review, 1 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and condemnation by the United Nations. On 1 April 1960, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 134|Resolution 134]]. Sharpeville marked a turning point in South Africa's history; the country found itself increasingly isolated in the international community. The event also played a role in South Africa's departure from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1961.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Sharpeville massacre contributed to the banning of the PAC and ANC as illegal organisations.  The massacre was one of the catalysts for a shift from [[passive resistance]] to [[armed resistance]] by these organisations. The foundation of [[Poqo]], the military wing of the PAC, and [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], the military wing of the ANC, followed shortly afterwards.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Not all reactions were negative: embroiled in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] voted a resolution supporting the [[South Africa|South African]] government "for its steadfast policy of segregation and the stanch adherence to their traditions in the face of overwhelming external agitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/04/15/page/14/article/what-they-commend-in-mississippi/index.html|title=What they commend in Mississippi|last=|first=|date=April 15, 1960|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=August 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720143751/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/04/15/page/14/article/what-they-commend-in-mississippi/index.html|archive-date=2017-07-20|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheCitizensCouncilvol.5No.7-9April-june1960/19-apr60-jun60#page/n0/mode/2up|title=South Africa Praised|last=|first=|date=April 1960|work=The Citizens' Council|access-date=August 14, 2017|issue=7|volume=5|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Since 1994, 21 March has been commemorated as [[Human Rights Day]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/acts/1994/a36-94.pdf |title=Public Holidays Act, Act No 36 of 1994 |publisher=Info.gov.za |date=2012-09-18 |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharpeville was the site selected by President [[Nelson Mandela]] for the signing into law of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] on 10 December 1996.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1998, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) found that the police actions constituted "gross human rights violations in that excessive force was unnecessarily used to stop a gathering of unarmed people."&lt;ref name="TRCReport"/&gt;{{rp|p.537}}

On 21 March 2002, the 42nd anniversary of the massacre, a memorial was opened by former President Nelson Mandela as part of the Sharpeville Human Rights Precinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://able.wiki.up.ac.za/index.php/Sharpeville_Memorial,_Theunis_Kruger_Street,_Dicksonville,_Sharpville |title=Sharpeville Memorial, Theunis Kruger Street, Dicksonville, Sharpville - ABLEWiki |publisher=Able.wiki.up.ac.za |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siming'''  ({{zh|c=司命|p=Sīmìng}}) refers to a Chinese deity or deified functionary of that title who makes fine adjustments to human [[fate]], with various English translations (such as, the Master of Fate, Controller of Fate, Deified Judge of Life, Arbiter of Fate, Director of Allotted Life Spans, and Director of Destinies). Siming is both an abstract deity (or title thereof) and a celestial [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]].

Siming, as Director of Destinies, has the bureaucratic function of human lifespan allocation. Siming seems to have roots in the shamanic traditions, then later to have somewhat assimilated with the [[Kitchen God]], as in the Daoist case of the [[Three Corpses|Three Worms]], in which Siming becomes a deity to whom home household activities are periodically reported,

As an asterism, or apparent stellar constellation, Siming is associated with the [[Wenchang Wang]] star pattern, near the [[Big Dipper]], in what is more or less [[Aquarius (Chinese astronomy)|Aquarius]].

Sometimes the term ''Siming'' is qualified by 大 (''da'', meaning "big" or "greater") or by 少 (''shao'', meaning "small" or "lesser").

==Siming (deity)==
[[File:元 佚名 倣趙孟頫 九歌圖 冊-Nine Songs MET DP375124.jpg|thumb|From an illustrated version of the ''[[Chuci]]'' poetry anthology section "Nine Songs" (''[[Jiu ge]]''), poem the "Greater Master of Fate"]]
The Siming deity has the bureaucratic function of human lifespan allocation. In bureaucratic terms, ''Si'' ([[wikt:司|司]]) is a common term, meaning "in charge of", "a person or department which is in charge of something", often translated as "secretary". Commonly, in real life or in imagined bureaucracies, there were Chief and Assistant Secretaries (''Dasi'' and ''Shaosi''). ''Ming'' ([[wikt:命|命]]) is a complicated word with a long folk and technical history, basically meaning "life" or "the balance of fate or destiny", personified as Siming. Often, a deified entity such as Siming receives increased sanctity over time, signified by additional official titles.

===Powers and duties===
As a deity Siming takes his, her, or their place in a complex cosmological system of Chinese religion and mythology. Over time, this system became a visualization of a complex cosmology including the elaboration of a heavenly bureaucracy, somewhat parallel to the earthly bureaucracy of the Chinese state, and invoking the same sort of explicit hierarchy.

Siming's special concern (and power) is the balancing of [[yin and yang]] (Hawkes 2011 (1985), 109). Of particular relevance here is the relation between yin and yang balance and human health, and the importance to individual human health of such balance, as articulated in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Siming has the power to balance or unbalance yin and yang, and thus to lengthen or shorten human lifespans, or to provide health or prolong illness.

===Three Deathbringers===
{{More|Three Corpses|Bigu (grain avoidance)|Chinese views on sin#Chinese_Buddhism}}
An idea from Daoism/traditional Chinese medicine relates to the Siming. Also known as the ''sanshi'' (三尸 "Three Corpses") or ''sanchong'' (三蟲 "Three Worms"), the Three Deathbringers are part of a Daoist physiological belief that demonic creatures live inside the human body, and they seek to hasten the death of their hosts. These three supernatural parasites allegedly enter the person at birth, and reside in the three [[dantian]] "energy centers" (head, chest, and abdomen). Succeeding the demise of their human host, they become free of the body as malevolent [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|"ghosts"]]. However, this process is regulated by Siming, who may or may not permit this process: in this regard, Siming is said to rely on the reports which the Three Deathbringers (and perhaps [[Kitchen God]]) provide on specifically regulated dates. Based on these reports, and perhaps other information, Siming alters the fine yin-yang balance of each individual, thus regulating each one's health or sickness, and ultimately each's lifespan. Nevertheless, humans are believed to have various recourses available to alter the judgement of Siming regarding their fates, such as interfering with the reporting process, praying to Siming or his superiors, or following treatment from a doctor to improve the yin-yang balance, and thus extend the lifespan.

===Zhuangzi and the skull===
{{More|Zhuangzi (book)}}

One of the early literary references to Siming as a deity is in a section of the book ''Zhuangzi'', from about 300 BCE  (莊子, 至樂: Zhuāngzǐ, Zhì lè).

One of the great literary figures of China, Zhou of the Zhuang family became known as Master Zhuang, Zhuangzi, to many subsequent generations. Living in about the 3rd century BCE, Zhuangzi's words and anecdotes have since become a central part of philosophy and culture around the globe. One anecdote, presumably relayed by the Master himself is that one day, while traveling down the road, he came upon a skull. After a prolonged and introspective session of speculation on what unhappy events had led to some unknown person's lack of proper burial, in such an inappropriate final resting spot: whose it had been and by what event the skull came to be lying here, abandoned by the wayside. Master Zhuang then became tired, and lay down to sleep, pillowing his head upon "Mr. Skull".  In his sleep, the skull came and lectured the Master upon the great tranquillity and happiness experienced by the dead. Zhuangzi retorted that he could petition Siming to use his or her powers over Fate and Destiny to restore the skull to be again a living human being, and then he or she could return to both hometown and family. The skull emphatically denies any such desire, and ends the encounter by rhetorically asking why anyone in such a state of unassailable happiness as experienced by the dead would ever wish give this up in exchange for suffering the vicissitudes of the living?

==Astronomical Siming==
{{Main|Aquarius (Chinese astronomy)}}
[[File:星象图.svg|thumb|Starmaps showing two Siming asterisms]]
In ancient times, astrology and astronomy were hardly distinguished. In China, on the one hand, there was the observation of phenomena in the sky, particularly trans-atmospheric phenomena: this observational study of experiential events became differentially known as [[Chinese astronomy]]. On the other hand, cerebral and emotional impulses lead to the development of a more philosophic, religious, and sometimes superstitious phenomenon known as [[Chinese astrology]]. It is worth emphasizing that the differentiation between the two is relatively modern. The astronomical [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] of [[Aquarius (Chinese astronomy)|Siming]] (itself, actually part of asterism 虛, "Emptiness") consist of the Deified Judge of Life star group. Sīmìngyī: ([[24 Aquarii]], 司命一) and Sīmìngèr ([[26 Aquarii]], 司命二); that is, Siming One and Siming Two. Astrological considerations appear to have had some influence on the assignment of names.

===Wenchang===
{{Main|Wenchang Wang}}
Wenchang Wang (Chinese: 文昌王), also known as Wenchang Dijun (Chinese: 文昌帝君), or simply as Wen Qu, or Wen, is a Taoist god of Culture and Literature. Literally he is King (王) of Flourishing (昌) Culture/Language (文). Wenchang Wang is physically represented by a constellation of six stars near the Big Dipper. The stars traditional names are: Shangjiang (上將), Cijiang (次將), Guixiang (貴相), Siming (司命), Sizhong (司中), and Silu (司祿). Wenchang Wang is often depicted as an elderly scholar accompanied by two attendants, Tianlong (天聾 or Heaven-Deaf) and Diya (地啞 or Earth-Mute). Wenchang has historically been called upon by scholars and writers who need inspiration or help right before an exam, in especial, traditionally, the [[Imperial examination]].

==Poetry==
[[File:元 佚名 倣趙孟頫 九歌圖 冊-Nine Songs MET DP375125.jpg|thumb|Illustrated version of the poem "Lesser Master of Fate", probably fourteenth century]]
The ancient poetry text ''[[Chu Ci]]'' features to Siming in two titles of the  ''[[Jiu Ge]]'' (Hawkes 2011 (1985), 95 and following, and 118 and following): the so-called "Greater Siming" and the "Lesser Siming". The ''[[Chuci]]'' poetry anthology (collected late BC - early BCE) has a section ''Nine Songs'' (''[[Jiu Ge]]''). To of its poems are titled "Greater Master of Fate" and "Lesser Master of Fate". The "Greater" and "Lesser" may refer to two different Siming deities, two aspects of the same deity (such as [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] and [[Chu (state)]] shamanic cult versions, both of which were prominent at the time the poems were collected and both of which listed Siming as a god), the greater and lesser may refer to the length of the poems, have some seasonal connotation, or perhaps there is some other explanation. (Hawkes 2011 (1985), 110)

==Pop culture==
Two Siming are found in ''[[The Legend of Qin (film)|The Legend of Qin]]'' film. There are a Greater Siming (大司命), appearing as the Priestess of Death and a Lesser Siming (少司命) as Priestess of Birth.

'''Systemic inflammatory response syndrome''' ('''SIRS''') is an [[inflammation|inflammatory state]] affecting the whole body. It is the body's response to an infectious or noninfectious insult. Although the definition of SIRS refers to it as an "inflammatory" response, it actually has pro- and anti-inflammatory components.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
SIRS is frequently complicated by failure of one or more organs or [[organ system]]s.&lt;ref name="accp"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rippe/&gt;&lt;ref name=marino/&gt; The complications of SIRS include:
* [[Acute lung injury]]
* [[Acute kidney injury]]
* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]
* [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]]

==Causes==
The causes of SIRS are broadly classified as infectious or noninfectious. Causes of SIRS include:
* [[Physical trauma|trauma]]
* [[burn (injury)|burns]]
* [[pancreatitis]]
* [[ischemia]]
* [[hemorrhage]]

Other causes include:&lt;ref name="accp"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rippe/&gt;&lt;ref name=marino/&gt;
* Complications of surgery
* [[Adrenal insufficiency]]
* [[Pulmonary embolism]]
* Complicated [[aortic aneurysm]]
* [[Cardiac tamponade]]
* [[Anaphylaxis]]
* Drug overdose

==Diagnosis==
===Definition===
{{SIRS}}
SIRS is a serious condition related to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and organ failure. It is a subset of [[cytokine storm]], in which there is abnormal regulation of various [[cytokine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Parson, Melissa, [http://www.aphon.org/files/public/JOPON_aug-sep10_Cytokine.pdf Cytokine Storm in the Pediatric Oncology Patient] (section "Differential Diagnoses and Workup", Journal of Peddanana is a good idea and is not the same tric Oncology Nursing, 27(5) Aug/Sep 2010, 253–258.&lt;/ref&gt; SIRS is also closely related to [[sepsis]], in which patients satisfy criteria for SIRS and have a suspected or proven infection.&lt;ref name="accp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rippe"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rippe, James M. |author2=Irwin, Richard S. |author3=Cerra, Frank B |title=Irwin and Rippe's intensive care medicine |publisher=Lippincott-Raven |location=Philadelphia |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-1425-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marino"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marino, Paul L. |title=The ICU book |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Baltimore |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-683-05565-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharma S, Steven M. Septic Shock. eMedicine.com, URL: http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic2101.htm Accessed on Nov 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experts consider SIRS to be overly sensitive, as nearly all (&gt;90%) of patients admitted to the ICU meet the SIRS criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Janet M., Mark J. Midwinter, Yen-Fu Chen, Antonio Belli, Karim Brohi, Elizabeth J. Kovacs, Leo Koenderman, Paul Kubes, and Richard J. Lilford. "The Systemic Immune Response to Trauma: An Overview of Pathophysiology and Treatment." The Lancet 384.9952 (2014): 1455-465. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adult SIRS Criteria ====
Manifestations of SIRS include, but are not limited to:
* [[Normal human body temperature|Body temperature]] less than 36&amp;nbsp;°C (96.8&amp;nbsp;°F) or greater than 38&amp;nbsp;°C (100.4&amp;nbsp;°F)
* [[Heart rate]] greater than 90 beats per minute
* [[Tachypnea]] (high respiratory rate), with greater than 20 breaths per minute; or, an arterial [[partial pressure]] of [[carbon dioxide]] less than 4.3 kPa (32 mmHg)
* [[Leukocytes|White blood cell count]] less than 4000 cells/mm³ (4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cells/L) or greater than 12,000 cells/mm³ (12 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cells/L); or the presence of greater than 10% [[immature neutrophil]]s (band forms). Band forms greater than 3% is called [[bandemia]] or a "left-shift."

When two or more of these criteria are met with or without evidence of infection, patients may be diagnosed with "SIRS." Patients with SIRS and acute organ dysfunction may be termed "severe SIRS."&lt;ref name="rippe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marino" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tsiotou"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsiotou AG, Sakorafas GH, Anagnostopoulos G, Bramis J |title=Septic shock; current pathogenetic concepts from a clinical perspective |journal=Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=RA76–85 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15735579 |doi= |url=http://www.medscimonit.com/fulltxt.php?ICID=15400}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note: Fever and an [[leukocytosis|increased white blood cell count]] are features of the [[acute-phase reaction]], while an [[tachycardia|increased heart rate]] is often the initial sign of hemodynamic compromise. An [[Tachypnea|increased rate of breathing]] may be related to the increased metabolic stress due to infection and inflammation, but may also be an ominous sign of inadequate [[perfusion]] resulting in the onset of anaerobic cellular metabolism.

==== Pediatric SIRS Criteria ====
The International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus has proposed some changes to adapt these criteria to the pediatric population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vritdraugija.lt/index_files/DODS%20kriterijai%20(PCCM%202005).pdf Brahm Goldstein et al., International pediatric sepsis consensus,]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ''[[Pediatric Critical Care Medicine]]'' 2005 Vol. 6, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In children, the SIRS criteria are modified in the following fashion:&lt;ref name="pmid15636651"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldstein B, Giroir B, Randolph A |title=International pediatric sepsis consensus conference: definitions for sepsis and organ dysfunction in pediatrics |journal= [[Pediatric Critical Care Medicine]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=2–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15636651 |doi=10.1097/01.PCC.0000149131.72248.E6 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1529-7535&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Heart rate]] is greater than 2 [[standard deviations]] above normal for age in the absence of stimuli such as pain and drug administration, or unexplained persistent elevation for greater than 30 minutes to 4 hours. In infants, also includes [[heart rate]] less than 10th percentile for age in the absence of [[Vagus nerve|vagal stimuli]], [[beta-blockers]], or [[congenital heart disease]] or unexplained persistent depression for greater than 30 minutes.
* [[Body temperature]] obtained orally, rectally, from [[Foley catheter]] probe, or from [[central venous catheter]] probe less than 36&amp;nbsp;°C or greater than 38.5&amp;nbsp;°C. 
* [[Respiratory rate]] greater than 2 [[standard deviations]] above normal for age or the requirement for [[mechanical ventilation]] not related to neuromuscular disease or the administration of [[anesthesia]].
* [[White blood cell]] count elevated or depressed for age not related to chemotherapy, or greater than 10% bands plus other immature forms.
Temperature or white blood cell count must be abnormal to qualify as SIRS in pediatric patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Brahm|last2=Giroir|first2=Brett|last3=Randolph|first3=Adrienne|last4=International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis|date=January 2005|title=International pediatric sepsis consensus conference: definitions for sepsis and organ dysfunction in pediatrics|journal=Pediatric Critical Care Medicine: A Journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–8|doi=10.1097/01.PCC.0000149131.72248.E6|issn=1529-7535|pmid=15636651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional Information ====
SIRS was first described by Dr. William R. Nelson, of the University of Toronto, in a presentation to the Nordic Micro Circulation meeting in Geilo, Norway in February 1983. There was intent to encourage a definition which dealt with the multiple (rather than a single) etiologies associated with organ dysfunction and failure following a [[Shock (circulatory)|hypotensive shock]] episode.  The active pathways leading to such pathophysiology may include [[fibrin]] deposition, [[Platelet#Adhesion and aggregation|platelet aggregation]], [[Coagulopathy|coagulopathies]] and [[leukemoid reaction|leukocyte liposomal release]].  The implication of such a definition suggests that recognition of the activation of one such pathway is often indicative of that additional pathophysiologic processes are also active and that these pathways are synergistically destructive. The clinical condition may lead to [[renal failure]], [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]], [[central nervous system]] dysfunction and possible [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].

Criteria for SIRS were established in 1992 as part of the [[American College of Chest Physicians]]/[[Society of Critical Care Medicine]] Consensus Conference.&lt;ref name="accp"/&gt; The conference concluded that the manifestations of SIRS include, but are not limited to the first four described above under adult SIRS critera.

In septic patients, these clinical signs can also be seen in other proinflammatory conditions, such as trauma, burns, pancreatitis, etc. A follow-up conference therefore decided to define the patients with a documented or highly suspicious infection that results in a systemic inflammatory response as having sepsis.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levy MM, Fink MP, Marshall JC, Abraham E, Angus D, Cook D, Cohen J, Opal SM, Vincent JL, Ramsay G |title=2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference |journal=Crit Care Med |date=Apr 2003 |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=1250–1256 |url=http://www.ccmjournal.com/pt/re/ccm/abstract.00003246-200304000-00038.htm |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000050454.01978.3B |pmid=12682500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that SIRS criteria are non-specific,&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levy MM, Fink MP, Marshall JC, Abraham E, Angus D, Cook D, Cohen J, Opal SM, Vincent JL, Ramsay G |title=2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference |journal=Crit Care Med |date=Apr 2003 |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=1250–1256 |url=http://www.ccmjournal.com/pt/re/ccm/abstract.00003246-200304000-00038.htm |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000050454.01978.3B |pmid=12682500}}&lt;/ref&gt; and must be interpreted carefully within the clinical context. These criteria exist primarily for the purpose of more objectively classifying critically ill patients so that future clinical studies may be more rigorous and more easily reproducible.

==Treatment==
Generally, the treatment for SIRS is directed towards the underlying problem or inciting cause (i.e. adequate fluid replacement for hypovolemia, IVF/[[Nil per os|NPO]] for pancreatitis, epinephrine/steroids/[[diphenhydramine]] for anaphylaxis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Treatment &amp; Management|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/168943-treatment|publisher=Mescape}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Selenium]], [[glutamine]], and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] have shown effectiveness in improving symptoms in clinical trials.&lt;ref name="pmid17713413"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berger MM, Chioléro RL |title=Antioxidant supplementation in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=35 |issue=9 Suppl |pages=S584–90 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17713413 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000279189.81529.C4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rinaldi|first=S |author2=Landucci, F |author3=De Gaudio, AR|title=Antioxidant therapy in critically septic patients|journal=Current drug targets|date=September 2009|volume=10|issue=9|pages=872–80|pmid=19799541|doi=10.2174/138945009789108774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other antioxidants such as [[vitamin E]] may be helpful as well.&lt;ref name="pmid12578114"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulger EM, Maier RV |title=An argument for Vitamin E supplementation in the management of systemic inflammatory response syndrome |journal=Shock |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=99–103 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12578114 |doi= 10.1097/00024382-200302000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Septic treatment protocol and diagnostic tools have been created due to the potentially severe outcome septic shock. For example, the SIRS criteria were created as mentioned above to be extremely sensitive in suggesting which patients may have sepsis. However, these rules lack specificity, i.e. not a true diagnosis of the condition, but rather a suggestion to take necessary precautions. The SIRS criteria are guidelines set in place to ensure septic patients receive care as early as possible.&lt;ref name="bone"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bone RC, Balk RA, Cerra FB, Dellinger RP, Fein AM, Knaus WA, Schein RM, Sibbald WJ |title=Definitions for sepsis and organ failure and guidelines for the use of innovative therapies in sepsis.

In cases caused by an implanted mesh, removal (explantation) of the polypropylene surgical mesh implant may be indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emergency abdominal wall reconstruction with polypropylene mesh: short-term benefits versus long-term complications|pmc=1345243|year=1981|last1=Voyles|first1=CR|last2=Richardson|first2=JD|last3=Bland|first3=KI|last4=Tobin|first4=GR|last5=Flint|first5=LM|last6=Polk Jr|first6=HC|volume=194|issue=2|pages=219–223|journal=Annals of Surgery|doi=10.1097/00000658-198108000-00017|pmid=6455099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept history==
The concept of SIRS was first conceived of and presented by Dr. William R. Nelson, of the Department of Surgery of the [[University of Toronto]] at the Nordic Micro Circulation meeting in 1983. The presentation followed a decade of research with colleagues including; Dr. J. Vaage of the [[University of Oslo]], Norway, Dr. D. Bigger, the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Dr. D. Sepro of [[Boston University]], and  Dr. H. Movat of the Department of Pathology at the University of Toronto. The laboratory experience was borne out in the clinical setting with Canada's first trauma unit for which Nelson was a co-founder. This allowed in the mid 1980s, the concepts of SIRS to be taught by Dr. Miles Johnson of the university of Toronto, Department of Pathology at the undergraduate dental school, as well as to residents in the Department of Surgery of the University of Toronto who rotated through the Regional Trauma Unit at Sunnybrook Medical Center. SIRS was more broadly adopted in 1991 at the American College of Chest Physicians/[[Society of Critical Care Medicine]] Consensus Conference with the goal of aiding in the early detection of [[sepsis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1065037&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of tachyaerobic muscles is important to animals such as [[giraffes]] that need blood circulated through a large body size quickly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1729">A '''technical file''' is a set of documents that describes a product and can prove that the product was designed and according to the requirements of a quality management system.

All products that have a [[CE marking|CE mark]] must have a technical file which must contain the information that proves that the product conforms with the [[EU]] directives for CE-marked products. EU enforcement authorities may demand a copy of the technical file for many years after the last product was made. Customers do not usually have access to the technical file.

A technical file is usually based on a document archive system that ensures longevity of documents and can either be on paper or in electronic files. One document may be named "technical file" and list all other documents that are considered part of the technical file.

A technical file includes drawings, specifications, reports, review records, meeting minutes, labels, instructions for use, software source code, etc.

The sub-clause 4.2.3 of ISO 13485:2016 requires a manufacturer of a [[medical device]] to establish a technical file (medical device file).

'''''The Man Who Came Back''''' is a 2008 American film directed by [[Glen Pitre]]. It stars [[Eric Braeden]], [[Billy Zane]], [[George Kennedy]], and [[Armand Assante]]. Set in southern Louisiana, it is loosely based on the 1887 sugar strike in four parishes and violence that erupted in the [[Thibodaux Massacre]].

==Plot==
''The Man Who Came Back'' is loosely based on the [[Thibodaux massacre]]. This was the culmination of the largest strike in the sugar cane industry, when 10,000 workers stopped labor, and the first to be conducted by a formal labor organization, the [[Knights of Labor]]. With an estimated 50 or more African-American cane workers killed by white [[paramilitary]] forces, it was the second bloodiest [[labor strike]] in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nola.com/michaelkleinschrodt/2008/12/brutal_man_who_came_back_is_an.html|title=Brutal 'Man Who Came Back' is an unsatisfying story of revenge from Louisiana filmmaker Glen Pitre|work=Michael Kleinschrodt|accessdate=June 19, 2016|date=December 4, 2008|first=Michael|last=Kleinschrodt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Reconstruction and white Democrats regaining control of the state government, in the late 1880s, freedmen worked hard on sugar cane plantations but were bound by many of the planters' practices. They were sometimes paid only in [[scrip]], redeemable only at the plantation's overpriced store, and the workers struggled to get out of debt and be able to leave a plantation.

In an attempt to better their lives, the workers strike. This leads to massive retaliation by the most powerful men in the town, including the sheriff ([[Armand Assante]]), the preacher ([[Al Hayter]]), power-hungry Billy Duke ([[James Patrick Stuart]]), and his vigilante group of thugs.

White overseer Reese Paxton ([[Eric Braeden]]) steps up to demand justice for his workers. Duke's rage turns on Paxton and his family. Despite assistance from a Yankee attorney ([[Billy Zane]]), Paxton is convicted in a trial presided by Judge Duke ([[George Kennedy]]), Billy's father.

After being sent to prison, beaten within inches of his life, and enduring emotional torture, Paxton "comes back" to seek revenge.

The '''Tree of Knowledge''' is a heritage-listed tree in Oak Street, [[Barcaldine, Queensland|Barcaldine]], [[Barcaldine Region]], [[Queensland]], Australia. The town was the headquarters of the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]] and the 1892 reading of the Labour Party manifesto leading to the formation of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP). It was a 200-year-old ''[[Corymbia aparrerinja]]'' ghost gum.&lt;ref name=asgap&gt;{{cite web|title=Eucalypts but not Eucalyptus|url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL2/jun96-5.html|author=Walters, Brian|work=Australian Plants Online|publisher=Australian Native Plants Society|accessdate=30 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530230417/http://anpsa.org.au/APOL2/jun96-5.html |archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992.&lt;ref name="qhr"&gt;{{cite QHR|14796|Tree of Knowledge|600021|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Tree of Knowledge is a [[ghost gum]] located in front of the [[Barcaldine railway station, Queensland|Barcaldine railway station]] under which the workers of the 1891 Shearer's Strike met. An icon of the Labor Party and Trades Unions, it symbolises the foundation of the organised representation of labour in Queensland.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Barcaldine sprang up in 1886 as the terminus of the [[Central Western railway line, Queensland|Central Western railway]]. The area was already settled by [[Pastoral farming|pastoralists]] and had previously been centred on [[Blackall, Queensland|Blackall]]. Large sheep stations were like small townships with their own working facilities, stores, worker's accommodation and tradesmen such as blacksmiths. The owners and managers of these stations had considerable power to dictate terms to an itinerant workforce of [[Sheep shearer|sheep shearers]] recruited for the shearing season. Poor working conditions, low pay and the threat of competition from cheap foreign labour caused discontent within the industry.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Barcaldine was a natural focus for the development of unionism. As the railhead, the town drew many seasonal and casual workers. Besides shearers and hands there were navvies who had worked on the construction of the railway and carriers who had found their work reduced by it. Difficulties in finding work and financial hardship helped to build a sense of mateship and mutual support amongst sections of them. In 1887 the Central Queensland Carriers Union was formed, and discussions leading up to this are said to have been held under the gum tree which provided shade where carriers waited at the front of the railway station. At the same time, the [[Queensland Shearers Union|Queensland Shearers' Union]] was formed at Blackall. Within a year it had 1300 members, indicating a perceived need for collective bargaining to obtain fair pay and working conditions. In 1888 the Central Queensland Labourers' Union was formed at Barcaldine. These three unions were the driving force behind the strike of 1891.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

In [[Brisbane]], the [[Trades and Labour Council of Queensland|Trades and Labour Council]] was formed in 1885 and in 1889 became the [[Australian Labour Federation]]. At Barcaldine in the same year the Pastoral Employers' Association was founded in response and moved to reduce pay rates. Many workers now joined the unions, pushing membership of the Shearers Union over 3000 and the Labourer's Union to 2,250. Only severe wet weather in 1890 delayed a confrontation. By January 1891 union representatives had gathered at Barcaldine for meetings and pastoralists were pressing shearers to sign freedom of contract forms. A [[Strike action|strike]] was called and employers began to import non-union labour from the south. Strikers, some of whom were armed, gathered at Barcaldine and set up a camp at Lagoon Creek and other places around the town.&lt;ref name="herqldout"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage Trails of the Queensland Outback|last=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland)]]|publisher=State of Queensland|year=2002|isbn=0-7345-1040-3|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The [[Queensland Government]] dispatched police and soldiers to the area and the strikers responded by [[Military parade|drilling]] and staging [[Torchlight procession|torchlight processions]] in the town. As the non-union labour, police and soldiers usually arrived by rail, strikers would rally outside the railway station to block their arrival and protest. Consequently, the tree in front of the station, the Tree of Knowledge, was the location of many meetings and a focus for protest.&lt;ref name="herqldout" /&gt; In March 1891 the situation escalated as carriers and railway workers [[Solidarity action|went out in sympathy]] and military reinforcements arrived. Barcaldine became the focus of the whole country's interest and armed conflict was expected. However, heavy rain which limited movement and the arrest of leaders slowed momentum and strikers began to disperse. On 15 June the strike was officially called off. It had failed, but was to have far reaching effects. The following year, [[T. J. Ryan|T.J. Ryan]] became the first representative of labour to be elected to the [[Queensland Parliament]]. In 1892, at the foot of the tree, the Manifesto of the Queensland Labour Party dated 9 September 1892 was read out, leading to the formation of the Labor Party in Queensland.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magsq.com.au/01_cms/details.asp?ID=312|title=UNESCO First for State Library of Queensland|publisher=Museum &amp; Gallery Services Queensland|work=Industry News|accessdate=24 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325004534/http://www.magsq.com.au/01_cms/details.asp?ID=312|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto is considered one of the foundation documents of the current [[Australian Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/2008/06/24/manifesto-of-the-queensland-labour-party-recognised-nationally/|title=Manifesto of the Queensland Labour Party recognised nationally|last=|first=|date=24 June 2008|website=|publisher=[[State Library of Queensland]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325061224/http://blogs.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/2008/06/24/manifesto-of-the-queensland-labour-party-recognised-nationally/|archive-date=25 March 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the area beneath the Tree of Knowledge was the scene of actions and decisions which had a profound effect on the future of labour and politics in Australia, it has become an icon of the Labor Party and Trades Unions. It is also important to the people of Barcaldine as a symbol of the town's identity and historical importance. This is reflected by the name chosen for the commemoration committee formed in 1987, the Tree of Knowledge Development Committee, and by the care given to the tree. In 1990 it was discovered that the tree was infested by termites and other insects and had severe health problems. Treatment by a tree surgeon, pest control and flushing of the root system with thousands of litres of water gave the tree a new lease of life. This treatment was completed in late 1993.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

In 1991, there were major celebrations at Barcaldine to mark the centenary of the Shearers' Strike. In preparation for this, the area around the tree was landscaped and a memorial to the strikers erected within the enclosure.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

In 2006, in an act of [[vandalism]], the tree was poisoned with [[glyphosate]] (a main ingredient in the [[herbicide]] [[RoundUp]]). An [[arborist]] declared the tree dead on 3 October 2006. The ALP offered a reward of A$10,000 for any information that would help identify those responsible.

The remains of the tree were removed on 29 July 2007. According to a Queensland Government release&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=55477 Tree of knowledge receiving world-class the treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122533/http://www.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=55477 |date=6 July 2011 }}. 4 December 2007.

Tim Mulherin.&lt;/ref&gt; the tree is undergoing a process of wood preservation and the remains of the tree – {{convert|7|m}} tall and {{convert|2|m}} across – are being transferred to a special preservation facility. In 2008 the tree was successfully [[Cloning|cloned]] in by workers at the former [[Queensland Department of Primary Industries]].&lt;ref name="tkc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/30/2231010.htm|title=Tree of Knowledge cloned|date=30 April 2008|work=[[ABC News Online]]|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|author=Chrissy Arthur|accessdate=30 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414051723/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/30/2231010.htm|archivedate=14 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cuttings propagated from the tree before its death are now growing in Barcaldine. A clone of the tree has also been planted at the Ecosciences Precinct in Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=77857 'Last' Tree of Knowledge finds home at Ecosciences Precinct]. 27 November 2011.

== Description ==
{{Update section|date=March 2017}}
The Tree of Knowledge is a ghost gum ([[Corymbia aparrerinja]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL2/jun96-5.html|title=Eucalypts...but not Eucalyptus|website=anpsa.org.au|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530230417/http://anpsa.org.au/APOL2/jun96-5.html |archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) situated outside the railway station in the main street of Barcaldine. Early photographys show a wider canopy than existed at the time of the tree's demise. At the foot of the tree is a plaque which says:&lt;blockquote&gt;This plaque commemorates the loyalty, courage, and sacrifice in 1891 of the stalwart men and women of the west from whom, beneath this tree, emerged Australia's labour and political movement.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Tree of Knowledge is protected by a modern metal fence and the area surrounding it is bordered by a low rail composed of evenly spaced lengths of log and is landscaped with flowering shrubs. This area also contains a flagpole and a bronze and granite monument symbolising shear blades which was erected in 1991 to commemorate the centenary of the Shearer's Strike.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Tree of Knowledge was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

When that occurs, the fossil is described as a "[[derived fossil|reworked fossil]]" or ''remanié''.
