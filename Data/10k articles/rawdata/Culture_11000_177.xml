'''[[Literature]] of the 18th century''' refers to [[world literature]] produced during the 18th century.

==European literature in the 18th century==
{{History of literature by region or country}}
[[European literature]] of the 18th century refers to literature (poetry, drama, satire, and novels) produced in Europe during this period. The 18th century saw the development of the [[modern novel]] as literary genre, in fact many [[First novel in English|candidates for the first novel in English]] date from this period, of which [[Daniel Defoe]]'s 1719 ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' is probably the best known. Subgenres of the novel during the 18th century were the [[epistolary novel]], the [[sentimental novel]], [[Histories (history of the novel)|histories]], the [[gothic novel]] and the [[libertine novel]].

18th Century Europe started in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and gradually moved towards [[Romanticism#Art and literature|Romanticism]]. In the visual arts, it was the period of [[Neoclassicism]].

=== The Enlightenment ===
The 18th century in Europe was The Age of Enlightenment and literature explored themes of social upheaval, reversals of personal status, political satire, geographical exploration and the comparison between the supposed natural state of man and the supposed civilized state of man. [[Edmund Burke]], in his ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]'' (2000), says: ''"The Fabrick of Superstition has in this our Age and Nation received much ruder Shocks than it had ever felt before; and through the Chinks and Breaches of our Prison, we see such Glimmerings of Light, and feel such refreshing Airs of Liberty, as daily raise our Ardor for more."research by Shema Leon Patrick

== English Literature in the Eighteenth Century by Year ==
===1700–09===
In 1700, [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s play ''[[The Way of the World]]'' premiered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/wwrld10.txt Full text], gutenberg project, retrieved on 17-03-2012&lt;/ref&gt; Although unsuccessful at the time, ''The Way of the World'' is a good example of the sophistication of theatrical thinking during this period, with complex [[subplot]]s and characters intended as ironic parodies of common [[stereotype]]s.

In 1703, [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s domestic drama ''The Fair Penitent'', an adaptation of [[Massinger]] and [[Nathan Field|Field]]'s ''Fatal Dowry'', appeared; it would later be pronounced by [[Dr Johnson]] to be one of the most pleasing tragedies in the language. Also in 1703 [[Sir Richard Steele]]'s comedy ''The Tender Husband'' achieved some success.

In 1704, [[Jonathan Swift]] (Irish satirist) published ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'' and ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/battle.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] published his ''Grounds of Criticism in Poetry''. ''The Battle of the Books'' begins with a reference to the use of a glass (which, in those days, would mean either a [[mirror]] or a [[magnifying glass]]) as a comparison to the use of satire. Swift is, in this, very much the child of his age, thinking in terms of [[science]] and [[satire]] at one and the same time. Swift often patterned his satire after Juvenal, the classical satirist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Satire#Classifications of satire]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first English novelists and also a political campaigner. His satirical writing springs from a body of liberal thought which produced not only books but also political pamphlets for public distribution. Swift's writing represents the new, the different and the modern attempting to change the world by parodying the ancient and incumbent. ''The Battle of the Books'' is a short writing which demonstrates his position very neatly.

In 1707, [[Henry Fielding]] was born (22 April) and his sister [[Sarah Fielding]] was born 3 years later on 8 November 1710. In 1711, [[Alexander Pope]] began a career in literature with the publishing of his ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]''. In 1712, [[French people|French]] [[philosophy|philosophical]] writer [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] born 28 June and his countryman [[Denis Diderot]] was born the following year 1713 on 5 October.  Also in 1712 Pope published ''The Rape of the Lock'' and in 1713 ''Windsor Forest''.

In 1708, [[Simon Ockley]] publishes an [[English language|English]] translation of [[Ibn Tufail]]'s ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'', a 12th-century [[philosophical novel]], as ''The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan''. This was the first English translation directly from the [[Arabic literature|Arabic original]].

''The Beggar's Opera'' began a new style in Opera, the "ballad opera" which brings the operatic form down to a more popular level and precedes the genre of comic [[operetta]]s. Also in 1728 came the publication of ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]], or, A Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences''  (folio, 2 vols.), an encyclopedia by [[Ephraim Chambers]]. The Cyclopaedia was one of the first general encyclopedias to be produced in English and was the main model for [[Diderot]]'s  ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (published in France between 1751 and 1766).

In 1729, Jonathan Swift published ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', a satirical suggestion that [[Irish people|Irish]] families should sell their children as food. Swift was, at this time, fully involved in political campaigning for the Irish.

===1730–39===
In 1731, [[George Lillo]]'s play ''The London Merchant'' was a success at the Theatre-Royal in [[Drury Lane]]. It was a new kind of play, a domestic tragedy, which approximates to what later came to be called a [[melodrama]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADHO's constituent organizations are the European Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://eadh.org/ European Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (EADH), the Association for Computers and the Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://ach.org/ Association for Computers and the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (ACH), the Canadian Society for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://csdh-schn.org/ Canadian Society for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (CSDH/SCHN), centerNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/ centerNet]&lt;/ref&gt; the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa-dh.org/ Australasian Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (aaDH), the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jadh.org/ Japanese Association for Digital Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; (JADH) and Humanistica,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanisti.ca Humanistica]&lt;/ref&gt; the french-speaking association for Digital Humanities.

==History==
The effort to establish the alliance began in [[Tübingen]], Germany, at the ALLC/ACH conference in 2002: a steering committee was appointed at the ALLC/ACH meeting in 2004, in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, and the executive committees of the ACH and [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]]  (ALLC) approved the governance and conference protocols at the 2005 meeting in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], Canada. 
The [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]] was also included.&lt;ref name="Unsworth" /&gt;
In 2007, the Alliance Steering Committee voted to enfranchise [[Society for Digital Humanities|The Society for Digital Humanities / Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs]] (SDH/SEMI) of Canada.
In 2012,  centerNet, a network of digital humanities centers, became a "constituent organization" affiliated with ADHO,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= centerNet to join ADHO |date= August 17, 2011 |work= ADHO centerNet blog |url= http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/2011/08/centernet-to-join-adho |accessdate = October 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities in 2013 and the French-speaking Association for Digital Humanities, Humanistica, in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Humanistica rejoint officiellement ADHO |date= July 15, 2016 |work= Humanistica website |url= http://www.humanisti.ca/humanistica-adho/ |accessdate = July 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ADHO gained legal status as the Stichting ADHO Foundation (Netherlands) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bedrijfnederland.nl/zuid-holland/den-haag/stichting-adho-foundation Stichting ADHO Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applied linguistics''' is an interdisciplinary field of linguistics which identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied [[linguistics]] are [[education]], [[psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication research]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]].

{{Linguistics}}

== Domain ==
Applied linguistics is an [[interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary field]] of linguistics. Major branches of applied linguistics include [[bilingualism]] and [[multilingualism]], [[conversation analysis]], [[contrastive linguistics]], [[Sign language#Linguistics of sign|sign linguistics]], [[language assessment]], [[literacy|literacies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[language pedagogy]], [[second language acquisition]], [[language planning]] and [[language policy|policy]], [[interlinguistics]], [[stylistics (literature)|stylistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[forensic linguistics]] and [[translation]].

== Journals ==
Major journals of the field include ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]'', ''Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''European Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''Issues in Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]]'', ''Language and Education, TESOL Quarterly'', and ''Linguistics and Education''.

== History ==
The tradition of applied linguistics established itself in part as a response to the narrowing of focus in linguistics with the advent in the late 1950s of [[generative linguistics]], and has always maintained a socially-accountable role, demonstrated by its central interest in language problems.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the field of applied linguistics started from Europe and the United States, the field rapidly flourished in the international context.

Applied linguistics first concerned itself with principles and practices on the basis of linguistics. In the early days, applied linguistics was thought as “linguistics-applied” at least from the outside of the field. In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment, [[language policy]], and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than [[theoretical linguistics]], including the solution of language-related problems in the real world. By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to  "the theoretical and empirical investigation of real world problems in which language is a central issue."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Brumfit. How applied linguistics is the same as any other science, "International Journal of Applied Linguistics", 7(1), 86-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, applied linguistics also began narrowly as the application of insights from structural linguistics—first to the teaching of English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The ''linguistics applied'' approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who developed the foundation for the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1941. In 1946, Applied linguistics became a recognized field of studies in the aforementioned university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/applied-linguistics|title=Applied Linguistics {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established ''Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics'', the first journal to bear the term ''applied linguistics.'' In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Margie Berns and Paul Kei Matsuda. 2006. Applied linguistics: Overview and history. In K. Brown (Ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of language and linguistics'' (2nd ed.), 398-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==
The [[International Association of Applied Linguistics]] was founded in France in 1964, where it is better known as Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée, or AILA. AILA has affiliates in more than thirty countries, some of which are listed below.

'''Australia'''
Australian applied linguistics took as its target the applied linguistics of mother tongue teaching and teaching English to immigrants. The Australia tradition shows a strong influence of continental Europe and of the USA, rather than of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (ALAA) was established at a national congress of applied linguists held in August 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alaa.org.au/ | title = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (home page) | date = September 2011 | publisher = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALAA holds a joint annual conference in collaboration with the Association for Applied Linguistics in New Zealand (ALANZ).

'''Canada'''
The Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics / L’Association canadienne de linguistique appliquée (CAAL/ACLA), is an officially bilingual (English and French) scholarly association with approximately 200 members. They produce the ''Canadian Journal of Applied Linguistics'' and hold an annual conference.&lt;ref name="ACLA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.aclacaal.org/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ireland'''
The [[Irish Association for Applied Linguistics]]/Cumann na Teangeolaíochta Feidhmí (IRAAL) was founded in 1975. They produce the journal ''Teanga'', the Irish word for 'language'.&lt;ref name="IRAAL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Association for Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.iraal.ie/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japan'''
In 1982, the Japan Association of Applied Linguistics (JAAL) was established in the Japan Association of College English Teachers (JACET) in order to engage in activities on a more international scale. In 1984, JAAL became an affiliate of the International Association of Applied Linguistics (AILA).[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202550/http://www.jacet.org/about-e.html]

'''New Zealand'''
The Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand (ALANZ) produces the journal ''New Zealand Studies in Applied Linguistics'' and has been collaborating with the Applied Linguistics Association of Australia in a combined annual conference since 2010, with the Association for Language Testing and Assessment of Australia and New Zealand (ALTAANZ) later joining the now three-way conference collaboration.&lt;ref name="ALANZ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand| url=http://alanz.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''South Africa'''
The Southern African Applied Linguistics Association (SAALA) was founded in 1980. There are currently four publications associated with SAALA including the ''Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies Journal'' (SAJALS).&lt;ref name="SAALA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern African Applied Linguistics Association| url=http://www.saala.org.za/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''
The [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]] (BAAL) was established in 1967. Its mission is "the advancement of education by fostering and promoting, by any lawful charitable means, the study of language use, language acquisition and language teaching and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration in this study [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.baal.org.uk/constitution.pdf | title = British Association for Applied Linguistics constitution | at = Paragraph 3: "Objects" | work = Public Documents  | date = September 2011  | publisher = British Association for Applied Linguistics | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAAL hosts an annual conference, as well as many additional smaller conferences and events organised by its Special Interest Groups (SIGs). 

'''United States'''
The [[American Association for Applied Linguistics]] (AAAL) was founded in 1977. AAAL holds an annual conference, usually in March or April, in the United States or Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2628">The '''Law 1420 of General Common Education''' of [[Argentina]] was a landmark national [[law]] that dictated public, compulsory, free, and [[secular education]]. It was passed in 1884 during the administration of [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Julio Argentino Roca]], after a number of similar laws of [[provinces of Argentina|provincial]] scope and the conclusions of the Pedagogical Congress of 1882.

The nonreligious [[education]] mandated by the law was controversial and caused a conflict between the [[Argentine government]] and the [[Catholic Church]]. The [[Pope|Papal]] [[Nuncio]], Luis Mattera, spoke against the law.

The government replied that Mattera was free to expose his ideas privately but not to interfere in government matters. Mattera tried to stop the arrival of school teachers hired by the Argentine authorities in the [[United States]] for the direction of public secular establishments. Opposition to the law came also from priests' [[sermon]]s, Church newspapers, documents by [[bishop]]s, and [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] supported by the clergy.

When the first Normal School was established in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], the Capitular Vicar, Gerónimo Clara, and priests denounced it from the pulpits as [[anathema]]. Clara was arrested and charged by the national authorities.

Mattera spoke to the head of the school and asked for a number of conditions to be met, including the teaching of the Catholic religion in the establishment. Those requirements were conveyed to the provincial government and, in turn, to the national authorities, which rejected them as interference by a foreign agent. Mattera ended up apologizing through a particular missive to Roca.

A '''bachelorette party''', '''hen(s) party''', '''hen(s) night''' or '''hen(s) do''', is a party held for a [[woman]] who is about to get [[Marriage|married]]. The terms ''hen party'', ''hen do'' or ''hen night'' are used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Canada]], while the terms ''hens party'' or ''hens night'' are common in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and the term ''bachelorette party'' is common in the [[United States]]. The term '''stagette''' is occasionally used in Canada.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-541816-6"&gt;{{cite book
|editor= Barber, Katherine|title=Canadian Oxford dictionary|edition=2|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|year=2004|isbn=0-19-541816-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be referred to as a ''girls' night out'' or ''kitchen tea'' ([[South Africa]] in particular) or other terms in other English-speaking countries. Other pre-wedding celebrations, such as the '''bridesmaids luncheon''', are often held in lieu of bachelorette parties due to the latter's association with [[Lascivious behavior|licentiousness]] in some countries since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Adam2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adam|first=Elise Mac|title=Something New: Wedding Etiquette for Rule Breakers, Traditionalists, and Everyone in Between|date=19 February 2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|language=English |isbn=9781416958093|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009Haire"/&gt;

The bachelorette party is modeled after the [[bachelor party]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Post, Peggy|authorlink=Peggy Post|title=Emily Post's wedding etiquette|edition=5|publisher=Collins|location=London|year=2006|pages=183–184|isbn=0-06-074504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself historically a dinner given by the [[bridegroom]] to his friends shortly before his wedding.&lt;ref name="1922 Post"&gt;{{cite book|author=Post, Emily|authorlink=Emily Post|title=Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home|publisher= [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company]]|year=1922

==History==
Prior to its usage as a term for a pre-wedding party, ''hen party'' was used in the United States as a general term for an all-female gathering, usually held at a hostess's residence. In 1897, ''[[The Deseret News]]'' noted that a hen party was a "time honored idea that tea and chitchats, gossip smart hats, constitute the necessary adjuncts to these particular gatherings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BLhLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fTADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6867,6158820&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en| title= Hen Party is Great Fun| work= The Deseret News |page= 12|publisher=Google News |date= December 18, 1897| access-date= June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was described as hosting a Christmas-time hen party for [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] wives and "ladies of the press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Gridiron Widows Visited by Santa| agency= Associated Press| location= Washington| date= December 15, 1940| page=B-9| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W00DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4017,4940452&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en| work=St. Petersburg Times |publisher=Google News |accessdate= June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9iEhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tWQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6361,456699&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en| title= And, Too, How Much Should Wives Tell Husbands| first= Hal| last= Boyle | work= Sarasota Herald-Tribune |page= 4| publisher= Google News |location= New York| date= September 6, 1951| access-date= June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WsYwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YmoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3476,2742002&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en| title= Dorothy Dix Says...| work= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | page= 12| date= June 10, 1947| access-date= June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bachelorette party is consciously modeled after the centuries-old [[bachelor's party]],&lt;ref name= isbn0-06-074504-5 /&gt;&lt;ref name= isbn0-8135-3811-4 /&gt; which is itself historically a [[black tie]] dinner given by the [[bridegroom]],&lt;ref name="1922 Post"/&gt; or sometimes his father,&lt;ref name="Haire2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1904885,00.html|title=A Brief History Of Bachelor Parties|last=Haire|first=Meaghan|date=16 June 2009|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|language=English|accessdate=15 December 2017|quote=In the past, a bachelor party could commonly involve a black-tie dinner hosted by the groom's father, with toasts to the groom and the bride.

=== Modern adaptations ===
The practice of giving a party to honour the bride-to-be goes back for centuries. However, certain American bachelorette party customs involving licentiousness among some social groups may have begun during the [[Sexual Revolution]] of the 1960s. It was uncommon until at least the mid-1980s,&lt;ref name="2009Haire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1904885,00.html|title=A Brief History Of Bachelor Parties|last=Haire|first=Meaghan|date=16 June 2009|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|language=English|accessdate=15 December 2017|quote=In the past, a bachelor party could commonly involve a black-tie dinner hosted by the groom's father, with toasts to the groom and the bride.

Since the 1980s, many parties in honor of the bride-to-be that were labeled as bachelorette parties often involved displays of sexual freedom, such as trading intimate secrets, getting drunk, and watching [[Striptease#Male strippers|male strippers]].&lt;ref name="2009Haire"/&gt; Parties that honored the bride-to-be without them avoided that label.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8135-3811-4"/&gt; Now, however, the term is used for a wide variety of parties.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8118-4458-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-470-10672-7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fox, Sue|title=Etiquette For Dummies |publisher=For Dummies|location=|year=2007|isbn=0-470-10672-7

Bachelorette parties became especially popular around the turn of the 21st century and frequently appeared in the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montemurro|first1=Beth|title=Something Old, Something Bold: Bridal Showers and Bachelorette Parties|isbn=9780813538112|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53_K9J2F5zoC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=bachelorette+party+1990s+early+2000s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uXqDyqq7lC&amp;sig=m2Lpf8wkW_YP1F64o6TOyIzIjPE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sd1QVYCqKYqu7gbHrYDICg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bachelorette%20party%201990s%20early%202000s&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those uncomfortable with these modern customs of debauchery often celebrate the night before their wedding with a combined [[stag and doe|stag and doe party]], a custom that has become increasingly popular.&lt;ref name="2009Haire" /&gt;

Author Beth Montemurro has tied the cultural significance of a bachelorette party to concepts of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8135-3811-4" /&gt;  The phrase "hen party" mirrors the male "stag party" in referencing social stereotypes of each gender at the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Creative compounding in English: the semantics of metaphorical and metonymical noun-noun combinations | first=Réka | last=Benczes | year=2006 | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | isbn=90-272-2373-4 | page=95 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK8R61s_gwQC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22hen+party%22+history&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CZRdTKCoFMP98AbA2LCzDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hen%20party%22%20history&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment==
[[File:Naked butlers with a hen party, Bristol 2013.jpg|320px|thumbnail|right|Topless butlers serving guests at a hen party]]
Many different kinds of entertainment are selected, depending on what the organizers think will best please their guest of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different kinds of entertainments|url=http://www.entertain-ment.co.uk/hen-party-ideas|website=entertain-ment.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hen Party Ideas|url=http://www.henandstagsligo.ie/great-hen-party-ideas|website=henandstagsligo.ie|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While notions of a bachelorette party as a night of drunken debauchery have persist in some social circles since the 1980s,&lt;ref name="2009Haire"/&gt; it is becoming widely seen in America as an opportunity for [[female bonding]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8118-4458-7"&gt;{{cite book

When held in a private venue, such as the hostess's home, the party may take any form that pleases the hostesses and honors the bride-to-be. Dinners and [[cocktail parties]], which provide comfortable opportunities for participants to talk or to give intimate advice to the bride-to-be, are common.&lt;ref name= isbn0-06-074504-5 /&gt; Other hostesses choose a themed party, such as a "[[pamper party]]," with guests indulging in [[spa]] treatments, or a cooking class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.henweekends.co.uk/spa-hen-party/|title=Spa Hen Party {{!}} UK &amp; European Spa Breaks {{!}} Hen Weekends|website=www.henweekends.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new etiq"&gt;{{cite book|first1= Kristen |last1= Finello |first2=Diane |last2=Forden |title=Bridal Guide Magazine's New Etiquette for Today's Bride| publisher= Warner Books |location=New York |year=2005 |pages=28–29 |isbn=0-446-67822-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While proposing a [[toast (honor)|toast]] to the bride-to-be is common at most bachelorette parties, some center on [[drinking games]].

In the 21st century, many companies sell products aimed at the organizers of bachelorette parties, including packs of themed games, pre-printed invitations, decorations, novelties, and [[sex toy]]s. A common theme of parties is male nudity. In North America, it is common in some social circles to hire a [[male stripper]] or attend a male strip club.

In the UK, a [[naked butler]] has become a common theme and a popular hen party idea. The naked butler is often dressed in just a collar, dickie bow, cuffs and a short apron or trunks. He will wait on the hen and her party including serving drinks and food as well as hosting or taking part in hen party games and entertainment. An extension of this concept that has also become popular in the UK is the hiring of a naked chef to cater for the guests often accompanied by a naked butler to serve the food and drinks. [[Life drawing]] parties featuring a nude male model might also be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A bachelorette art party that makes ogling hot naked guys respectable|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/a-bachelorette-art-party-that-makes-ogling-hot-naked-guys-respectable-4991034|website=www.laweekly.com|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Participants are often all women. [[Bridesmaids]] (if any) are typically invited, but any of the [[bride]]'s close friends may be included.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt;

This party is typically hosted by one or more members of the [[wedding party]], although it is possible for any friend to host a party in honor of the bride-to-be. Formally, a party in honor of the bride-to-be is never hosted by the bride-to-be,&lt;ref name="Rude III"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/opinions/dont_be_rude_part_iii_socializing.php|title=Don’t Be Rude: Part III, Socializing|last= Berry| first= Margaret|date=September 4, 2002|work=[[The Morning News (online magazine)|The Morning News]]|publisher=|quote= Don’t throw parties in your own honor. Throwing a birthday party, a shower, or an anniversary party for yourself lacks humility. It also suggests that the party is a poorly camouflaged push for gifts, instead of a heartfelt expression of affection from a dear friend. |accessdate=2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although she may participate in its planning. While it is normally the duty of a hostess to pay for the entertainment she gives her guests, it is common in most English-speaking countries for participants to share the costs of this event.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt; Whether the bride-to-be pays her share, or whether her share is divided between other participants is determined by the organizers and the bride-to-be during the early stages of the planning process.

Participating in a bachelorette party is always optional, and many brides decline these parties altogether.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt; Neither bridesmaids nor other friends can be required either to attend or to pay for any part of this party.&lt;ref name="isbn0-609-60431-7"&gt;{{cite book|last= Martin| first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Martin|title=Miss Manners on Weddings|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|year=1999|pages=136&amp;ndash;137|isbn=0-609-60431-7|quote=Contrary to rumor, bridesmaids are not obliged to entertain in honor of the bride, nor to wear dresses they cannot afford.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it is derived from a formal dinner, a bachelorette party is properly held in the evening,&lt;ref name="1922 Post"/&gt; usually about a week (or at least a few days) before the wedding,&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt; and usually includes dinner, although alternative approaches are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt;

==Role of alcohol==
In the early 21st century, some bachelorette parties rivaled the drunkenness seen in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2017-07-12/how-to-plan-a-sober-bachelorette-or-bachelor-celebration|title=How to Plan a Sober Bachelorette or Bachelor Celebration|last=Castaneda|first=Ruben|date=12 July 2017|work=US News and World Report|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, sober bachelorette parties are not unusual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many brides and guests are staying [[Sobriety|sober]] in recovery from alcoholism or are not drinking alcoholic beverages [[Alcohol and pregnancy|due to pregnancy]] or health issues, for [[Religion and alcohol|religious reasons]], or because they do not want to drink alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brides.com/story/how-to-survive-a-bachelorette-when-youre-sober|title=Surviving a Bachelorette Party When You’re Sober|last=Emery|first=Léa Rose|date=11 August 2017|work=Brides|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sober parties focus on building relationships and activities beyond hanging out at a place that serves alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Location==
Many bachelorette parties are held at home or at a nearby restaurant.  Some people turn a bachelorette party into a weekend trip to another city.  Some cities, such as [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] for people in the southwestern US and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] for people in the [[Upper Midwest]], are relatively popular with American bridal parties that are seeking a weekend destination and can afford to pay hundreds of dollars per person for the experience.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/how-nashville-became-one-big-bachelorette-party|title=How Nashville Became One Big Bachelorette Party|last=Petersen|first=Anne Helen|date=29 March 2018|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other people will travel farther to cities such as [[Las Vegas]].  In the UK, parties in relatively inexpensive European destinations such as [[Latvia]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are popular.  

One reason that bridal parties travel to a different city is because they want to behave differently than they normally would, but they do not want to deal with the social repercussions that might ensue if friends, family members, or professional acquaintances saw them doing this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  When large numbers of bachelor and bachelorette parties choose the same cities, this can produce extra jobs and new businesses to cater to them, but it also draws complaints from local residents who are faced with the disruption and public service costs caused by the seasonal influx of noisy parties and drunken visitors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Stag parties caused so much disruption in [[Riga, Latvia]] that the city formed a police group specifically to deal with bachelor and bachelorette parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5101628.stm|title=Stagflation|last=|first=|date=2006-06-21|work=BBC|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2359095/British-men-flock-Latvia-cut-price-parties-easy-prey-mafia-beauties.html|title=The stag hunters: Hordes of British men are flocking to Latvia for cut-price parties. But they are easy prey for mafia beauties who seduce them, spike their drinks and empty their bank accounts|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
A more traditional alternative is the ''bridesmaids luncheon'', hosted by friends of the bride's mother or mothers of the bridesmaids, usually give the day before the wedding. Attendees include the bridesmaids, their mothers and close female friends and relatives; the event is often multi-generational including mothers and even grandmothers of the bride and groom. At a bridesmaids luncheon, the bride often presents a small gift to each bridesmaid. The purpose of the luncheon is for the bride to thank her attendants and includes presenting them with bridesmaid gifts. This is also the time when the bridesmaids' gift, if any, is customarily given to the bride. If there is a cake, it may contain symbolic [[Good luck charm|good luck charms]].

If a significant aspect of the party is presenting small gifts to the bride-to-be, then the event is properly called a [[bridal shower]]. For the convenience of the bride-to-be, bridal showers are usually held earlier than a bachelorette party.&lt;ref name="isbn0-385-41342-4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vanderbilt, Amy |author2=Tuckerman, Nancy |author3=Dunnan, Nancy |authorlink=Amy Vanderbilt|title=The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette|edition=|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, N.Y|year=1995|pages=364–365|isbn=0-385-41342-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

In [[Canada]] a [[stag and doe]] party, also called a "Jack and Jill", "buck and doe" or "hag" (''hen'' + ''stag'') party, is a [[fundraising party]] that includes both men and women. These parties are held by couples wishing to distance themselves from the licentiousness associated with many post-1980s bachelorette parties and are becoming increasingly popular, especially as a means to financially support a wedding.

'''''Battle Pope''''' is an independent [[comic book]] created by [[Robert Kirkman]] and [[Tony Moore (artist)|Tony Moore]], which was published by their own small press company under the moniker of Funk-O-Tron originally in [[2000 in comics|2000]]. The series was reprinted in color by [[Image Comics]] in [[2005 in comics|2005]], with plans to possibly continue it with new stories after collecting the original material.

The book tells the tale of a hard drinking, womanizing [[Pope]], condemned by [[God]] for his own evil ways, who is called to action to save [[Saint Michael]], with the help of [[wikt:Jesus H. Christ|Jesus H. Christ]], becoming mankind's final hope in a world overrun by [[demons]] following the [[Rapture]].

The comic was adapted into a season of 8 animated webisodes that appeared on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV's]] website in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16168 |title=Shooting the Papal Bull: Kirkman talks Animated Battle Pope |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=April 24, 2008 |accessdate=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The opening panels show Pope Oswald Leopold II sitting in a bar drinking and reminiscing. There is a flashback to a young child preparing to accept the mantle of Pope. He undergoes martial arts training from Bruce Lee, because "The Pope needs to be ready for anything." After becoming Pope, Leopold leads a life full of drinking, sex and debauchery. Eventually, God casts judgement on the entire human race, condemning them all. He allows the gates of Hell to open and the world is invaded by swarms of demons. After a great war, a treaty is formed and Hell's gates are closed. Human and demon survivors roam the Earth together and co-exist.

After the flashback, Pope witnesses a gang kidnapping a young woman. When Pope tries to stop the group, they summon the demon Belaam. Pope beats the demon after a brief fight by cutting off his right arm with a sword. The woman expresses her gratitude and goes back to Pope's house.

Later that night, Belaam ambushes Pope, killing the woman. While distracted by her death, Pope appears to be killed. As Belaam relishes his triumph, he is shot from behind by Jesus. Pope soon awakens and finds he is in the presence of Jesus and God. They reveal to him that God sent Saint Michael to watch over the good people left on Earth. Lucifer was able to overpower and capture the saint. God gives Pope super-strength and tells him that if he rescues Saint Michael, he will get into Heaven despite his deplorable life.

As Pope and Jesus search for Hellcorp - Lucifer's headquarters on Earth - they are attacked by the Zombie Twins, Lucifer's henchmen. Pope dispatches the duo, but they were not beaten and summon all of Earth's corpses to form a giant, writhing zombie monster. Pope can't stop this new monster, but Jesus is able to destroy them in a brilliant explosion when they try to eat him. After killing the zombies, Pope and Jesus are once again attacked by Belaam, now with a robotic arm, but he is easily defeated.

Finally at Hellcorp, Jesus and Pope enter, only to have to fight waves of demons waiting for them. After putting up an incredible fight, Pope and Jesus are incapacitated and brought before Lucifer. They then discover Lucifer's plan: to steal Saint Michael's halo and combine it with his own demon horns, expanding his powers to godlike proportions. Pope escapes, but is unable to prevent Lucifer from donning the halo and he is banished.

Pope then spends what seems like a long time in Hell, fighting every day to survive. But just 17 seconds later on Earth, Pope is rescued by God, who increases his powers by granting him a halo of his own. With his new-found power, Pope defeats Lucifer and saves Saint Michael. God grants Pope access to Heaven, but he turns it down to stay and protect the people of Earth.

Afterwards, Pope returns home and Jesus becomes his roommate.

==Overview==
[[File:Abstraction hierarchy.jpg|thumb|200px|Right|Abstraction hierarchy allows the breakdown of complexity.]]
The BioBrick parts are used by applying engineering principles of abstraction and modularization. BioBrick parts form the base of the hierarchical system on which [[synthetic biology]] is based. There are three levels to the hierarchy:

# Parts: Pieces of DNA that form a functional unit (for example promoter, RBS, etc.)
# Device: Collection set of parts with defined function. In simple terms, a set of complementary BioBrick parts put together forms a device. 
# System: Combination of a set of devices that performs high-level tasks.
The development of standardized biological parts allows for the rapid assembly of sequences. The ability to test individual parts and devices to be independently tested and characterized also improves the reliability of higher-order systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts|url = http://www.jbioleng.org/content/2/1/5/abstract|journal = Journal of Biological Engineering|date = 2008-04-14|issn = 1754-1611|pmc = 2373286|pmid = 18410688|pages = 5|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1754-1611-2-5|language = en|first = Reshma P.|last = Shetty|first2 = Drew|last2 = Endy|first3 = Thomas F.|last3 = Knight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first attempt to create a list of standard biological parts was in 1996, by ''Rebatchouk et al''. This team introduced a cloning strategy for the assembly of short DNA fragments. However, this early attempt was not widely recognised by the scientific research community at the time.&lt;ref name="Reshma" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rebatchouk&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rebatchouk|first=Dmitri|author2=Daraselia, N. |author3=Narita, J.

Since then, various research groups have utilized the BioBrick standard parts to engineer novel biological devices and systems.

=== BioBricks Foundation ===
The [http://biobricks.org/ BioBricks Foundation] was formed in 2006 by engineers and scientists alike as a not-for-profit organization to standardize biological parts across the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About - BioBricks Foundation|url = http://biobricks.org/about-foundation/|website = BioBricks Foundation|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation focuses on improving in areas of Technology, Law, Education and the Global Community as they apply to [[synthetic biology]]. BioBricks Foundation's activities include hosting SBx.0 Conferences, technical and educational programs. The SBx.0 conferences are international conferences on synthetic biology hosted across the world. Technical programs are aimed at the production of a series of standard biological parts, and their education expansion is creating acts which help create open, standardized sources of biological parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Programs - BioBricks Foundation|url = http://biobricks.org/programs/|website = BioBricks Foundation|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BioBricks Public Agreement ===
As an alternative to traditional biotechnology patent systems and in an effort to allow BioBricks to be utilized as an open-source community standard, the BioBricks Foundation created the [http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/49434 BioBricks Public Agreement] (BPA). The BPA allows users to establish invention of uses of parts, to disclose patents on parts combinations, and to freely build on the contributions of other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The BioBrick Public Agreement v1 (draft)|url = http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/49434|website = dspace.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-11|language = en-US|first = Fischer,|last = Mark|first2 = Crews,|last2 = Lee|first3 = Lynch,|last3 = Jennifer|first4 = Schultz,|last4 = Jason|first5 = Grewal,|last5 = David|first6 = Endy,|last6 = Drew|date = 2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Building outside of the box: iGEM and the BioBricks Foundation|journal = Nature Biotechnology|pages = 1099–1102|volume = 27|issue = 12|doi = 10.1038/nbt1209-1099|first = Christina D|last = Smolke|pmid=20010584|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BioBrick Assembly standard==
The BioBrick assembly standard was introduced to overcome the lack of standardization posed by traditional [[molecular cloning]] methods. The BioBrick assembly standard is a more reliable approach for combining parts to form larger composites. The assembly standard enables two groups of synthetic biologists in different parts of the world to re-use a BioBrick part without going through the whole cycle of design and manipulation.&lt;ref name="Reshma" /&gt; This means the newly designed part can be used by other teams of researchers more easily. Besides that, when compared to the old-fashioned ''ad hoc'' cloning method, the assembly standard process is faster and promotes automation.&lt;ref name="The BioBrick approach"&gt;{{cite web|title=j5 automated DNA assembly-The BioBrick approach|url=http://j5.jbei.org/j5manual/pages/21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BioBrick assembly standard 10 was the first assembly standard to be introduced. Over the years, several other assembly standards, such as the Biofusion standard and Freiburg standard have been developed.

===BioBrick assembly standard 10===

[[File:Standard assembly 10.jpg|thumb|300px|Right| Standard assembly of two BioBrick parts (promoter and coding sequence) by digestion and ligation  which forms a 'scar' site(M).]]

Assembly standard 10 was developed by Tom Knight, and is the most widely used assembly standard. It involves the use of [[restriction enzymes]]. Every BioBrick part is a DNA sequence which is carried by a [[Plasmid|circular plasmid]], which acts a [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]].&lt;ref name="Sean C. Sleight"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sleight|first=S. C.|author2=Bartley, B. A. |author3=Lieviant, J. A. |author4= Sauro, H. M. |title=In-Fusion BioBrick assembly and re-engineering|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=12 April 2010|volume=38|issue=8|pages=2624–2636|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq179 |pmid=20385581 |pmc=2860134}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The vector acts as a transport system to carry the BioBrick parts. The first approach towards a BioBrick standard was the introduction of standard sequences, the prefix and suffix sequences, which flank the 5&amp;prime; and 3&amp;prime; ends of the DNA part respectively.&lt;ref name="Chapter 13"&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385120-8.00013-9 |pmid=21601683 |isbn=9780123851208|year=2011 |last1=Shetty |first1=R. |title=Assembly of BioBrick standard biological parts using three antibiotic assembly |journal=Methods in Enzymology |volume=498 |pages=311–26 |last2=Lizarazo |first2=M. |last3=Rettberg |first3=R. |last4=Knight |first4=T. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These standard sequences encode specific restriction enzyme sites. The prefix sequence encodes ''EcoRI'' (E) and ''Xbal'' (X) sites, while the suffix sequence encodes ''SpeI'' (S) and ''PstI'' (P) sites. The prefix and the suffix  are not considered part of the BioBrick part.&lt;ref name="SynBio standards" /&gt; To facilitate the assembly process, the BioBrick part itself must not contain any of these restriction sites. During the assembly of two different parts, one of the plasmids is digested with ''EcoRI'' and ''SpeI''. The plasmid carrying the other BioBrick part is digested with ''[[EcoRI]]'' and ''Xbal''. This leaves both plasmids with 4 base pair (bp) overhangs at the 5’ and 3’ ends. The ''EcoRI'' sites will ligate since they are complementary to each other. The ''Xbal'' and ''SpeI'' sites will also ligate as the digestion produces compatible ends. Now, both the DNA parts are in one plasmid. The ligation produces an 8 base pair ‘scar’ site between the two BioBrick parts. Since the scar site is a hybrid of the ''Xbal'' and ''SpeI'' sites, it is not recognized by either restriction enzyme.&lt;ref name="Chapter 13" /&gt; The prefix and suffix sequences remain unchanged by this digestion and ligation process, which allows for subsequent assembly steps with more BioBrick parts.

This assembly is an [[idempotent]] process: multiple applications don’t change the end product, and maintain the prefix and suffix. Although the BioBrick standard assembly allows for the formation of functional modules, there is a limitation to this standard 10 approach. The 8 bp scar site does not allow the creation of a [[fusion protein]].&lt;ref name="Sean C. Sleight" /&gt; The scar site causes a [[frame shift]] which prevents the continuous reading of codons, which is required for the formation of fusion protein.

Tom Knight later developed the BB-2 assembly standard in 2008 to address problems with joining the scars of protein domains and that the scars consist of eight bases, which will yield an altered reading frame when joining protein domains. The enzymes used for digestion of the initial parts are almost the same, but with modified prefixes and suffixes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== BglBricks assembly standard ===
The BglBrick assembly standard was proposed by J. Christopher Anderson, John E. Dueber, Mariana Leguia, Gabriel C. Wu, Jonathan C. Goler, Adam P. Arkin, and Jay D. Keasling in September 2009 as a standard very similar in concept to BioBrick, but enabling the generation of fusion proteins without altering the reading frame or introducing stop codons and while creating a relatively neutral amino acid linker scar (GlySer). A BglBrick part is as a DNA sequence flanked by 5′ EcoRI and BglII sites (GAATTCaaaA&lt;u&gt;GATCT&lt;/u&gt;) and 3′ BamHI and XhoI sites (&lt;u&gt;G&lt;/u&gt;GATCCaaaCTCGAG), and lacking in these same restriction sites internally. The upstream part in the pairwise assembly is purified from an EcoRI/BamHI digest, and the downstream part+vector is purified from an EcoRI/BglII digest. Ligation of these two fragments creates a composite part reforming the original flanking sites required in the part definition and leaving a &lt;u&gt;GGATCT&lt;/u&gt; scar sequence at the junction of the parts, a scar that encodes the amino acids glycine and serine when fusing CDS parts together in-frame, convenient due to the GlySer dipeptide being a popular linker of protein domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shetty|first=Reshma P|last2=Endy|first2=Drew|last3=Knight|first3=Thomas F|date=2008|title=Engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts|url=https://jbioleng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1754-1611-2-5|journal=Journal of Biological Engineering|language=En|volume=2|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1754-1611-2-5|issn=1754-1611|pmc=2373286|pmid=18410688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver (Biofusion) standard===

[[File:Biofusion standard.jpg|300px|thumb | Biofusion assembly of two BioBrick parts.The schematic diagram shows the 6 base pair scar site made due to the deletion and insertion of nucleotide in the ''XbaI'' and ''SpeI'' sites.]]
Pam Silver’s lab created the Silver assembly standard to overcome the issue surrounding the formation of fusion protein. This assembly standard is also known as Biofusion standard, and is an improvement of the BioBrick assembly standard 10. Silver’s standard involves deletion of one nucleotide from the ''Xbal'' and ''SpeI'' site, which shortens the scar site by 2 nucleotides, which now forms a 6 bp scar sequence. The 6 bp sequence allows the reading frame to be maintained.The scar sequence codes for the amino acid [[threonine]] (ACT) and [[arginine]] (AGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silver|first=Pamela A.|author2=Ira E. Phillips|title=A New Biobrick Assembly Strategy Designed for Facile Protein Engineering|journal=Harvard Medical School|date=April 18, 2006|pages=1–6|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/32535/PhillipsSilverFusion.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This minor improvement allows for the formation of in-frame fusion protein. However, arginine's being a large, charged [[amino acid]] is a disadvantage to the Biofusion assembly technique: these properties of arginine result in the destabilisation of the protein by the [[N-end rule]].

===Freiburg standard===

The [http://2007.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Freiburg07/report_fusion_parts 2007 Freiburg iGEM team] introduced a new assembly standard to overcome the disadvantages of the existing Biofusion standard technique. The Freiburg team created a new set of prefix and suffix sequences by introducing additional restriction enzyme sites, ''AgeI'' and ''NgoMIV'' to the existing prefix and suffix respectively. These newly introduced restriction enzyme sites are BioBrick standard compatible. The Freiburg standard still forms a 6 bp scar site, but the scar sequence (ACCGGC) now codes for threonine and [[glycine]] respectively. This scar sequence results in a much more stable protein&lt;ref name="Freiburg standard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Kristian M.|title=dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/45140/BBF_RFC%2025.pdf?sequence=1|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/45140/BBF_RFC%2025.pdf?sequence=1|work=MIT|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the glycine forms a stable N-terminal, unlike the arginine, which signals for N-terminal degradation. The assembly technique proposed by the Freiburg team  diminishes the limitations of the Biofusion standard.

==Assembly method==
Different methods are used when it comes to assembling BioBricks. This is because, some standards require different materials and methods (use of different restriction enzymes), while others are due to preferences in protocol because some methods of assembly have higher efficiency and is user-friendly.

===3 Antibiotic (3A) Assembly===

The 3A assembly method is the most commonly used, as its compatible with assembly Standard 10, Silver standard as well as the Freiburg standard. This assembly method involves two BioBrick parts and a destination plasmid. The destination plasmid contains the toxic(lethal) gene, to ease the selection of correctly assembled plasmid. The destination plasmid also have a different antibiotic resistance genes than the plasmids carrying the BioBrick parts. All three plasmids are digested with appropriate restriction enzyme and then allowed to ligate. Only the correctly assembled part will produce a viable composite part contained in the destination plasmid. This allows a good selection as only the correctly assembled BioBrick parts survives.

=== Amplified Insert Assembly ===
The amplified insert assembly method does not depend on prefix and suffix sequences, allowing to be used in combination with a majority of assembly standards. It also has a higher transformation rate than 3A assembly, and it does not require the involved plasmids to have different antibiotic resistance genes. This method reduces noise from uncut plasmids by amplifying a desired insert using PCR prior to digestion and treating the mixture with the restriction enzyme DpnI, which digests methylated DNA like plasmids. Eliminating the template plasmids with DpnI leaves only the insert to be amplified by PCR. To decrease the possibility of
creating plasmids with unwanted combinations of insert and backbone, the backbone can be treated with phosphatase to prevent its religation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = BioBrick Assembly Standards and Techniques and Associated Software Tools |journal = &lt;!-- --&gt; |volume = 1116|pages = 1–24|publisher = Humana Press|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 978-1-62703-763-1|series = Methods in Molecular Biology|doi = 10.1007/978-1-62703-764-8_1|pmid = 24395353|editor-first = Svein|editor-last = Valla|editor-first2 = Rahmi|editor-last2 = Lale|last1 = Røkke|first1 = G.|last2 = Korvald|first2 = E.|last3 = Pahr|first3 = J.|last4 = Oyås|first4 = O.|last5 = Lale|first5 = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gibson Scarless Assembly ===
The Gibson scarless assembly method allows the joining of multiple BioBricks simultaneously. This method requires the desired sequences to have an overlap of 20 to 150 [[Base pair|bps]]. Because BioBricks do not have this overlap, this method requires PCR primers to create overhangs between adjacent BioBricks. T5 exonuclease attacks the 5' ends of sequences, creating single-stranded DNA in the ends of all sequences where the different components are designed to anneal. DNA polymerase then adds DNA parts to gaps in the anneal components, and a Taq ligase can seal the final strands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Parts Registry==

The MIT group led by Tom Knight that developed BioBricks and [http://igem.org/Main_Page International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM)] competition are also the pioneers of The Registry of Standard Biological Parts (Registry).&lt;ref name="A primer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Geoff|title=Synthetic Biology A Primer.|year=2012|publisher=Imperial College Pr|location=London|isbn=978-1848168633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registry being one of the foundations of synthetic biology, provides web-based information and data on over 20,000 BioBrick parts. The Registry contains:
*Information and characterisation data for all parts, device and system
*Includes a catalogue which describes the function, performance and design of each part

Every BioBrick part has its unique identification code which makes the search for the desired BioBrick part easier (for example, BBa_J23100, a constitutive promoter).&lt;ref name=Reshma /&gt; The registry is open access, whereby anyone can submit a BioBrick part. Most of the BioBrick submission is from students participating in the annual iGEM competition hosted every summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Main Page - ung.igem.org|url = http://igem.org/Main_Page|website = igem.org|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Registry allows exchange of data and materials online which allows rapid re-use and modifications of parts by the participating community.

Professional parts registries have also been developed. Since most of the BioBrick parts are submitted by undergraduates as part of the iGEM competition, the parts may lack important characterisation data and metadata which would be essential when it comes to designing and modelling the functional components.&lt;ref name="A primer" /&gt; One example of a professional parts registry is the USA-based publicly funded facility, [http://biofab.synberc.org The International Open Facility Advancing Biotechnology (BIOFAB)], which contains detailed descriptions of each biological part. It is also an open-source registry, and is available commercially.  BIOFAB aims to catalogue high-quality BioBrick parts to accommodate the needs of professional synthetic biology community.

The [http://biobricks.org BioBrick Foundation (BBF)] is a public-benefit organization established to promote the use of standardized BioBrick parts on a scale beyond the iGEM competition. The BBF is currently working on the derivation of standard framework to promote the production high quality BioBrick parts which would be freely available to everyone.&lt;ref name=BBF&gt;{{cite web|title=About BioBricks Foundation|url=http://biobricks.org/about-foundation/|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese architecture''' demonstrates an [[architectural style]] that developed over millennia in [[China]], before spreading out to influence architecture all throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]]. Since the solidification of the style in the early [[Imperial China|imperial period]], the structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Starting with the [[Tang Dynasty]], Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of [[Korean architecture|Korea]], [[Vietnamese architecture|Vietnam]], and [[Japanese architecture|Japan]], and a varying amount of influence on the architectural styles of Northeast and [[Southeast Asia]]. Chinese architecture is typified by various features; such as, bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, the incorporation of ideas related to [[feng shui]] such as directional hierarchies, a horizontal emphasis, and the allusion to various cosmological, mythological, or other symbolism. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces. In part because of an emphasis on the use of wood, a relatively perishable material, and due to a de-emphasis on major monumental structures built of less-organic but more durable materials, much of the historical knowledge of Chinese architecture derives from surviving miniature models in ceramic and published planning diagrams and specifications. Some of the architecture of China shows the influence of other types or styles from outside of China, such as the influences on [[mosque]] structures originating in the [[Middle East]]. Chinese architecture has also influenced neighboring areas, including Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia. Although displaying certain unifying aspects, rather than being completely homogeneous, Chinese architecture has many types of variation based on status or affiliation, such as dependence on whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or used for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in the varying styles associated with different geographic regions and in ethnic architectural design. 

{{quote|The architecture of China is as old as Chinese civilization. From every source of information—literary, graphic, exemplary—there is strong evidence testifying to the fact that the Chinese have always enjoyed an indigenous system of construction that has retained its principal characteristics from prehistoric times to the present day. Over the vast area from Chinese Turkistan to Japan, from Manchuria to the northern half of French Indochina, the same system of construction is prevalent; and this was the area of Chinese cultural influence. That this system of construction could perpetuate itself for more than four thousand years over such a vast territory and still remain a living architecture, retaining its principal characteristics in spite of repeated foreign invasions—military, intellectual, and spiritual—is a phenomenon comparable only to the continuity of the civilization of which it is an integral part.|[[Liang Sicheng]]|1984&lt;ref&gt;[[Liang Sicheng]], year 12, ''A pictorial history of Chinese architecture : a study of the development of its structural system and the evolution of its types'', ed. by Wilma Fairbank, Cambridge (Mass.): [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the 20th Century, Western-trained Chinese architects have attempted to combine traditional Chinese designs into [[modern architecture]] (usually government), with great success. Moreover, the pressure for urban development throughout contemporary [[China]] required higher speed of construction and higher [[floor area ratio]], which means that in the great cities the demand for traditional Chinese buildings, which are normally less than 3 levels, has declined in favor of modern architecture. However, the traditional skills of Chinese architecture, including [[carpentry|major and minor carpentry]], [[masonry]], and [[stonemasonry]], are still applied to the construction of [[vernacular architecture]] in the vast rural area in China.

==History==
===Neolithic &amp; early Antiquity===
Chinese civilizational cultures developed in the plains along the numerous rivers that emptied into the [[Bohai Bay|Bohai]] and [[Honzhow Bay|Hongzhow]] bays. The mosr prominent of these rivers, the [[Yellow River|Yellow]] and the [[Yangtze]], hosted a complex fabric of villages. The climate was warmer and more humid that today, allowing for millet to be grown in the north and rice in the south. There was, however, no single "origin" of the Chinese civilization.

==Features==

The rectangular compound shown above has two sections of courtyards. The buildings on the axle line include central entrance, four-pointed pavilion, mountain-shaped front hall, artificial mountain and ponds, eight-pointed pavilion and mountain-shaped retiring quarters. The two sides of the central axle are arranged with corridor rooms symmetrically.]]

===Architectural bilateral symmetry===

A very important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on [[articulation (architecture)|articulation]] and bilateral symmetry, which signifies balance. Bilateral symmetry and the articulation of buildings are found everywhere in Chinese architecture, from palace complexes to humble farmhouses. When possible, plans for renovation and extension of a house will often try to maintain this symmetry provided that there is enough capital to do so.&lt;ref name=KnappEA&gt;{{Citation| first = Ronald G. |last= Knapp |year=2006 |title=Chinese Houses: The Architectural Heritage of a Nation |publisher=Tuttle Publishing | isbn=978-0-8048-3537-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary elements are positioned either side of main structures as two wings to maintain overall bilateral symmetry. The buildings are typically planned to contain an even number of columns in a structure to produce an odd number of bays (間). With the inclusion of a main door to a building in the center bay, symmetry is maintained.

In contrast to the buildings,  the Chinese gardens tend to be asymmetrical. The principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ming Furniture in the Light of Chinese Architecture |first=Sarah |last=Handler |publisher=Ten Speed Press |date=January 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the classic Chinese garden is based on the ideology of "Nature and Man in One", as opposed to the home itself, which is a symbol of the human sphere co-existing with, but separate from nature. So, the arrangement is as flexible as possible to let people feel they are surrounded by and in harmony with nature. The two essential elements of the garden are hill stones and water. The hill stones mean the pursuit of immortality and water represents emptiness and existence. The mountain belongs to yang (static beauty) and the water belongs to yin (dynamic wonder). They depend on each other and complete the whole nature. &lt;ref&gt; Cui, Huaizu, and Qingqing Hu (2015), ''Creation and Appreciation of “Nature and Man in One” and Chinese Classic Beauty of Garden – Taking the Suzhou classic garden as an example'', (https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2015/04/shsconf_icmetm2015_02001/shsconf_icmetm2015_02001.html).

===Enclosure===

In much of traditional Chinese architecture, buildings or building complexes take up an entire property but enclose open spaces within themselves. These enclosed spaces come in two forms, the:&lt;ref name="KnappEA"/&gt;
*''Courtyard (院)'': The use of open courtyards is a common feature in many types of Chinese architectures. This is best exemplified in the [[Siheyuan]], which has consisted of an empty space surrounded by buildings connected with one another either directly or through verandas.
*''"Sky well" (天井)'': Although large open courtyards are less commonly found in southern Chinese architecture, the concept of an "open space" surrounded by buildings, which is seen in northern courtyard complexes, can be seen in the southern building structure known as the "sky well". This structure is essentially a relatively enclosed courtyard formed from the intersections of closely spaced buildings and offer small opening to the sky through the roof space from the floor up.

These enclosures serve in temperature regulation and in venting the building complexes. Northern courtyards are typically open and facing the south to allow the maximum exposure of the building windows and walls to the sun while keeping the cold northern winds out. Southern sky wells are relatively small and serves to collect rain water from the roof tops. They perform the same duties as the [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman]] [[impluvium]] while restricting the amount of sunlight that enters the building. Sky wells also serve as vents for rising hot air, which draws cool air from the lower stories of the house and allows for exchange of cool air with the outside.

===Hierarchy===
[[File:Tomb of Northern Qi Dynasty in Jiuyuangang, Xinzhou, Mural, Building.jpg|thumb|A tomb mural of [[Xinzhou]], dated to the [[Northern Qi]] (550-577 AD) period, showing a hall with a [[Roof tiles|tiled roof]], [[dougong]] brackets, and doors with giant [[door knockers]] (perhaps made of bronze)]]
The projected hierarchy and importance and uses of buildings in traditional Chinese architecture are based on the strict placement of buildings in a property/complex. Buildings with doors facing the front of the property are considered more important than those facing the sides. Buildings facing away from the front of the property are the least important.

South-facing buildings in the rear and more private location of the property with higher exposure to sunlight are held in higher esteem and reserved for elder members of the family or ancestral plaques. Buildings facing east and west are generally for junior members or branches of the family, while buildings near the front are typically for servants and hired help.&lt;ref name=zggjz&gt;{{citation |title=中国古建筑 |publisher=齊魯音像出版社出版发行 |last=浙江长城纪实文化传播公司 |year=2004 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/zhongguo-gu-jian-zhu/oclc/057661389 |isbn=978-7-88408-237-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Front-facing buildings in the back of properties are used particularly for rooms of celebratory rites and for the placement of ancestral halls and plaques. In multiple courtyard complexes, central courtyards and their buildings are considered more important than peripheral ones, the latter typically being used as storage or servants’ rooms or kitchens.&lt;ref name=KnappEA/&gt;

=== Horizontal emphasis ===
Classical Chinese buildings, especially those of the wealthy, are built with an emphasis on breadth and less on height, featuring an enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not well emphasized. Buildings that were too high and large were considered unsightly, and therefore generally avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Li |first = Yih-yuan |title = Ancestors |publisher = DE GRUYTER MOUTON |ISBN = 9783110805314 |doi = 10.1515/9783110805314.329 |chapter = Chinese Geomancy and Ancestor Worship: A Further Discussion |year = 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings, using sheer scale to inspire awe in visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date = 2017-01-31 |work = Traditional Chinese Architecture |publisher = Princeton University Press |ISBN = 9781400885138 |doi = 10.1515/9781400885138-018 |chapter = Twelve. Typical Design Features of Ming Palaces and Altars in Beijing |title = Traditional Chinese Architecture }}&lt;/ref&gt; This preference contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. This often meant that [[Pagoda|pagodas]] towered above all other buildings in the skyline of a Chinese city.&lt;ref name="Kohrman"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kohrman |first = Matthew |date = March 1998 |title = Technology and Gender: Fabrics of Power in Late Imperial China:Technology and Gender: Fabrics of Power in Late Imperial China |journal = American Anthropologist |volume = 100 |issue = 1 |page = 236 |doi = 10.1525/aa.1998.100.1.236.1 |ISSN = 0002-7294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The halls and palaces in the [[Forbidden City]] (which were in fact partially designed with some western influence),  have rather low ceilings when compared to equivalent stately buildings in the West, but their external appearances suggest the all-embracing nature of imperial China. These ideas have found their way into modern Western architecture, for example through the work of [[Jørn Utzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Richard |last = Weston |title = Utzon |publisher = Edition Blondal |year = 2002 |ISBN = 978-87-88978-98-8 |page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmological concepts ===
[[File:Siheyuan model.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Model of a Chinese [[Siheyuan]] in Beijing, which shows off the symmetry, enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized.]]

Chinese architecture from early times used concepts from [[Wu Xing|Chinese cosmology]] such as ''[[feng shui]]'' ([[geomancy]]) and [[Taoism]] to organize construction and layout from common residences to imperial and religious structures.&lt;ref name="KnappEA" /&gt; This includes the use of:
* Screen walls to face the main entrance of the house, which stems from the belief that evil things travel in straight lines.
* Talismans and imagery of good fortune:
** [[Door god]]s displayed on doorways to ward off evil and encourage the flow of good fortune
** Three anthropomorphic figures representing [[Fu Lu Shou]] (福祿壽 fú-lù-shòu) stars are prominently displayed, sometimes with the proclamation "the three stars are present" (三星宅 sān-xīng-zhài)
** Animals and fruits that symbolize good fortune and prosperity, such as [[bat]]s and [[pomegranates]], respectively. The association is often done through [[rebus]]es.
* Orienting the structure with its back to elevated landscape and ensuring that there is water in the front. Considerations are also made such that the generally windowless back of the structure faces the north, where the wind is coldest in the winter.
* Ponds, pools, wells, and other water sources are usually built into the structure.
* Aligning a building along a north/south axis, with the building facing south and the two sides facing east and west respectively.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt;

The use of certain colors, numbers and the cardinal directions in traditional Chinese architecture reflected the belief in a type of [[immanence]], where the nature of a thing could be wholly contained in its own form. Although the Western tradition gradually developed a body of architectural literature, little was written on the subject in China, and the earliest text, the [[Kaogongji]], was never disputed. However, ideas about cosmic harmony and the order of the city were usually interpreted at their most basic level, so a reproduction of the "ideal" city never existed. [[Beijing]] as reconstructed throughout the 15th and 16th century remains one of the best examples of traditional Chinese [[town planning]].

==Architectural types==
There are various types of Chinese architecture. Some of these relate to the associated use of the structures, such as whether they were built for royals, commoners, or the religious.

=== Commoners ===
Due to primarily wooden construction and poor maintenance, far fewer examples of commoner's homes survive to this day compared to those of nobles. According to Matthew Korman, the average commoner's home did not change much, even centuries after the establishment of the universal style, such as early 20th century homes, were very similar to late and mid imperial homes in layout and construction.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt;

These homes, be they those of bureaucrats, merchants or farmers, tended to follow a set pattern: the center of the building would be a shrine for the deities and the ancestors, which would also be used during festivities. On its two sides were bedrooms for the elders; the two wings of the building (known as "guardian dragons" by the Chinese) were for the junior members of the family, as well as the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen, although sometimes the living room could be very close to the center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Beijing Courtyard House |last=Cassault |first=Andre |publisher=Open House International |year=1987 |ISBN = |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sometimes the extended families became so large that one or even two extra pairs of "wings" had to be built. This resulted in a U-shaped building, with a courtyard suitable for farm work.&lt;ref name="Kohrman" /&gt; Merchants and bureaucrats, however, preferred to close off the front with an imposing front gate. All buildings were legally regulated, and the law held that the number of stories, the length of the building and the colours used depended on the owner's class.

Some commoners living in areas plagued by bandits built communal fortresses called [[Tulou]] for protection. Often favoured by the Hakka in Fujian and Jiangxi, the design of Tulou also shows the Chinese ancient philosophy of harmony between people and environment. People used local materials to build the walls with rammed earth. There is no window to the outside on the lower two floors for defense, but it’s open on the inside with a common courtyard and lets people get together easily.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Shao-Sen; Li, Su-Yu; and Shi-Jie Liao (2012).

===Imperial===
There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the [[Emperor of China]]. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles, yellow having been the Imperial color; yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the [[Forbidden City]]. The [[Temple of Heaven]], however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s ("''dougong''"), a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surfaces of the walls, tend to be red in color. Black is also a famous color often used in pagodas. It was believed that the gods are inspired by the black color to descend to the earth.

The Chinese 5-clawed dragon, adopted by the first Ming emperor for his personal use, was used as decoration on the beams, pillars, and on the doors on Imperial architecture. Curiously, the dragon was never used on roofs of imperial buildings.

Only the buildings used by the imperial family were allowed to have nine ''jian'' (間, space between two columns); only the gates used by the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] could have five arches, with the centre one, of course, being reserved for the Emperor himself. The ancient Chinese favored the color [[red]]. The buildings faced south because the north had a cold wind.

[[Beijing]] became the [[capital of China]] after the [[Mongol]] invasion of the 13th century, completing the easterly migration of the Chinese capital begun since the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] dynasty. The [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] uprising in 1368 reasserted Chinese authority and fixed Beijing as the seat of imperial power for the next five centuries. The Emperor and the Empress lived in palaces on the central axis of the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Crown Prince]] at the eastern side, and the concubines at the back (therefore the numerous imperial concubines were often referred to as "The Back Palace Three Thousand"). However, during the mid-[[Qing Dynasty]], the Emperor's residence was moved to the western side of the complex. It is misleading to speak of an axis in the Western sense of a visual [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] ordering facades, rather the Chinese axis is a line of privilege, usually built upon, regulating access—there are no vistas, but a series of gates and pavilions.

[[File:Prince Yide's tomb, towers.jpg|thumb|left|''Que'' 闕 towers along the walls of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]]-era [[Chang'an]], as depicted in this 8th-century mural from Prince [[Li Chongrun]]'s tomb at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]] in [[Shaanxi]]]]

[[Numerology]] heavily influenced Imperial Architecture, hence the use of nine in much of construction (nine being the greatest single digit number) and the reason why the Forbidden City in Beijing is said to have 9,999.9 rooms—just short of the mythical 10,000 rooms in heaven. The importance of the East (the direction of the rising sun) in orienting and siting Imperial buildings is a form of solar worship found in many ancient cultures, where there is the notion of Ruler being affiliated with the Sun.

The tombs and mausoleums of imperial family members, such as the 8th century [[Tang Dynasty]] tombs at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], can also be counted as part of the imperial tradition in architecture. These above-ground earthen mounds and pyramids had subterranean shaft-and-vault structures that were lined with brick walls since at least the [[Warring States]] (481–221 BC).&lt;ref name="guo 2004 12"&gt;Guo, Qinghua. "Tomb Architecture of Dynastic China: Old and New Questions," ''Architectural History'' (Volume 47, 2004): 1–24. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===

Generally speaking, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] architecture follows the imperial style. A large Buddhist monastery normally has a front hall, housing the statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]], followed by a great hall, housing the statues of the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]]. Accommodations for the monks and the nuns are located at the two sides. Some of the greatest examples of this come from the 18th century [[Puning Temple (Hebei)|Puning Temple]] and [[Putuo Zongcheng Temple]]. Buddhist monasteries sometimes also have [[pagoda]]s, which may house the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha]]; older pagodas tend to be four-sided, while later pagodas usually have eight sides.

[[Daoism|Daoist]] architecture, on the other hand, usually follows the commoners' style. The main entrance is, however, usually at the side, out of [[superstition]] about [[demon]]s which might try to enter the premise (see [[feng shui]].) In contrast to the Buddhists, in a [[Daoism|Daoist]] temple the main deity is located in the main hall at the front, the lesser deities in the back hall and at the sides. This is because Chinese people believe that even after the body has died, the soul is still alive. From the Han grave design, it shows the forces of cosmic yin and yang, the two forces from the heaven and earth that creates eternity. &lt;ref&gt; Suhadolnik, Nataša Vampelj (2011).

The tallest pre-modern building in China was built for both religious and martial purposes. The [[Liaodi Pagoda]] of 1055 AD stands at a height of {{convert|84|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and although it served as the crowning pagoda of the Kaiyuan monastery in old Dingzhou, [[Hebei]], it was also used as a military [[watchtower]] for [[Song Dynasty]] soldiers to observe potential [[Liao Dynasty]] enemy movements.

The architecture of the [[List of mosques in China|mosques]] and ''[[Gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]]'' tomb shrines of [[Islam in China|China's Muslims]] often combines traditional Chinese styles with Middle Eastern influences.

==Urban planning==
{{Main|Ancient Chinese urban planning}}
Chinese urban planning is based on [[fengshui]] geomancy and the [[well-field]] system of land division, both used since the Neolithic age. The basic [[well-field]] diagram is overlaid with the luoshu, a [[magic square]] divided into 9 sub-squares, and linked with Chinese numerology.&lt;ref&gt;Schinz, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  In Southern Song Dynasty (1131AD), the design of Hongcun city in Anhui was based around "harmony between man and nature", facing south and surrounded by mountains and water. According to the theory of the traditional Chinese fengshui geomancy, it is a carefully planned ancient village and show the Human-Nature Intergraded Ecological Planning concept. &lt;ref&gt; Zheng, Shanwen; Han, Baolong; Wang, Dang; and Zhiyun Ouyang (2018).

Since wars happened in northern China very often, people moved to southern China. The building method of a courtyard house was adapted to southern China. The village of Tungyuan in Fujian Province is a good example of a planned settlement that shows the Chinese feng shui elements - psychological self-defense and building structure – in the form of material self-defense. &lt;ref&gt; Jin, Xia; and Shang-chia Chiou (2015).

==Construction==

===Materials and history===
[[File:Earthenware architecture models, Eastern Han Dynasty, 3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Models of watchtowers and other buildings made during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (AD 25–220); while these models were made of ceramics, the real versions were made of easily perishable wood and have not survived.]]
Wood was originally utilised as a primary building material because it was very common. Also, Chinese people trust that life is connecting with nature and humans should interact with animated things, therefore wood was favored as opposed to stone, which was associated with the homes of the dead.&lt;ref&gt; Li, Lin; Tang, Lei; Zhu, Haihong; Zhang, Hang; Yang, Fan; and Wenmin Qin (2017). ''Semantic 3D Modeling Based on CityGML for Ancient Chinese-Style Architectural Roofs of Digital Heritage'' (http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/5/132/htm). Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike other building construction materials, old wooden structures often do not survive because they are more vulnerable to weathering and fires and are naturally subjected to rotting over time. Although now-nonexistent wooden residential towers, watchtowers, and pagodas predated it by centuries, the [[Songyue Pagoda]] built in 523 is the oldest extant [[Chinese pagoda|pagoda in China]]; its use of [[brick]] instead of wood had much to do with its endurance throughout the centuries. From the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) onwards, brick and stone architecture gradually became more common and replaced wooden edifices. The earliest examples of this transition can be seen in building projects such as the [[Zhaozhou Bridge]] completed in 605 or the [[Xumi Pagoda]] built in 636, yet stone and brick architecture is known to have been used in subterranean tomb architecture of earlier dynasties.

The earliest walls and platforms in China were of [[rammed earth]] construction, and over time brick and stone became more frequently used. This can be seen in ancient sections of the [[Great Wall of China]], while the brick and stone Great Wall seen today is a renovation of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644).

*''Foundations'': Most buildings are typically erected on raised platforms (臺基) as their foundations. Vertical structural beams may rest on raised stone pedestals (柱础) which occasionally rest on [[Deep foundation|piles]]. In lower class construction, the platforms are constructed of rammed [[earth]] platforms that are unpaved or paved with brick or ceramics. In the simplest cases vertical structural beams are driven into the ground directly. Upper class constructions typically have high raised stone paved rammed earth or stone foundations with ornately carved heavy stone pedestals for supporting large vertical structural beams.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; The vertical beams rest and remain on their pedestals solely by friction and the pressure exerted by the building structure.&lt;ref name=yu&gt;{{citation |first=Maohong |last=YU |first2=Yoshiya |last2=ODA |first3=Dongping |last3=FANG |first4=Junhai |last4=ZHAO |title=Advances in structural mechanics of Chinese ancient architectures |journal=Front. Archit. Civ. Eng. China |year=2008 |volume=2 |pages=1–25 |doi=10.1007/s11709-008-0002-1 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Structural beams'': Use of large structural timbers for primary support of the roof of a building. Wooden timber, usually large trimmed logs, are used as load-bearing columns and lateral beams for framing buildings and supporting the roofs. These beams are connected to each other directly or, in larger and higher class structures, tied indirectly together through the use of brackets. These structural timbers are prominently displayed in finished structures. It is not definitively known how the ancient builders raised the huge wooden load bearing columns into position.
*''Structural connections'': Timber frames are typically constructed with joinery and dowelling alone, seldom with the use of glue or nails. These types of semi-rigid structural joints allow the timber structure to resist bending and torsion while under high compression.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Structural stability is further ensured through the use of heavy beams and roofs, which weighs the structure down.&lt;ref name=yu /&gt; The lack of glue or nails in joinery, the use of non-rigid support such as [[dougong]], and the used of wood as structural members allow the buildings to slide, flex, and hinge while absorbing shock, vibration, and groundshift from [[earthquake]]s without significant damage to its structure.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Dougong has a special function. The rich people applied valuable materials to decorate the Dougong for displaying their wealth. The common people used artwork to express their appreciation to the house. &lt;ref&gt; Jin, Xia; and Shang-chia Chiou (2015). ''Architectural Features and Preservation of Ancient Residential Complexes of the Changs in Xiangan, Xiamen'', page 458 (https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W7/453/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W7-453-2015.pdf). Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. &lt;/ref&gt;
*''Walls'': The common use of curtain walls or door panels to delineate rooms or enclose a building, with the general de-emphasis of [[load-bearing wall]]s in most higher class construction. However, with the reduction in availability of trees in the later dynasties for building structures, the use of load-bearing walls in non-governmental or religious construction increased, with brick and stone being commonly used.
*''Roofs'': Flat roofs are uncommon while [[gable]]d roofs are almost omnipresent in traditional Chinese architecture. Roofs are either built on roof cross-beams or rest directly on vertical structural beams. In higher class construction, roof supporting beams are supported through complex dougong bracketing systems that indirectly connect them to the primary structural beams.&lt;ref name=zggjz/&gt; Three main types of roofs are found:
*#''Straight inclined'': Roofs with a single incline. These are the most economical type of roofing and are most prevalent in commoner architectures.
*#''Multi-inclined'': Roofs with 2 or more sections of incline. These roofs are used in higher class constructions, from the dwellings of wealthy commoners to palaces.
*#''Sweeping'': Roofs with a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners of the roof. This type of roof construction is usually reserved for temples and palaces although it may also be found in the homes of the wealthy. In the former cases, the ridges of the roof are usually highly decorated with ceramic figurines.
*''Roof apex'': The roof apex of a large hall is usually topped with a ridge of tiles and statues for both decorative purposes as well as to weigh down the layers of roofing tiles for stability. These ridges are often well decorated, especially for religious or palatial structures. In some regions of China, the ridges are sometimes extended or incorporated into the walls of the building to form matouqiang (horse-head walls), which serve as a fire deterrent from drifting embers.
*''Roof top decorations'': Symbolism can be found from colors of the eaves, roofing materials and roof top decorations. Gold/yellow is an auspicious (good) color, imperial roofs are gold or yellow. They are usually used by the emperor. Green roofs symbolize bamboo shafts, which, in turn, represent youth and longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/10/content_46273.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628081026/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/10/content_46273.htm |archivedate=28 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miniature models==
{{Main|Science and technology of the Han Dynasty#Structural engineering}}
Although mostly only ruins of [[brick]] and [[rammed earth]] walls and towers from ancient China (i.e. before the 6th century AD) have survived, information on ancient Chinese architecture (especially wooden architecture) can be discerned from more or less realistic clay [[Scale model|models of buildings]] created by the ancient Chinese as funerary items. This is similar to the paper [[joss paper|joss]] houses burned in some modern Chinese funerals. The following models were made during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&amp;nbsp;– AD 220):

During the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)]] and the [[Six Dynasties]], miniature models of buildings or entire architectural ensembles were often made to decorate the tops of the so-called "soul vases" (''[[hunping]]''), found in many tombs of that period.&lt;ref name=dien&gt;{{citation

== Influence from outside of China ==
Despite largely being self-developing, there have been periods where Chinese architecture received significant influence from abroad, particularly during conquest dynasties such as the Yuan and Qing, who tended to be more outward-looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James-Chakraborty |first=Kathleen |date=2014-01-01 |pages=1–15|publisher=University of Minnesota Press |ISBN = 9780816673964 |doi = 10.5749/minnesota/9780816673964.003.0001 |chapter=Ming and Qing China |title = Architecture since 1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations and ruins of the Yuan capitol of [[Khanbaliq]] directly under the Forbidden City in Beijing were analysed by scholars to be both distinct from previous styles and ancestral to many later features of Ming and Qing architecture. Additionally the import of many Muslim officials, architects and scholars from the Islamic world during the Yuan led to an influx of Islamic design elements, especially in mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hou |first=Renzhi |year=2014 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |ISBN =9783642553202 |doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-55321-9_7 |chapter = Khanbaliq (1267–1368) of the Yüan Dynasty (1260–1368) |title = An Historical Geography of Peiping |series = China Academic Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zhenghai Mosque in Ningbo city, Zhejiang province is a type of Islamic Architecture which appeared in China during the Song dynasty (990AD). When the Arabic traders arrived at the big commercial city of Ningbo and settled down there, they spread the Muslim culture and built a mosque. Later, more mosques were built around Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Hagras, Hamada Muhammed (2017).

There are many miniature pagodas in Northeast China. They were built when the Buddhists came from India to spread Buddhism during the Liao dynasty (907-1125), and the empire supported the practice of Buddhism. They developed some new types of Buddhist architecture building with bricks. So, we can find many high-rise pagodas from Hebei Province to Beijing and Inner Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Youn-mi (2017).

== Influence in neighboring Asian countries ==
Chinese architecture has been influential in varying degrees in the development of the architecture of many neighboring Asian countries. After the Tang dynasty, the era when much Chinese culture was imported en masse by neighboring nations, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of [[Korean architecture|Korea]], [[Vietnamese architecture|Vietnam]], and [[Japanese architecture|Japan]], where the [[East Asian hip-and-gable roof]] design is ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tA_3y2XsMMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Barron's how to Prepare for the AP World History Examination|first=John|last=McCannon|date=19 March 2018|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="steinhardt 2004 228" /&gt;In [[Architecture of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], Chinese architecture has played a significant role in shaping Sri Lankan architecture, alongside influences from [[Architecture of India|Indian]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_History_of_the_British_Empire.html?id=u2G63IrFXpgC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography|first=Robin|last=Winks|date=21 October 1999|publisher=OUP Oxford|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tJM3AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=East+Asia#v=onepage&amp;q=East+Asia&amp;f=false|title=Sinhalese Monastic Architecture: The Viháras of Anurádhapura|first=S.

The [[Chinese guardian lions|Chinese-origin guardian lion]] is also found in front of Buddhist temples, buildings and some Hindu temples (in Nepal) across Asia including Japan, Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia and Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kgorman.ca/monster-monday-guardian-lions/|title=Monster Monday: Guardian Lions|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=kgorman.ca|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variation==
There is considerable regional variance in traditional Chinese architecture, some of which are very divergent from general layouts. Several of the more notable regional styles include:
===Shanxi architecture===
{{main|Shanxi architecture}} 
Shanxi preserves the oldest wooden structures in China from [[Tang dynasty]], including the [[Foguang Temple]] and [[Nanchan Temple]]. [[Yungang Grottoes]] in [[Datong]] and numerous Buddhist temples in the sacred [[Mount Wutai]] exemplify the religious architectures of China.
[[Shanxi Courtyard Houses|Shanxi family compounds]] are representative of [[vernacular architecture]] in North China. In the mountainous areas of Shanxi, [[yaodong]] is a type of [[earth shelter]] that are commonly found.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Lingnan (Cantonese) architecture===
{{main|Cantonese architecture}} 
The classical Lingnan architecture is used primarily in the southern province of [[Guangdong]] and the eastern half of the neighboring [[Guangxi]]. It is noted for its use of carvings and sculptures for decorations, green brick, balconies, "Cold alleys", "Narrow doors", and many other characteristics adaptive to the [[subtropical]] region.
&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Minnan (Hokkien) architecture===
{{main|Hokkien architecture}} 
Minnan architecture, or Hokkien architecture, refers to the architectural style of the [[Hoklo people]], the Han Chinese group who have been the dominant demographic of most of [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]]. This style is noted for its use of swallowtail roofs (heavily decorated upward-curving roof ridges) and "cut porcelain carving" for decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Hongyin, X. (2009).

===Gan architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Jiangxi}}
The [[Gan Chinese]]-speaking province of [[Jiangxi]] is noted for its distinct style, making use of bricks, wood, and stones as materials, primarily erected with wooden frames.

=== Yaodong ===
{{Main|Yaodong}}
The [[Jin Chinese]] cultural area of [[Shanxi]] and northern [[Shaanxi]] are noted for carving their homes into the sides of mountains. The soft rock of the [[Loess Plateau]] in this region makes for an excellent insulating material.&lt;gallery widths="180"&gt;

The '''competition model''' is a [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] theory of [[language acquisition]] and [[sentence processing]], developed by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]] (1981).

The model suggests that the meaning of language is interpreted by comparing a number of linguistic 'cues' (signaling specific functions) within a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], and that language is learned through the competition of basic cognitive mechanisms inside a rich linguistic environment.

It is an [[emergentism|emergentist]] theory of language acquisition and processing, serving as an alternative to strict [[psychological nativism|innatist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] theories.

According to the competition model, competitive cognitive processes operate on a [[phylogenetic]], [[ontogenetic]], and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] scale, allowing language acquisition to take place across a wide variety of chronological periods.

==Theoretical components==

===Sentence processing===
In its original instantiation, the competition model was proposed as a theory of cross-linguistic [[sentence processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Crosslinguistic Study of Sentence Processing |last=MacWhinney |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian MacWhinney |author2=[[Elizabeth Bates]]  |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-26196-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition model suggests that people interpret the [[semantics|meaning]] of a sentence by taking into account various linguistic cues contained in the sentence context ('cotext'), such as [[word order]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and semantic characteristics (e.g., [[animacy]]), to compute a [[probability|probabilistic]] value for each interpretation, eventually choosing the interpretation with the highest likelihood.  According to the model, '''cue weights''' are learned inductively on the basis of a 'constrained set of sentence types' and 'limited predictions of sentence meaning' for each language.

Because different languages use different cues to signal meanings, the competition model maintains that cue weights will differ between languages, and users of a given language will use the cue weights associated with that language, to guide their interpretation of sentences.

Thus, when people learn other languages, they must learn which cues are important in which languages, in order to successfully interpret sentences in any language.

===Language acquisition===
More recently, the competition model has been developed into a unified theory of [[language acquisition|first]] and [[second language acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of bilingualism: Psycholinguistic approaches |last=Kroll |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith F. Kroll |author2=Annette M. B. DeGroot |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-19-515177-1 |pages=49–67  |chapter=A unified model of language acquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its scope has been expanded to account for a number of psycholinguistic processes involved in language acquisition, including arenas, cues, storage, chunking, codes, and resonance.

The expanded version of the competition model posits that each of these cognitive mechanisms controls the activation of representations in the target language – and in the native language, as for L2 learners – which compete in the mind of the learner during acquisition and usage of the language.

As in the original version of the model, the weights of the competing representations are computed and adjusted in real-time, based on the learner's experience with the target language.

Thus, the model infers that as the extensiveness of learners' exposure to the target language increases, they will gain an increasingly complete and nuanced understanding of the meaning of sentences in the target language.

===Emergentism===
By definition, the competition model is an [[emergentism|emergentist]] theory of language acquisition.

Rather than viewing language acquisition as a process that is based on innate, language-specific mechanisms (e.g., [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]'s concepts of the [[language acquisition device]] and [[universal grammar]]), or rather as completely dependent upon one's experience with [[language]] or on the influence of the environment, the competition model views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal.

By applying general cognitive processes to the language stimulus in the presence of a rich and stimulating environment, we are able to connect intrinsically meaningless symbols ([[word]]s and sentences) to their [[reference|referents]], which allows us to infer meaning.

Thus, in addition to relying on traditional mechanisms of [[cognition|human information processing]], the competition model posits that language acquisition must be [[embodied philosophy|embodied and situated]] in order for learners to derive meaning from language.

In this sense, the competition model follows many of the principles of [[situated cognition]], [[situated learning]], and [[legitimate peripheral participation]].

==Chronological scales==

===Synchronic relevance===
On the [[synchrony (linguistics)|synchronic]] time scale of online [[language processing]], the competition model hypothesizes that utterances provide cues that adjudicate the competition between alternative interpretations. It views language processing as a series of competitions between lexical items, phonological forms, and syntactic patterns. Studies based on the Competition Model have shown that learning of language forms relies on the accurate recording of many exposures to [[words]] and [[patterns]] in different [[Context (language use)|contexts]]. If a pattern is reliably present in adult language input, [[children]] acquire it quickly. Rare and unreliable language patterns are learned late and are relatively weaker, even in adults.

===Ontogenetic relevance===
On the [[ontogenetic]] time scale, the competition model posits that language [[emergentism|emergence]] can be examined in at least two ways. One methodology uses [[neural network]] models to simulate the acquisition of detailed [[grammar|grammatical]] structures. Competition model researchers have constructed [[connectionism|connectionist]] models for the acquisition of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[lexicon]] in several languages, including [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. More recently, the ontogenetic emergence of language has been examined from a biological viewpoint, using data on language processing from children with early [[ataxia#Focal lesions|focal lesions]]. The results of studies of these children using [[reaction time]] methodologies and [[neuropsychological tests]] indicate that, although they have completely normal functional use of language, detailed aspects of processing are slower in some cases. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] technology, areas of neurological activation involved in specific linguistic tasks have been pinpointed in these children. These results have allowed researchers to evaluate a series of hypotheses regarding [[critical period hypothesis|sensitive periods]] for the emergence of language in the [[human brain|brain]].

===Phylogenetic relevance===
On the [[phylogenetic]] time scale, researchers working within the framework of the competition model have begun to examine the ways in which language originally emerged through competitive Darwinian processes. Research on cognitive perspective taking, competition, and brain mechanisms suggests that the most likely account of the [[origin of language]] is one grounded on language as a medium of [[social interaction]]. In this sense, the elaboration of an emergent account of perspective taking suggests a [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotskyan]] approach to language evolution.

==Applications==

===Perspective taking===
On the level of mental model construction, the [[communication|communicative]] functions of language postulated by the competition model have been related to the process of perspective taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacWhinney|first=Brian|year=1977|title=Starting points|url=|journal=Language|volume=53|pages=152–168|via=|doi=10.2307/413059}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process allows the human mind to construct an ongoing cognitive simulation of the meaning of an utterance coded in linguistic abstractions, through the use of perceptual realities derived from one's [[embodied cognition|embodied experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How mental models encode embodied linguistic perspectives. In Klatzkty, MacWhinney, &amp; Behrmann Embodiment, Ego-Space and Action|last=MacWhinney|first=Brian|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2008|isbn=|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=368–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective taking approach views the [[syntax|forms of grammar]] as emerging from repeated acts of perspective taking and perspective switching during online [[sentence comprehension|language comprehension]]. Grammatical devices such as [[pronoun]]s, [[grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], and attachment can all be seen as ways of expressing shifts in a basically ego-centered perspective. One major goal in this line of research is to better understand the brain mechanisms underlying perspective shifting during language comprehension.

===Second language acquisition===
In addition to accounting for the [[language acquisition|acquisition of a first language]] by children, the competition model accounts for the [[second language acquisition|learning of second languages]]. In its conceptualization, the model's creators used linguistic data from 18 different languages to elaborate the parameters and mechanisms of the model. 

Empirical studies conducted within the competition model framework have supported the predictions of a connectionist perspective, emphasizing the role of [[Language transfer|transfer and interference]] in second language learning.

Although first and second language acquisition share many features in common, they also differ because of a series of four risk factors (''entrenchment'', ''transfer'', ''over analysis'', and ''social isolation'') which the adult second language learner faces. Fortunately, a determined adult second language learner can also rely on a series of protective factors to compensate for these disadvantages.  

These compensatory factors include ''resonance'', working to connect new L2 forms; ''decoupling'', operating to bind together L2 as separate from L1; ''chunking'', reducing the effects of overanalysis; and ''participation'', countering the tendency to social isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multiidimensional SLA in S.

'''Construction bidding''' is the process of submitting a proposal ([[Request for tender|tender]]) to undertake, or manage the undertaking of a construction project. The process starts with a [[cost estimate]] from [[blueprints]] and [[material take off]]s.

The tender is treated as an offer to do the work for a certain amount of money (firm price), or a certain amount of profit ([[Reimbursement|cost reimbursement]] or cost plus). The tender, which is submitted by the competing firms, is generally based on a [[bill of quantities]], a bill of approximate quantities or other specifications which enable the tenders to attain higher levels of accuracy, the [[statement of work]].

For instance, a bill of quantities is a list of all the materials (and other work such as amount of excavation) of a project which have sufficient detail to obtain a realistic cost, or rate per described item of work/material. The tenders should not only show the unit cost per material/work, but should also if possible, break it down to labour, plant and material costs. In this way the individual who is selecting the tender will be quite confident that the tender is feasible. Bids are not only chosen on cost alone. Sometimes contractors submit lower tenders to win the contract and win the work. Either the costs that the [[General contractor|contractor]] incurs are greater than the price he is charging the client (as a consequence of a lower tender determining the contract sum), and thus is likely to go [[Insolvency|insolvent]], or he will claim for "loss and/or expense" due to discrepancies in the contract documents (this can be done deliberately). The lowest tender is not always a feasible tender. The lowest tender is the most likely to increase the contract sum the most throughout the course of the project.

==Bid solicitation==
Bid solicitation is the process of making published construction data readily available to interested parties, including [[Construction management|construction managers]], contractors, and the public. There are several services, including government entities and private plan rooms, that allow project owners to release project details to solicit and obtain contractor bids. These services act as a gateway for project owners to release project information to a large group of contractors, general contractors or [[Subcontractor|subcontractors]] in an attempt to solicit bids. Many of these services are subscription based or charge a [[flat rate]] for project data.

==Contractual formation==
Depending upon the language in the bid proposal, a subcontracting construction company could make its bid final, and, if accepted, a [[Contract|legally enforceable contract]] is created. In these circumstances, upon determination by the general contractor that a bid is the lowest offer, it can accept the bid and, upon acceptance, a subcontractor cannot renege or revoke its offer. The language of the bid or offer can impact the court's determination of whether the subcontractor intended for further negotiations to take place, or whether the bid was intended to be an option or unilateral agreement to enter into a contract upon acceptance of the offer.

==Types of project delivery==
The most common methods of construction project delivery include [[design-bid-build]] (DBB), the [[design-build]] (DB), the construction-manager-as-constructor approach and a negotiated approach. Each of these methods have advantages and disadvantages and they all can be used to successfully plan, design and undertake a given construction project.

===Traditional procurement===
The traditional [[procurement]] method is the most common construction delivery method. This process begins with an owner selecting an [[architect]] to prepare construction documents. These are prepared using drafting standards such as the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] ICE Conditions of Contract, or the [[NEC Engineering and Construction Contract]]. In most cases, the architect will release these construction documents publicly, or to a select group of general contractors, who will then place a bid on the project which reflects what they believe cost of construction will total. This bid is inclusive of a multitude of subcontractor bids for each specific trade. The general contractor’s fee is generally built into the bid cost. Most government contracts are bid competitively using this method.

===Digital procurement===
The digital procurement method is rapidly emerging. There are various web sites and applications that provide electronic bidding, [[Request for tender|tender calls]], scope work, [https://designbids.in/ designbids], [https://www.buildtools.com/ BuildTools] and related services.

===Design-build===
{{Main article|Design–build}}Design-build (or design/build, and abbreviated D-B or D/B accordingly) is a construction project delivery system where, in contrast to traditional "design-bid-build" (or "design-tender"), the design and construction aspects are contracted for with a single entity known as the design-builder or design-build contractor. The design-builder is usually the general contractor, but in many cases it is also the design professional ([[architect]] or [[Construction engineering|engineer]]). This system is used to minimize the project risk for an owner and to reduce the delivery schedule by overlapping the design phase and construction phase of a project. Where the design-builder is the contractor, the design professionals are typically retained directly by the contractor.

====History====
The design/build delivery system often cites the original "master builder" model used to build most [[History of engineering|pre-modern]] projects. Under the master builder approach, a central figure of the architect held total project accountability. From inception to completion, the master builder was the key organizational figure and strictly liable to the owner for defects, delays, and losses. The design/build system is a return to some of the fundamentals of the Master Builder approach.

====Overview of process====
Design-build focuses on combining the design, permit, and construction [[Schedule (project management)|schedules]] in order to streamline the traditional design-bid-build environment. This does not shorten the time it takes to complete the individual tasks of creating construction documents ([[Plan (drawing)|working drawings]] and specifications), acquiring [[Construction permit|building]] and other permits, or actually constructing the building. Instead, a design-build firm will strive to bring together design and construction professionals in a collaborative environment to complete these tasks at the same time. 

Typically the hallmark of a design/build project is that one organization is responsible for both design and construction of the project. If this organization is a contractor, the process is known as "contractor-led design-build". If the organization is a [[Design|design firm]], the process is known as "design-led design-build". In either case, the organization employed by the owner rarely handles both aspects of design and construction in-house. In fact, the organization often subcontracts with on-site personnel (if design-led) as well as architects and engineers (if contractor-led).

====Potential problems of design-build====
Cost estimating for a design-build project is sometimes difficult because design documents are often preliminary and may change over the course of the project. As a result, design-build contracts are often written to allow for unexpected situations without penalizing either the design-builder or the owner. Several organizations (such as the Design/Build Institute of America) provide [[Standard form contract|standardized form contracts]] for design-builders to use, but it is not unusual for the design-builder to provide its own contractual documents. 

This uncertainty requires the owner to rely a great deal on the integrity, acumen, and competence of the design-builder. As the certainty of estimates decreases, the opinion of the construction professionals of the design-build firm must be trustworthy, accurate, and reasonably verifiable in order to minimize risk.

====Benefits of design-build====
It is important to note that the design-build method, while not focused on saving the owner construction costs, nonetheless often saves the owner money on the overall project. The combined effects of carrying a [[construction loan]] (which typically carries a higher interest rate than permanent financing) and an earlier useful on-line date usually yields considerable overall profitability to the project and may make seemingly unfeasible projects into genuine opportunities. 

The compression of time is only one important aspect of implementing this system.

====Other attributes include====
*Increased accountability by the service provider,
*Single source project delivery, and
*A value based project feedback system

====Accountability====
Rather than a parcelized level of responsibility of the classic design-bid-build, design-build provides an integrated solution for the owner or client. This moves projects away from the "finger-pointing" that is often commonplace in contemporary construction projects, and allows the owner to look to one entity with any questions or concerns.

====Single source====
Instead of having several contractors and consultants, an owner has just one entity to deal with. Design revisions, project feedback, budgeting, permitting, construction issues, change orders, and billing can all be routed through the design-build firm. This single point of contact allows a certain degree of flexibility for the owner. Most design-builders will leverage that flexibility for the owner's benefit by continually refining the construction program to maximize the owner's value at the completion of the project.

====Value-based project feedback====
Typically, in order for a contractor to bid on a project, very specific details relating to the methods and materials must be given to avoid any ambiguity and to make an "apples to apples" comparison of bids. In a design-build context, the owner, the owner's other consultants, and the design-builder can work together to determine what methods and materials will maximize the owner's value. In instances where marginally more expensive materials, designs, or construction methods might yield a higher return on investment for the owner than those of lower cost, the owner is free to adjust the project's program without having to [[Bidding|re-bid]] the entire project.

===Construction manager as constructor===
Under this delivery method, a construction manager is hired prior to the completion of the [[Engineering design process|design phase]] to act as a project coordinator and general contractor. Unlike the DBB method, a construction manager is hired during the design phase, which allows the construction manager to work directly with the architect and circumvent any potential design issues before completion of the construction documents. After documents are completed, the construction manager accepts bids for the various divisions of work from subcontractors or general contractors.

===Negotiated===
This delivery method is similar to the [[design–bid–build]] method in that design and construction are performed by different firms. Unlike the design-bid-build approach, a general contractor and an architect are selected at the project’s inception.  These firms work together throughout the design phase. When design documents are complete, the final construction costs are negotiated by the general contractor through bids from subcontractors on various [[Scope (project management)|scopes of work]].

'''Dai Nippon Butoku Kai''' {{lang|ja|大日本武徳会}} ("Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society") was originally established in 1895 in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.konishi.co.jp/html/fujiyama/konishibunko/shirayuki_MTS/MTS05.html "Konishibunko]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of World War II, the DNBK changed its status from a public to a private organization.  Enrollment fell significantly from millions to hundreds and it lost its authority to  govern all martial arts organizations in Japan. In 1946, due to its association with the Japanese Military during wartime, the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|GHQ]] dissolved the DNBK.  The following years, more than 1,300 leaders and officials of the DNBK were [[Purge (occupied Japan)|purged]]—ostracized, lost their jobs, and were forbidden to take any government position. In 1953, the DNBK was re-established with a new philosophical vision of preserving the long-standing illustrious classical martial virtues and traditions.&lt;ref name="whatisdnbk"&gt;[http://asaikarate.com/what-is-dai-nippon-butoku-kai-%E5%A4%A7%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E6%AD%A6%E5%BE%B3%E4%BC%9A%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AF%EF%BC%9F/ "What is the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai?]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s a systematic appropriation of martial arts by the state was underway, fueled in the successful wake of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], sped up even more in 1942-1945 during the apex of Japan's "militarisation"(sengika.) This led to a number of "unprecedented policies aimed at making martial arts education combat effective and ideologically aligned with ultra-nationalistic government policy" &lt;ref name="alexbennettkansai" /&gt; were set into motion. This strove to corral any and all budo organizations under state control to which the proposal of the "National Physical Strength Deliberation Council" sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Welfare recommended that an "all-encompassing extra-governmental organization" formed between the five ministries of Kōseishō (Health and Welfare), Mombushō (Education), Rikugunshō(Army), Kaigunshō (Navy) and the Naimushō (Home) which promoted budō in schools, community organizations and groups. This was an effective way to expand the reach and breadth of the harmful propaganda being issued by the ultra nationalistic government into the community, plus allowing a clear path to community indoctrination through budō programs; especially notable was the efforts targeting children and schools that is apparent by the amount of funding it received, allocated by a national budget at the time.

The response was as follows: 
"We have reached a consensus to restructure the Dai-Nippon Butokukai, a registered society that has contributed to the advancement of budō for many years, and incorporate it into the organs of government."
&lt;ref name="alexbennettkansai" /&gt; This allowed public funding to be spent on a larger project nationally.

After the end of [[World War II]], the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers ([[General Douglas MacArthur]]) issued a directive to dissolve any and all military-related or nationalistic propaganda organizations. The disbanding was done under the "Removal and Exclusion of Undesirable Personnel from Public Office," which issued a purge directive contained in SCAPIN9 548 (Removal of Ultranationalists) clearly stating:
"ultra-nationalistic or militaristic social, political, professional and commercial societies and institutions will be dissolved and prohibited."

This was accompanied by SCAPIN 550 (Removal and Exclusion of Undesirable Personnel from Public Office) which states:
"Persons who have been active exponents of militarism and militant nationalism will be removed and excluded from public office and from any positions of public or substantial private responsibility."

In a memorandum proposed to the Chief of Staff, it also stated:
"Dissolution of Dai Nippon Butokukai by order to the Imperial Japanese Government is recommended in accordance with the provisions of SCAPIN 548 Paragraph I-f on the grounds that this is an organization 'affording military or quasi-military training' and which provides for the 'perpetuation of militarism' or a martial spirit in Japan." &lt;ref name="alexbennettkansai" /&gt;

==The Reestablishment of DNBK==
In 1953, a new organization with the name Dai Nippon Butoku Kai was established with the philosophical vision of preserving the long-standing illustrious classical martial virtues and traditions. This DNBK aims for the restoration of classical martial cultures, supporting allied research, instruction and service, promotion of international peace and harmony, and the advancement of greater humanity through Budo education.

Though this organization applied to be recognized as an official organization with the Japanese government in 1953, granting of this status was rejected until 2012, as it was opposed by multiple organizations (such as the [[All Japan Kendo Federation]], and the [[All Japan Judo Federation]]) which had inherited the original DNBK's duties and operations. While it is recognized by the government as an official organization, similar to other organizations, it is no longer directly tied with any government office such as the ministry of sports or ministry of education, and therefore does not have the same access to the official training halls (Butokuden) like the original, and its current membership is in the few thousands. &lt;ref name="whatisdnbk" /&gt;

The first official branch outside Japan was established in Virginia (USA) and in 1985 a division in the east coast USA.

In 1974, DNBK officially established the International Division overseeing all international members. In 2011, DNBK has official representatives and coordinators in Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Israel, Hungary, Russia, Germany, Spain, Malta, France and California USA, Hawaii USA, Mid-Western USA, Boston USA, Arizona USA, Florida USA, Australia, Romania, Switzerland, Armenia, Chile, Switzerland, Greece, Gibraltar, Austria, and Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnbk.org/ The official website of Dai Nippon Butoku Kai(DNBK)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Northern Ireland}}

The '''Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure''' ('''DCAL'''), translated in [[Irish Language|Irish]] as ''An Roinn Cultúir, Ealaíon agus Fóillíochta'' and in [[Ulster Scots dialect|Ulster-Scots]] as ''Männystrie o Fowkgates, Airts an Aisedom'',&lt;ref&gt;''Männystrie o Fowkgates, Airts an Aisedom'' is the name used by the Department itself, although other variants, like the ''Depairtment o Cultur, Airts an Leisur'', are also in use.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] [[government]] department in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The minister with overall responsibility for the department was the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure.

After the [[election to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2016]], the DCAL was closed and its roles and functions were amalgamated with other departments in order to reduce the size of the Northern Ireland Executive.

==Aim==
DCAL's overall vision is a "confident, creative, informed and healthy society". It describes its mission as delivering economic growth and enhancing the quality of life in Northern Ireland by "unlocking the full potential of the culture, arts and leisure sectors."&lt;ref&gt;Northern Ireland Budget 2011–15, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Minister was [[Carál Ní Chuilín]] ([[Sinn Féin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/work-of-the-executive/ministers-and-their-departments.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016032100/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/work-of-the-executive/ministers-and-their-departments.htm |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }} Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister was, by virtue of office, the Keeper of the Records for Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure|title=Site construction begins for the new PRONI Headquarters|url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-dcal/news-dcal-november-2008/news-dcal-241108-site-construction-begins.htm|publisher=Northern Ireland Executive|accessdate=18 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424134208/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-dcal/news-dcal-november-2008/news-dcal-241108-site-construction-begins.htm|archivedate=24 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following a [[Northern Irish Belfast Agreement referendum, 1998|referendum]] on the [[Belfast Agreement]] on 23 May 1998 and the granting of [[royal assent]] to the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] on 19 November 1998, a [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]] were established by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Government]] under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. The process was known as [[devolution]] and was set up to return devolved legislative powers to Northern Ireland. DCAL was one of five new devolved Northern Ireland departments created in December 1999 by the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] and the [[The Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999|Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999]].

A devolved minister first took office on 2 December 1999.  Devolution was suspended for four periods, during which the department came under the responsibility of [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] ministers from the [[Northern Ireland Office]]:
* between 12 February 2000&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Commencement) Order 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and 30 May 2000;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
* on 11 August 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* on 22 September 2001;&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) (No.2) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) (No.2) Order 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* between 15 October 2002&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Suspension of Devolved Government) Order 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and 8 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Northern Ireland Act 2000 (Restoration of Devolved Government) Order 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 8 May 2007, devolution has operated without interruption.

Under the [[St Andrews Agreement]] (signed 13 October 2006), the Executive is obliged to adopt strategies on enhancing and protecting the development of the [[Irish language]] and enhancing and developing [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] language, heritage and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/28D Section 28D, Northern Ireland Act 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/28E Section 28E, Northern Ireland Act 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement also committed the [[United Kingdom Government]] to introducing "an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St Andrews Agreement |year=2006 |url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf |accessdate=21 March 2012 |page=11 |chapter=Human Rights, Equality, Victims and Other Issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104144328/http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf |archivedate=4 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and Irish are official languages in those respective countries.

Language policy was devolved, alongside the department's other responsibilities, on 8 May 2007.  As of March 2012, neither an Irish language strategy or act, nor an Ulster Scots strategy, had been adopted. The department stated that a ''Strategy for Indigenous or Regional Minority Languages'' "will be presented to the Executive in due course".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language/Cultural Diversity|url=http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08.htm|publisher=Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure|accessdate=11 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025002023/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/language-cultural-diversity-r08.htm|archivedate=25 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Educational perennialism''' is a [[Philosophy_of_education#Normative_educational_philosophies|normative educational philosophy]]. [[Perennialist]]s believe that one should teach the things that are of everlasting pertinence to all people everywhere, and that the emphasis should be on principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, rather than machines or techniques, and about liberal, rather than vocational, topics.

Although perennialism may appear similar to [[educational essentialism|essentialism]], perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be [[teacher]]-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as [[educational progressivism|progressivism]]. However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces{{what?|date=December 2017}} themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated [[Socratic method]], which, if carried out as true dialogue, involves a balance between teacher activity and student activity, with the teacher promoting discussion.

==Secular perennialism==
The word perennial in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. As promoted primarily by [[Robert Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended.  This form of perennialism comprises the [[Humanism|humanist]] and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the [[University of Chicago]], where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core.  Other notable figures in the movement include [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] (who together initiated the [[Great Books]] program at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in Annapolis, Maryland), [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Alexander Meiklejohn]], and Sir [[Richard Livingstone]], an English [[Classicism|classicist]] with an American following.

Secular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually developing common oriented base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical [[paradigm shift]]s or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated.&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Paul D. and Ronald W. Rebore. ''Foundations of Education, Becoming a Teacher''. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: 1990. P. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; They firmly believe that exposure of all citizens to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the occidental oriented tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights and responsibilities inherent to a true Democracy.

Adler states: &lt;blockquote&gt;
... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J. [http://radicalacademy.com/adlerreformedu.htm "Reforming Education — No Quick Fix"]. ''The Radical Academy''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hutchins writes in the same vein: &lt;blockquote&gt;
The business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to "our" group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ...&lt;ref name="Hutchins"&gt;Hutchins, Robert Maynard. ''Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education''. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York: 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with the [[Educational essentialism|essentialists]], perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but stress that the overall aim should be exposure to history's finest thinkers as models for discovery.  The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts.&lt;ref&gt;Kneller, George F. ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Education''. John Wiley &amp; Sons: 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler states: "The three R's, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education."&lt;ref&gt;Adler: op. cit., p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular perennialists agree with [[Educational progressivism|progressivists]] that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful [[great books]] of the [[Western canon]]. These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the world's finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the "[[Great Conversation]]" of humanity with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works (abridged translations being acceptable as well) is that these are the products of "[[genius]]". Hutchins remarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.&lt;ref name="Hutchins"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is important to note that the Great Conversation is not static, which is the impression that one might obtain from some descriptions of perennialism, a confusion with religious perennialism, or even the term perennialism itself.  The Great Conversation and the set of related great books changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses, and is therefore representative of an evolution of thought, but is not based upon the whim or fancy of the latest cultural fads.  Hutchins makes this point very clear:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the discussion that they have carried on.&lt;ref name="Hutchins"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perennialism was a solution proposed in response to what was considered by many to be a failing educational system. Again Hutchins writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The products of American high schools are illiterate; and a degree from a famous college or university is no guarantee that the graduate is in any better case. One of the most remarkable features of American society is that the difference between the "uneducated" and the "educated" is so slight.&lt;ref name="Hutchins"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this regard [[John Dewey]] and Hutchins were in agreement. Hutchins's book ''The Higher Learning in America'' deplored the "plight of higher learning" that had turned away from cultivation of the intellect and toward anti-intellectual practicality due in part, to a lust for money. In a highly negative review of the book, Dewey wrote a series of articles in ''The Social Frontier'' which began by applauding Hutchins' attack on "the aimlessness of our present educational scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Erlich, Thomas. "Dewey versus Hutchins: The Next Round". ''Education and Democracy: Re-imagining Liberal Learning in America''. Ed. Robert Orril. College Entrance Examination Board, New York: 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perennialists believe that reading is to be supplemented with mutual investigations (between the teacher and the student) and minimally-directed discussions through the [[Socratic method]] in order to develop a historically oriented understanding of concepts. They argue that accurate, independent reasoning distinguishes the developed or educated mind and they thus stress the development of this faculty. A skilled teacher would keep discussions on topic and correct errors in reasoning, but it would be the class, not the teacher, who would reach the conclusions.  While not directing or leading the class to a conclusion, the teacher may work to accurately formulate problems within the scope of the texts being studied.

While the standard argument for utilizing a modern text supports distillation of information into a form relevant to modern society, perennialists argue that many of the historical debates and the development of ideas presented by the great books are relevant to any society, at any time, and thus that the suitability of the great books for instructional use is unaffected by their age.

Perennialists freely acknowledge that any particular selection of great books will disagree on many topics; however, they see this as an advantage, rather than a detriment. They believe that the student must learn to recognize such disagreements, which often reflect current debates. The student becomes responsible for thinking about the disagreements and reaching a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the Socratic discussions. They do not advocate teaching a settled scholarly interpretation of the books, which would cheat the student of the opportunity to learn rational criticism and to know his own mind.

==Religious perennialism==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of education]] --&gt;
Perennialism was originally religious in nature, developed first by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the thirteenth century in his work ''[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer11.htm De Magistro]'' (''The Teacher'').

In the nineteenth century, [[John Henry Newman]] presented a defense of religious perennialism in ''The Idea of a University''. Discourse 5 of that work, "Knowledge Its Own End", is a recent statement of a Christian educational perennialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newmanreader.org/works/idea/discourse5.html|title=Discourse 5. Knowledge its Own End|last=Newman|first=John Henry|website=The National Institute for Newman Studies|access-date=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several epistemological options, which affect the pedagogical options. The possibilities may be surveyed by considering four extreme positions, as indicated in the following table:

==Colleges exemplifying this philosophy==
* [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] is a well-known secular liberal arts college which requires a year-long humanities course covering ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Students may pursue an optional extension to this core curriculum in later years.
* [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] is a secular liberal arts college with an undergraduate program described as "an all-required course of study based on the great books of the Western tradition".
* The [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], is another example of a well-known example of educational perennialism. 
* The [[University of Chicago]]'s Common Core, established by [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] is another well-known example of educational perennialism. Similar to [[Columbia College of Columbia University]], it is an uncommon example of an educational perennialistic college within a large research institution. 
* Integral Program at [[Saint Mary's College of California]] in [http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/undergraduate/programs_by_school/school_of_liberal_arts/programs/integral/] is a [[Great Books]] major at the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Lasallian]] Catholic liberal arts college in [[Moraga, California]]. The program was designed with the assistance of faculty from St. John's College, U.S.
* [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in [[Santa Paula, California]] is a Catholic Christian college with a Great Books curriculum. The college was founded by a group of graduates and professors of the Integral Program at Saint Mary's College of California, who were discouraged by the liberalism that became common place among the faculty and administration on Saint Mary's campus shortly after [[Vatican II]].
* [[Gutenberg College]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]] provides "a broad-based liberal arts education in a Protestant Christian environment", with a "great books" curriculum emphasizing "the development of basic learning skills (reading, writing, mathematics, and critical thinking) and the application of these skills to profound writings of the past".
* [[Shimer College]] in [[Chicago]] grants a Bachelor of Arts to students who complete a program composed of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, integrative studies and a capstone senior thesis.
* The Torrey Honors Institute at [[Biola University]] is a Christian Great Books program.
* [[George Wythe University]] in [[Cedar City, Utah]], is an unaccredited [[liberal arts]] school.
* [http://www.thomasmorecollege.edu/ Thomas More College] in Merrimack, New Hampshire is a Catholic College with an integrated [http://www.thomasmorecollege.edu/academics/course-descriptions/ Liberal Arts curriculum]. The program includes [http://www.thomasmorecollege.edu/student-life/catholic-guilds/ poetry and folk, art and wood guild]. The College also offers a [http://www.thomasmorecollege.edu/academics/semester-in-rome/ Rome Semester], when students have the chance to study Ancient and Medieval Art &amp; Architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56812">A person's '''Erdős–Bacon number''' is the sum of one's [[Erdős number]]—which measures the "collaborative distance" in authoring academic papers between that person and Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]—and one's [[Bacon number]]—which represents the number of links, through roles in films, by which the individual is separated from American actor [[Kevin Bacon]].&lt;ref name=Singh2002&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Singh |authorlink=Simon Singh |title=And the winner tonight is |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4768389/And-the-winner-tonight-is.html |work=The Telegraph |date=May 1, 2002 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112081753/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4768389/And-the-winner-tonight-is.html |archivedate=November 12, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday20070814&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20070814/bl_cover14_side.art.htm |title=There's not much separating her from Bacon, Erdos |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104060408/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20070814/bl_cover14_side.art.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower the number, the closer a person is to Erdős and Bacon, which reflects a [[small world phenomenon]] in academia and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/30835 |year=1998 |last1=Collins |first1=James J. |last2=Chow |first2=Carson C. |journal=Nature |volume=393 |issue=6684 |pages=409–10 |pmid=9623993 |title=It's a small world|bibcode=1998Natur.393..409C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined Erdős/Bacon [sic]&lt;!-- was originally written with a slash --&gt; number was introduced by mathematicians Tim Hsu and David Grabiner sometime before late-January 1999, when they pointed out that [[Daniel Kleitman]] has a combined number of 3: a Bacon number of 2 and Erdős number of 1.&lt;ref name="enp1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/Erdoshp.html |title=The Erdös Number Project |first=Jerry |last=Grossman |date=January 27, 1999 |publisher=Oakland University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203155656/http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/Erdoshp.html |archivedate=1999-02-03}}. Current version at {{cite web |url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp |title=The Erdös Number Project |publisher=Oakland University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To have a defined Erdős–Bacon number, it is necessary to have both appeared in a film and co-authored an academic paper, although this in and of itself is not sufficient.
&lt;!--Paul Erdős has an Erdős–Bacon number of 3, having a Bacon number of 3 and an Erdős number of 0.

[[File:Blue eyes.JPG|thumb|[[Nazar (amulet)|Nazars]], [[amulet|charms]] used to ward off the evil eye.]]
The '''evil eye''' is a curse or legend  believed to be cast by a malevolent glare, usually given to a person when they are unaware. Many cultures believe that receiving the evil eye will cause misfortune or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=C|title=Hypothesis:The Electrophysicological Basis of the Evil Eye Belief|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|year=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1556-3537.2010.01020.x|volume=21|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talisman]]s created to protect against the evil eye are also frequently called "evil eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evil%20eye |title=Definition for "evil eye" from Merriam Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/197336/evil-eye |title=evil eye (occult) |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea expressed by the term causes many different cultures to pursue protective measures against it. The concept and its significance vary widely among different [[cultural diversity|cultures]], primarily in [[West Asia]]. The idea appears multiple times in [[rabbinic literature|Jewish rabbinic literature]].&lt;ref name=ulmer&gt;{{cite book |title=The evil eye in the Bible and in rabbinic literature |author=Ulmer, Rivka |editor=KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |year=1994 |isbn=0-88125-463-0|page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cwB8Hfkjpx0C&amp;pg=PA176}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a widely extended belief among many Mediterranean and Asian tribes and cultures. [[Amulet|Charms]] and decorations with eye-like symbols known as [[Nazar (amulet)|nazars]], which are used to repel the evil eye, are a common sight across [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Albania]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], parts of [[North India]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Morocco]], southern [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Levant]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Syria]], and [[Mexico]], and have become a popular choice of souvenir with tourists.

==History==
Belief in the evil eye dates back to [[Classical antiquity]]. It is referenced by [[Hesiod]], [[Callimachus]], [[Plato]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Theocritus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Aulus Gellius]]. Peter Walcot's ''Envy and the Greeks'' (1978) listed more than one hundred works by these and other authors mentioning the evil eye.

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Antiochia - House of the Evil Eye.jpg|thumb|Roman-era mosaic from Antioch depicting a plethora of devices against the evil eye]]
Classical authors attempted both to describe and to explain the function of the evil eye. Plutarch's scientific explanation stated that the eyes were the chief, if not sole, source of the deadly rays that were supposed to spring up like poisoned darts from the inner recesses of a person possessing the evil eye. Plutarch treated the phenomenon of the evil eye as something seemingly inexplicable that is a source of wonder and cause of incredulity.{{efn|Plutarch, ''[[Moralia]]'', Book VII}} Pliny the Elder described the ability of certain African enchanters to have the "power of fascination with the eyes and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze".{{efn|Pliny the Elderh, ''[[Natural History|Natural History (Pliny)]]'', VII.2}}

The idea of the evil eye appears in the poetry of [[Virgil]] in a conversation between the shepherds Menalcas and Damoetas.{{efn|Virgil, ''[[Eclogues]]'', III.1.103}} In the passage, Menalcas is lamenting the poor health of his stock: "What eye is it that has fascinated my tender lambs?".

====Protection from the eye====
The belief in the evil eye during antiquity varied across different regions and periods. The evil eye was not feared with equal intensity in every corner of the Roman Empire. There were places in which people felt more conscious of the danger of the evil eye. In Roman times, not only were individuals considered to possess the power of the evil eye but whole tribes, especially those of Pontus and Scythia, were believed to be transmitters of the evil eye.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[fascinum|phallic charm]] called ''[[wikt:fascinum#Latin|fascinum]]'' in Latin, from the verb ''fascinare'', "to cast a spell" (the origin of the English word "[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]") is one example of an apotropaic object used against the evil eye. They have been found throughout Europe and into the Middle East from contexts dating from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitmore, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Fascinating ''fascina'': apotropaic magic and how to wear a penis |editor1=Cifarelli, M. |editor2=Gawlinkski, L. |title=What shall I say of clothes? Theoretical and Methodological Approaches to the Study of Dress in Antiquity |place=Boston, MA |publisher=[[American Institute of Archaeology]] |pages=47-65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phallic charms were often objects of personal adornment (such as pendants and finger rings), but also appeared as stone carvings on buildings,&lt;ref name='BAR'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parker, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Protecting the Troops?

In describing their ability to deflect the Evil Eye, [[Ralph Merrifield]] described the Roman phallic charm as a "kind of lightning conductor for bad luck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Merrifield, R. |date=1969 |title=Roman London |place=London |publisher=Cassell |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
[[File:Votive tree cappadocia.jpg|thumb|right|Tree with nazars in [[Cappadocia]], [[Turkey]].]]
Belief in the evil eye is strongest in [[West Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[East Africa|East]] and [[West Africa]], [[Central America]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe]], especially the [[Mediterranean region]]; it has also spread to areas, including northern Europe, particularly in the [[Celts|Celtic]] regions, and the [[Americas]], where it was brought by European colonists and West Asian immigrants.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Belief in the evil eye is found in the [[Islam]]ic doctrine, based upon the statement of Prophet [[Muhammad]], "The influence of an evil eye is a fact..." [Sahih Muslim, Book 26, Number 5427].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/026.smt.html#026.5427 |title=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |publisher=Usc.edu |access-date=2007-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903081746/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/026.smt.html#026.5427#026.5427 |archive-date=2007-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic practices of warding off the evil eye are also commonly practiced by Muslims: rather than directly expressing appreciation of, for example, a child's beauty, it is customary to say ''[[Masha'Allah]]'', that is, "God has willed it", or invoking God's blessings upon the object or person that is being admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makedua.com/display_dua.php?sectionid=118 |title=Du'a – What to say when in fear of afflicting something or someone with one?s eye |publisher=Makedua.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of beliefs about the evil eye are also found in [[folk religion]], typically revolving around the use of [[amulet]]s or [[talisman]]s as a means of protection.

In the [[Aegean Region]] and other areas where light-colored eyes are relatively rare, people with [[eye color|green eyes]], and especially blue eyes, are thought to bestow the curse, intentionally or unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cora Lynn Daniels, et al., eds, ''Encyclopædia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World'' (Volume III), p. 1273, Univ. Press of the Pacific, Honolulu, {{ISBN|1-4102-0916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Greece and Turkey amulets against the evil eye take the form of blue eyes, and in the painting by John Phillip, below, we witness the culture-clash experienced by a woman who suspects that the artist's gaze implies that he is looking at her with the evil eye.

Among those who do not take the evil eye literally, either by reason of the culture in which they were raised or because they simply do not believe it, the phrase, "to give someone the evil eye" usually means simply to glare at the person in anger or disgust. The term has entered into common usage within the [[English language]]. Within the broadcasting industry it refers to when a presenter signals to the interviewee or co-presenter to stop talking due to a shortage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He may sound like a Dalek doing a bad impression of Kenneth Williams, but why DO so many BBC stars want to exterminate Pesto?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2063409/He-sound-like-Dalek-doing-bad-impression-Kenneth-Williams-DO-BBC-stars-want-exterminate-Pesto.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protective talismans and cures==
[[File:WPVA-khamsa.svg|upright|thumb|left|The [[Hamsa]], a charm made to ward off the evil eye.]]
Attempts to ward off the curse of the evil eye have resulted in a number of [[amulet|talismans]] in many cultures. As a class, they are called "''apotropaic''" (Greek for "prophylactic" / προφυλακτικός or "protective", literally: "turns away") talismans, meaning that they turn away or turn back harm.

Disks or balls, consisting of concentric blue and white circles (usually, from inside to outside, dark blue, light blue, white, and dark blue) representing an evil eye are common apotropaic talismans in West Asia, found on the [[prow]]s of Mediterranean [[boat]]s and elsewhere; in some forms of the folklore, the staring eyes are supposed to bend the malicious gaze back to the [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]].

Known as ''[[Evil eye in Turkish Culture|nazar]]'' ({{lang-tr|nazar boncuğu}} or {{lang|tr|nazarlık}}), this talisman is most frequently seen in [[Turkey]], found in or on houses and vehicles or worn as beads.
[[File:Hotamis Kilim .jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a 19th-century Anatolian [[kilim]], with rows of crosses (Turkish: Haç) and scattered S-shaped hooks (Turkish: Çengel), both to ward off the evil eye&lt;ref name=Erbek/&gt;]]

A blue or green eye can also be found on some forms of the [[hamsa|hamsa hand]], an [[apotropaic]] hand-shaped talisman against the evil eye found in West Asia. The word hamsa, also spelled khamsa and hamesh, means "five" referring to the fingers of the hand. In [[Secular Jewish culture|Jewish culture]], the hamsa is called the [[hamsa|Hand of Miriam]]; in some Muslim cultures, the [[hamsa|Hand of Fatima]]. Though condemned as superstition by doctrinaire Muslims, it is almost exclusively among Muslims in the Near East and Mediterranean that the belief in envious looks containing destructive power or the talismanic power of a nazar to defend against them. To adherents of other faiths in the region, the nazar is an attractive decoration.

A [[Kilim motifs|variety of motifs]] to ward off the evil eye are commonly woven into tribal [[kilim]] rugs. Such motifs include a cross (Turkish: Haç) to divide the evil eye into four, a hook (Turkish: Çengel) to destroy the evil eye, or a human eye (Turkish: Göz) to avert the evil gaze. The shape of a lucky [[amulet]] (Turkish: Muska; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse) is often woven into kilims for the same reason.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A.

[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] are also strong believers in the evil eye. They will usually wear a blue/turquoise bead around a necklace to be protected from the evil eye. Also, they might pinch the [[buttocks]], comparable to Armenians. It is said that people with green or blue eyes are more prone to the evil eye effect. {{Citation needed|reason=What is the source for this statement? Was it racially motivated in any way?

===In Judaism===
[[File:HamsaS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clay hamsa with an inscription in Hebrew (translates to "good luck")]]
The evil eye is mentioned several times in the classic ''[[Pirkei Avot]] (Ethics of Our Fathers)''. In Chapter II, five disciples of Rabbi [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] give advice on how to follow the good path in life and avoid the bad. [[Rabbi Eliezer]] says an evil eye is worse than a bad friend, a bad neighbor, or an evil heart.

Judaism believes that a "good eye" designates an attitude of good will and kindness towards others. Someone who has this attitude in life will rejoice when his fellow man prospers; he will wish everyone well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Magic_and_the_Supernatural/Practices_and_Beliefs/Amulets/Evil_Eye.shtml |title=Evil Eye in Judaism |publisher=My Jewish Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt; An "evil eye" denotes the opposite attitude. A man with "an evil eye" will not only feel no joy but experience actual distress when others prosper, and will rejoice when others suffer. A person of this character represents a great danger to our moral purity.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters of the Fathers, Translation &amp; Commentary by Samson Raphael Hirsch, Feldheim Publishers, {{ISBN|0-87306-182-9}} pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] explained that the evil eye is "an example of how one soul may affect another through unseen connections between them. We are all influenced by our environment.... The evil eye is the venomous impact from malignant feelings of jealousy and envy of those around us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrison |first1=Chanan |last2=Kook |first2=Abraham Isaac Kook|title=Gold from the Land of Israel: A New Light on the Weekly Torah Portion - From the Writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac HaKohen Kook' |date=2006 |publisher=Urim Publications |isbn=965-7108-92-6 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Observant Jews avoid talking about valuable items they own, good luck that has come to them and, in particular, their children. If any of these are mentioned, the speaker and/or listener will say ''b'li ayin hara'' (Hebrew), meaning "without an evil eye", or ''kein eina hara'' (Yiddish; often shortened to ''kennahara''), "no evil eye". Another way to ward off the evil eye is to spit three times (or pretend to). Romans call this custom "despuere malum," to spit at evil. &lt;ref&gt;Joyce Eisenberg and Ellen Scolnic. "The Whole Spiel: Funny essays about digital nudniks, seder selfies and chicken soup memories," Incompra Press, {{ISBN|978-0-692-72625-9}} pg. 153 &lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested {{by whom|date=June 2016}} the 10th commandment: "do not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor" is a law against bestowing the evil eye on another person.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], the evil eye is called ''Nazar'' (نظر). People usually may resort to reading the last three chapters of the Quran, namely [[Al-Ikhlas|Sura Ikhlas]], [[Al-Falaq|Sura Al-Falaq]] and [[Al-Nas|Sura Al-Nas]]. "[[Masha'Allah]]" ({{rtl-lang|ar|ما شاء الله}}) ("God has willed it") is commonly said to ward off the evil eye. Understanding of the evil eye varies by the level of education. Some perceive the use of black color to be useful in protecting from the evil eye. Others use "[[taawiz]]" to ward off the evil eye. Truck owners and other public transport vehicles may commonly be seen using a small black cloth on the bumpers to prevent the evil eye.&lt;ref&gt;Ghilzai, S.A., and Kanwal, A.

===Greece===
The evil eye, known as {{lang|el|μάτι}} (''mati''), "eye", as an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] visual device, is known to have been a fixture in Greece dating back to at least the 6th century BC, when it commonly appeared on drinking vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster. ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions''. 2000, p. 69. {{ISBN|0877790442}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greece]], the evil eye is cast away through the process of ''xematiasma'' ({{lang|el|ξεμάτιασμα}}), whereby the "healer" silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex, usually a [[grandparent]]. Such prayers are revealed only under specific circumstances, as according to their customs those who reveal them indiscriminately lose their ability to cast off the evil eye. There are several regional versions of the prayer in question, a common one being: "[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]], Our Lady, if [insert name of the victim] is suffering of the evil eye, release him/her of it." [[Evil]] repeated three times. According to [[tradition|custom]], if one is indeed afflicted with the evil eye, both victim and "healer" then start yawning profusely. The "healer" then performs the sign of the cross three times, and emits spitting-like sounds in the air three times. A very similar ritual can be found in neighboring [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]], as well as in [[Corsica]].

Another "test" used to check if the evil eye was cast is that of the [[oil]]: under normal conditions, [[olive oil]] floats in water, as it is less dense than water. The test of the oil is performed by placing one drop of olive oil in a glass of water, typically holy water.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph and the next two paragraphs appear to be original research|date=July 2017}} If the drop floats, the test concludes there is no evil eye involved. If the drop sinks, then it is asserted that the evil eye is cast indeed. Another form of the [[experiment|test]] is to place two drops of olive oil into a glass of water. If the drops remain separated, the test concludes there is no evil eye, but if they merge, there is. There is also a third form where in a plate full of water the "healer" places three or nine drops of oil. If the oil drops become larger and eventually dissolve in the water there is evil eye. If the drops remain separated from water in a form of a small circle there isn't. The first drops are the most important and the number of drops that dissolve in water indicate the strength of the evil eye.

There is another form of the "test" where the "healer" prepares a few cloves by piercing each one with a pin. Then she lights a candle and grabs a pinned clove with a pair of scissors. She then uses it to do the sign of the cross over the afflicted whilst the afflicted is asked to think of a person who may have given him the evil eye. Then the healer holds the clove over the flame. If the clove burns silently, there is no evil eye present; however, if the clove explodes or burns noisily, that means the person in the thoughts of the afflicted is the one who has cast the evil eye.{{Citation needed|reason=this paragraph, the preceding paragraph, and the following paragraph appear to be original research, or at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}} As the clove explodes, the evil eye is released from the afflicted. Cloves that burn with some noise are considered to be λόγια - words - someone foul-mouthing you that you ought to be wary of. The burned cloves are extinguished into a glass of water and are later buried in the garden along with the pins as they are considered to be contaminated. Greek people will also ward off the evil eye by saying φτου να μη σε ματιάξω! which translates to "I spit so that I won't give you the evil eye." Contrary to popular belief, the evil eye is not necessarily given by someone wishing you ill, but it stems from admiration. Since it is technically possible to give yourself the evil eye, it is advised to be humble.

The [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]] accepted the traditional belief in the evil eye, but attributed it to the [[Devil]] and [[envy]]. In Greek [[theology]], the evil eye or ''vaskania'' ({{lang|el|βασκανία}}) is considered harmful for the one whose envy inflicts it on others as well as for the sufferer. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]] has an ancient prayer against vaskania from the ''Megan Hieron Synekdemon'' ({{lang|el|Μέγαν Ιερόν Συνέκδημον}}) book of prayers.{{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph and the preceding two paragraphs appear to have original research or are at least suspiciously informal|date=July 2017}}

===Italy===
[[File:Fig._81_-_The_Evil_Eye_-_Elworthy.jpg|thumb|left|Various evil eye amulets from Italy such as the [[cornicello]], [[cimaruta]], and [[lunula (amulet)|lunula]] (1895).]]
The [[cornicello]], "little horn", also called the ''cornetto'' ("little horn", plural ''cornetti''), is a long, gently twisted horn-shaped amulet. Cornicelli are usually carved out of red coral or made from gold or silver. The type of horn they are intended to copy is not a curled-over sheep horn or goat horn but rather like the twisted horn of an African [[Taurotragus|eland]] or a chili pepper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Corno (Italian Horn Amulet)|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/corno.html|author=Lucky Mojo|access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One idea that the [[ribaldry|ribald]] suggestions made by sexual [[symbol]]s distract the witch from the mental effort needed to successfully bestow the curse. Another is that since the effect of the eye was to dry up liquids, the drying of the phallus (resulting in male impotence) would be averted by seeking refuge in the moist female genitals. Among the ancient Romans and their cultural descendants in the Mediterranean nations, those who were not fortified with phallic charms had to make use of sexual [[gesture]]s to avoid the eye. Such gestures include scratching one's testicles (for men), as well as the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' gesture and [[List of gestures#Fig sign|the fig sign]]; a fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers, representing the phallus within the vagina. In addition to the phallic talismans, [[statue]]s of hands in these gestures, or covered with magical symbols, were carried by the Romans as talismans. In [[Latin America]], carvings of the fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers continue to be carried as good luck charms.

The wielder of the evil eye, the ''jettatore'', is described as having a striking facial appearance, high arching brows with a stark stare that leaps from his black eyes. He often has a reputation for clandestine involvement with dark powers and is the object of gossip about dealings in magic and other forbidden practices. Successful men having tremendous personal magnetism quickly gain notoriety as jettatori. [[Pope Pius IX]] was dreaded for his evil eye, and a whole cycle of stories about the disasters that happened in his wake were current in Rome during the latter decades of the 19th century. Public figures of every type, from poets to gangsters, have had their specialized abilities attributed to the power of their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence. ''The Evil Eye''.

===Malta===
The symbol of the eye, known as "l-għajn", is common on traditional fishing boats which are known as [[luzzu]].

}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Latin America===
The evil eye or 'Mal de Ojo' has been deeply embedded in Spanish popular culture throughout its history and Spain is the origin of this superstition in Latin America.

In [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], infants are considered at special risk for the evil eye (see ''mal de ojo'', above) and are often given an amulet bracelet as protection, typically with an eye-like spot painted on the amulet. Another preventive measure is allowing admirers to touch the infant or child; in a similar manner, a person wearing an item of clothing that might induce envy may suggest to others that they touch it or some other way dispel envy.

One traditional cure in rural Mexico involves a ''[[curandero]]'' (folk healer) sweeping a raw chicken egg over the body of a victim to absorb the power of the person with the evil eye. The egg is later broken into a glass with water and placed under the bed of the patient near the head. Sometimes it is checked immediately because the egg appears as if it has been cooked. When this happens it means that the patient did have Mal De Ojo. Somehow the Mal De Ojo has transferred to the egg and the patient immediately gets well. (Fever, pain and diarrhea, nausea/vomiting goes away instantly) In the traditional Hispanic culture of the Southwestern United States and some parts of Mexico, the egg may be passed over the patient in a cross-shaped pattern all over the body, while reciting ''The Lord's Prayer''. The egg is also placed in a glass with water, under the bed and near the head, sometimes it is examined right away or in the morning and if the egg looks like it has been cooked then it means that they did have Mal de Ojo and the patient will start feeling better. Sometimes if the patient starts getting ill and someone knows that they had stared at patient, usually a child, if the person who stared goes to the child and touches them, the child's illness goes away immediately so the Mal De Ojo energy is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |title=Medical Anthropology: Explanations of Illness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817130521/http://anthro.palomar.edu/medical/med_1.htm |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of [[South America]] the act of ''ojear'', which could be translated as ''to give someone the evil eye'', is an involuntary act. Someone may ''ojear'' babies, animals and inanimate objects just by staring and admiring them. This may produce illness, discomfort or possibly death on babies or animals and failures on inanimate objects like cars or houses. It's a common belief that since this is an involuntary act made by people with the ''heavy look'', the proper way of protection is by attaching a red ribbon to the animal, baby or object, in order to attract the gaze to the ribbon rather than to the object intended to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |title=El ''Mal de Ojo'' de la Etnografía Clásica y ''La Limpia'' Posmoderna |author=Flórez, Franz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213519/http://www.revistatabularasa.org/numero_dos/florez.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
Brazilians generally will associate ''mal-olhado'', ''mau-olhado'' ("act of giving a bad look") or ''olho gordo'' ("fat eye" i.e. "gluttonous eye") with envy or jealousy on domestic and garden plants (that, after months or years of health and beauty, will suddenly weaken, wither and die, with no apparent signs of pest, after the visitation of a certain friend or relative), attractive hair and less often economic or romantic success and family harmony.

Unlike in most cultures ''mal-olhado'' is not seen to be something that risks young babies. "Pagans" or non-baptized children are instead assumed to be at risk from ''bruxas'' (witches), that have malignant intention themselves rather than just ''mal-olhado''. It probably reflects the Galician folktales about the ''[[meiga]]s'' or Portuguese magas, (witches), as Colonial Brazil was primarily settled by [[Portuguese people]], in numbers greater than all Europeans to settle pre-independence United States. Those ''bruxas'' are interpreted to have taken the form of moths, often very dark, that disturb children at night and take away their energy. For that reason, Christian Brazilians often have amulets in the form of crucifixes around, beside or inside beds where children sleep.

Nevertheless, older children, especially boys, that fulfill the cultural ideals of behaving extremely well (for example, having no problems whatsoever in eating well a great variety of foods, being obedient and respectful toward adults, kind, polite, studious, and demonstrating no bad blood with other children or their siblings) who unexpectedly turn into problematic adolescents or adults (for example lacking good health habits, extreme laziness or lacking motivation towards their life goals, having eating disorders, or being prone to delinquency), are said to have been victims of ''mal-olhado'' coming from parents of children whose behavior was not as admirable.

Amulets that protect against ''mal-olhado'' tend to be generally resistant, mildly to strongly toxic and dark plants in specific and strategic places of a garden or the entry to a house. Those include ''comigo-ninguém-pode'' ("against-me-nobody-cans"), ''[[Dieffenbachia]]'' (the dumbcane), ''espada-de-são-jorge'' ("St. George's sword"), ''[[Sansevieria trifasciata]]'' (the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue) and ''guiné'' ("Guinea"), among [[:pt:Petiveria tetrandra|various other names]], ''[[Petiveria alliacea]]'' (the guinea henweed). For those lacking in space or wanting to "sanitize" specific places, they may all be planted together in a single ''sete ervas'' ("seven [lucky] herbs") pot, that will also include ''arruda'' ([[Ruta graveolens|common rue]]), ''pimenteira'' ([[Capsicum annuum]]), ''manjericão'' ([[basil]]) and ''alecrim'' ([[rosemary]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vidaeestilo.terra.com.br/esoterico/interna/0,,OI4880508-EI14322,00-Conheca+o+poder+e+a+protecao+das+sete+ervas.html |title=Conheça o poder e a proteção das sete ervas |author=Guizetti, Franco |language= pt |accessdate=Jan 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Though the last four ones should not be used for their common culinary purposes by humans.)
Other popular amulets against evil eye include: the use of mirrors, on the outside of your home's front door, or also inside your home facing your front door; an elephant figurine with its back to the front door; and coarse salt, placed in specific places at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revista.zap.com.br/imoveis/proteja-sua-casa-do-mau-olhado/|title=Proteja sua casa do mau olhado|last=Caires|first=Olivia|language= Portuguese|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
Mal ojo often occurs without the dimension of envy, but insofar as envy is a part of ojo, it is a variant of this underlying sense of insecurity and relative vulnerability to powerful, hostile forces in the environment. In her study of medical attitudes in the Santa Clara Valley of California, Margaret Clark arrives at essentially the same conclusion: "Among the Spanish-speaking folk of Sal si Puedes, the patient is regarded as a passive and innocent victim of malevolent forces in his environment. These forces may be witches, evil spirits, the consequences of poverty, or virulent bacteria that invade his body. The scapegoat may be a visiting social worker who unwittingly 'cast the evil eye'&amp;nbsp;... Mexican folk concepts of disease are based in part on the notion that people can be victimized by the careless or malicious behavior of others".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Another aspect of the mal ojo syndrome in Ixtepeji is a disturbance of the hot-cold equilibrium in the victim. According to folk belief, the bad effects of an attack result from the "hot" force of the aggressor entering the child's body and throwing it out of balance. Currier has shown how the Mexican hot-cold system is an unconscious folk model of social relations upon which social anxieties are projected. According to Currier, "the nature of Mexican peasant society is such that each individual must continuously attempt to achieve a balance between two opposing social forces: the tendency toward intimacy and that toward withdrawal. [It is therefore proposed] that the individual's continuous preoccupation with achieving a balance between 'heat' and 'cold' is a way of reenacting, in symbolic terms, a fundamental activity in social relations."&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, Clarence.

=== India ===
{{Main article|Nazar Battu}}
In the northern states of India, like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the evil eye is called "Drishti" (meaning gaze or vision) or more commonly as ''Buri Nazar''. A charm bracelet, tattoo or other object ([[Nazar battu]]), or a slogan ([[Chashme Baddoor (slogan)]]), may be used to ward-off the evil eye. Some truck owners write the slogan to ward off the evil eye: "buri nazar wale tera muh kala" ("O evil-eyed one, may your face turn black").

In general in India, if gone through time up to historical myths, babies and newborn infants will have their eye adorned with kajal, or eyeliner. This would be black, as it is believed in India that black wards off the evil eye or any evil auras.
In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, people call it as 'Disti' or 'Drusti'. To remove Disti people follow several methods based on their culture/area. Items used to remove Disti either Rock salt or Red chilies or Oiled cloth. Taking one of this item, people remove Disti by rotating their hand with one of the item above around the person who affected by Disti and they will burn the item.&lt;ref name="JackStephen2013"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Amariglio, Jack |author2=Cullenberg, Stephen E |author3=Ruccio, David F | title=Post-Modernism, Economics and Knowledge | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-LqpYBnDOkC&amp;pg=PA217 |year= 2013 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-134-83668-0 | pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures over-complimenting is said to cast a curse. So does envy. Since ancient times such maledictions have been collectively called the evil eye. According to the book ''The Evil Eye'' by folklorist [[Alan Dundes]],&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan (ed.) (1992) ''The Evil Eye: A Casebook'' [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, Wisconsin, {{ISBN|0-299-13334-6}}; originally published in 1981 by Garland Publishing, New York&lt;/ref&gt; the belief's premise is that an individual can cause harm simply by looking at another's person or property. However, protection is easy to come by with talismans that can be worn, carried, or hung in homes, most often incorporating the contours of a human eye. In Aegean countries, people with light-colored eyes are thought to be particularly powerful, and amulets in Greece and Turkey are usually blue orbs. Indians and Jews use charms with palm-forward hands with an eye in the center; Italians employ horns, phallic shapes meant to distract spell casters.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, Johnna (April 2013) ''National Geographic Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hara-Kiri''''' was a monthly French [[satire|satirical]] magazine, first published in 1960, the precursor to ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]''. It was created by [[Georges Bernier]], [[François Cavanna|Cavanna]] and [[Fred Aristidès]]. A weekly counterpart, '''''Hara-Kiri Hebdo''''', was first published in 1969.

Contributors included [[Melvin Van Peebles]], [[Jean-Marc Reiser|Reiser]], [[Roland Topor]], [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], [[Georges Wolinski|Wolinski]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Gébé|fr}}, [[Cabu]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Delfeil de Ton|fr}}, [[Jean-Claude Fournier|Fournier]], [[Jean-Pierre Bouyxou]] and [[Willem (cartoonist)|Willem]]. In 1966 it published ''[[The Adventures of Jodelle|Les Aventures de Jodelle]]'', drawn by [[Guy Peellaert]] 

Hara-Kiri editions, subtitled "''Journal bête et méchant''" ("Stupid and nasty newspaper"), were constantly aiming at established powers, be they political parties or institutions like the Church or the State. In 1961 and 1966 the monthly magazine was temporarily banned by the French government.

==''Hara-Kiri Hebdo'' becomes ''Charlie Hebdo''==
In November 1970, following the death of [[Charles de Gaulle]] at his home in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]], the weekly ''Hara-Kiri Hebdo'' bore the headline ''« Bal tragique à Colombey : 1 mort »'' (Eng: "Tragic ball in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises|Colombey]]: 1 death").

By way of contradistinction, the choice of the title refers to the far greater loss of life the same month: a [[Club Cinq-Sept fire|fire at a discothèque]] in which 146 people died.  The government felt this editorial choice was an offence of [[lèse-majesté]] against the deceased President and its then minister of the interior [[Raymond Marcellin]] ordered an immediate and permanent ban on publicity and on sale to minors.

''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' was started immediately afterwards. Charlie in the title refers to General de Gaulle (said [[Georges Wolinski]]); but it was also the name of another magazine from Éditions du Square ''[[Charlie Mensuel]]'', named after the character [[Charlie Brown]] from [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]''.

'''Ivy Day''' is an annual ceremony in which an '''ivy stone''' is placed on either a residential, academic or administrative building or ground to commemorate academic excellence. The ceremony is most known for being practiced among older colleges in the [[Northeastern United States]]. It is most associated with the [[Ivy League]] and a group of small liberal arts college known as the [[Little Ivies]]. Some institutions announce members of [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] and specialized honor designations for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/events/commencement.php|title=Smith College: Events|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classes donate to the college, in the form gates, facades, and door outlines,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://innocents.unl.edu/ivy-day-0|title=Ivy Day {{!}} Innocents Society {{!}} University of Nebraska–Lincoln|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=innocents.unl.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; by inscribing or creating their own version of symbolic icons of the college's seal or other prominent insignia. The ivy stones are usually decorated with the graduation date and a symbol that represents the college as a whole or the class as a whole. The most common ivy stone is one-by-two feet and is usually made out of workable stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/pennhistory/ivystones/ivystones.ica.html|title=Penn History-ICA Ivy Stone Brochure|website=www.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasion students have featured prominent alumni on their class ivy stones or have selected to feature an engraving of a member of their graduating class. Since 1873 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and since 1879 at [[Bates College]], students have unveiled class ivy stones at the annual ivy day preceding [[Commencement Day|commencement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/pennhistory/ivystones/ivystones.ica.html Penn website] (accessed February 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bates.edu/x61823.xml Bates College website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414113219/http://www.bates.edu/x61823.xml |date=2009-04-14 }} (accessed February 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also have a selective procession prior to the official commencement walk to honor each stone being placed on the buildings. On some occasions students plant [[Hedera|ivy]] in front or on the side of their ivy stones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bates.edu/x61823.xml Bates College website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414113219/http://www.bates.edu/x61823.xml |date=2009-04-14 }} (accessed February 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princeton University]] also places class ivy stones on the walls of its buildings, a few days prior to their commencement. Students are known to give speeches at Ivy Day to commemorate their time and work at the college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/pennhistory/ivystones/ivystones.ica.html UPENN website] (accessed February 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Select medical schools also participate in Ivy Day prior to their [[White coat ceremony|White Coat Ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tulane.edu/som/student-affairs/graduation/ivy-day.cfm|title=Tulane University - School of Medicine - ivy-day|website=tulane.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ran on [[The WB]] for 5 seasons from September 9, 2000, to July 8, 2005. During its run, it was also shown on [[Cartoon Network]], and afterwards, its reruns landed on [[Toon Disney]]'s [[Jetix]] programming block, as well as continuing on Cartoon Network. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], it originally premiered on [[Fox Kids]] in 2002 and ran until 2005. Several toys and [[Jackie Chan Adventures (video game)|video games]] based on the series were produced and sold during the original run of the animated series. Its main character designer is [[Jeff Matsuda]].

==Plot==
Jackie Chan, an amateur archeologist, enjoyed his job working for the local university until fate dealt him another hand. After finding a shield containing a talisman he encounters ''The Dark Hand'', a criminal organization led by a man called Valmont that serves the demon sorcerer Shendu. Jackie and his family must cooperate with a secret law enforcement organization, ''Section 13'', to counter the threat, and must face dangers that will demand all of Jackie's daring and skill in martial arts to overcome.

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Jackie Chan Adventures characters}}

The main characters are:

* Jackie Chan – Jackie Chan is a talented archaeologist and skilled martial artist who lives in San Francisco with his uncle. His quiet life of exploring booby-trapped castles and dusty tombs is disturbed when an old friend, Captain Black of Section 13, recruits him to stop the Dark Hand from acquiring the 12 Talismans, forcing him onto the front lines of the battle between good and evil.
* Jade Chan – Jade is Jackie's Hong Kong-born, 12-year-old niece (technically his first-cousin-once-removed, since she is his "''Cousin Shen's girl''") who is already "Americanized". She is adventurous, and thus she frequently disobeys her uncle's advice to remain in safety. She tends to accompany Jackie as he goes out on adventures and gets herself into trouble. Though she will not admit it, she has to be rescued by Jackie almost every time. Just as often, however, her quick mind and flexible thinking help Jackie in situations where his moderate thinking and habitual caution are a definite hindrance. A frequent gag in the series is her inexplicable ability to appear in the middle of the action mere seconds after being left in a supposedly secure location/vehicle for her safety.
* Uncle Chan – Uncle, as he is known (he is called "sensei" by Tohru), is the uncle of Jackie and great-uncle of Jade. He has a very stereotypical Cantonese accented drawl, usually talks in third person about himself, and often uses Cantonese in many aspects of his speech (his magic incantation, "Jiu&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;mo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;gwai&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;gwaai&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; faai&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; di&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; zau&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;" (妖魔鬼怪快哋走), means "Evil demons and malevolent spirits, be gone!" in Cantonese). His most commonly used magical items are a dried salamander and puffer fish; both having backgrounds in Asian remedies. Tea is his favorite drink, but he often complains that it is too hot or too cold and always throws the cup when he finishes. He has a variety of catchphrases, many of which serve as admonitions to other characters, and frequently exclaims "One more thing!" before pointing out something that annoys him. He is a skilled martial artist, but he is rarely seen engaging in hand-to-hand combat. When he does, he usually takes opponents out with one discreet strike. Uncle's most utilized skills are his knowledge of history, and his talents for sorcery and magic. He is a talented chi wizard, able to hold his own against and gain the better of opponents who are much more capable than him.
* Tohru – A very large Japanese man, Tohru was once an enforcer for the Dark Hand and a personal servant for Valmont, its leader. From the episode centered around the [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]] and [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]] talismans, Tohru started to have second thoughts about working for the Dark Hand. Several things point to this, from Jackie trying to tell Tohru to come and work for Section 13 because "they serve donuts every Thursday" (which he stated back in episode 13) to all the insults and blames he bore through his working for the Dark Hand and betraying them, always angering him. However, when the Dark Hand managed to revive Shendu, the demon sorcerer double-crossed them. Forced to fight Shendu alone, Tohru was quickly defeated, after which he changed his allegiances, and turned himself in to Section 13's authorities. After an ordeal that allowed Tohru some degree of freedom, he became Uncle's apprentice in chi magic and developed a close big brother relationship with Jade, whom he becomes very protective of. Tohru shows great loyalty to whoever he stands by, even back to the time when he was an enforcer for the Dark Hand.  By the end of the series, Tohru becomes a full chi wizard.
* Ratso – A nerdy strongman who acts somewhat childish, dimwitted and has a fondness of toys, baseball and grilled cheese sandwiches. He wears a bandage across his nose as a fashion statement, and studied theoretical physics before joining the Enforcers. When he was a Dark Chi warrior in Season 3, he inherited the mantle of Chuy. When infused with fire demon Chi by Drago, he could generate fire from his hands. When the [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]] Talisman affected him, he was usually turned into a rat (which is fitting, based on his name). In Season 2 episode 1, Chow turned him into a walrus by accident and changed him back. He has an unnamed sister and a young nephew named Rocko, who is his sister's son and is unaware of his uncle's criminal career.
* Chow – Of Asian descent (most likely Chinese, for in Season 2 episode 3, he is able to read a riddle in Chinese), he is the shortest and youngest member of the group. His trademark is a pair of yellow-orange sunglasses, which are actually eyeglasses, and worked at a store called Sunglass Shack where he was employee of the month 3 times before joining the Dark Hand. When he was a Dark Chi warrior in Season 3, he inherited the mantle of Ghon. He gained the ability to shoot fire from his eyes during his employ by Drago (although all too often his sunglasses broke when he used that ability). He has a fear of flying, heights, space travel and a lot of other things. He has a young nephew named Charlie, who is unaware of his uncle's crime life.
* Finn – An Irish-American comedian and the brains (or at least the most intelligent) of the Dark Hand enforcers (after Tohru's defection). He is a 1970s fanatic, and sang disco at weddings before joining the Dark Hand. Along with the other two recurring Enforcers and Hak Foo, he worked for Shendu, Valmont, Daolon Wong, Tarakudo and Drago (shortly). He commonly and playfully refers to Valmont as Big-V (and Little-V when he is reduced to a child) and Shendu as "Shen-Dude". When a [[Dragon (zodiac)|dragon]], he has the ability to shoot fire from his fingers, and as a Dark Chi Warrior he assumes the mantle of his predecessor Rhen. He has a young nephew named Frank, who is unaware of his uncle's criminal career.
* Hak Foo – aka the Black [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]], has spiked red hair, a thin moustache and chin beard, and habitually wears a blue muscle shirt and jeans. He wore a blue vest and red pantaloons in his first appearance, and when he joined the Dark Hand, had a costume change. He is a very skillful and brawny fighter, and a dangerous opponent to all who face him. Hak Foo has the habit of making up and shouting colorful metaphorical phrases whenever he commences an attack or a special action. When Hak Foo and Jackie first met, he was the first opponent who ever defeated Jackie in a fair fight, and throughout the entire series, Jackie never defeats him outright.
* Valmont – The leader of the Dark Hand who hails from the United Kingdom. He is a skillful criminal mastermind and martial arts expert who is able to hold his own against (and even get the better of) Jackie in their personal confrontations. When something goes wrong, he says his catchphrase, "blast!" In Season 2, he was possessed by Shendu. Throughout the series, Valmont loses more and more capital until he is plunged into total poverty. By the time Season 4 comes around, he lives in a run down apartment barely large enough for him to live comfortably, and in the series' finale he is found working as a bus driver.
* Captain Black – Captain Black is the head of Section 13 and Jackie's longtime friend. In the first-season episode The Rock, when Jade tries to access Section 13's Vault, it is revealed that Captain Augustus Black was born on October 27, 1959, which Jade thought might have been the Talisman vault's password. It is also hinted that Captain Black may be a fan of James Bond as he used "007" as the pass code to the vault (Jade mentions that the code only had "three numbers, last one seven"). In Black Magic, Captain Black mentions that he is a fan of Elvis Presley; "The only (King) I bow to is Elvis, and I don't see you wearing Blue Suede Shoes". He is also relatively sarcastic, as (in season 3, "A Jolly J-Team Xmas") when mistaken for Tohru's mother, Captain Black commented that, "I am often mistaken for elderly Japanese women". Uncle has commented that Captain Black has a lot of good chi inside of him, as Jackie found out when he was surprised to find that Captain Black was able to resist an Oni Mask for quite a significant amount of time.

==Magic and the supernatural==
The series involves magic and the supernatural, like [[spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, [[demon]]s, [[Ch'i|chi]], and stone [[talisman]]s all throughout the episodes.

===Talismans===
The talismans represent the twelve animals of the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]]:
*[[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]: Power and ability of [[Undead|Animation]]. "Motion to the Motionless" Gives inanimate objects life. The animated object takes on the personality, powers and abilities of the person or thing it's modeled after. A Quetzalcoatl (sun god) statue could fly and shoot fire balls and the Lo Pei statue knew chi magic. When Shendu was under the spell of Lo Pei, this Talisman was required to maintain his form, if the Talismans were used to free him from statue form. Found on the bottom of an ancient Chinese lantern.
*[[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]]: Power and ability of [[Super strength|Super Strength]]. Found by Jackie on the mask of El Toro Fuerte. In the episode "The Mask of El Toro Fuerte", it greatly strengthened Jade to superhuman levels. Can also strengthen objects.
*[[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]]: Power and ability of [[Balance (metaphysics)|Balance]] (in the spiritual sense, not literally). When activated, it splits the user's positive and negative halves ([[Yin and Yang]]) into two separate beings, each holding a half of the Talisman. Can also be used to find the "other half" of a broken object. The two beings rejoin when they reunite the broken Talisman. It was found within a pie. In Season 1 episode 12 "The [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] and the Pussycat" Shendu claims it is "the glue which binds the others together."
*[[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]]: Power and ability of [[Speedster (fiction)|Superspeed]]. It was found stuck in the shell of a Giant tortoise in the Pacific. When used in conjunction with the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]] Talisman, it allows the user to fly at super-sonic speeds.
*[[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]]: Power and ability of [[Combustion]]. Highly destructive and explosive bursts of fiery energy are discharged from the Talisman. The [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] Talisman can be fused to the wielder's hand. Found in a volcanic cave, it is shown to draw power from the user's emotions.
*[[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]]: Power and ability of [[Invisibility]]. Found on the ceiling of a chamber of a [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]] worshipper's temple near the Amazon River and later donated to a New York museum. It is also Viper's favorite Talisman (as she considers it to be her "sign.") The only drawback is that [[List of Jackie Chan Adventures characters#Shadowkhan|Shadowkhan]] can see the user despite being invisible, as well as various magical items designed for locating.  In addition, the show has a [[running gag]] in which characters believe that they are using the power of invisibility when they are not.
*[[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]]: Power and ability of [[Healing]]/[[wikt:Special:Search/renewal|Renewal]]. "''The noble [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]] of a knight" can "expel all alien forces within,''" curing the user of illness (foreign bodies,) and can also heal physical injuries, repair broken objects, and instantly relieve physical pain and disorientation. Found within a structure atop an unnamed mountain. In the Old West, it was government property destined for the San Francisco museum. Its whereabouts in between are unknown.
*[[Goat (zodiac)|Sheep]]: Power and ability of [[Astral projection|Astral Projection]], or the ability to remove the soul from the body (and others too) and wander as an invisible spirit. While projecting, the wielder is able to enter another person's dreams. Although you can't hurt a person's astral form, if two or more users are both astral then they can do damage to each other (as seen when Chow fought Jackie) and the user's body is susceptible to all damage when the astral user returns to the body (i.e. Hak Foo during his fight with Tohru.) It was first found in a crate on a freight train bound for Istanbul.
*[[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]]: Power and ability of [[Shapeshifting]]. Grants the wielder the ability change anything they wish into any animal. Found by Jade at the bottom of the sea next to a volcanic island. Any item/person/animal may be changed into the shape of any animal by saying the name of the intended animal's shape. The effect can be reversed be pointing the talisman at an affected object or person and saying "Change him/her/me/it back."
*[[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]]: Power and ability of [[Levitation]]. Allows the user to levitate themselves and other objects, effectively giving them telekinesis. When used in conjunction with the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]] Talisman, it allows the user to fly at super-sonic speeds. Found within a golden shield inside a ruined Bavarian castle. This was the first talisman of the series and has been used quite often throughout the series.
*[[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]]: Power and ability of [[Immortality]]. "''The [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]] talisman is best friend to man, it restores youthful energy to its holder, and grants eternal life.''" It prevents death and grants partial invulnerability. This Talisman was found in a Bavarian windmill.''
*[[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]: Power and ability of [[Heat vision (fiction)|Heat Vision]]. "''Heat Beam Eyes''" Allows the user to expel extremely powerful beams of pure heat energy from their eyes. Found on the hat of a mechanical [[Pig (zodiac)|pig]] atop a Bavarian clock tower.

===Chi magic===
In the series of ''Jackie Chan Adventures'', several characters can use a form of magic using chi energy. Chi magic involves the use of potions, magic objects, and incantations. Below are some of the Chi incantations that have been used throughout the series. Each wizard usually uses the same incantation but can accomplish many different effects, ranging from banishing demons to turning living creatures to stone.

*Yu Mo Gui Gwai Fai Di Zao – The main good incantation of the series, this spell is used most often by Uncle. It is used for multiple purposes, including: banishing the evil power of the Shadowkhan from Jade's body, returning [[the Demon Sorcerers]] to the Netherworld, turning Shendu to stone, and extracting the Demon Chi of the Demon Sorcerers. Translated literally, the incantation is [[Cantonese]] for "Ghosts and goblins quickly leave" (妖魔鬼怪快离开).
*Lai Shui Zai – The incantation used by Bai Tza during her attempt to flood San Francisco. It is possibly 'Lai Shui Zai' (来水在) in Chinese. It means 'Occur, flood' or 'Come, flood'. The spell circle that this spell needs has a '水' at the middle of it, which means 'Water' in Chinese and Japanese.
*Kuai Kuai Qi Lai – Incantation used by Shendu (in Jackie's body) to open the portal to the Book of Ages. In Mandarin, 快快起來 literally means "Quickly Quickly Stand Up."
*Nukeru, He Men Ja'aku – The Japanese incantation used for the removal of Oni masks. It is also used to imprison Tarakudo in his Oni mask. Can be translated as "Come out, evil spell."
*Qu Yiqi Bushi Ni – The main incantation used by the evil chi wizard Iso. He uses it to do a variety of things.
*Mee-thana Chi. Chi-Mee-thana Chi – spell Tohru used to absorb all 8 demon chi from Drago.
*Ya Gaa Mee Mo Ya Gaa Mee Chi Wa – spell Drago used to absorb demon chi from the Ice Crew.

==Reception==
[[Common Sense Media]] gave the show 4 out of 5 stars, saying "Lighthearted, entertaining, suspenseful, and humorous, this show may not be deep, but it's a lot of fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/jackie-chan-adventures|title=Review of Jackie Chan Adventures|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=December 1, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806200649/http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/jackie-chan-adventures|archivedate=August 6, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References to Jackie Chan's career==
The TV series features references to Jackie Chan's films and his own life throughout the series. In the first episode, Jackie is surprised to learn that Jade speaks English. She tells him that she never said she didn't speak it, he assumed. This is a reference to Jackie's line of a similar nature in the movie ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]''. In the episode "A Night at the Opera", Uncle states that he was part of the stage group "[[Seven Little Fortunes]]", which Jackie Chan was actually part of in real life. Another example is season 3 episode 7 Jackie is bitten by a [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]], and uses a kung fu style known as "the drunken master" from one of his earliest headlining films of the same name.  According to Jackie during one of his question segments, the characters of the show are based on certain people in his life. Uncle is based on his agent and father, Jade is based on an assortment of his nieces, and Tohru is based on one of his stunt team members as well as himself. An episode titled "And He Does His Own Stunts" in reference to the fact that Jackie Chan does his own stunts in his movies.

Some episodes' titles are based on actual film names. For example, "Half a Mask of Kung Fu" is based on ''[[Half a Loaf of Kung Fu]]'', four episode titles ("Enter the Viper", "Enter the Cat", "Re-Enter the J-Team", and "Re-Enter the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]]") are based on ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (In which Jackie Chan performs as a stuntman&lt;ref&gt;''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action''. Ballantine Publishing Group, 1999, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;), "Shanghai Moon" is based on ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'', "Armor of the Gods" is based on ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'', "Project A, For Astral" is based on ''[[Project A]]'' and "Rumble in the Big House" is based on ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]''.

===VHS &amp; DVD releases===
In 2001, [[Sony Pictures]] released episodes from the first season on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. But one format differed from the other in that of the four DVDs released, three were select, individual episodes while the fourth contained the whole season of 13 episodes; the VHS series had only three, separate episodes. Also, there was a difference in the titles of the said episodes released on VHS and DVD. The Day Of The [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] VHS box cover art was the same as that of the first season DVD case cover, which featured Jackie, Jade and Uncle with the villains behind them, dimmed in a yellowish background. On these, the episodes were presented sans the teasers that originally appeared prior to the opening/intro sequence as they aired. They are currently unavailable and [[out-of-print]], especially since they had limited pressings and no plans have been announced to follow up season one with DVD box sets of the remaining four seasons. However, the entire series can be ordered and seen via [[video-on-demand]] service at [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[iTunes]]. As of October 2010, the entire series was made available on the Netflix Instant Streaming service.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment plans to release the second season on DVD through Amazon.com, and other online retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Jackie-Chan-Adventures-Season-2/16992|title=Jackie Chan Adventures DVD news: DVD Plans for Jackie Chan Adventures - The Complete 2nd Season - TVShowsOnDVD.com|author=|date=|website=www.tvshowsondvd.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527062616/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Jackie-Chan-Adventures-Season-2/16992|archivedate=2012-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mill Creek Entertainment]] announced all five seasons on DVD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6865">'''Jean-Baptiste Botul''' is a fictional French philosopher created in 1995 by the journalist [[Frédéric Pagès]] and other members of a group calling itself the Association of the Friends of Jean-Baptiste Botul. Originating as a literary hoax, the names of both Botul and his philosophy of ''botulism'' derive from [[botulism]], an illness caused by the bacterium ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeandillou, Jean-François. ''Supercheries littéraires: La vie et l'œuvre des auteurs supposés''. Geneva: Librairie Droz, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; References to Botul were first made in publications by members of the association and later turned up in texts by writers who were not party to the hoax and thought Botul was a real person, notably the French philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; There is now an annual Botul Prize awarded for a book that mentions Botul.

==History==
The hoax began in 1995, when Frédéric Pagès, a former professor of philosophy and a journalist for the satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' (The Chained Duck), invented Jean-Baptiste Botul and his chief work, entitled ''The Sexual Life of [[Immanuel Kant]]''.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=derbyshire/&gt; The general idea behind Botul and ''botulism'' was that philosophy is too vital to be left solely in the hands of professional philosophers.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; 

Various authors afterwards referred to this work—some facetiously and some seriously—including the philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], who quoted from it extensively in his 2010 book ''On War in Philosophy''.&lt;ref name=derbyshire/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aude Lancelin, "BHL en flagrant délire: l'affaire Botul". NouvelObs.com, Feb. 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gnouros, Oscar. "Après (et surtout avant) BHL, d'autres victimes de Jean-Baptiste Botul". ''Morbleu!'', Feb. 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy afterwards acknowledged that he had fallen for the "well-rigged" hoax.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=mclemee/&gt;

==Fictional biography==
Pagès created a fictitious history for Botul, as follows: Botul was supposedly born on August 15, 1896, in the French village of [[Lairière]] in the south-central [[Aude]] department. Affiliating himself with the oral tradition in philosophy, he left no official writings; instead, what is known of his thought comes from transcribed speeches and fragments of correspondence. He is said to have been a friend of the writer [[Marcel Proust]] and to have been engaged for a time to the politician and former spy [[Marthe Richard]].&lt;ref&gt;"Botul n'existe pas, je l'ai rencontré!"  ''Là-bas si j'y suis'' March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous people placed in his orbit include the writers [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]], [[Marie Bonaparte]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean Giraudoux]], [[Stefan Zweig]], and [[Andre Malraux]], and the Mexican revolutionaries [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]].&lt;ref&gt;Roubaud, Jacques. "Botulisme et Oulipisme". ''[[La Bibliothèque oulipienne]]'' 183 (February  2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 he supposedly emigrated to [[Paraguay]] with a hundred German families fleeing the advancing Soviet armies, and there he is said to have founded a town, 'Nueva Königsberg', governed by the principles of Kantian philosophy.&lt;ref name=derbyshire/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Landru, précurseur du féminisme'' cited in ''Le Nouvel Observateur'', Feb. 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His death date is given as August 15, 1947.

In his philosophical work, Botul is presented as an expert in the work of Immanuel Kant, with special attention to Kantian morality.

==History==
The effort to start Landmark Columbus began in 2013 when the Columbus Redevelopment Commission began looking at new ways to research and examine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Columbus taps conservator to preserve architecture|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/22423226/columbus-taps-conservator-to-preserve-architecture|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=www.wdrb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current state for the design heritage in the Columbus Arts and Entertainment District.&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=The Columbus Challenge|journal=Objects Speciality Group Postprints|date=2014|volume=21|pages=363-377|url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/osg-postprints/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/03/osg021-17.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The start of this project came at a time when some of the modern works of [[architecture]] had begun to age and show signs of transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes on Columbus, Indiana {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://www.docomomo-us.org/news/notes_columbus_indiana|website=www.docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
The effort officially launched as "Landmark Columbus" in 2015 as a program of Heritage Fund, and began producing events in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=MONUMENTAL TASK|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/11/06/monumental_task|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus Update: Civic Inspiration at the Right Scale {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://docomomo-us.org/news/columbus_update_civic_inspiration_right_scale|website=docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karaim|first1=Reed|title=Is Columbus's Modernist Legacy at Risk?|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/is-columbuss-modernist-legacy-at-risk_o|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort has been seen as a way to preserve the design legacy of the town without relying on traditional historic preservation ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Michael Franklin|title=Saving the Columbus Occupational Health Association|url=http://archpaper.com/2016/08/columbus-occupational-health-association/#gallery-0-slide-1|accessdate=20 August 2016|work=Archpaper.com|date=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaotic Tuesdays===
[[File:2015 Chaotic Tuesday.jpg|thumb|left|A "Chaotic Tuesday" inside the Commons]]
In celebration of [[Jean Tinguely]]'s masterwork, ''[[Chaos 1]]'', located inside the Commons, Landmark Columbus started "Chaotic Tuesdays" as a free community event during which everyone could see the [[kinetic art]]work operate during the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=Returning to a state of ‘Chaos’|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/02/22/returning_to_a_state_of_chaos/|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea for the event came from the director of [[Museum Tinguely]], Roland Wetzel, when he visited in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking Chaos with Roland Wetzel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T16pS4n3_Fs|website=YouTube|publisher=Landmark Columbus|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event happens on the fourth Tuesday of every month and has grown to be a partnership between many in the community and led by the Columbus Area Arts Council. Professors from Ivy Tech bring drawing materials for the community and provide lessons on how to draw the artwork, which Tinguely himself did many times; his drawings of ''Chaos 1'' are in collections around the world.    

===Landscape architecture cleanups===

A '''lecture''' (from the French 'lecture', meaning 'reading' [process]) is an oral [[presentation]] intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a [[university]] or [[college]] [[teacher]]. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a businessman's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.

Though lectures are much criticised as a [[teaching method]], universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of [[communication]] that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon [[passive learning]].  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to [[active learning]]. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in [[academia]] as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.

Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on "[[keynote|keynote addresses]]", i.e., lectures. The [[public lecture]] has a long history in the sciences and in [[social movement]]s. [[Hiring hall|Union halls]], for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, [[Local church|churches]], [[Community centre|community center]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[museum]]s, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of [[oral tradition]] in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of [[grey literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603045435/http://greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} GreyNet International, Document Types in Grey Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Golan levin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Golan Levin]] lecturing using a projected side]]
The noun "lecture" dates from 14th century, meaning "action of reading, that which is read," from the [[Latin]] ''lectus'', pp. of ''legere'' "to read." Its subsequent meaning as "oral discourse on a given subject before an audience for purposes of [[Education|instruction]]" is from the 16th century. The verb "to lecture" is attested from 1590.
The noun "lectern" refers to the reading desk used by lecturers.

==History==
The practice in the [[medieval university]] was for the instructor to read from an original source to a class of students who took notes on the lecture. The reading from original sources evolved into the reading of glosses on an original and then more generally to lecture notes. Throughout much of history, the diffusion of knowledge via handwritten lecture notes was an essential element of academic life.

[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Rembrandt's ''The Anatomy Lecture of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp'']]
Even in the twentieth century, the lecture notes taken by students, or prepared by a scholar for a lecture, have sometimes achieved wide circulation (see, for example, the genesis of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''Cours de linguistique générale'').  Many lecturers were, and still are, accustomed to simply reading their own notes from the lectern for exactly that purpose. Nevertheless, modern lectures generally incorporate additional activities, e.g. writing on a chalk-board, exercises, class questions and discussions, or student presentations.

The use of [[multimedia]] presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] has changed the form of lectures, e.g. video, graphics, websites, or prepared exercises may be included. Most commonly, however, only outlines composed of "bullet points" are presented.  Critics such as [[Edward Tufte]]  contend that this style of lecture bombards the audience with unnecessary and possibly distracting or confusing graphics.&lt;ref&gt;Tufte, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified lecture format, generally presented in 5 to 15 minute short segments, is now commonly presented as video, for example in [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) or in programs such as the [[Khan Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html Daphne Koller, ''What we're learning from online education''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804030308/http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html |date=2012-08-04 }}, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Hogarth lecture 1736.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|[[William Hogarth]]'s 1736 [[engraving]], 
''Scholars at a Lecture'']]
Bligh, in ''What's the Use of Lectures?'', argues that lectures "represent a conception of education in which teachers who know give knowledge to students who do not and are therefore supposed to have nothing worth contributing."  Based on his review of numerous studies, he concludes that lecturing is as effective, but not more effective, as any other teaching method in transmitting information.  Nevertheless, lecturing is not the most effective method for promoting student thought, changing attitudes, or teaching behavioral skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong| journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning| year = 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916150012/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| archivedate = 2014-09-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bligh summarises research on memory to show the significance of the meaningfulness of material on retention (Marks and Miller 1964) and the importance of immediate rehearsal of information (Bassey 1968).  He relates his own research on arousal during lectures to suggest a decrement in attention during the first 25 minutes.  Lloyd (1968) and Scerbo et al. (1992) showed that students take less and less notes as lectures proceed. Bligh shows that after a short break filled by buzz group discussion, attention will recover somewhat. 
The largest section of Bligh's book is devoted to lecturing technique, particularly the organisation of lectures, how to make a point, the effectiveness of taking notes, the use of handouts, and ways of obtaining feedback.
Early editions of the book contained a reply paid evaluation card. This research showed that the section on alternative teaching methods within lectures was the most highly praised.&lt;ref name=Bligh&gt;{{cite book|last=Bligh|first=Donald|title=What's the use of lectures?|year=1998|edition=5th|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=9781871516791|pages=316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-xxxqZXUU8C}} [http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic38998.files/Bligh_Ch1_and_Ch3.pdf Ch.1 and Ch. 3 reprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011213244/http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic38998.files/Bligh_Ch1_and_Ch3.pdf |date=2014-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conception of the lecture as needing to be a didactic event has been challenged by Meltzer and Manivannan (2002) and Sandry (2005) who maintain that lectures can involve active learning.&lt;ref name="byrne"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275637847_Using_Technology_to_Prevent_Plagiarism_Skilling_the_Students|title=Using Technology to Prevent Plagiarism: Skilling the Students|first1=Christopher|last1=Ireland|first2=Gillian|last2=Byrne|date=29 April 2015|publisher=|via=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831175516/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275637847_Using_Technology_to_Prevent_Plagiarism_Skilling_the_Students|archivedate=31 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Elliot (2005) sees difficulties in the encouragement of active learning with phenomena such as [[social loafing]] and [[Evaluation apprehension model|evaluation apprehension]] causing audience members to be reluctant to participate.&lt;ref name=byrne/&gt; A possible solution to the encouragement of audience involvement in lectures is the use of an [[Audience response#Use in Educational Settings|audience response system]] which allows audience members to participate anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199 | volume=41 | title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education | journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education | pages=482–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
The effectiveness of traditional lecture is and has been debated. Some advantages of lecturing include: quick exposure to new material, greater teacher control in the classroom, an engaging format, which may complement and clarify course material, and facilitating large-class communication.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  Lecturing also permits the dissemination of unpublished or not readily available material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Lecturing|url=http://www.southalabama.edu/languages/spanish/TRG/TRG/Enhancing_Learning/Lecturing/advantages.htm|website=TeachingResourcesGuide.com|publisher=South Alabama University|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112936/http://www.southalabama.edu/languages/spanish/TRG/TRG/Enhancing_Learning/Lecturing/advantages.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
There has been much debate as to whether or not lecturing actually improves student learning in the classroom.  Commonly cited disadvantages of lecture include: placing students in a passive (rather than an active) role, encouraging one-way communication, requiring significant out-of-class time for students to engage with the material, and requiring the speaker to possess effective speaking skills.&lt;ref name=cirtl&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecturing: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Traditional Lecture Method|url=http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|publisher=CIRTL Network|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311181116/http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticisms of lectures are often summarized by a quote generally misattributed&lt;ref name=notes2notes/&gt; to [[Mark Twain]]:
{{quote|College is a place where a professor’s lecture notes go straight to the students’ lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either.&lt;ref name=notes2notes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Professor’s Lecture Notes Go Straight to the Students’ Lecture Notes|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/17/lecture-minds/|work=Quote Investigator|accessdate=April 19, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502201823/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/17/lecture-minds/|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}. This source suggests that [[Edwin Slosson]] is more likely the original writer.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other forms==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
While lecturing is generally accepted as an effective form of instruction, there have been some prominent educators who have succeeded without the help of lectures.

Many [[university]] courses relying on lectures supplement them with smaller discussion sections, [[tutorial]]s, or laboratory experiment sessions as a means of further actively involving students. Often these supplemental sections are led by [[Postgraduate education|graduate student]]s, [[tutor]]s, [[teaching assistant]]s, or teaching [[fellow]]s rather than senior [[Faculty (division)|faculty]]. Those other forms of academic teaching include [[Conversation|discussion]] ([[recitation]] if conducted by a teaching assistant), [[seminar]]s, [[Training workshop|workshop]]s, [[observation]], practical application, [[case example]]s/[[case study]], [[experiential learning]]/[[active learning]], [[computer]]-based instruction, and [[tutorial]]s. 
  
In [[school]]s, the prevalent mode of student-teacher interaction is [[lesson]]s.

The term "[[Parlour|parlor]] lecture" gained currency throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United States|United States of America]] during the mid-19th century.  It referred to the custom of inviting noted speakers to deliver private lectures, which were typically hosted in the parlors of wealthy and socially influential families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.virginia.edu/~rmf8a/gaskell/EveningP.htm Gaskell's Compendium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202172539/http://people.virginia.edu/~rmf8a/gaskell/EveningP.htm |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series began airing on 2 August 2012 on [[ITV2]], and concluded its first series on 23 August 2012. Whilst on ''[[Let's Do Lunch with Gino &amp; Mel]]'', Lemon announced that a Christmas special of ''Lemon La Vida Loca'' would air in December. He confirmed this news on his [[Twitter]] account as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lemontwittor/status/241241160734089216|title=New celeb juice tonight 10pm.

{{Formula One|lists}}
From the beginning of organised motor sport events, in the early 1900s, until the late 1960s, before commercial [[Formula One sponsorship liveries|sponsorship liveries]] came into common use, vehicles competing in [[Formula One]], [[sports car racing]], [[touring car racing]] and other international [[auto racing]] competitions customarily [[paint]]ed their cars in standardised '''racing colours''' that indicated the nation of origin of the car or driver.  These were often quite different from the [[national colours]] used in other sports or in politics.

==History==

===1900s===

The colours have their origin in the national teams competing in the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing|Gordon Bennett Cup]], which was held annually in 1900-1905. Count [[Eliot Zborowski]], father of inter-war racing legend [[Louis Zborowski]], suggested that each national entrant be allotted a different colour. The [[1900 Gordon Bennett Cup|first competition in 1900]] assigned: Blue to France, Yellow to Belgium, White to Germany and Red to the USA. (Italy did not adopt its famous [[Rosso Corsa|'Racing Red']] until a red [[Itala]] won the [[Peking to Paris]] race in 1907).

When Britain first competed in [[1902 Gordon Bennett Cup|1902]], it had to choose a different colour from her [[national colours]] of red, white and blue, as these had already been allocated. [[Selwyn Edge]]'s winning [[D. Napier &amp; Son|Napier]] of 1902 was painted olive green, and green was well-established as an appropriate colour for locomotives and machinery, in which Britain had led the world during the previous century.   When Britain hosted the [[1903 Gordon Bennett Cup]] the following year on a closed course at [[Athy]] in Ireland, the British adopted [[Shamrock green]] which later evolved into various shades of '[[British racing green]]'.

===1920s - 1960s===

Colours were definitely established in the [[Interwar period]] of [[Grand Prix motor racing]] and listed by the AiACr (the forerunner of the [[FIA]]), when the ''[[Bleu de France (colour)|Bleu de France]]'' Bugattis and the ''[[Rosso Corsa]]'' Alfa Romeos of Italy won many races, while the [[British racing green]] [[Bentley]]s dominated the [[24 hours of Le Mans|Le Mans ''Grand Prix d'Endurance'']] until 1930.

In the 1930s the Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union teams did not apply the traditional German white paint, and their bare sheets of metal gave rise to the term ''[[Silver Arrows]]''.   A myth developed in the 1930s that the German teams did not apply white paint owing to the need to be under the 750&amp;nbsp;kg maximum weight limit; however the first "Silver Arrows" raced in 1932, before the weight limit was imposed in 1934.  Modern [[monocoque]] aircraft [[fuselage]] construction was already using polished and unpainted aluminium panels at this period, and the wealthy motor-racing fraternity would also have been aware that in [[Heraldry]], White and Silver are the same colour or '[[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]', described as '[[Argent]]'; (similarly Yellow and Gold are both called '[[Or (heraldry)|Or]]').

Post-war colours were defined in terms of body, bonnet, chassis, numbers and their backgrounds (see diagrams below). When the chassis was no longer exposed, the chassis colour was shown in various ways, e.g. the parallel blue stripes of the [[Briggs Cunningham|Cunningham]] team and other US teams in the 1950s. [[Porsche]] in the 1950s and 1960s also retained the silver colouring, although other German teams in the 1960s (such as BMW) returned to white paint.

During this period, the colour was not determined by the country the car was made in nor by the nationality of the driver(s) but by the [[List of Formula One constructors#Team's nationality|nationality of the team]] entering the vehicle, e.g. [[Stirling Moss]] drove some races during the [[1954 Formula One season|1954 season]] in a [[British racing green]] [[Maserati 250F]] because the Italian-built car was entered by the British [[Alfred Moss|A.E.Moss]] team. However, this general rule was not strictly kept. Australian [[Jack Brabham]] and New Zealander [[Bruce McLaren]], for instance, who both based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corktree.tripod.com/Case_History.html |title=Case History |publisher=Corktree.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and licensed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Zeltweg-1970-08-16e.jpg|title=1970 Austrian Grand Prix Entry list}}&lt;/ref&gt; their teams in Britain, used colour schemes on their early cars that were not based on national principles (namely the [[Brabham BT3]], [[McLaren M2B]], [[McLaren M4B]] and [[McLaren M5A]] cars).

===Sponsorship era - from 1968===

In the spring of {{F1|1968}}, [[Formula One sponsorship liveries|sponsorship liveries]], which had  already been used in the United States for some years, were also allowed in international racing. [[Team Gunston]], a South African [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateer team]], was the first Formula One team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors when they entered a private [[Brabham]] for [[John Love (racing driver)|John Love]], painted in the colours of [[Gunston]] cigarettes, in the [[1968 South African Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wheels24.co.za/FormulaOne/sa-was-ahead-of-the-curve-50-years-of-sponsorship-in-f1-20180320|title='SA was ahead of the curve' - 50 years of sponsorship in F1|website=wheels24.co.za|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next race, the [[1968 Spanish Grand Prix]], [[Team Lotus]] became the first [[Factory-backed|works team]] to follow this example, with [[Graham Hill]]'s [[Lotus 49]]B entered in the red, gold and white colors of [[Imperial Tobacco]]'s Gold Leaf brand. [[British Racing Green]] soon vanished from the cars of British teams.

The old colour scheme was abandoned by the [[FIA]] for most racing disciplines in the 1970s.

===Contemporary usage===

Traditional colours are still used by [[automaker]]s and teams that want to emphasise their racing traditions, especially by Italian, British and German manufacturers.

The ''[[Rosso Corsa]]'' has been used uninterruptedly by Italian manufacturers [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Alfa Romeo in motorsport|Alfa Romeo]].

Since the 1990s, other traditional colours have resurfaced, such as the [[British racing green]] F1 [[Jaguar Racing]] cars and [[Aston Martin]] sports cars, and the white F1 [[BMW Sauber]]. German manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and Audi (Auto Union) used silver paint when they returned to international racing in the 1990s. Many [[concept car]]s follow the old colour schemes, and most amateur racers prefer them as well.

Often, sponsorship agreements respect traditional colours. For example, Ferrari has had major sponsors which also use red colours, like Marlboro and Santander. In contrast, when tobacco company West sponsored McLaren in the 1990s and 2000s, they did not use their colours, but the "[[Silver Arrows]]" from engine provider [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]]. In a reversed situation, Subaru has continued using blue and yellow liveries well after their 555 sponsorship ended.

Some manufacturers prefer colours different from their national colours. For example, Citroën has traditionally used red, Renault and Opel have used yellow and black, and Volkswagen has used blue and white.

The [[EFDA Nations Cup]], running 1990-1998, was a one make racing series with around 20 national teams being represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastlinesinternational.com/Nations%20Cup |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812095607/http://www.fastlinesinternational.com/Nations%20Cup |archivedate=12 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Fastlines International&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual [[A1 Grand Prix]] series of 2005-2009 featured national teams, driving identical cars with differing colour schemes. Initially, most schemes were based on the respective national flags;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1gp.com/theCar/sportingRegulations.aspx |title=Sporting Regulations |publisher=A1 GP |accessdate=1 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524061557/http://www.a1gp.com/theCar/sportingRegulations.aspx |archivedate=24 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some teams with different traditional sporting colours have since switched, including [[A1 Team Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1gp.com/(S(h0bvirbprhtbpdm4mbkghkms))/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=41945 |title=Australia's new colours |date=28 August 2008 |publisher=A1 GP |accessdate=1 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831083920/http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=41945 |archivedate=31 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A1 Team India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1teamindia.in/news_article.php?newsid=50 |title=A1 Team India brings home 2 points with 9th position in the Feature Race |date=14 October 2007 |publisher=A1 Team India |accessdate=1 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314105710/http://www.a1teamindia.in/news_article.php?newsid=50 |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The old national racing colours were not so popular among these teams.

[[Honda]]'s range of street-legal Type-R vehicles are offered in Championship White (Honda colour code NH0) which is similar to the original white that adorned Honda's first F1 car ([[Honda RA272]]) driven by [[Richie Ginther]] that secured Honda's first ever F1 win in the [[1965 Mexican Grand Prix]].

These have stuck as a pattern, and are common outside of international Grand Prix racing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3824">'''Literary tourism''' is a type of [[cultural tourism]] that deals with places and events from [[fictional]] texts as well as the lives of their authors. This could include following the route taken by a fictional character, visiting particular place associated with a novel or a novelist, such as [[writer's home|their home]]., or [[Tombstone tourist|visiting a poet's grave]]. Some scholars regard literary tourism as a contemporary type of secular [[pilgrimage]]. There are also long-distance walking routes associated with writers, such as the [[Thomas Hardy]] Way.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Literary tourists are specifically interested in how places have influenced writing and at the same time how writing has created place. In order to become a literary tourist you need only book-love and an inquisitive mindset; however, there are literary guides, literary maps, and literary tours to help you on your way. There are also many museums associated with writers, and these are usually housed in buildings associated with a writer's birth or literary career, such as their [[writer's home|home]].
[[File:William Shakespeares birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon 26l2007.jpg|thumb|left|John Shakespeare's house, believed to be [[Shakespeare's Birthplace|Shakespeare's birthplace]], in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].]]
While most literary tourism is focused on famous works, more modern works that are written to specifically promote tourism are called [[tourism fiction]]. Modern tourism fiction can include travel guides within the story showing readers how to visit the real places in the fictional tales. With recent technological advances in publishing, digital tourism fiction books can even allow literary tourists to follow direct links to tourism websites related to the story. This can be done on new e-reading devices like the Kindle, iPad, iPhone, smart phones, tablets, and regular desktop and laptop computers. These links within the story allow readers to instantly learn about the real places without doing their own web searches.

The first classic novel to take advantage of tourism fiction technology was [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''This Side of Paradise: Interactive Tourism Edition'', published by the Southeastern Literary Tourism Initiative in 2012. The tourism edition offered web links to tours of Princeton University, where Fitzgerald attended in real life and where the fictional protagonist in the novel Amory Blaine attended. The tourism edition also offered links to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], where Fitzgerald fell in love with his future wife Zelda Sayre, much like the fictional character Amory fell in love with Rosalind.

In addition to visiting author and book sites, literary tourists often engage in [[bookstore tourism]], browsing local bookshops for titles specifically related to the sites as well as other regional books and authors.

==KwaZulu-Natal==
Literary tourism is a [[National Foundation for Educational Research|National Research Foundation]]-funded project in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]]. The project, [[KZN Literary Tourism]], has a Literary Map connecting authors whose lives or work is tied in some significant way to specific places in KwaZulu-Natal. Each author entry contains a short biography, a selected bibliography and an excerpt from the author's work that relates to the place identified in the map.&lt;ref&gt;[http://literature.kzn.org.za/lit/ KwaZulu-Natal map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105084635/http://literature.kzn.org.za/lit/ |date=2005-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Look Japan'''''|ルックジャパン|''Rukku Japan''}} was an English language magazine published from [[Japan]].  It was created to introduce Japanese culture to expatriate foreigners who were unfamiliar with the country.

==History and profile==
''Look Japan'' was established in 1953 by Takenori Kimura.&lt;ref name="Lookj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home &gt; News and Media &gt; E-zines|url=http://newsonjapan.com/html/linkbase/News_and_Media/E-zines/|publisher=News on Japan|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in English, [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] editions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1871533/Lookout-post-Brief-Article.html Lookout post.]." ''Look Japan''. 1 July 2002. Retrieved 11 October 2011. "LOOK JAPAN also publishes Chinese and Spanish versions of its print magazine."&lt;/ref&gt; The offices of the publisher, Look Japan Ltd, were in the Asahi Seimei Hibiya Building in [[Yurakucho]], [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="Lookj"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19981203065600/http://www.lookjapan.com/about.html About Us]."

Jay Brushart of the ''[[Portsmouth Daily Times]]'' said that the format of ''Look Japan'' was similar to that of ''[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brushart, Jay. "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XqVFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kM8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5828,5491685&amp;dq=look-japan+magazine&amp;hl=en Learning the meaning of citizenship]." ''[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]''. 19 February 1992. A4. Retrieved 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Gibson of the ''[[Harlan Daily Enterprise]]'' said that ''Look Japan'' was "a slick publication, a lot like "[[People (magazine)|People]]" that offers the non-Japanese a most interesting look at the country and its people."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ed. "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8U9BAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AqkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1933,3709539&amp;dq=look-japan+magazine&amp;hl=en Japanese Sayings Have A Familiar Ring To Them]."

A '''luxury yacht''', also known as a '''superyacht''' or '''megayacht''', is a large and very expensive professionally-crewed sailing or motor [[yacht]].

There is no industry-wide definition of a luxury yacht. However, there is a legal distinction between yachts above {{convert|24|m}} and below, as in some countries those above 24 meters must have a permanent crew onboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rya.org.uk/infoadvice/boatingabroad/Pages/boatingabroadpaperwork.aspx|title = RYA regulations|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hacker tender and Christina O.jpg|thumb|right| ''[[Christina O]]'' of [[Aristotle Onassis]]]]
This term began to appear at the beginning of the 20th century, when wealthy individuals constructed large private yachts for personal pleasure, such as [[Charles Henry Fletcher]]'s ''Jemima F. III'', at 111 feet, the largest motor-powered yacht in the world in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; More examples of early luxury motor yachts include the [[Cox &amp; King]] yachts, [[Gas Engine &amp; Power Company &amp; Charles L. Seabury Company|Charles L. Seabury and Company]]'s yachts, M/Y (motor yacht) ''[[Christina O]]'', and M/Y ''[[MV Savarona|Savarona]]''.

Between 1997 and 2008, there was a massive growth in the number, size, and popularity of large private luxury yachts in the {{convert|24|to|70|m|ft|adj=on}} size range. Luxury yachts typically have no real home port as such, although a yacht must be registered in a port of the country where its flag state is registered. Popular flag state registrars for large yachts are [[Cayman Islands]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Isle of Man]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]], among others. (Many times the yacht will have never been to these ports.) They are particularly bountiful in the Mediterranean Sea in summer and the Caribbean Sea in winter. Some can be chartered (rented) for sums of up to 1 million [[Euro]] per week. Yachts will dock in a port of choosing while the crew does maintenance work and waits for owners or guests to arrive. The vessels then will do short cruises with the owners and/or guests aboard. Typical destinations in Spain and the [[French Riviera|French]] and Italian Rivieras include Cannes, Antibes, St. Tropez, Monte Carlo, [[Portofino]], Porto Cervo, [[Puerto Banús]], Puerto Portals, and [[Palma, Majorca]], although increasingly luxury yachts are cruising in more remote areas of the world. Antigua is one of the main ports in the Windward Islands of the Caribbean and hosts a Charter Show at the beginning of the winter season.

While the demand for new luxury yachts has slowed somewhat since 2009, 2011 has seen a small rebound with launches from many of the top yards. The {{convert|163.5|m}} [[Eclipse (yacht)|M/Y ''Eclipse'']], was built by [[Blohm + Voss]] for Russian businessman [[Roman Abramovich]]&lt;ref name="Boat International"/&gt; and the {{convert|180|m}} ''[[Azzam (yacht)|Azzam]]'' launched in 2013 are the largest private yachts in the world. Luxury boatbuilding and yacht charter companies are predominantly based in Western Europe and the United States but are also increasingly found in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and Eastern Europe.

As of 2016 there were about 10,000 luxury yachts, worldwide, over 24 metres in length. The annual production rate was reported to be around 150.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/editorial-features/mega-yachts-explained--27357|title=Megayachts explained|last=Nineham|first=Laura|date=August 22, 2016|website=Boat International|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charter==
[[Image:Aerial view Yacht Harbour Residence Rostock Yachthafenresidenz Hohe Düne 1.jpg|right|thumb|Luxury [[yacht club]] and [[marina]] with charter yachts – ''Yachthafenresidenz Hohe Düne'' in [[Rostock]], [[Germany]].]]
Some yachts are used exclusively by their private owners, others are operated all year round as charter businesses, and a large number are privately owned but available for charter part-time. The weekly charter rate of luxury yachts around the world ranges from tens of thousands to over a million dollars/euros. Expenses of approximately 20–30%, such as food, fuel, and [[Berth (moorings)|berthing]] are charged as an extra, called the [[advance provisioning allowance]]. The luxury yacht charter industry functions effectively because private yacht owners mitigate their running costs with charter income as well as keeping their yachts and crew in top running order. Conversely, private charterers charter yachts (rather than owning them) because it is generally considered to be less expensive, and less hassle, than owning a yacht and it also provides them with extra choice related to yacht type, location and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Yachts from {{convert|24|m|ft}} and up qualify for design awards, but given the number of yachts exceeding 100 feet, many set the minimum length for a super-yacht higher. A {{convert|45|to|50|m|ft|adj=on}} yacht, the smallest with a generally accepted claim to super-yacht status, will usually be a three-decker with cabins for 10–12 guests and for a crew of a similar size. The accommodation on this type of yacht is typically as follows:

*Lower deck: exterior swimming platform at the stern; four (sometimes five) guest cabins with en-suite bath aft; engine room amidships; crew quarters forward.
*Main deck: sheltered exterior deck aft leading into the saloon; dining room and [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]]; entrance amidships; owner's suite forward, usually includes a study, and sometimes a second stateroom for a personal assistant/bodyguard.
*Upper deck: exterior deck aft, often used for outdoor dining; second saloon (often called the sky lounge); sixth stateroom will be amidships if it is not on the lower deck or part of the owner's suite; captain's cabin; bridge.
*Sun deck: the uppermost deck, often features a jacuzzi and sometimes a glass-enclosed gym (which can also be below decks or even part of the owner's suite).

A 50-metre yacht will have one or more [[luxury yacht tender]]s for reaching shore and other "toys" which may include a [[speed boat]] or sailing boat, [[personal water craft]], [[windsurfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]] equipment and a [[banana boat (boat)|banana boat]]. Up-to-date yachts have multiple televisions and satellite communications.

The number of very large yachts has increased rapidly since the 1990s, and increasingly only yachts above around {{convert|65|m|ft}} stand out among other luxury yachts. Yachts of this size are almost always built to individual commissions and cost tens of millions of dollars (most super-yachts cost far more than their owners' homes on land, even though those homes are likely to be among the largest and most opulent). A yacht of this size usually has four decks above the waterline and one or two below. It is likely to have a helicopter landing platform. Apart from additional guest cabins, which are likely to include one or more "VIP suites" besides the owner's suite, extra facilities compared to a {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}} yacht will include some or all of the following: indoor jacuzzis, sauna and steam rooms, a beauty salon, massage and other treatment rooms, a medical centre, a disco (usually the same space as the sky lounge or saloon, transformed into a dance area when furnishings are moved aside and special lighting activated), a cinema, plunge pool (possibly with a wave-maker), a playroom, and additional living areas such as a separate bar, secondary dining room, private sitting rooms or a library. There will be more boats and "toys" than there are on a {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}}.

==Gigayacht==
[[Image:Yacht Lady Moura in Monaco.jpg|thumb|right|Megayacht ''[[Lady Moura]]'' in [[Monaco]] harbor]]
A '''gigayacht''' is an extraordinarily large luxury yacht, and first emerged as a hyperbolic term in the mid-2000s. Power &amp; Motoryacht magazine's popular Megayachts forum, which was online from the early 1990s to 2012 (now offline), had an ongoing discussion about the term, since luxury yachts at that time were getting larger and larger, exceeding 300 feet in length (about 91 meters). The word megayacht was coined by yacht broker George Nicholson of Camper &amp; Nicholsons, quoted in one of the first issues of Power &amp; Motoryacht magazine in 1985 as well as subsequent media reports elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

They incorporate many of the same features that smaller megayachts do, such as helicopter landing areas and swimming pools, though given their extra length, they also feature helicopter hangars and miniature submarines.

==Crew==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
The crew required to operate a large or super-sized luxury yacht can number from 8 members for a 120&amp;nbsp;ft yacht, to a complement of 70 for a yacht the size of ''[[Eclipse (yacht)|Eclipse]]''. The crew is made up of a captain, first mate or officer, chief engineer, engineers, bosun, personal chef, crew chef, deckhands, purser, and stewards. Luxury yachts are maintained by crew all year round but will often scale down to a skeleton crew during the seasons that the owners are not on board and no charters are booked. Most crew members live on board and are paid a monthly salary, with most living expenses covered by the owner. Live-on-board crews do not pay rent, food, electricity or water bills. All luxury yachts have crew areas below deck, which consist of a crew mess, crew cabins and laundry. While most crew cabins contain bunk beds, there are captains and chief engineers who, on the larger yachts, have their own cabins. There are no set hours that crew members work each week. The hours depend greatly on how often the owners are on board, how often it is chartered and on what hours the captain sets when there are no guests on board. The crew can be hired through crew agencies or various websites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9413">'''Media economics''' embodies [[economics|economic]] theoretical and practical economic questions specific to [[Mass media|media]] of all types. Of particular concern to media economics are the economic policies and practices of media companies and disciplines including [[journalism]] and the [[news industry]], [[film]] production, [[entertainment]] programs, [[Printing|print]], [[Broadcasting|broadcast]], mobile communications, [[Internet]], [[advertising]] and [[public relations]]. [[Deregulation]] of media, media ownership and concentration, market share, [[intellectual property rights]], competitive economic strategies, company economics, "[[media tax]]" and other issues are considered parts of the field. Media economics has [[social]], cultural, and economic implications.Regular study of media economic issues began in the 1970s but flourished in the 1980s with the addition of classes on the subject at U.S. and European universities. ''[[The Journal of Media Economics]]'' began publishing in 1988, edited by [[Robert G. Picard]], one of the founding fathers of the discipline. Since that time the field of inquiry has flourished and there are now hundreds of universities offering courses and programs in media economics. Other significant figures in the field have included [[Steven S. Wildman]], Alan Albarran, [[Bruce M. Owen]], Ben Compaine, [[Ghislain Deslandes]], Stuart McFadyen, Gillian Doyle, Karl Erik Gustafsson, Lucy Küng, Gregory Ferrell Lowe, Nadine Toussaint Desmoulins, [[Achour Fenni]], [[Amanda D. Lotz]], and Stephen Lacy.

Within academia, the location of media economics research varies depending upon the tradition and history of the institution. In some universities it is located in schools of business or economics, whereas in others it is located in communication, media or journalism schools (or departments).

The term "[[cultural economics]]" is sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for media economics but they are not substitutable. Cultural economics includes a wide variety of activities that do not necessarily involve mediated dissemination such as museums, symphonies, operas, and festivals. At times these may cross over into media economic issues, such as when audio or video recordings are made of performances or museum holdings are put on [[CD]]s.

== Advertising revenues ==
In the United States, a report from the Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB) states that in 2002, radio's revenue reached $19.4 billion, an increase of 5.7% from the $17.7 billion earned in 2001. For additional details see [https://web.archive.org/web/20050513032002/http://www.rab.com/station/marketing_guide/RMGFB2004.pdf RAB's Radio Fact Book]. Total broadcast revenues for 2001 were $54.4 billion, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20030222120906/http://www.tvb.org/rcentral/MediaTrendsTrack/tvbasics/19_Total_and_TV_Ad_Volume.asp reported by The Television Advertising Bureau (TVB)].

=== Advertiser spending ===
:Quote – "Annually advertisers spend approximately $150 billion to sponsor TV and radio programs, in the hopes of making two-to-three times as much in return from media consumers who buy their products and services (Fox, 2002). From the 1970s to the 1990s, the daily number of ads targeted at the average American jumped from 560 to 3,000 (Fox, 2002). In that same time frame, the number of ads to which children were exposed increased from 20,000 per year (Adler et al., 1977) to more than 40,000 per year (Kunkel &amp; Gantz, 1992; also see Strasburger, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lrc.edu/psy/dillk/The%20economics%20of%20media%20violence.htm |author1=Bartholow, Bruce D. |author2=Dill, Karen E. |author3=Anderson, Kathryn B. |author4=Lindsay, James J. |title=The Economics of Media Violence|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030728162039/http://www.lrc.edu/psy/dillk/The%20economics%20of%20media%20violence.htm |archivedate=2003-07-28|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4296">The '''Mutiny of the Trout''' (Spanish: ''Motín de la Trucha'') was a semi-legendary [[popular revolt]] in [[Zamora, Spain]], in late 1157. The uprising is first mentioned in a late 15th-century manuscript. While the story is not inherently implausible, there is no near-contemporary evidence for it and modern scholars have been hesitant to accept it as historical.

The revolt supposedly began as a dispute over a [[trout]]. The steward of Gómez Álvarez de Vizcaya, the town governor or ''regidor'', tried to requisition an especially fine-looking trout from a local fishmonger who had already promised to sell it to the shoemaker. The steward then claimed that the ''regidor'' had prior rights. During the ensuing argument, which attracted several other townsmen to support the shoemaker, the steward arrested the latter and some of his supporters. This sparked a riot. Some local knights, including the eldest son (unnamed in the sources) of Count [[Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera]], then governor of Zamora, convened in the church of Santa María to discuss the proper course of action, the rioters locked them in and set the church alight, burning to death all inside. They then razed to the ground the house of the ''regidor'', and, fearing the reprisals of Count Ponce, they fled ''en masse'' to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] border and asked the king, [[Ferdinand II of León|Ferdinand II]], through messengers to pardon them and confiscate Ponce's lands (''[[tenencia]]s''). Ferdinand feared that they would abandon Zamora permanently and settle in Portugal, the kingdom of his enemy. The enemies of Ponce de Cabrera at court counselled the king to accede to the townsfolk's demands, and so pardon was granted and Ponce was deprived of his governorships and exiled. 

One commentator has seen in the story "notable indications of its veracity" (''no desdeñables indicios de su veracidad''), but it is not widely accepted by historians. Urban uprisings were characteristic of the [[Kingdom of León]] at the time. In 1161 there was one in [[Lugo]] and in 1162 a further two in [[Salamanca]] and [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]]. The exile of Ponce de Cabrera is also a historical fact, but no source other than the Mutiny story provides a reason for it. He soon returned to favour:
{|

:''Tenía la governación de la cibdad de Zamora por el dicho rey don Fernando el Conde don Ponce de Cabrera y el rey tomó tal enojo del por este caso que lo despojó de la tierra que le dava y él se fue huyendo al rey de Castilla don Sancho, el deseado, el qual después le ganó perdón y retitución con gracia y su hazienda y bolvió a la cibdad con el cargo que primero tenía''. 
|
:Holding the government of the city of Zamora from the said king don Fernando was the Count don Ponce de Cabrera, and the king was so angered by this case [the Mutiny] that he dispossessed him of the land that he had given him and he [Ponce] fled to the king of Castile don Sancho, the Desired &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Sancho III of Castile]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, he [Ponce] whom afterwards gained from him [Fernando] pardon and restitution with grace and his estates and he returned to the city with the office that he had at first held.

The '''New Zealand International Science Festival''' is a biennial [[science festival]] which takes place for six days and involves participation of international keynote speakers; NZISF-staff produce events, external event organisers, and a range of local and national sponsors and funders.  Up to 40 individual volunteers help run 200 festival events and thousands of visitors from all over New Zealand participate in festival events.  The festivals attract a significant amount of high-profile local, regional and national media coverage, in print, radio and TV. The festival was first held in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifest.org.nz/about-us|title=About us|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its aim is to celebrate, promote and raise awareness of science, technology and the environment. The festival encourages people and organisations (educational, research, business and community) to participate in the promotion of their work in science and its applications and contributions to society. They also aim to highlight the excellence of achievements in these fields by Dunedin, Otago and New Zealand scientists. Beside private sponsors, core contributors to the festival are the [[Dunedin City Council]], [[The Community Trust of Otago]] and the [[University of Otago]].

==Sci Kids==

Children are one of the festival's key audiences. The festival is held during the winter school holidays, and most events for kids are free.

The '''Nursing Madonna''', '''''Virgo Lactans''''', or '''Madonna Lactans''', is an [[iconography]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] in which the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] is shown [[breastfeeding]] the infant [[Jesus]].

The depiction is mentioned by Pope [[Gregory the Great]], and a mosaic depiction probably of the 12th century is on the facade of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, though few other examples survive from before the late Middle Ages.  It continued to be found in Orthodox icons (as ''Galaktotrophousa'' in Greek, ''Mlekopitatelnitsa'' in Russian), especially in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tradigo|first=Alfredo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uODOkMgUZKYC&amp;pg=PA183|title=Icons And Saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church, A Guide to Imagery|page=183|year=2006|publisher=Getty|isbn=9780892368457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the depiction seems to have revived with the [[Cistercian Order]] in the 12th century, as part of the general upsurge in [[Mariology|Marian theology]] and devotion.  Milk was seen as "processed blood", and the milk of the Virgin to some extent paralleled the role of the [[Blood of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eucharist in Romanesque France: Iconography And Theology|last=Saxon|first=Elizabeth|pages=205-207|year=2006|publisher=Boydell|isbn=9781843832560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DwQB4_6tG0C&amp;pg=PA206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, the middle and upper classes usually contracted breastfeeding out to [[wetnurse]]s, and the depiction of the Nursing Madonna was linked with the [[Madonna of Humility]], a depiction that showed the Virgin in more ordinary clothes than the royal robes shown, for instance, in images of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], and often seated on the ground.  The appearance of a large number of such depictions in [[Tuscany]] in the early 14th century was something of a visual revolution for the theology of the time, compared to the [[Queen of Heaven]] depictions; they were also popular in [[Iberia]]. After the [[Council of Trent]] in the mid-16th century, clerical writers discouraged nudity in religious subjects, and the use of the Madonna Lactans iconography began to fade away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From the Pews in the Back|first1=Mary Ann|last1=Hinsdale|first2=Kate|last2=Dugan|first3=Jennifer|last3=Owens|year=2009|isbn=0-8146-3258-0|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of depiction, also deprecated after Trent, showed Mary baring her breast in a traditional gesture of female supplication to Christ when asking for mercy for sinners in [[Deesis]] or [[Last Judgement]] scenes. A good example is the fresco at S. Agostino in [[San Gimignano]], by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], painted to celebrate the end of the plague. {{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

The nursing Virgin survived into the Baroque some depictions of the [[Holy Family]], by [[El Greco]] for example,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:El Greco - Holy Family with St Anne - WGA10565.jpg|El Greco in Budapest]]&lt;/ref&gt; and narrative scenes such as the ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]'', for example by [[Orazio Gentileschi]] (versions in Birmingham and Vienna).

A variant, known as the '''Lactation of St Bernard''' ('''''Lactatio Bernardi''''' in Latin, or simply '''Lactatio''') is based on a miracle or vision concerning St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] where the Virgin sprinkled milk on his lips (in some versions he is awake, praying before an image of the Madonna, in others asleep).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La lactation de saint Bernard: Legende et iconographie|last1=Dewez|first1=Léon|last2=van Iterson|first2=Albert|journal=Citeaux in de Nederlanden|volume=7|year=1956|pages=165–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In art he usually kneels before a Madonna Lactans, and as Jesus takes a break from feeding, the Virgin squeezes her breast and he is hit with a squirt of milk, often shown travelling an impressive distance. The milk was variously said to have given him wisdom, shown that the Virgin was his mother (and that of mankind generally), or cured an eye infection. In this form the Nursing Madonna survived into [[Baroque art]], and sometimes the [[Rococo]], as in the high altar at [[Kloster Aldersbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Aldersbach Pfarrkirche - Hochaltar 2 Altarbild.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of Suyapa''' (Spanish: ''Nuestra Señora de Suyapa''), also known as the '''Virgin of Suyapa''' (Spanish: ''Virgen de Suyapa'') is a title of the [[Virgin Mary]], mother of [[Jesus Christ]]. An 18th-century cedar wood statue (6 cm/2.3 in) of the Virgin is perhaps  [[Honduras]]' most popular religious image, and the focus of an extensive pilgrimage.&lt;ref name=Malkin&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/world/americas/19tegucigalpa.html Malkin, Elizabeth. "Amid a Crisis, Hondurans Heap Large Hopes on a Tiny Religious Icon", ''The New York Times'', October 18, 2009] Retrieved 2012-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is kept in the Basílica de Suyapa in [[Suyapa]], a suburb of the capital [[Tegucigalpa]], and toured through various other parts of Honduras each year in early February. Many thousands of people from all over [[Central America]] make pilgrimages to visit the statue on her name day, February 3rd, a commemoration of the day she was found. The statue has been stolen and then recovered on two occasions.&lt;ref name=Malkin/&gt; Our Lady of Suyapa is the Patroness of Honduras.

==Discovery==
[[File:Basilica Virgen de Suyapa.jpg|thumb|300px|The Basilica of the Virgin of Suyapa.]]
[[File:Festival Virgin Suyapa Tegucigalpa Honduras.jpg|thumb|300px|The festival of the Virgin of Suyapa.]]
There are several different versions of how the statue of the Virgin of Suyapa was discovered.

Many Hondurans believe the statue was [[miracle|miraculously]] discovered in late January or early February 1747 by a labourer, Alejandro Colindres. Colindres and an 8-year-old boy had been sent by Colindres's mother to clear some cornfields on Piligüin mountain, northeast of Tegucigalpa. On the way back, they were overtaken by nightfall and decided to sleep outside. During the night, Colindres was awakened by a sharp pain in his side, and discovered that he was sleeping on something.&lt;ref name=Malkin/&gt; Later versions of the story claim that without looking at the object, Colindres threw it as far away as he could, only to find it underneath him as he lay down again.  This detail, however, is not present in early versions of the story.  The next morning, Colindres discovered that he had been sleeping on a tiny statue of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Blessed Virgin Mary]],&lt;ref name=archmil&gt;[https://www.archmil.org/offices/world-mission/Hispanic-Heritage-Month-and-Mission-Month/Our-Lady-of-Suyapa.htm Zelada, Rogelio. "Marian Titles in the Popular Religiosity of Latin America (Advocaciones Marianas en la Religiosidad Popular Latinoamericana)", Miami, Southeast Regional Office for Hispanic Ministry, Inc (DBA SEPI)]&lt;/ref&gt; which he took home with him and set up on the family altar in his mother's house. There it remained for the next 20 years.

By 1777, a chapel was constructed for the statue. The first shrine of our Lady of Suyapa was blessed in 1780.&lt;ref name=archmil/&gt; The first notable attested miracle, occurred in 1796.&lt;ref name=Dayton/&gt;

The statue has been stolen twice. In 1986 it was stolen and stripped of its gold, silver, and jewels, and left in the men's room of the restaurant La Terrraza de Don Pepe in Tegucigalpa.

==Description==
''La Morenita'' (the Dear Dark One) is carved in cedar wood, and measures less than 2.5 inches in size. It is believed that the carving is very old, and possibly done as a devotional item by an unknown, amateur artist.  She has an oval face and straight, shoulder length hair.  Her hands are joined in prayer and she wears a light pink robe. The statue is covered by a dark cloak trimmed with golden stars and adorned with valuable jewels.&lt;ref name=archmil/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dayton&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/l/latin-american-titles-of-mary.php "Honduras: Our Lady of Suyapa", Latin American Titles of Mary, International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
In 1925, [[Pope Pius XI]] declared her Patroness of Honduras under the title Our Lady of Suyapa, and selected February 3 as her feast day. In 1954, a large [[Basilica]] was built next to the chapel.  The statue of the Virgin spends most of her time in the chapel, but every year before the celebration of her festival, the statue is moved into the larger church to accommodate the crowds.

The statue is considered to have miraculous powers. The swift ending of the [[Football War]] between Honduras and [[El Salvador]] is attributed to the statue. Many of the Honduran soldiers involved reported visions of the Virgin, which calmed their fears during the fighting. In 1969 The Virgin of Suyapa was declared Captain General of the Armed Forces of Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hondurasnews.com/virgen-de-suyapa/ Catrachita. "Hondurans Celebrate La Virgen de Suyapa", ''Honduras News'', February 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of the Virgin of Suyapa has a group of lay caretakers, all male, known as the Orden de los Caballeros de Suyapa, founded in the 20th century.  They are responsible for caring for the image, and the small chapel.  They escort the statue whenever it leaves the chapel to travel around Honduras, as it often does every February.

'''Peter Paret''' (born April 13, 1924) is a German-born American cultural and intellectual historian, whose two principal areas of research are war and the interaction of art and politics from 18th to 20th century Europe.&lt;ref name="ias"&gt;"[https://www.ias.edu/scholars/paret Peter Paret]". Institute for Advanced Study. ias.edu. Retrieved August&amp;nbsp;5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also written on related subjects in more recent times.

==Early life ==
Paret was born in 1924 in Berlin,&lt;ref name="ContempAuthors"&gt;"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/paret-peter-1924 Peter Paret]". ''Contemporary Authors Online''. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale, 2017. Via ''Encyclopedia.com''. Retrieved August&amp;nbsp;5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Hans Paret and Suzanne Aimée Cassirer.  On his father's side, he is descended from a French family that emigrated to Germany in 1679.  Thirteen of Paret's ancestors, including his great grandfather and grandfather, were [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ministers.  His father, severely wounded in the First World War, studied philosophy before turning to business, and after the Second World War became head of the firm Beuck and Paret, business consultants.  Paret's mother, who began to study medicine after her marriage, came from a Jewish family well-known for the past two centuries in manufacturing (weaving looms, steel cables), finance, publishing, and scholarship.  Her father, [[Paul Cassirer]], publisher and art dealer, was an important force for modernism in the arts in Germany.  The philosopher [[Ernst Cassirer]] was her uncle.  In 1932, Paret's parents were divorced, and his mother with her young daughter moved to [[Vienna]], where she continued her studies with [[Sigmund Freud]].  Paret followed in January 1933.  In the following year, his mother married the psychoanalyst and educational reformer [[Siegfried Bernfeld]]&amp;nbsp;– subject of a recent biography by Peter Dudeck, ''Er war halt genialer als die anderen'' (Vienna, 2012)&amp;nbsp;– and with her husband and children moved to France, and in August 1937 to the United States, where they settled in [[San Francisco]].

==Career ==
Paret entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in January 1942, was drafted the following year, and served in combat intelligence and operations sections of an infantry battalion in the New Guinea and Philippine campaigns and in Korea.  In 1946, at the age of 21, he was discharged with the rank of Staff Sergeant, reentered UC Berkeley as a sophomore, and graduated in 1949,&lt;ref name="ias"/&gt; after which he returned to Europe to reconnect with his father and other relatives.  His plan to study art history was interrupted by the need to assist his mother during his stepfather's final illness, and it was not until 1955 that he began graduate study, this time in history, at [[King's College London]].

He wrote his dissertation on the [[Prussian Reform Movement (1806–1815)|Prussian Reform era]] under [[Michael Howard (historian)|Michael Howard]], became an early member of the Institute for Strategic Studies, served as Resident Tutor in the Delegacy of Extra-Mural Studies of Oxford University, and in the last year before receiving his degree, began to publish articles on contemporary military thought as well as on recent history, having found important documents in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|British archives]], including a lost register of a [[Gestapo]] prison established after the [[20 July plot|attempt on Hitler's life on July 20, 1944]].

After receiving his Ph.D., in 1960,&lt;ref name="ias"/&gt; Paret returned to the United States as Research Associate at the [[Center of International Studies]], Princeton University, where he spent two years. With John W. Shy, who was then a finishing graduate student at Princeton, he wrote his first book, ''Guerrillas in the 1960s'' (New York, 1961), a short work analyzing the nature of irregular [[war]]fare and the difficulties it posed to modern, [[industrialisation|industrialized]] societies, which was reprinted several times, and came out in an expanded edition the following year.

In 1962, Paret came to the [[University of California, Davis]], as Visiting Assistant Professor. He was promoted to tenure the following year, and to full professor in 1966.&lt;ref name="ias"/&gt; During these years at an innovative, rapidly expanding campus, which he later characterized as the happiest in his academic career, he published a study of the modern French theory of political-military warfare, ''French Revolutionary Warfare from Indochina to Algeria'' (New York, 1966), and an expanded version of his dissertation, ''Yorck and the Era of Prussian Reform'' (Princeton, 1966), a work combining ideological analysis with the study of operational and tactical doctrine, and prepared the context for his growing interest in the ideas and life of [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]], who as a young officer was an active member of the Prussian reform movement.

In 1969, after a year at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], Paret was appointed Professor of History at [[Stanford University]]; and in 1977 he became the Raymond A. Spruance Professor of International History there.&lt;ref name="ias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContempAuthors"/&gt;

In 1976, having written several articles on the life and work of Clausewitz, he published a biography, ''Clausewitz and the State'' (now in its third expanded edition), which has been translated into three languages. Paret's work together with [[Raymond Aron]]'s ''Penser la guerre: Clausewitz'', published in the same year, placed Clausewitz firmly in the history of ideas and politics of the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]], [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic]], and post-Napoleonic periods. Paret and Aron reviewed each other's works favorably, although their perspectives on the subject differed.  Unlike Aron, Paret has shown little interest in the influence of Clausewitz's ideas on more recent and contemporary conflicts.  He studies him, he has said, as he would study [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for what he has composed, not for how later conductors or opera directors perform his work.  The title of Paret's book points to the powerful role the [[Prussia]]n state played in Clausewitz's life, a power that reappears in the central role of policy and politics in Clausewitz's theories.

The same year the biography appeared, Howard's and Paret's translation of Clausewitz's major theoretical work, ''[[On War]]'', was published. Highly praised, it has also received some criticism.  The work, now available in five English-language editions, has been repeatedly reprinted.  Paret's recent article, “Translation, Literal or Accurate,” in ''[[The Journal of Military History]]'', July 2014, outlines the principles he and Howard followed in converting Clausewitz's early 19th century German into modern English&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; principles of [[translation]] that also apply to Paret's and Daniel Moran's subsequent translations of Clausewitz's ''Historical and Political Writings'' (Princeton, 1992).  A related project was Paret's new edition of ''Makers of Modern Strategy'' (Princeton, 1986), which retained three essays from the 1943 original, revised four others, and added twenty-two new essays.  The work continues to be widely read and used as a text.  It is currently being translated into simplified Chinese, the 14th translation of the work.

Since 1980, when his study of modern art and its enemies in [[German Empire|imperial Germany]], ''The Berlin Secession'', appeared, Paret has published several monographs and collections of essays in the history of art, three of which have been translated into German.  He combined his interests in the history of art and the history of war in ''Imagined Battles: Reflections of War in European Art'' (Chapel Hill, 1997), a work dedicated "to the memory of the men with whom I served, and against whom I served, in New Guinea and the Philippines."

Paret retired at the age of 73 in 1997.  He continues to write, lecture and publish.  Among his recent work are Clausewitz in His Time (New York:  Oxford, 2015), an expanded German edition of which, Clausewitz in seiner Zeit, appeared in 2017, as well as two long articles on "Clausewitz as a Historian and as a Historical Subject" in the Journal of Military History, the second of which, "The Function of History in Clausewitz's Understanding of War," which will appear in the Journal of Military History, LXXXII, 4, October 2018, has been translated into German, and will be published this winter by the Miles-Verlag, Berlin, together with a second article on a related subject by Hans Delbrück (1848-1929) in a volume edited by Professor Paret.

==Honors and awards ==

Paret is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], which has awarded him its Thomas Jefferson Medal, an Honorary Fellow of the [[London School of Economics]], and an Honorary Member of the German Clausewitz Society. He has received an honorary doctorate from the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University, Berlin]], as well as three other honorary degrees, and the German government awarded him the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Great Cross of the Order of Merit]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="ias"/&gt;

In 1993, he was awarded the [[Samuel Eliot Morison Prize]] for lifetime achievement given by the [[Society for Military History]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh-hq.org/awards/morison.html |title=Samuel Eliot Morison Prize previous winners |publisher=[[Society for Military History]]  |accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he received the $100,000 [[Pritzker Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement in Military Writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/explore/pritzker-literature-award/peter-paret-2017-pritzker-literature-winner/ |title=Peter Paret |work=pritzkermilitary.org |author= |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-pritzker-military-writing-award-20170621-story.html |title=93-year-old author wins $100,000 Pritzker military writing award |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |author= |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key was heated and pressed to the area where a person had been bitten by a dog believed to have rabies.

The film was released in China on June 17, 2010. The film had a [[limited release]] in the United States on October 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/chinese-neonoir-shanghai-to-see-us-release-august-21-1201485980/ | title=World War II-Set Neo-Noir 'Shanghai' Finally Gets U.S. Release| date=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/shanghai-weinstein-co-release-date-change-1201502912/#comment-list-wrapper | title=Weinstein Co.

==Plot==
In December 1941, just before the entry of the United States into [[World War II]], an American agent from the [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence Office]] (Cusack) arrives in [[Shanghai]] to find his friend Conner ([[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]) was recently murdered. Determined to find out who killed Conner and why, he begins working at the Herald using the alias Paul Soames, a Nazi-sympathizer cover he used while stationed in [[Berlin]]. He meets Anthony Lan-Ting ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]) an influential crime lord and Captain Tanaka ([[Ken Watanabe]]) at the German embassy in Shanghai, during an invitation-only event. He later befriends Anthony when he saves him during an attack on Japanese officers by the Chinese Resistance at a night club.

Paul realizes that it was Anthony's wife, Anna ([[Gong Li]]) who actually organized the attack and is the leader of the resistance. He then decides to help her pass on messages. After finally meeting up with Conner's contact in the Japanese Consulate, Paul finds out that Conner had an affair with a Japanese girl named Sumiko ([[Rinko Kikuchi]]) and after searching her place, Paul uncovers numerous photos, which Conner took, in a darkroom nearby. Some of the photos include Captain Tanaka, other Japanese officers and the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|aircraft carrier ''Kaga'']].

Unconvinced that Sumiko betrayed Conner, he determines to find the girl and get the answers he seeks. After a few more encounters with Anna, Anthony, Captain Tanaka, and investigating at an opium house, Paul realizes that Sumiko was Captain Tanaka's lover and was seduced by Conner to spy for him. Paul's cover is blown when Conner's contact is arrested, and Paul gets interrogated by Captain Tanaka regarding the whereabouts of Sumiko, whose location he does not know. After being released, Anna takes Paul to a safe house where she has been hiding Sumiko, who is on the verge of death due to withdrawal from opium and possibly other illnesses.

Outside, Anthony Lan-Ting arrives with Captain Tanaka who he gave away the location of the safe house. It was the only way for him to save Anna from arrest. Inside the safe house, Tanaka informs Paul that the Japanese fleet started [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]] one hour earlier and that the [[History of Shanghai#World War II and the Japanese Occupation|invasion of Shanghai]] is also underway. Tanaka admits to killing Conner, but only out of jealousy as he found out about Conner and Sumiko. A visibly distraught Tanaka asks for Paul's help in administering drugs to ease Sumiko's death. After Sumiko dies, everyone gets ready to leave, but Tanaka wants to question Anna which infuriates Anthony. He then guns down Tanaka's bodyguards and seriously wounds Tanaka himself. Before he can kill Tanaka, Anthony is fatally wounded by a dying bodyguard.

Leaving behind a wounded Tanaka, Paul drives the Lan-Tings away through the burning streets of Shanghai and with his last words, Anthony asks Paul to take Anna out of Shanghai, which he successfully does. Before getting on the ship, Paul and Anna encounter Tanaka once again, but Tanaka decides not to acknowledge them, perhaps because Paul helped him at Sumiko's deathbed and spared his life after being shot. It is revealed later that both Paul and Anna, at some point, returned to Shanghai.&lt;ref name="firstshowing20071127"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/11/27/john-cusack-and-mikael-hafstrom-together-again-in-shanghai/|title=John Cusack and Mikael Hafstrom Together Again in Shanghai|last=Billington|first=Alex|date=2007-11-27|publisher=FirstShowing.net|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film was originally intended to be shot on location in [[Shanghai]]; however, due to the controversial time period in which the film is set, [[The Weinstein Company]]'s permits were revoked by the Chinese government one week prior to the scheduled start of filming. Thus, the film crew had to relocate to [[Bangkok]], Thailand, where an elaborate two-block set was built.&lt;ref name="Shanghai Hits Theaters in China First"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/6666/2010/05/06/2521s567927.htm |title="Shanghai" to Hit Chinese Screens in June |last=|first=zhanglin |date=2010-05-06|publisher=CRIEnglish.com|accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Shanghai'' received negative reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 4% score, an average rating of 4.2/10, based on 23 reviews. The site's consensus states: "''Shanghai'' is crippled by a weak story and fatally undermined by clunky direction, making for a period political drama that lacks all of its key components."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shanghai/ |title=Shanghai (2015) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 36 out of 100, sampled from 14 critics, signifying "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/shanghai |title=Shanghai |work=Metacritic |accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Super Mario'''''|スーパーマリオ|Sūpā Mario|lead=yes}} is a series of [[fantasy]] [[platform game]]s created by [[Nintendo]] featuring their mascot, [[Mario]]. Alternatively called the '''''Super Mario Bros.'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo||スーパーマリオブラザーズ|Sūpā Mario Burazāzu}}}} series or simply the {{Nihongo|'''''Mario'''''|マリオ}} series, it is the central series of the greater [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]]. At least one ''Super Mario'' game has been released for every major Nintendo [[video game console]].

The ''Super Mario'' games follow Mario's adventures, typically in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom with Mario as the [[player character]]&lt;!-- Most games are not set in the Mushroom Kingdom, and several can be played without Mario (SM3DW, SMB2, SMW2, SM64DS) --&gt;. He is often joined by his brother, [[Luigi]], and occasionally by other members of the ''Mario'' cast. As in platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed [[level (video gaming)|levels]]. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario [[Damsel in distress|rescuing the kidnapped]] [[Princess Peach]] from the primary [[antagonist]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. The first title in the series, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985, established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game since.  These include a multitude of [[power-up]]s and [[item (gaming)|items]] that give Mario special magic powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing into giant and miniature sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5710212/nintendos-revised-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=Nintendo's Revised History Of Super Mario Bros.|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Super Mario'' series is part of the greater ''Mario'' franchise.  This includes other video game genres as well as media such as film, television, printed media and merchandise. Over 310 million copies of games in the ''Super Mario'' series have been sold worldwide, as of September 2015, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game series]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/happy-birthday-super-mario-181332681.html?nf=1|title=Happy 30th birthday, 'Super Mario Bros.'!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Super Mario Bros.'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Bros.}}
''Super Mario Bros.'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and is the first [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] 2D platform game to feature Mario. It established many core ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' gameplay concepts. The brothers Mario and Luigi live in the Mushroom Kingdom, where they must rescue Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser. The game consists of eight [[Level (video games)|worlds]], each with four sub-levels, totaling 32 sub-levels altogether. Though the worlds differ in themes, the fourth sub-level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] (or one of his minions disguised as him).&lt;ref name="TMKTheBad"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://themushroomkingdom.net/smb_breakdown.shtml#bad |title=The Bad |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=TMK Super Mario Bros. Complete Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game is one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games]] of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chartspot-june-2004/1100-6103856/|title=ChartSpot: June 2004|first=Tor|last=Thorsen|date=August 2, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels}}
''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' is the sequel to the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' and was released as ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' in Japan. It uses the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' engine with additions such as weather, character movements, and more complex levels, altogether yielding a much higher difficulty.  The game follows the same style of level progression as ''Super Mario Bros.'', with eight initial worlds each with four levels. The last levels of the eight worlds is a [[lava]]-filled castle that culminates in a battle against Bowser. This sequel was not released outside Japan in this time period, because Nintendo of America did not want the Mario series to be known for frustrating difficulty, to be inaccessible to a steadily broadening market of American video game players, nor to be stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' could be eventually delivered to America.&lt;ref name="History of SMB at IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|last=McLaughlin|first=Rus| publisher=IGN | date=September 14, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game later debuted outside Japan in 1993, as "Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels" in the compilation cartridge titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). The original [[Famicom]] version was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in September 2007, listed as "Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels" outside Japan. A later ''Super Mario All-Stars'' Wii [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]], titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars#25th Anniversary Edition|Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition]]'', features the SNES gameplay and adds [[Wii Remote]], [[Classic Controller]], and [[GameCube]] controller compatibility.

=== ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' and ''Super Mario USA'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 2}}
In ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (''Super Mario USA'' in Japan), Mario and his companions are out to stop the evil frog [[Wart (Nintendo)|Wart]] in the Subcon dreamland. Based on a discarded prototype,&lt;ref name="Secret History of SMB2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/04/the-secret-history-of-super-mario-bros-2.ars |title=The Secret History of Super Mario Bros. 2 |date=April 3, 2011 |publisher=wired.com |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the game was instead originally released as ''[[Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic]]'' in Japan, and was ultimately converted back into a ''Mario'' game for the rest of the world as ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', before being named in Japan as ''Super Mario USA'' as part of ''Super Mario All-Stars''. One of the game's most defining aspects is the ability to pluck vegetables from the ground to throw at enemies. This is also the first ''Super Mario'' game to use a life meter, which allows Mario and the other playable characters to be hit up to four times before dying.&lt;ref name="History of SMB at IGN" /&gt;

=== ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 3}}
''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6–10 levels and several bonus stages displayed as locations on a mapped [[overworld]]. These locations are not necessarily in a linear order, and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order. Completed levels cannot be replayed. A world's final level is a [[boss stage]]. The penultimate boss stage is a side-scrolling level atop an [[airship]] ("Doom Ship") with a fight against one of Bowser's seven [[Koopalings]]. The game introduced a diverse array of new power-ups, including flight as Raccoon Mario. Bowser is again the final boss.

=== ''Super Mario Land'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Land}}
''Super Mario Land'' was the first handheld ''Super Mario'' title after the Game &amp; Watch port of ''Super Mario Bros.'', and was released for the [[Game Boy]]. As with other games in the series, it is a sidescrolling platformer in which Mario sets out to save [[Princess Daisy]] by defeating the a mysterious spaceman named [[Tatanga]]. The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds.

=== ''Super Mario World'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario World}}
''Super Mario World'' was released for the SNES and consists of nine worlds displayed via a world map overworld. Most of the 72 levels have one exit, though some have hidden second exits. Mario's new moves include a spin jump and the rideable [[Yoshi]] who can eat enemies and either swallow or spit them out. Power-ups include the returning Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star, and the new Cape Feather, based on ''Super Mario Bros. 3''{{'}}s Super Leaf, which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape.

=== ''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins}}
''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' introduces Mario's rival, [[Wario]], who had taken over Mario's castle during the events of ''Super Mario Land'' and forces Mario to collect the six golden coins to reclaim his castle. While its predecessor is similar to the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Land 2'' has more in common with later games. The player is no longer restricted to moving towards the right. A bell at each level's end activates a [[minigame]], where the player can try to get [[1-Up|extra lives]]. There are 32 levels, based on several themed worlds each with its own boss. Three power-ups return: the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. The game introduces the Carrot power-up, which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for a limited time. Its story was continued in ''[[Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3]]'', which would retroactively become the first of a spin-off series, ''Wario Land''.

=== ''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island}}
''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' is considered by Miyamoto to be part of the ''Super Mario'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dan Ryckert |title=Mario's Creators Answer Burning Questions About The Series |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/09/24/miyamoto-tezuka-interview.aspx |website=Game Informer |accessdate=January 12, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123161706/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/09/24/miyamoto-tezuka-interview.aspx |archivedate=January 23, 2013 |date=September 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; with its sequels forming a spin-off series. In the game, Yoshi carries [[Baby Mario]] across Yoshi's Island to find Luigi. It is considered a prequel to all other ''Super Mario'' games, portraying the birth of the Mario Bros. The primary goal is delivering Baby Mario safely to the end of each level, where he is transferred to the back of another Yoshi, who does the same. When Yoshi is struck by an enemy, Baby Mario is ejected from Yoshi's back and floats around in a bubble while crying as a timer counts down until Yoshi pops the bubble. If the time counts down to zero, Baby Bowser's minions fly on screen and kidnap Baby Mario, resetting the level. The game has a childlike aesthetic, with environments stylised like crayon drawings. ''Yoshi's Island'' has received sequels that have spun off from the ''Super Mario'' series, including ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'', and ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]''.

=== ''Super Mario 64'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario 64}}
''Super Mario 64'' was the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[open world]] game in the series, and a [[launch game|launch title]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] home console. Each level, or course, is an enclosed environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player collects Power Stars that appear after completing tasks to unlock later courses and areas.&lt;ref name="NP88"&gt;{{Cite journal| date=September 1996 | title= Full Coverage&amp;nbsp;— Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nintendo 64's [[analog stick]] makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. It is the first ''Super Mario'' series game to feature [[Charles Martinet]]'s voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser, and collect up to 120 Power Stars from the paintings and return them to her castle, the overworld. There are a total of 105 Power Stars in the paintings, with 15 hidden in the castle. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles.

=== ''Super Mario Sunshine'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Sunshine}}
''Super Mario Sunshine'', the second 3D ''Super Mario'' title, was released on the [[GameCube]]. In it, Mario and Peach travel to Isle Delfino for a vacation when a Mario [[doppelgänger]] appears and vandalizes the entire island. Mario is sentenced to clean the island with a water-squirting accessory, F.L.U.D.D. ''Super Mario Sunshine'' shares many similar gameplay elements with its predecessor, ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', but also introduces moves, like spinning while jumping, and other actions through the use of F.L.U.D.D. The game contains a number of independent levels, which can be reached from the hub, Delfino Plaza. Mario collects Shine Sprites by completing tasks in the levels, which unlock levels in Delfino Plaza by way of abilities and plot-related events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070716082934/http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml|archivedate=July 16, 2007|title=Super Mario Sunshine (JPN) Review|publisher=GamingWorld X|author=Mackie, Joe|accessdate=November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunshine'' introduces one of Bowser's eight children, [[Bowser Jr.]] as an antagonist. Yoshi also appears again for Mario to ride in certain sections.

=== ''New Super Mario Bros.'' ===
{{Main|New Super Mario Bros.}}
''New Super Mario Bros.'' was released on the [[Nintendo DS]]. In it, Mario and Luigi set out to save Peach from [[Bowser Jr]]. The gameplay is 2D, but most of the characters and objects are 3D on [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] backgrounds, resulting in a [[2.5D]] effect. The game uses an overworld map similar to that of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and ''Super Mario World''. Some levels have multiple exits. The classic power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star) return alongside the Mega Mushroom, Blue Shell, and Mini Mushroom. The Mega Mushroom briefly turns Mario (or Luigi) into an invincible giant that destroys everything in his path, the Blue Shell protects Mario from harm and allows him to slide (depending on speed), and the Mini Mushroom shrinks Mario to very small size, which allows him to fit through tight spaces.

=== ''Super Mario Galaxy'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Galaxy}}
''Super Mario Galaxy'' is set in [[outer space]], where [[Mario]] travels between "[[Galaxy|galaxies]]" to collect Power Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies. Each galaxy contains a number of [[planet]]s and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's physics system gives each celestial object its own [[Gravitation|gravitational force]], which lets the player circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The player is usually able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object. Though the main gameplay and physics are in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], there are several points in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear, and many of these return in its sequel, ''Super Mario Galaxy 2''.

=== ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' ===
{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. Wii}}
In ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', Peach is captured by Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings during her birthday party in her castle, and Mario, Luigi, and two Toads (blue and yellow) spring into action to save her. The game features 4-player co-op and new power-ups: the Propeller Mushroom, the Ice Flower, and the Penguin Suit. The Propeller Mushroom launches the player into the air by shaking the [[Wii Remote]]. The Penguin Suit enhances traction of sliding and speed and agility of swimming abilities, in addition to the ice ball projectiles that are provisioned by the Ice Flower. Players can ride [[Yoshi]]. Like in its predecessor, there are three hidden Star Coins to find in each level, which can be used to unlock movies with gameplay tips. It was released in November 2009 and was a commercial success and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/143/14354229.html |title=IGN: New Super Mario Bros.

=== ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Galaxy 2}}
''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', the sequel to ''Super Mario Galaxy'', was initially developed as an expansion pack to the latter, although was eventually developed into its own game, being released on May 23, 2010. It retains the basic premise of its predecessor and includes items and power-ups. These include the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to create platforms in mid-air, and the Rock Mushroom, which turns Mario into a rolling boulder. Also, Mario can ride Yoshi. It was released to widespread critical acclaim.

=== ''Super Mario 3D Land'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario 3D Land}}
''Super Mario 3D Land'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in November and December 2011. It is the first original 3D ''Super Mario'' title on a handheld console. It was an attempt to translate the gameplay of the 2D games into a 3D environment, by simplifying the control scheme of the 3D games and using more linear levels. It also brought back several older gameplay features, including the Super Leaf power-up last seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. It was released to critical acclaim.

=== ''New Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===
{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. 2}}
''New Super Mario Bros. 2'', the direct sequel of ''New Super Mario Bros.'', released in July and August 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. The player, as Mario or Luigi, must save Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings, with the game's secondary goal is to collect one million coins. Several gameplay elements were introduced to help achieve this goal, such as the Gold Flower, a rarer variant of the Fire Flower that turns items into coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5903941/new-super-mario-bros-2-hits-japan-3dses-this-august/|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 Hits 3DSes This August|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tinycartridge.com/post/25460539710/new-super-mario-bros-2-artwork-featuring-smb|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 artwork, featuring SMB|work=Tiny Cartridge 3DS|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' ===
{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. U}}
''New Super Mario Bros. U'', the [[Wii U]] follow-up to ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', was released on November 18, 2012, in North America. It plays similarly to the previous ''New Super Mario Bros.'' titles, and introduces both a Flying Squirrel suit that lets the players glide through the air, and [[asymmetric gameplay]] that allows the player holding the [[Wii U GamePad|GamePad]] to influence the environment. On June 20, 2013, ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' was released as a downloadable content (DLC) package for the game, featuring shorter but more difficult levels, starring Luigi. It was subsequently released as a standalone retail game on August 25, 2013, in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kubba |first=Sinan |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/17/super-luigi/ |title=Super Luigi U arrives as DLC June 20, packaged standalone August 25 |publisher=Joystiq |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the downloadable content version, the standalone retail version of ''New Super Luigi U'' does not require having ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' to play it.

=== ''Super Mario 3D World'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario 3D World}}
''Super Mario 3D World'', the sequel to ''Super Mario 3D Land'', was released for the Wii U on November 22, 2013, in North America, and utilized the same gameplay mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/06/11/nintendo-reveals-super-mario-3d-world/|title=Nintendo reveals Super Mario 3D World|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced three power-ups, the Super Bell (which turns the characters into cats to attack and scale walls), Lucky Bell, and Double Cherry (which creates a clone of the character that collects it). Like ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', it features Princess Peach and Toad as playable characters in addition to Mario and Luigi. Rosalina from ''Super Mario Galaxy'' is also unlocked later in the game.

=== ''Super Mario Maker'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Maker}}
''Super Mario Maker'' is a video game creation tool released for the Wii U in September 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Mario Maker Release Date Announced at E3 2015|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-maker-release-date-announced-at-e3-201/1100-6428205/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows players to create their own levels based on the gameplay and style of ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', ''Super Mario World'', and ''New Super Mario Bros. U'', as well as share their creations online. Based on existing games, several gameplay mechanics were introduced for the game, with existing ones also available to be used together in new ways. A Nintendo 3DS version of the game called ''Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS'', was released in December 2016. It features a few new pre-installed levels, but no online level sharing.

=== ''Super Mario Run'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Run}}
''Super Mario Run'' is a side-scrolling and [[Endless running game|auto-scrolling]] video game released in December 2016 for the [[iOS]] platform and March 2017 for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It is the first ''Mario'' game to be developed for [[mobile game|mobile devices]], and features simplified controls playable with only one hand.

=== ''Super Mario Odyssey'' ===
{{Main|Super Mario Odyssey}}
Released on October 27, 2017 for [[Nintendo Switch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Mario Odyssey|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Super-Mario-Odyssey-1173332.html|website=Nintendo UK|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a return to the open-world "sandbox" 3D style of game last seen in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. After Mario's cap is possessed by a spirit named Cappy, he is able to use it to temporarily "capture" enemies and objects and utilize their powers. Like previous sandbox 3D games, the game's worlds contain a large variety of objectives that can be achieved in a non-linear order before progressing. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' was critically acclaimed, with many describing it as one of the greatest games of all time. This game adventures through many different kingdoms in addition to the Mushroom Kingdom.

=== ''New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe'' ===
A [[Nintendo Switch]] port of ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' is titled ''New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe'' for release on January 11, 2019. This port includes both the main game and ''New Super Luigi U'' as well as new playable characters Nabbit and Toadette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3_B-PXyX88|title=New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe – Reveal Trailer (Nintendo Switch) – YouTube|author=GameXplain|work=YouTube|date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:NES Super Mario Bros.png|right|thumb|The [[Super Mario Bros.|first ''Super Mario'' game]]'s gameplay involved jumping on enemies and moving to the right as the screen scrolled.]] --&gt;

The objective of the game is to progress through levels by defeating enemies, collecting items and solving puzzles without dying. Power-up use is integral to the series. The series has installments featuring both two and three-dimensional gameplay.
In the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] games, the [[player character]] (usually Mario) jumps on platforms and enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D ''Super Mario'' game levels have single-exit objectives, which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next sequential level. ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' introduced the [[overworld]], a map of nonlinear levels that branches according to the player's choice.&lt;ref name="NP-10-Preview"&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| title = Previews: ''Super Mario Bros. 3''| author= Nintendo Power Staff| issue = 10| date=January–February 1990 | pages = 56–59| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced levels with multiple exits.

3D installments in the series have had two subgenres: [[open world]] exploration based games and more linear 3D games with a predetermined path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborn|first1=Alex|title=Miyamoto Offers a Few New Super Mario Odyssey Details|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/13/miyamoto-offers-a-few-new-super-mario-odyssey-details|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=IGN|date=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levels in the open world games, ''[[Super Mario 64|64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine|Sunshine]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Odyssey|Odyssey]]'', allow the player to freely explore multiple enclosed environments in 360 degree movement. As the game progresses, more environments become accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Mario Galaxy Central – Galaxy Information| publisher=Super Mario Galaxy Central |url=http://smgalaxy.com/view_level.php?id=10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313130758/http://smgalaxy.com/view_level.php?id=10 |archivedate=March 13, 2008|accessdate=November 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linear 3D games, whose titles include either "Galaxy" or "3D", feature more fixed camera angles and a predetermined path to a single goal.

=== Items ===
Most items in the ''Super Mario'' series appear from item blocks, which originated in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and persist throughout the series, where Mario hits a block to receive either coins or power-ups.

==== Mushrooms ====
[[File:Supermushroom.png|thumb|[[UGO Networks|UGO]] described the Super Mushroom as "the [[wikt:quintessential|quintessential]] power-up".&lt;ref name="SuperMushroom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/a/top11-videogame-powerups/?cur=supermushroom |title=The Top 11 Video Game Powerups |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028230817/http://www.ugo.com/a/top11-videogame-powerups/?cur=supermushroom |archivedate=October 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mushroom [[power-up]]s appear in almost every ''Super Mario'' game. The most iconic of these is the Super [[Mushroom]].&lt;ref name="SuperMushroom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amanita"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Li, C.|author2=Oberlies, N. H.  | date=December 2005 |title=The most widely recognized mushroom: chemistry of the genus ''Amanita'' |journal=Life Sciences |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=532–38 |pmid=16203016 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2005.09.003 | quote="Idealized representations of this species permeate popular culture. A. muscaria can be found [...] as a major obstacle in video games (e.g., the Smurfs and Super Mario Bros., respectively)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Super Mushroom'' increases Mario's size, turning him into "Super Mario", and allows him to break certain blocks. When hit by an enemy, Mario reverts to his smaller size instead of losing a life.&lt;ref name="SuperMushroom" /&gt; When Mario is in his "Super" form, most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated in an interview that beta tests of ''Super Mario Bros.'' proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario.&lt;ref name="worldrecord"&gt;{{cite web | author = O'Connell, Patricia | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_45/b3958127.htm | title = Meet Mario's Papa | publisher = BusinessWeek online | date = November 7, 2005 | accessdate =November 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Poison Mushroom'', first introduced in the Japanese ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', is a mushroom that causes damage when touched. In later games, the Poison Mushroom looks almost exactly like the Super Mushroom with a red cap but has a meaner-looking face.

The ''Mini Mushroom'' is a small blue mushroom, a recurring item in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, which shrinks Mario into miniature size, allowing him access areas and pipes that Mario normally cannot reach. Mini Mario also jumps higher, floats midair, bounces off enemies without hurting them except by ground pounding, and can run across the surface of the water and then jump from it as if he was on land. Mario is more vulnerable in this form and loses a life upon receiving one hit in miniature form. The Mini Mushroom in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' lets Mario run up walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5942967/its-impossible-to-hate-the-new-new-super-mario-bros-u|title=It's Impossible to Hate the New New Super Mario Bros. U|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mega Mushroom'', introduced in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and further appearing in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is a more recent addition to the series that grows Mario into a towering, invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running through them. It has an orange-yellow cap with red spots, like the ''Super Mario Bros.'' Super Mushroom, but with an inflated cap. ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' features an item simply called "Mushroom"&lt;ref name="Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet"&gt;{{ cite book | date=2005 | title=Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet (PAL version) | publisher=Nintendo }}&lt;/ref&gt; that grants the same abilities as the Mega Mushroom.

In the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' franchise, the Bee Mushroom gives Mario the Bee Suit, and the Spring Mushroom puts Mario inside a metallic coil. The Mystery Mushroom in ''Super Mario Maker'' provides a "costume" based on one of many characters in addition to the abilities of the Super Mushroom.

===== 1-Ups =====
The ''[[1-Up]]'' is a common item shown as a green and white mushroom that gives Mario an [[extra life]]. The 1-Up was introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', sometimes hidden in invisible item blocks, and displayed as having an orange cap with green spots. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Land 2]]'', the 1-Up is shown as a heart. 1-Ups can take other forms, such as the 3-Up Moon from ''Super Mario World'' and ''New Super Mario Bros. U''.

==== Projectile flowers ====
The flower power-ups let Mario shoot projectiles. The Fire Flower, introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', transforms Mario into Fire Mario, who can throw bouncing fireballs at enemies. ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' was the first 3D Mario platformer game to have the Fire Flower. In ''Super Mario Land'', the Superball is a [[bouncing ball]] obtained from a Super Flower, which Mario can use to defeat enemies and collect coins. The Ice Flower transforms Mario into Ice Mario, where he can shoot balls of ice as projectiles similar to that of the Fire Flower; it freezes enemies in a block of ice, to be used as platforms or as thrown projectiles, as seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''.&lt;ref name="nsmbw" /&gt; In ''Super Mario Galaxy'', the Ice Flower turns Mario into ice and lets him walk on lava or water for a limited time by freezing the surface. Lastly, ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''{{'}}s Gold Flower lets Mario turn bricks into coins and earn bonus coins for defeating enemies.

==== Invincibility ====
Invincibility is an effect first appearing in the three ''Super Mario Bros.'' games, where it is granted by a "Starman",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Super Mario'' manual|url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/media/super-mario-bros/manuals/Super-Mario-Bros-Manual-US.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=legendsoflocalization|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 2'' Manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_NES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_Bros._2_-_1986_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|format=PDF|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//media/system/nintendo_nes/manual/formated/super_mario_bros._3_-_1990_-_nintendo.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=gamesdatabase|format=PDF|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; an anthropomorphized, flashing star. The star has also been named the "Super Star" in the two ''Super Mario World'' games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/manual/Formated/Super_Mario_World_-_1991_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|format=PDF|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_World_2-_Yoshi-s_Island_-_1995_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|format=PDF|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Rainbow Star" in the two ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games. Picking up the star makes Mario temporarily [[Glossary of video game terms#God mode|invincible]], able to resist any harm. Use of the item is accompanied by a distinctive music track that appears consistently across most of the games. The player character flickers a variety of colors — and in some titles, moves with increased speed and enhanced jumping ability — while under the Star's influence. While invincible, Mario kills any enemy upon contact with it. In ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', the star gives the normally immobile baby Mario the ability to run as well as become invincible. In ''Super Mario 64'', invincibility is provided when Mario wears the metal cap or the vanish cap. The Mega Mushroom provides invincibility with the addition of giant size and environment destruction (see [[Super Mario#Mushrooms|Mushrooms]]).

==== Power Stars and course tokens ====
The games often feature [[collectible]]s found in levels in order to progress in the overworld, most frequently with the visual motif of a star. They are typically situated in locations that are not readily found or reached, or awarded for completing stunts, or objectives given by [[Non-player character|NPCs]]. They include the Power Stars in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games, Shine Sprites in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', Star Coins in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' games and ''Super Mario 3D Land'', Green Stars in the ''Galaxy'' games and ''Super Mario 3D World'', and Power Moons in ''Super Mario Odyssey''. In ''Super Mario Land 2'', there are six Golden Coin tokens that must be collected to finish the game.

==== Flying ====
Flight is a common theme throughout the series, first enabled with the [[magic carpet]] item in the international ''Super Mario Bros. 2''. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit items, first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' provide Mario with an animal-suited tail, which in turn acts as a flight propeller. The Tanooki Suit returns in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', and the Super Leaf returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. In the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' games, the Spin Block and the Propeller Mushroom let Mario spin up into the air and slowly descend. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', Mario pilots a yellow airplane with unlimited ammunition called the Sky Pop. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduces various forms of flight: the feather item provides a cape, the P Balloon puffs Mario into a floating balloon figure, and Yoshi can carry a blue Koopa shell which gives him wings. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', flight that is granted by a Winged Cap. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', Mario has limited flight and gliding capabilities in a Flying Squirrel suit and can also command a pink Baby Yoshi to puff up into the form of a floating balloon. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Mario can obtain a special red star that transforms him into Flying Mario for a limited time. [[Lakitu]]'s cloud can be commandeered in several of the side-scrolling games.

==== Power-up suits ====
Several suits work as power-ups, many of which are based on animals.  Debuting in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', the Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide Mario with a tail which acts as a flight propeller.  In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets Mario spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. In ''Super Mario 3D Land'', the Raccoon Suit reappears and is accompanied by a silver-colored variation called a Statue Leaf.&lt;ref name=GT&gt;{{cite web| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = May 21, 2010| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-super-mario/100404| accessdate =May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' includes a [[Hammer Bros.]] suit, which allows Mario to throw hammers as projectiles, to defeat enemies at a distance, taking what the Hammer Bros does to Mario and turning it around. While wearing the suit and ducking, Mario is invulnerable to fire attacks. The Hammer Suit was so powerful that in later games, it was downgraded. ''Super Mario 3D Land'' features a "Boomerang Suit" which provisions long-distance boomerang projectiles. Other animal suits include the Frog Suit, Tanooki Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit and Bee Suit.

==== Coins ====
''Super Mario'' level design traditionally incorporates many distributed coins as puzzles and rewards.  Most ''Super Mario'' games award the player an extra life once a certain amount of yellow coins are collected, commonly 50 or 100.  Several coin variants exist, such as silver coins, dragon coins, star coins, and more.

In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', coins replenish health (and air, when Mario is underwater). In ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Super Mario Sunshine'', collecting 100 coins in a level results in a Power Star or Shine Sprite respectively. There are also stages in that game reward a Power Star for collecting eight red coins in a level, worth two normal coins each. In ''Super Mario 64'', a blue coin is worth five normal coins. In ''Super Mario Sunshine'', blue coins act as a side quest when brought to the Delfino Bank.

In ''Super Mario Galaxy'' and ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', after finishing each game once, stages unlock where Mario can collect a certain amount of purple coins to earn a Power Star. In ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', they can also be used to feed some hungry "Luma" characters that can turn into either an item or another planet.

=== Warp Pipes and Warp Cannons ===
{{See also|Warp (gaming)}}
The Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the ''Mario'' series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually [[Piranha Plants]], and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]''). In early ''Mario'' games such as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', special, well-hidden areas known as [[Warp Zone]]s contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cuddy |first1=Luke |date= August 2013|title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UefdMONDLIC&amp;dq=cucco+legend+of+zelda&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher= Open Court|isbn=0-8126-9691-3 |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. [[Cannons]] appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. Mario uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming himself and being fired at a distant target. This allows Mario to progress through a level or reach an otherwise inaccessible area.

=== Yoshi ===
Mario's dinosaur friend [[Yoshi]] has appeared as a mount to the player character in several ''Super Mario'' games since ''[[Super Mario World]]''. In the sequel, ''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'', a tribe of Yoshis finds Mario and helps him to save Baby Luigi. In this game and ''Super Mario 64 DS'', instead of the player merely riding on Yoshi's back, Yoshi is the player character. Yoshis generally have abilities including eating enemies, flying, and breathing fire. Miyamoto had originally wished for Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in ''Super Mario Bros.'', but this wasn't possible due to the technical restraints of the system.

== Settings ==
* The {{Nihongo|'''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]'''|キノコ王国|Kinoko Ōkoku}} is the primary ''Super Mario'' series setting, having been introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'' The Mushroom Kingdom is also the setting for the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' games, ''Super Mario 3D Land'' and ''Super  Mario Run''. It is a monarchy and its heir is [[Princess Peach]]. Though Princess Peach, Mario and Luigi are human, most citizens of this area are the mushroom-like [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]]. While the main characters of the series reside in the Mushroom Kingdom, their adventures have extended to other settings.
* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' introduced '''Subcon''', a mysterious world from Mario's dream. It was taken over by the frog king [[Wart (character)|Wart]].
* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is set in the '''Mushroom World''', a collection of eight kingdoms. Seven of these are "Mushroom Kingdoms", ruled by independent Mushroom Kings. The different kingdoms are Grass Land (a plains kingdom), Desert Hill (a desert kingdom), Ocean Side (an ocean kingdom), Big Island (a kingdom where everything is larger), The Sky (a kingdom which consists of the ground level and the sky level), Iced Land (an arctic kingdom), and Pipe Maze (a small island kingdom filled with a maze of Warp Pipes). The eighth world is referred to as "Dark Land" and is ruled by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]: King of the Koopas. The instruction manual for the game states Bowser had taken over the Mushroom Kingdom, and the Mushroom Kingdom is a gateway to the Mushroom World. This is never elaborated upon in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', but ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' reveals that the Mushroom World is a planet.
* ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' takes place in '''Sarasaland'''. It is ruled by [[Princess Daisy]]. The species in Sarasaland are range from [[tiki]] monsters to aliens to gigantic [[sphinx]]es, as well as enemies similar to enemies from other games in the series. The kingdoms that make up Sarasaland include Birabuto (an [[Ancient Egypt]]-like kingdom), Muda (an ocean kingdom), Easton (an [[Easter Island]]-like kingdom), and Chai (an Ancient [[China]]-like kingdom).
* ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced '''Dinosaur Land''', a separate continent where Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool vacation after the events of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.&lt;ref&gt;Super Mario World instruction manual&lt;/ref&gt; '''Yoshi's Island''', the setting of ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', is located within Dinosaur Land. The other areas consist of Donut Plains, Vanilla Dome, Twin Bridges, Forest of Illusion, Chocolate Island, Valley of Bowser, Star World, and Special World.
* ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' introduced '''Mario Land''', a region which belongs to Mario.
* ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' introduced '''Peach's Castle''', which serves as a [[overworld|hub world]]. The worlds in the game are reached by jumping into paintings, which are portals to imaginary worlds created by Bowser. As such, the game is largely not set in the Mushroom Kingdom. However, Peach's Castle itself is located in the Mushroom Kingdom as shown in games like ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel.
* ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' introduced '''Isle Delfino''', a tropical island somewhere outside the Mushroom Kingdom. It contains several harbors, beaches, hotels, parks, and villages. Instead of Toads or humans, most of the residents on Isle Delfino are tropical creatures called Nokis and Piantas. Its main village Delfino Plaza serves as the central hub world in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. Different areas of the island can be accessed through portals created by spray paint in different parts of the plaza. Besides Delfino Plaza, the different locations of Delfino Island are Delfino Airstrip, Bianco Hills, Ricco Harbor, Gelato Beach, Pinna Park, Sirena Beach, Noki Bay, Pianta Village, and Corona Mountain. While Isle Delfino has only appeared in one game in the ''Super Mario'' series, it has been commonly used in ''Mario'' spin-off games, including the [[Mario Kart|''Mario Kart'' series]].
* ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' are set in outer space and contain various galaxies.
* ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' takes place in the '''Sprixie Kingdom''', where the Sprixies live.
* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' has Mario traveling across the globe in a hat-shaped airship called the Odyssey; thus, several new regions known as "kingdoms" are introduced in the game, including a New York-inspired urban area called the '''Metro Kingdom''', a dry desert land called the '''Sand Kingdom''', and a food-filled world called the '''Luncheon Kingdom'''.

=== Music ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}
Much of the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' music and sound effects have become iconic to the series and incorporated into modern games. The original [[Super Mario Bros. theme]], composed by [[Koji Kondo]], has become well known around the world.&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web |title=GDC 2007: Mario Maestro Shares His Secrets |url=http://www.1up.com/news/gdc-2007-mario-maestro-shares |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=February 16, 2009 |date=March 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710232628/http://www.1up.com/news/gdc-2007-mario-maestro-shares |archivedate=July 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme from the underwater levels of ''Super Mario Bros.'' frequently appears as [[title screen]] music in the series, including in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', the main intros and titles of all four ''Super Mario Advance'' titles, and the ''Super Mario All-Stars'' versions of the four NES games.

The ''Super Mario'' series is critically acclaimed and a financial success. The series was ranked as the best game franchise by [[IGN]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/749/749069p5.html|title=The Top 25 Videogame Franchises – PS3 Feature at IGN|work=IGN|date=December 4, 2006|accessdate=October 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228062503/http://ps3.ign.com/articles/749/749069p5.html|archivedate=February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' ranked the series as number 5 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time",{{efn|The entry name is "Mario (series)", but the description as a "side-scrolling platformer" makes it clear that ''Next Generation'' meant the ''Super Mario'' series specifically.}} additionally ranking ''Super Mario 64'' at number 1 although stating the rule that series of games be confined to a single entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Top 100 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|pages=36–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' was awarded the top spot on ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'}}s greatest 200 games of their time list&lt;ref name="EGM Best 200 Games – SMB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=10&amp;cId=3147448 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629011651/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=10&amp;cId=3147448 |title=The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time: ''Super Mario Bros.'' |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |accessdate=August 9, 2007 |archivedate=June 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and IGN's top 100 games of all-time list twice (in 2005 and 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html|title=IGN's Top 100 Games|year=2005|publisher=IGN|accessdate=August 9, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqeao0AV?url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html|archive-date=January 17, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Super Mario Bros.'' popularized [[side-scrolling video game]]s and provided the basic concept and mechanics that would persist throughout the rest of the series. ''Super Mario Bros.'' sold 40.24 million copies, making it the best-selling video game of the whole series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm|title=Super Mario Sales Data: Historical Unit Numbers for Mario Bros on NES, SNES, N64..|publisher=GameCubicle.com|accessdate=October 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is often regarded as one of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]'s greatest games; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' rated the game sixth on their list of the 200 Greatest Nintendo Games. The game was 14th on ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'}}s list. ''Super Mario World'' also received very positive scores, with a 94.44% aggregate review score on [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/snes/519824-super-mario-world/index.html |title=''Super Mario World'' Reviews |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nintendo Power'' ranked the game eighth best overall to be released on a Nintendo console in their Top 200 Games list.&lt;ref name="NP Top 200"&gt;{{Cite news|date=February 2006|title=NP Top 200|periodical=Nintendo Power|volume=200|pages=58–66|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Super Mario 64'', as the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] platform game in the ''Mario'' series, established a new archetype for the genre, much as ''Super Mario Bros.'' did for [[2D computer graphics|2D]] side-scrolling platformers. It is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest and most revolutionary video games of all time.&lt;ref name="IGN100-2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2003/1-10.html|title=IGN's Top 100 Games|publisher=IGN|year=2003|accessdate=February 2, 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqeaoEzJ?url=http://top100.ign.com/2003/1-10.html|archive-date=January 17, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN100-2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html|title=IGN's Top 100 Games|publisher=IGN|year=2005|accessdate=February 11, 2006|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqeao0AV?url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/001-010.html|archive-date=January 17, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN100-2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html |title=IGN's Top 100 Games of All Time |publisher=IGN |year=2007 |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65aWDgKEP?url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GI100"&gt;{{Cite news|date=August 2001|title=Top 100 Games of All Time|periodical=[[Game Informer]]|page=36|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo100"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/specials/100games/1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209213205/http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/specials/100games/1.html|archivedate=February 9, 2009|title=The 100 Greatest Computer Games of All Time|publisher=[[Yahoo!

''Super Mario Sunshine'' also received critical acclaim by game reviewers. [[IGN]] praised the addition of the water backpack (F.L.U.D.D.) for improving the gameplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/368/368539p2.html|title=Super Mario Sunshine review|publisher=IGN|author=Mirabella III, Fran|year=2002|accessdate=May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GameSpy]] commented on the "wide variety of moves and the beautifully constructed environments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/august02/smsgcn/|title=Super Mario Sunshine review|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|author=Guzman, Hector|date=August 26, 2002|accessdate=May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GameSpot]]'' and ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', however, called the game "unpolished", with the latter going so far as to insinuate that it was unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matt Wales |title=Super Mario Galaxy reviewed |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/140193/previews/super-mario-galaxy/ |website=gamesradar |accessdate=January 12, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629025945/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/140193/previews/super-mario-galaxy/ |archivedate=June 29, 2012 |date=May 17, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jeff Gerstmann |title=Super Mario Sunshine Review |url=http://au.gamespot.com/supermariosunshine/reviews/2878399/super-mario-sunshine-review/platform/gamecube |website=au.gamespot.com |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707095335/http://au.gamespot.com/super-mario-sunshine/reviews/2878399/super-mario-sunshine-review/platform/gamecube/ |archivedate=July 7, 2012 |date=August 26, 2002 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the ''Mario'' games released, ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' have been the most highly acclaimed by both fans and professional critics. The ''Galaxy'' titles, extolled for their creativity, level design, visuals, and music, have been considered to be not only two of the best ''Mario'' games ever made but also among the greatest games of all time in general, according to sites such as [[IGN]] and [[TopTenReviews]]. ''Odyssey'' was praised for successfully reviving the sandbox-style gameplay last seen in ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Sunshine'' and its introduction of the "capture" mechanic. [[GameRankings]], a website that aggregates game scores and rankings from well-established video game critics, gives ''Super Mario Odyssey'' an aggregate ranking of 98.17%,&lt;ref name="odyssey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/wii/915692-super-mario-galaxy/index.html |title=''Super Mario Galaxy'' Reviews |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the best-ranked game on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html |title=Reviews and News Articles |publisher=GameRankings |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Super Mario 3D Land'' was also highly commercially and critically successful, being the third-best-selling game for the Nintendo 3DS. Its sequel, ''Super Mario 3D World'', received similar critical praise and is among the Wii U's best-selling titles.

'''Swedish art''' refers to the visual arts produced in [[Sweden]] or by Swedish artists.  Sweden has existed as country for over 1,000 years, and for times before this, as well as many subsequent periods, Swedish art is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art.  After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Swedish art has a big production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Sweden has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Swedish Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Sweden has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in [[Viking art]], and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

The Reformation greatly disrupted Swedish artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requiremnents of the court and aristocracy were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the late 17th or 18th centuries that large numbers of Swedes were trained in contemporary styles.  The political success of the [[Vasa dynasty]] led to a considerable revival, expressed in the "Gustavan style", which again had some influence over neighbouring countries.    

Among famous Swedish artists are [[Johan Tobias Sergel]], [[Carl Milles]], [[Anders Zorn]], [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Carl Eldh]]. 
==History==
=== Prehistoric art ===
[[File:Aspberget rock carving Sweden 4.jpg|thumb|Pre-historic petroglyphs in [[Tanum Municipality|Tanum]]]]
When the ice age ended, the Scandinavian peninsula was populated from the south by hunters and gatherers. Art surviving from that period are [[Stone Age]] expressions and is simple and reflects the available material. Only the truly persistent art forms have survived the ravages of time: [[petroglyph]]s, are such an expression. The earliest rock carvings in the form of symbols, characters and images are carved in rock outcrops and boulders. They began to be produced about 7000 BC. Sweden has one of the largest concentrations of petroglyphs with a local center in [[Tanum Municipality]] in [[Bohuslän]] province.
  
During the [[Bronze Age]], a spiral ornamentation was produced in the style that existed in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="Store_norske"&gt;{{cite web |author=Östby, Leif &amp; Frode Ernst Haverkamp |year=2009 |url=http://www.snl.no/Sverige/kunst |title=Sverige - kunst |publisher= Store norske leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; From about 400 AD, the development of the Nordic animal ornamentation, an unusually rich and imaginative style that reached its peak during the 7th century with the so-called Vendel style. Animal ornamentation experienced a renewed flourishing of the [[rune stones]]. Rune stones - some of which are quite illustrative and are therefore called “image blocks” - were added between about  200 AD and 1130 with a flourishing between the period 980-1100. As an art form, the rune stone is specific to the Nordic culture. Sweden leads the way with the highest amount of rune stones with a total of 2,800 inscriptions. Approximately 85% of all the identified blocks have been in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordiska.uu.se/forskn/samnord.htm nordiska.uu.se]&lt;/ref&gt; The stones were originally painted and combined text with ornamentation and stylized characters. They can be divided into seven different styles.&lt;ref&gt;Gräslund, Anne-Sofie (2006). ''Dating the Swedish Viking-Age rune stones on stylistic grounds'', Runes and their secrets: studies in runology. {{ISBN|978-87-635-0627-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first known image-makers in Sweden were, in fact, rune carvers.

Sweden, especially the south of the country, also participated in [[Viking Age art]], along with the rest of Scandinavia.

=== Medieval and Gothic art ===
[[File:Harkeberga 0844.jpg|thumb|left|This painting by [[Albertus Pictor]] can be seen in [[Härkeberga Church]] (c. 1480).]]
With the advent of Christianity came a new iconography, originally established in the churches, particularly in the form of altar screens, crucifixes, and stones. According to the [[Swedish History Museum]], no other country has such a rich and comprehensive collection of medieval liturgical art.&lt;ref name=hmus&gt;{{cite web |url= http://historiska.se/historia/medeltiden/livochsamhalle/kyrkanlivetscentrum/|title= Kyrkan - livets centrum - Historiska|language=Swedish|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 31 January 2007|website= www.historiska.se|publisher= [[Swedish History Museum]]|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity was shown in [[Romanesque art]] products fabrics and gold works. From the 13th century, Gotland was a center for sculptors, such as the anonymous [[Master Majestatis]]. The [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style came to Sweden during the second half of the 13th century. [[Linköping]] Cathedral is mostly conducted in English Gothic style and contains richly decorated sculptures. Several works from this period exhibit a French influence, for example the [[triumphal cross]] from [[Öja Church]], Gotland and St. Erik's statue in [[Roslags-Bro Church]] in Uppland. There are also Gothic monumental paintings on wood in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

Visual narratives gained momentum in the churches in central Sweden in the late 15th century by masters such as [[Nils Håkansson]], Master Petrus. Håkansson's student, [[Albertus Pictor|Albert the painter]], however, was to become far more famous for his religious paintings in Uppland. Motives during this period were often religious or mythical. Albert the painter, motivated by a chess playing Grim Reaper in [[Täby Church]], was the inspiration for [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' almost 600 years later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Contemporary with Albertus the Painter is the famous sculpture of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] in the [[Storkyrkan|Great Church]] of Stockholm.&lt;ref name=Hillman&gt;Hillman, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was made by the German-born painter and sculptor [[Bernt Notke]], one of the late Middle Ages the most important northern European artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/kort/berntnotke Nationalencyklopedin: Bernt Notke]&lt;/ref&gt; Notke, who periodically lived in Sweden, was very productive and had great influence with an intense and expressionistic style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/420621/Bernt-Notke Encyklopedia Britannica: Bernt Notke]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance and Baroque art ===
[[File:Vädersolstavlan.jpg|thumb|17th century copy of [[Urban målare|Urban Larsson]]'s ''Vädersoltavlan'', the oldest known image of Stockholm. The painting can be seen in Storkyrkan.]]
The Vasa period of art consisted largely of portraits of princes, which were painted by foreign artists who were active in Sweden. [[Urban målare|Urban Larsson]] with his ''Vädersoltavla'' from 1535, in the Great Church in Stockholm, was an exception. He is one of the few well-known Swedish artists during the Vasa period and the Renaissance era.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

[[File:Georg Stiernhielm, 1598-1672.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]] painted this portrait of [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (1663)]]
[[File:Gustav III of Sweden 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander Roslin]]'s magnificent portrait of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (1777)]]

The pompous, happy and decorative made its entrance in the 17th century Great Power - during the 17th and 18th centuries the first few decades - was a grand time for architecture. A number of castles, mansions and churches built, like the Royal Palace, meant that artists were called from abroad. These foreign artists trained new generations of Swedish artists. More significant art collections were acquired through spoils of war. One famous artist was the court painter [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Ehrenstral was also a portraitist and animal painter, and worked with the [[Drottningholm Palace]], together with Johan Sylvius.  [[Erik Dahlbergh]] depicted the superpower era of Sweden in the great work ''[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna]]''. Other painters were [[David von Krafft]], [[Michael Dahl]].&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

===Rococo and the Gustavian style===
Liberty and the Gustavian period was a major cultural boom in Sweden. At this time, [[Rococo]] was the initial style.{{huh|date=February 2016}} Future portrait paintings made it internationally known in Swedish painting.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt; During the period, many Swedish artists moved to continental Europe. A representative of the rococo was [[Gustaf Lundberg]]. His technique was long dominant in the Swedish portrait arts, and he is represented at the Louvre and the National Museum and Art Academy. The French painter [[Guillaume Taraval]] was called upon to decorate the Royal Palace. Together with [[Carl Hårleman]] he advocated the new relaxed style. A leading style artist was [[Jean Eric Rehn]], a student of Hårleman, who worked as craftsmen, architect and artist.

[[Alexander Roslin]] took inspiration from France and conducted many highly sensitive portraits of the era's finest personalities. Some of Roslin's portraits are among the most reproduced from the period. Of major importance was also [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]], who became a court painter in Denmark. Pilo was inspired both by Venetian artists and the Dutchman [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]. Pilo returned, however, to Sweden and then painted the great work Gustaf III's coronation in Stockholm Cathedral.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

Other prominent names were [[Johan Pasch]], [[Per Krafft the Elder]], [[Peter Adolf Hall]] and, perhaps most importantly, [[Johan Tobias Sergel]]. Over time, beginning around 1770, Rococo was succeeded in Sweden by the Gustavian period. Swedish neoclassicism is said to have begun around 1785. The Gustavian period was characterized by both French and English influence. 
  
After Gustav III's death, there was a period of stagnation in Swedish art. On the other hand, peasant painting flourished in particular, Dalarna and Hälsingland with painting and [[Dala horse]]s during this time.{{huh|date=February 2016}} Peasantry painting became a major inspiration for the 18th century artist [[Carl Larsson]].  [[Gothicism]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were the styles of art for several decades, including artists like the sculptor [[Bengt Fogelberg]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Fogelberg, who was inspired by the Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], created powerful statues of Nordic gudagestalter and historical figures.

=== Karl Johan style ===
From the mid-19th century and a few decades later, nature paintings dominated the scene, with Marcus Larsson in the lead. Artists that pointed to something new were Egron Lundgren and Carl Fredrik Hill. Hill became one of the foremost Swedish landscape-painters as he had views that reflected his personality and often express despair and darkness. Egron Lundberg developed watercolor art,  as he traveled extensively in Europe and Asia, and painted his findings. Even history painting was done extensively during the period, including artists such as Carl Gustav Hellquist Gustaf and Cederstrom.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Another painter was August Malmström who created historic and romantic nature works and illustrated many fairytales.

=== Romanticism and naturalism ===

From an international perspective Swedish-produced art languished in obscurity until the late 19th century, when a number of Swedish artists gained attention outside of Sweden. Especially the 1880s and the following two decades were periods of greatness in the Swedish art. Perhaps the best artist of them is the painter, sculptor, and printmaker [[Anders Zorn]]. Zorn was an extremely talented oil painter with a very precise but free style.[[File:Midsommardans av Anders Zorn 1897.jpg|thumb|180px|left| [[Anders Zorn]]'s ''Midsummer Dance'', 1897]] Anders Zorn painted landscapes and people and is known for his nude studies of the hillocks from [[Dalarna]].{{huh|date=February 2016}} Zorn was also concerned with depicting peasant life in his home province of Dalarna. Woman artist [[Amalia Lindegren]] also created glorified scenes of the Swedish peasant and folk. Zorn was counted as one of the foremost painters in Europe in the late 19th century and made many portraits of contemporary celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4aug/art0822.html#zorn Safran-Arts.com:Anders Leonard Zorn]&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous work is ''Love's Nymph'' (1883), ''A Prime'' (1888), ''Midsummer Dance'' (1897), ''President Grover Cleveland'' (1899) and ''Bathing hills'' (1906). Zorn's art is featured at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the [[White House]], and his works are among the most valued of all Swedish artists.

Another big name from this generation is [[Carl Larsson]]. Larsson, like Zorn, appeared in Dalarna and is one of the most beloved Swedish artists. Larsson painted primarily in watercolor and his motives were found in daily life: he often portrayed his own family and their home in Sundborn. His style is airy, very light and is characterized by a skillful interplay of surfaces and lines. Larsson created frescoes and wall paintings, like Midvinterblot and several other frescoes in the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. Larsson became very famous in Germany in connection with an art book, A Home, that was published there. Another painter who achieved great popular popularity was [[Bruno Liljefors]] with very precise paintings of nature and animals in motion. 
[[File:Bergh Richard Nordic Summer Evening.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Richard Bergh]]'s ''Nordic Summer Evening'', 1899-1900]]
Two painters with great stylistic ability were [[Eugène Jansson]] and [[Ernst Josephson]]. Jansson's paintings, which took stylistic inspiration from [[van Gogh]], are often simple geometric forms a large, quiet Stockholm Ground and powerful male figures. Josephsson is more varied and known for masterful oil portraits. He became an inspiration for the later modernism. Portrait painting was also developed by Richard Bergh as well as by [[Nils Kreuger]]. A significant development came in 1885 with the artist's group The Opponents, who wanted to renew the Swedish painting and collected many of those names. A few years later, in the 1890s, Bergh and Kreuger founded the Dorset School together with [[Karl Nordström]]. They reacted against the realistic landscape style and were inspired by Paul Gauguin. Especially Nordström was inspired by the French impressionists. A close friend of Nordström was the author and the universal genius of [[August Strindberg]]. Even Strindberg was an important Swedish painter from the period. The rise of women artists, such as [[Eva Bonnier]], and [[Hanna Hirsch-Pauli|Hanna Pauli]], who, among other things, took inspiration from Rembrandt, also becomes prominent in this period.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

=== Modernism and expressionism ===

Modernism began to enter Swedish art with [[Axel Törneman]] and then the Men of 1909, which was a group of young male artists, mainly from the Artist League school. More abstract forms were represented by [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Nils von Dardel]] and [[Gösta Adrian Nilsson]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

The mid-1920s and a couple of decades following were both characterized by surrealism, the [[Halmstad Group]], and of expressionism, which includes Gothenburg Schools realists, Sven Erixson and Bror Hjorth and a rigorous formalist, abstract minimalism of artists such as [[Olle Bærtling]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Among the sculptors of the period are Carl Eldh and [[Carl Milles]]. Both have had great influence and the latter is perhaps the most famous Swedish sculptor of all time. From the same generation of sculptors came the self-taught wood sculptor and realist people portrayer [[Axel Petersson Döderhultarn]].

After World War II,  Swedish art was something of a boom and a host of artists established themselves. With a new democratic idea that art was founded for everyone in 1947, popular movements promoting art and in the same period also launched a variety of arts organizations across the country. Among the 1930s radicals as painter [[Albin Amelin]] and graphic artist and monumental painter [[Torsten Billman]] the work continued to bring images to the working people. Torsten Billman could also through his literary illustrations reach new groups. In the 1950s expressionists emerged like Torsten Renqvist and more informal painter Rune Jansson and Eddie Figge.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

In the early 1960s, was revitalized by the Swedish graphic artists as Philip von Schantz and Nils G. Stenqvist.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

'''''Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World''''' is a [[television syndication|syndicated]] television series loosely based on the 1912 novel by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. The show premiered in the United States in the fall of 1999 (after the [[Television film|TV-movie]]/[[Television pilot|pilot]] aired in February on [[DirecTV]] and then on the [[cable television]] channel [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] in April).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tnt.turner.com/specials/lostworld/index3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508090830/http://tnt.turner.com/specials/lostworld/index3.html|title=SPECIALS on TNT|archivedate=8 May 1999|work=turner.com|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for three seasons before it was cancelled on a cliffhanger in 2002 after funding for a fourth season fell through. To this day, the cliffhanger remains unresolved. All three seasons were released in DVD box sets in 2004.

The first part of the series originally aired on [[Pay-per-view]] via [[DirecTV]] in the summer of 1999 before it aired in syndication. [[Pay-per-view]] aired the show uncensored, containing nudity and extended scenes. The syndicated version on TV and DVD releases are edited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DIRECTV(R)+Agreement+With+Action+Adventure+Network+Marks+Entry+Into...-a020037411] 1997.

==Plot==
"At the dawn of the 20th century" a band of adventurers, led by adventurer and scholar [[Professor Challenger]], embark on an expedition to prove the existence of a lost world isolated from the rest of the modern world. The British expedition team, consisting of a mismatched group of enthusiasts, all with less than selfless reasons for making the journey, begin their trip under less than ideal conditions. The intrepid band consists of Professor George Edward Challenger, Professor Arthur Summerlee, Marguerite Krux, Major Lord John Richard Roxton, Edward T. Malone.

During their journey disaster strikes and their [[hot air balloon]] crashes in the uncharted [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon jungle]], where they end up on the [[prehistoric]] [[plateau]]. There they find themselves trapped and isolated in this dangerous land. The group is assisted by a young [[jungle girl (stock character)|jungle-savvy woman]] named Veronica Layton, whose parents disappeared eleven years before. Her family was part of a research group that became isolated and was then lost under mysterious circumstances. Together with a young woman from the future named Finn ([[Lara Cox]]), the group fights to survive against carnivorous [[dinosaur]]s, vicious [[Neanderthal]]s, a race of [[List of reptilian humanoids|lizardmen]], and other perils as they search for a way to escape. The stories usually worked out that two separate adventures were going on at the same time.

In the later series, it is clear that they actually landed on the plateau in 1919.

==Characters==
* Professor George Edward Challenger (played by [[Peter McCauley]])&amp;nbsp;— The leader of the expedition, who hopes to prove his claims to the skeptical [[London Zoological Society]].
* Professor Arthur Summerlee (played by [[Michael Sinelnikoff]])&amp;nbsp;— The elderly member of the band and a colleague to George Challenger, who initially does not believe Challenger's claims about a lost world. Although he is supposedly killed by Drakul and washed down the waterfall at the end of Season One, Edward revealed to the group that Arthur is in a state where he is neither dead or alive upon being lifted from the dried-up waterfall as seen in "Man of Vision". If there was a Season 4, he would have been confirmed as officially alive.
* Marguerite Krux (played by [[Rachel Blakely]])&amp;nbsp;— The selfish financier of the expedition who goes along for her own reasons.
* Lord John Richard Roxton (played by [[William Snow (actor)|William Snow]])&amp;nbsp;— The nobleman with vast hunting experience, who accidentally killed his brother while trying to save him from an ape. He serves as protector of the group.
* Edward "Ned" T. Malone (played by [[David Orth]])&amp;nbsp;— An American newspaper reporter, hoping to make a name for himself and impress his girl back home, if he survives the ordeal.
* Veronica Layton (played by [[Jennifer O'Dell]])&amp;nbsp;– A [[Jungle girl (stock character)|jungle girl]] whose parents disappeared eleven years prior to the series.
* Finn (played by [[Lara Cox]])&amp;nbsp;– A young woman from the year 2033 who debuts in the middle of Season 3.

===Cast===
The list follows the credits order. The seasons during which each actor has been included in the main cast are marked in black. Note that the actors don't necessarily appear in every episode during their time as a main star.

When a starring actor also has appeared as a guest star during other seasons, this is marked in gray, with the number of guest appearances noted in ''italics''. A white square means that the actor doesn't appear in that season at all.

===Proposed season 4===
The producers of the show have revealed some details of the proposed fourth and even fifth seasons from 2002. If the subsequent season had been produced, fans would have learned that professor Arthur Summerlee was indeed alive, residing in Avalon. Avalon, near the border of the Plateau, is where Veronica's surviving mother Abigail Layton had become the Plateau's protector soon after her disappearance. She became the ruler of Avalon and had left behind a triangle artifact- the Trion, the Eye of Heaven- for her daughter Veronica to find. Veronica was to become the new Protector of the Plateau. Her tree-house dwelling was apparently the epicenter of the entire Plateau.

The new season would have also revealed that Marguerite and Roxton were always meant to be together from the beginning. As Veronica is the new Protector of the Plateau, Marguerite is a descendant of ''Morrighan'', her ancestor whom came from "the line of Mordren;" they are the opposing forces against the Protectors. Marguerite as the "third power" within the Trion forces, was a free will agent allowed to choose good or evil in the battle against power over the Plateau. Roxton, Marguerite's knight, protector, and future groom would have been her personal guide so that Marguerite would ultimately choose "good." Also, because of Marguerite's Celtic heritage within the line of Mordren whose presence is on the Plateau and Veronica's bloodline with the Protectors, Veronica and Marguerite are cousins genetically, but spiritually are sisters. Roxton's role as Marguerite's modern day knight originates with his childhood and ancestral home having close proximity to [[Avebury]], nearly twenty miles from [[Stonehenge]]. Finn would have been revealed to be Malone's great great granddaughter, her grandmother being the Amazon Phoebe (also played by Lara Cox) whom Malone had sex with in the episode "Amazons"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reeves-stevens.com/TLWSUMMARY1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The series would have been resolved with Malone and Veronica getting married and staying in Avalon, while Challenger uses his teleportation invention from the episode "Finn" to send himself, Roxton, Marguerite and Summerlee to London but travels forward in time to the year 2005 where they are welcomely greeted by the zoological society due to Malone having sent them a letter explaining when they would arrive.

The fourth season would have featured guest appearances of Holmes two other characters, [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]].

==International Distribution==
In addition to the English language broadcasts in North America and Europe, the series has aired around the globe in other languages.

It is unknown if the series was ever broadcast to Australia and New Zealand.

During the original run the weekly syndicated primary and backup satellite [[wildfeed]] for the series utilized the [[Galaxy 26]] satellite located at 93° West longitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitmagazine.com/wfeedsjl.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010521063833/http://www.orbitmagazine.com/wfeedsjl.htm|title=Satellite ORBIT Wild Feeds|archivedate=21 May 2001|work=orbitmagazine.com|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Trivia==
* [[Lara Cox]] appeared in the second half of the third season as Finn, but was never given credit in the opening credits. In the 2nd-season episode "Amazons", she had a guest appearance as the Amazon "Phoebe".
* William deVry played Ed Malone in the two-hour telefilm that preceded the series (the film was split into two episodes for syndication purposes). David Orth took over the role at the start of the series proper.
* The character of Arthur Summerlee, as portrayed by Michael Sinelnikoff, was killed off in the first-season finale, but returned once as a ghost during Season 2. Prior to the pilot for this series, Sinelnikoff had also played the character of Summerlee in the 1998 cable TV movie version of ''[[The Lost World (1998 film)|The Lost World]]'', in which Summerlee is killed by a T-Rex, and which otherwise had different actors, and with only those series characters which came from the book (Challenger, Roxton, Malone).
* During the third season, both David Orth and Jennifer O'Dell were absent from the series for several consecutive episodes, due in part to financial constraints.
* The show was primarily filmed on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], near [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] on Australia's east coast.
* Several well-known Australian actors appeared as one off characters throughout the series, including [[Natalie Bassingthwaighte]] and [[Rebecca Gibney]].
* Season 1 episode "Blood Lust" about vampires aired in syndication in the United States [[Halloween]] weekend 1999. In 2000, the season 2 episode "Stone Cold" was also promoted as a special Halloween themed episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MXQXSQZfiI|title=The Lost World Trailer Promo for Stone Cold|date=10 September 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Tourism Organization]] defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".&lt;ref name="unwto1034"&gt;{{cite web|year=1995 |url=http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf |title=UNWTO technical manual: Collection of Tourism Expenditure Statistics |page=10 |publisher=World Tourism Organization |access-date=26 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922120940/http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's [[balance of payments]]. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases being of vital importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.georgetown.edu/the-growing-importance-of-tourism-in-the-global-economy-and-international-affairs/|title=The Growing Importance of Tourism in the Global Economy and International Affairs {{!}}|website=journal.georgetown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism suffered as a result of a strong economic slowdown of the [[late-2000s recession]], between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and the outbreak of the [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 influenza virus]],&lt;ref name=Barom2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=WTOaugust10/&gt; but slowly recovered. International tourism receipts (the travel item in the [[balance of payments]]) grew to {{USD|1.03}} trillion ({{euro|740}} billion) in 2011, corresponding to an increase in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]] of 3.8% from 2010.&lt;ref name="pr12027"/&gt; International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012,&lt;ref name=Barom2012/&gt; [[emerging markets]] such as [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[Brazil]] had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.&lt;ref name="Barom201304"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.unwto.org/en/press-release/2013-04-04/china-new-number-one-tourism-source-market-world |title=China – the new number one tourism source market in the world|publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]]|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ITB Berlin]] is the world's leading tourism [[trade fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITB Berlin: The World's Leading Travel Trade Show|url=http://www.expodatabase.com/tradeshow/itb-berlin-the-worlds-leading-travel-trade-show-908.html|website=www.expodatabase.com|publisher=M+A Expo Database|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global tourism accounts for ca. 8% of global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen et al.

==Etymology==
[[File:Vysoké Tatry r.1922.jpg|thumb|1922 postcard of tourists in the [[High Tatras]], [[Slovakia]].]]

The word ''tourist'' was used in 1772&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=Ralph|authorlink1=Ralph Griffiths|author2=Griffiths, G. E. |title=Pennant's Tour in Scotland in 1769|journal=[[Monthly Review (London)|The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal]]|year=1772|volume=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xS8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=tourist&amp;dq=tourist&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=London|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tourism'' in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=tour&amp;searchmode=none|title=tour (n.)|first1=Douglas|last1=Harper|authorlink1=Douglas Harper|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed from the word ''tour'', which is derived from Old English ''turian'', from Old French ''torner'', from Latin ''tornare''; 'to turn on a lathe,' which is itself from Ancient Greek ''tornos'' (τόρνος); 'lathe'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=turn&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of tourism==

Not only does the service sector grow thanks to tourism, but also local [[Craft|manufacturers]] (like those producing the strandkorb chairs), [[retail]]ers, the [[Real estate development|real-estate sector]] and the general [[City marketing|image of a location]] can benefit.]]

Tourism has become an important, even vital, source of income for many regions and even entire countries. The ''Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980'' recognized its importance as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations."&lt;ref name="unwto1034"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= http://www.univeur.org/cuebc/downloads/PDF%20carte/65.%20Manila.PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120180003/http://www.univeur.org/CMS/UserFiles/65.%20Manila.PDF |archivedate= 20 November 2012 |title=  Manila Declaration on World Tourism |date= 10 October 1980|pages= 1–4|location= [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] |conference= World Tourism Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for [[goods and services]] needed by tourists, accounting {{as of | 2011 | lc = on}} for 30% of the world's [[trade]] in services, and for 6% of overall [[export]]s of goods and services.&lt;ref name="pr12027"/&gt; It also generates opportunities for [[employment]] in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector of the economy]] associated with tourism.&lt;ref name="WTO2012Highlights"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf |title= 2012 Tourism Highlights |publisher= UNWTO |accessdate= 17 June 2012 |date= June 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120709215809/http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf |archivedate= 9 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include [[transport |transportation services]] (such as [[airline]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[train]]s and [[taxicab]]s); [[hospitality service]]s (such as [[lodging|accommodations]], including [[hotel]]s and [[resort]]s); and entertainment venues (such as [[amusement park]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[casino]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[music venue]]s, and [[theatre|theaters]]). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including [[souvenir]]s.

On the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = The globalisation of tourism has partially exacerbated the relationships of inequality and subservience that are so commonplace in host-guest encounters. It is not simply enough for local people to accept their role as servants, guides or companions to a range of ever-changing tourists. They are also confronted increasingly by the luxurious global products of Western indulgence which remain far from their reach, rather like the thirsty Tantalus in his elusive pool of water.

==Definitions==
In 1936, the [[League of Nations]] defined a ''foreign tourist'' as "someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours". Its successor, the [[United Nations]], amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9dvK2ajv7zIC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936|title=Global Tourism|last=Theobald|first=William F.|publisher=[[Butterworth–Heinemann]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7506-4022-0|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford [England]|pages=6–7|oclc=40330075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as "the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to [[Permanent residency|permanent residence]] and are not connected with any earning activity."&lt;ref name="1941define"&gt;{{cite book|title=Grundriß Der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre|last1=Hunziker |first1=W|authorlink1=Walter Hunziker|last2=Krapf|first2=K|oclc=180109383|publisher=Polygr.

It includes movements for all purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beaver|first=Allan|title=A Dictionary of Travel and Tourism Terminology|year=2002|publisher=CAB International|isbn=978-0-85199-582-3|page=313|location=Wallingford |oclc=301675778}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIEST, its character and aims|url=http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|author=International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism|accessdate=29 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126143828/http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|archivedate=26 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[United Nations]] identified three forms of tourism in its ''Recommendations on Tourism Statistics'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1994|title=Recommendations on Tourism Statistics|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/newsletter/unsd_workshops/tourism/st_esa_stat_ser_M_83.pdf|journal=|series=M|location=New York|volume=|issue=83|page=5|pages=|work=Statistical Papers|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
* Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country
* Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country

The terms ''tourism'' and ''travel'' are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms ''tourism'' and ''tourist'' are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, ''traveler'' is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tourists_at_the_Taj.html?id=YjLxR2H-YCYC|title=Tourists at the Taj: Performance and Meaning at a Symbolic Site|last=Edensor|first=Tim|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780415167123|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
{{see also|Travel literature}}
Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times traveled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, [[multilingualism|learn new languages]], experience new cultures, and to taste different [[cuisine]]s. As early as [[Shulgi]], however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFWjoeVCLk0C|title=Introduction To Tourism|last=Jayapalan|first=N.|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=9788171569779|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling for pleasure can be seen in [[Egypt]] as early on as 1500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casson|first1=Lionel|title=Travel in the Ancient World|date=1994|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Republic]], [[spa]]s and coastal resorts such as [[Baiae]] were popular among the rich. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote his ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century AD. In [[ancient China]], nobles sometimes made a point of visiting [[Mount Tai]] and, on occasion, all [[five Sacred Mountains]].

===Middle Ages===
By the [[Middle Ages]], [[Christian pilgrimage|Christianity]] and [[Buddhist pilgrimage|Buddhism]] had traditions of [[pilgrimage]]. [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]] and [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s ''[[Journey to the West]]'' remain classics of [[English literature|English]] and [[Chinese literature]].

The 10th- to 13th-century [[Song dynasty]] also saw secular [[travel literature|travel writers]] such as [[Su Shi]] (11th century) and [[Fan Chengda]] (12th century) become popular in [[China]]. Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], [[Xu Xiake]] continued the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hargett, James. "Some Preliminary Remarks on the Travel Records of the Song Dynasty (960-1279)" in ''Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews'', {{nowrap|Vol. 7}}, {{nowrap|No. 1/2}}, {{nowrap|pp. 67–93}}. 1985. {{doi|10.2307/495194}}. {{JSTOR|495194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval Italy]], [[Francesco Petrarch]] also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] that praised the act of traveling and criticized ''frigida incuriositas'' ("cold lack of curiosity"). The [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundian]] poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Michault Taillevent|fr}} later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the [[Jura Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz |author1=Deschaux, Robert |author2=Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32| isbn=9782600028318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Tour===
[[File:Willem van Haecht Władysław Vasa.JPG|thumb|Prince Ladislaus Sigismund of Poland visiting Gallery of [[Cornelis van der Geest]] in [[Brussels]] in 1624.]]
{{See also|Grand Tour}}
Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the [[Grand Tour]], which was a traditional trip around [[Europe]] (especially [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]), undertaken by mainly [[Upper class|upper-class]] European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, young Prince of [[Poland]], [[Władysław IV Vasa|Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa]], the eldest son and heir of [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], embarked for a journey across Europe, as was in [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] among Polish nobility.&lt;ref name="wladcy12b"&gt;[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Podróże po Europie'', ''Władysław IV Wasa'', Władcy Polski, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, where he admired the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|Siege of Breda]] by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="wladcy12b"/&gt; It was an educational journey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Kucharski |title=Dyplomacja i turystyka&amp;nbsp;– królewicz Władysław Waza w posiadłościach hiszpańskich (1624–1625)|url=http://www.wilanow-palac.art.pl/dyplomacja_i_turystyka_krolewicz_wladyslaw_waza_w_posiadlosciach_hiszpanskich_1624_1625.html |work=Silva Rerum |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the outcomes was introduction of [[Polish opera|Italian opera]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;’’The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera’’, ed. Roger Parker (1994): chapter on Central and Eastern European opera by John Warrack, p. 240; ‘’The Viking Opera Guide’’, ed. Amanda Holden (1993): articles on Polish composers, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale [[rail transport|rail]] transit in the 1840s, and generally followed a standard [[Travel itinerary|itinerary]]. It was an educational opportunity and [[rite of passage]]. Though primarily associated with the [[British nobility]] and wealthy [[landed gentry]], similar trips were made by wealthy young men of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Northern Europe]]an nations on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the [[middle class]] after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son|Thomas Cook]] made the "Cook's Tour" a byword.

The Grand Tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers and travellers (such as [[Goethe]]) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centres, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.

''[[The New York Times]]'' recently described the Grand Tour in this way:

{{Quote|text=Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-[[Oxbridge]] trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they [[Commission (art)|commissioned paintings]], perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.|sign=Gross, Matt.|source=[http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/lesons-from-the-frugal-grand-tour/index.html Lessons From the Frugal Grand Tour]." ''New York Times'' 5 September 2008.}}

The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Renaissance]], and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.

===Emergence of leisure travel===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
[[File:Carl Spitzweg 047.jpg|thumb|''Englishman in the [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]]'' by [[Carl Spitzweg]] (c. 1845)]]

[[Leisure]] travel was associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the [[United Kingdom]]{{spaced ndash}}the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population.&lt;ref name="singh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=L. K.|title=Fundamental of Tourism and Travel|year=2008|publisher=Isha Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-8205-478-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWf4PtzRmwUC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=the%20first%20European%20country%20to%20promote%20leisure%20time%20to%20the%20increasing%20industrial%20population&amp;pg=PA189|page=189|chapter=Issues in Tourism Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders. These comprised the new [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt; [[Cox &amp; Kings]] was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coxandkings.co.uk/aboutus-history.aspx|title=History: Centuries of Experience|publisher=[[Cox &amp; Kings]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In [[Nice]], France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the [[French Riviera]], the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the ''[[Promenade des Anglais]]''; in many other historic resorts in [[continental Europe]], old, well-established palace hotels have names like the ''[[Hotel Bristol]]'', ''Hotel Carlton'', or ''Hotel Majestic''{{spaced ndash}}reflecting the dominance of English customers.

[[File:Thomas Cook Building, Leicester, panels.jpg|thumb|Panels from the Thomas Cook Building in Leicester, displaying excursions offered by [[Thomas Cook]]]]
[[File:Leicester Rail Station - geograph.org.uk - 1266728.jpg|left|thumb|[[Leicester railway station]] – built in 1894 to replace, largely on the same site, [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]], the origin for many of Cook's early tours.]]
A pioneer of the travel agency business, [[Thomas Cook]]'s idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at [[Kibworth]]. With the opening of the extended [[Midland Counties Railway]], he arranged to take a group of 540 [[Temperance Movement|temperance campaigners]] from [[Leicester]] [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]] to a rally in [[Loughborough]], {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one [[shilling]] per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} This was the first privately chartered [[excursion train]] to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains.&lt;ref&gt;Ingle, R., 1991 ''Thomas Cook of Leicester'', Bangor, Headstart History&lt;/ref&gt; During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and [[Sunday school]] children. In 1844 the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomascook.com/thomas-cook-history/|title=Thomas Cook History|website=www.thomascook.com|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to [[Calais]] to coincide with the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Exhibition]]. The following year he started his "grand circular tours" of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomascook.com/thomas-cook-history/key-dates/|title=Key Dates 1841–2014 {{!}} Thomas Cook|website=www.thomascook.com|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt and the United States. Cook established "inclusive independent travel", whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.

==Cruise shipping==
[[File:Prinzessin Victoria Luise LOC det.4a15439.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]], the first [[cruise ship]] of the world, launched in June 1900 in [[Hamburg]] (Germany)]]
Cruising is a popular form of [[water tourism]].
Leisure [[cruise ship]]s were introduced by the ''[[Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company]]'' (P&amp;O) in 1844, sailing from [[Southampton]] to destinations such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btnews.co.uk/article/5037|title=CRUISE NEWS JUNE 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, German businessman [[Albert Ballin]] sailed the ship [[Augusta Victoria (ship)|''Augusta Victoria'']] from [[Hamburg]] into the Mediterranean Sea. June 29, 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was ''[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]]'', built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cruiselinehistory.com/the-prinzessin-victoria-luise-worlds-first-cruise-ship/|title=The Prinzessin Victoria Luise – world’s first cruise ship.|work=CRUISING THE PAST|access-date=2018-08-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day tourism==
{{see|Impacts of tourism}}

Many leisure-oriented tourists travel to [[seaside resort]]s on their nearest coast or further afield. Coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter.

===Mass tourism===
[[File:Adolf Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel 044.jpg|thumb|''Reisepläne'' (''Travel plans'') by [[Adolph Menzel]] (1875)]]
[[File:Rom fountain of Trevi.jpg|thumb|Mass tourism at the [[Trevi Fountain]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]
[[File:Barceloneta 2007.jpg|thumb|Tourists at the Mediterranean Coast of [[Barcelona]], 2007]]

Academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age of Mass Tourism: Its History and Development, Erkan Sezgin and Medet Yolal, [[Anadolu University]], p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the [[United Kingdom]] and was pioneered by [[Thomas Cook]]. Cook took advantage of Europe's rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to [[the masses]], in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son]].&lt;ref name="Mass Tourism p. 74"&gt;Golden Age of Mass Tourism: Its History and Development, Erkan Sezgin and Medet Yolal, [[Anadolu University]], p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads.&lt;ref name="Mass Tourism p. 74"/&gt; One contemporary form of mass tourism, [[package tour]]ism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.

Travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes.
Improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest, so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

In [[Continental Europe]], early [[seaside resort]]s included: [[Heiligendamm]], founded in 1793 at the [[Baltic Sea]], being the first seaside resort; [[Ostend]], popularised by the people of [[Brussels]]; [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] and [[Deauville]] for the [[Paris]]ians; [[Taormina]] in [[Sicily]]. In the [[United States]], the first seaside resorts in the European style were at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

By the mid-20th century the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the [[Spanish miracle#Mass tourism and emigration|Spanish economic "miracle"]].

===Niche tourism===
{{main list|List of adjectival tourisms}}
[[File:Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Sanctuary of Christ the King]], in [[Almada]], has become one of the most religious tourism visited places.]]

Niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lew|first=Alan A.|title=Long Tail Tourism: New geographies for marketing niche tourism products|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=409–19|doi=10.1080/10548400802508515|url=http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614084130/http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|archivedate=14 June 2010|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.6320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:
{{colbegin}}
* [[Agritourism]]
* [[Birth tourism]]
* [[Culinary tourism]]
* [[Cultural tourism]]
* [[Dark tourism]] (also called "black tourism" or "grief tourism") 
* [[Eco tourism]]
* [[Extreme tourism]]
* [[Geotourism]]
* [[Heritage tourism]]
* [[LGBT tourism]]
* [[Medical tourism]]
* [[Movie tourism]]
* [[Nautical tourism]]
* [[Pop-culture tourism]]
* [[Religious tourism]]
* [[Sex tourism]]
* [[Slum tourism]]
* [[Sports tourism]]
* [[Virtual tourism]]
* [[War tourism]]
* [[Wellness tourism]]
* [[Wildlife tourism]]
{{colend}}

Other terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term "destination" in the descriptions, such as [[destination wedding]]s, and terms such as [[location vacation]].

===Winter tourism===
{{See also|List of ski areas and resorts|Winter sport}}
[[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]] became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|title=Birthplace of winter tourism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017122131/http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Winter Tourism|url=http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|work=Tradition &amp; History|publisher=Kulm Hotel|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=[[St. Moritz]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230025/http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|archivedate=19 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.graubuenden.ch/winter-walking-switzerland.html |title=Winter hiking in Switzerland-Graubünden|publisher=graubuenden.ch |accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major [[ski resort]]s are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. [[Andorra]], [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Cyprus]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], Greece, [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Poland|Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]]), [[Canada]], the [[United States]] (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) [[Argentina]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Chile]], and [[Lebanon]].

Some places that already have ski opportunities can also have glaciers in the area. Some of theses places already offer a glacier hike to see the glaciers in another way that they can. One of these places are New Zealand. New Zealand has several glaciers that are available for this experience. The Franz Josef is one of these glaciers that tourism is available. The only way to get to the glacier is via a helicopter. Before helicopters were invented the way that people were able to get up to the glacier was by hiking up to the glacier. The companies have to make sure that people are safe from when they are on the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purdie|first=Heather|date=1 November 2013|title=Glacier Retreat and Tourism: Insights from New Zealand|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00073.1|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=33|issue=4|pages=463–472|doi=10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00073.1|issn=0276-4741}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would fall under environmental tourism as well as winter tourism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Recent developments==
[[File:Aerial view Yacht Harbour Residence Rostock Yachthafenresidenz Hohe Düne 6.jpg|thumb|right|A [[destination hotel]] in [[Germany]]: ''Yacht Harbour Residence'' in [[Warnemünde|Rostock]], [[Mecklenburg]].]]
[[File:Can you see the surfer? (33988985575).jpg|thumb|right|[[Nazaré, Portugal]], is now listed on the [[Guinness World Records]] for the biggest waves ever surfed and has become a worldwide tourist attraction.]]
There has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades,{{vague|date=November 2013}} especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialised holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted [[destination hotel]]s.

The developments in [[Aviation|air transport]] infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. The [[WHO]] estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example some retirement-age people sustain year round tourism. This is facilitated by [[Electronic commerce|internet sales]] of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer [[dynamic packaging]], in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[terrorism|terrorist threats]] to [[tourist destination]]s, such as in [[Bali]] and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a [[tsunami]], caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], hit the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia|Asian countries]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], including the [[Maldives]]. Thousands of lives were lost including many tourists. This, together with the vast [[clean-up]] operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travelcupio.com/category/destination/asia-pacific/india/|title=India Top Tourist Destinations &amp; Attractions|website=TravelCupio|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the [[hostel]] market and services like [[CouchSurfing]] and [[airbnb]] being established.&lt;ref name="newyorkercouch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Patricia|title=Couch-surfing the globe|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/16/120416fa_fact_marx|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cadene|first1=Philippe|title=Atlas of the Gulf States|date=2013|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable tourism===
{{Main|Sustainable tourism}}

"Sustainable tourism is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] and life support systems." ([[World Tourism Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Tourism: Turning the Tide |url=http://www.stakeholderforum.org/fileadmin/files/SF_Briefing_Papers/bp_tourism.pdf|work=Towards Earth Summit 2002|publisher=[[Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future]]|access-date=22 January 2012|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable development]] implies "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." ([[Bruntland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a42r187.htm|work=42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|publisher=[[The Conference of NGOs]]|access-date=21 January 2012|date=11 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of sustainable tourism is something known as the three pillars of sustainability which include Economic, Environmental/Ecological and Socio-cultural. For a destination to be truly sustainable it must have an equal balance which the three pillars. Economic is in relation to money and making and maintaining a certain amount of cash. Environmental is of course in relation to the environment it looks into whether the local ecosystems can support the influx of visitors and also how these visitors effect the ecosystem. Then finally Socio-cultural is about how well the culture of this area is able to maintain its traditions with the incoming tourists.  These pillars are important because they are the true key to being sustainable when discussing tourism.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Sustainable tourism can be seen as having regard to ecological and social-cultural carrying capacities and includes involving the community of the destination in tourism development planning (that was done e.g. in [[Fruška Gora]] National Park in [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vujko|first=Aleksandra|last2=Plavša|first2=Jovan|last3=Petrović|first3=Marko|last4=Radovanović|first4=Milan|last5=Gajić|first5=Tamara|date=13 March 2017|title=Modelling of carrying capacity in National Park - Fruška Gora (Serbia) case study|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/issue-files/geo.2017.9.issue-1.xml|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0005|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also involves integrating tourism to match current economic and growth policies so as to mitigate some of the negative economic and social [[impacts of tourism|impacts]] of '[[mass tourism]]'. Murphy (1985) advocates the use of an 'ecological approach', to consider both 'plants' and 'people' when implementing the sustainable tourism development process. This is in contrast to the '[[boosterism]]' and '[[economic]]' approaches to tourism planning, neither of which consider the detrimental ecological or sociological impacts of tourism development to a destination.

However, Butler questions the exposition of the term 'sustainable' in the context of tourism, citing its ambiguity and stating that "the emerging sustainable development philosophy of the 1990s can be viewed as an extension of the broader realization that a preoccupation with economic growth without regard to its social and environmental consequences is self-defeating in the long term." Thus 'sustainable tourism development' is seldom considered as an autonomous function of economic regeneration as separate from general economic growth.

===Ecotourism===
{{Main|Ecotourism}}
Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveler; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities; and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights.''Take only memories and leave only footprints'' is a very common slogan in protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinterest.com/marymo393/take-only-memories-leave-only-footprints-chief-sea/|title=Morgan Gamble|work=Pinterest|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Entrepreneuring Sustainable Tourism, [[Jack Soifer]] Editor, Lisboa, 2008, {{ISBN|978-989-95976-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie tourism===
The movie tourism is a form of tourism for those who visit the film and television locations, ie the places used for filming a film or a television series. In addition to organized tours (and not) to film locations lately has widened the tendency to a type of tourism, linked to the cinema, which relates to events, conventions and more like the case of the [[Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico]].

===Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico===
The Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is an artistic costume movement originally born as a journalistic column on various online and paper publications officially in 2012 (with a genesis formed in the previous decade) but, in the following years, it has become a real costume fashion popularized in sites, associations, institutions, municipal administrations, political parties, movements and television listings all over the world. It also includes Museums and Sports Groups linked to its brand. The purpose of the work is varied: from the redevelopment of territorial areas thanks to the artistic interest raised to be film and fiction locations ([[Movie tourism]]) to promote events linked to the Cinema as film anniversaries, festivals, parties to theme (Toga Party, Monster Party, Cosplay Party, Hollywood Party, Pajamas Party, etc ...), manifestations born in films or that the cinema has helped to divulge (though already existing) as, for example, the Demolition Derby, village festivals disseminated by the Cinema (such as those appearing in the [[Mondo Cane]] film series, etc ...). We wanted to differentiate from Movie Tourism  (a fashion that has existed for several decades) to be more varied and not limited to tourism (that is a part of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico).
In the mid-2000s, the student of video advertising and journalistic communications at the [[Turin]] branch of the Fellini Institute [[Davide Lingua]] (called Dave Lingua), obsessed with customary phenomena, has in mind to create a totally new object to redevelop areas territories hit by the crisis but fun and that leads to fashion accessible to all. This is the genesis for the creation of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico. A few years later (between 2010, the beginning of the collaboration, and 2012) creates with this name a column (which initially deals with Cine tourism, Cinema Museums and Costume Party with a cinematic theme) within the site (in that period related to the homonymous paper magazine) of the Milan group [[Mondadori]] [[filmtv.it]] which soon became the most popular of the magazine with a myriad of collaborators. In the following period the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico appears as a column in various newspapers and magazines (the Netweek group, La Voce, is mentioned in [[La Stampa]] and many other newspapers) and officially appears as a cultural movement that gives full freedom to all to join simply using the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico (respecting however the topics of interest of the movement) coming to create totally independent sections (but always within legally registered bodies or associations), with their own statutes and directives but with only provided that the official founder (helped at the beginning by the first members) Davide Lingua is recognized as Permanent Director for life (in fact director and not president because he wants to underline the journalistic origin of the project).

From its birth until today the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is a worldwide journalistic column, television broadcasting, has sections in many associations, institutions that collaborate with municipal administrations, has dealt with the official celebrations of film shooting anniversaries (for example [[Salasco]] of the film [[Bitter Rice]]), appears in the credits of many films for the collaboration given, organizes communication courses, cultural and sporting events, etc ...

===Volunteer tourism===

Volunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities. Wearing (2001) defines volunteer tourism as applying “to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Volunteer Tourism: Experiences That Make a Difference|publisher=CABI}}&lt;/ref&gt; VSO was founded in the UK in 1958 and the US Peace Corps was subsequently founded in 1960. These were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butcher|first=J|last2=Smith|first2=P|date=2010|title=‘Making a difference’: Volunteer tourism and development|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=35|pages=27–36|doi=10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures, and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terry|first=W|date=2014|title=Solving labor problems and building capacity unsustainable agriculture through volunteer tourism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738314001091|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=49|pages=94–107|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2014.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour, and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guttentag|first=D|date=2009|title=The possible negative impacts of volunteer tourism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.727/full|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|volume=11|issue=6|pages=537–51|doi=10.1002/jtr.727}}&lt;/ref&gt; while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curran|first=Ross|last2=Taheri|first2=Babak|last3=MacIntosh|first3=Robert|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2016|title=Nonprofit Brand Heritage: Its Ability to Influence Volunteer Retention, Engagement, and Satisfaction|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0899764016633532|journal=Nonprofit and Volutary Sector Quarterly|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1234–57|doi=10.1177/0899764016633532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|date=2017|title=A modern day panopticon: Using power and control theory to manage volunteer tourists in Bolivia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221197361730003X|journal=Tourism Management Perspectives|volume=22|pages=34–43|doi=10.1016/j.tmp.2017.01.003|hdl=10373/2606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-poor tourism===
[[File:Community Tourism (Riven No 2).webm|thumb| Community tourism in Sierra Leone [[b:Development Cooperation Handbook/Stories/Community Tourism|→ The story of a community in Sierra Leone trying to manage tourism in a responsible manner]]   [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]   [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL32A3F6F949A3F26D Playlist] ]]
Pro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in [[Tanzania]] and cultural tourism in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2675&amp;title=value-chains-tourism-poverty-reduction |title=Value chain analysis and poverty reduction at scale  |author=Jonathan Mitchel |year=2009 |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Richard|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin D.|date=1 September 2013|title=Pro-Poor Tourism in a First World Urban Setting: Case Study of Glasgow Govan|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.1888/abstract|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=443–57|doi=10.1002/jtr.1888|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recession tourism===
Recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place of once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travelers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as [[staycation]].

===Medical tourism===
{{Main|Medical tourism}}
When there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Cuba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/world/americas/americans-may-see-appeal-of-medical-tourism-in-cuba.html|title=Americans May See Appeal of Medical Tourism in Cuba|last=Neuman|first=William|date=17 February 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/evolving-medical-tourism-in-canada.html|title=Evolving medical tourism in Canada {{!}} Deloitte Canada|website=Deloitte Canada|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. [[dentistry]]), traveling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as "medical tourism".

===Educational tourism===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of classroom environment. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program.

=== Event tourism ===
This type of tourism is focused tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event  or to see an organized event put on by the city/region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/760291882|title=Tourism management : an introduction|last=Clare.|first=Inkson,|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|others=Minnaert, Lynn.|isbn=9781848608696|location=Los Angeles|oclc=760291882}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of tourism can also fall under [[sustainable tourism]] as well and companies that create a [[Sustainable event management|sustainable event]] to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere it creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival [[South by Southwest]] that is hosted in [[Austin, Texas]] annually. This is a perfect example because very year people from all over the world flock to this one city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see a whole city of bands perform. These people are being drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which is exactly what event tourism is about.

===Creative tourism===
[[File:FF of Hartwell welcomes Indonesians.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friendship Force International|Friendship Force]] visitors from Indonesia meet their hosts in [[Hartwell, Georgia]], USA.]]
Creative tourism has existed as a form of [[cultural tourism]], since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the [[Grand Tour]], which saw the sons of aristocratic families traveling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards,&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wurzburger|first=Rebecca|title=Creative Tourism: A Global Conversation: How to Provide Unique Creative Experiences for Travelers Worldwide: As Presented at the 2008 Santa Fe &amp; UNESCO International Conference on Creative Tourism in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA|publisher=Sunstone Press|location=Santa Fe|year=2009|isbn=978-0-86534-724-3|oclc=370387178|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the [[European Commission]], including cultural and crafts tourism, known as [[sustainable tourism]]. They have defined "creative tourism" as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the [[culture]] of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as [[UNESCO]], who through the [[Creative Cities Network]], have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, [[authenticity (reenactment)|authentic]] experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a [[Location (geography)|place]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[File:Greg Richards - Conferencia Turismo Creativo.jpg|thumb|A tourism conference underway.]]
More recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travelers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy, New Zealand and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legco.gov.hk/research-publications/english/essentials-1617ise03-creative-tourism.htm|title=Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - Creative tourism|last=Lau|first=Samantha|date=14 November 2016|website=Legislative Council of Hong Kong|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Experiential tourism===
[[Experiential travel]] (or "immersion travel") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its [[history]], people, food and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/nyregion/your-home-the-new-frontier-for-tourists-in-new-york-city.html|title=Your Home, the New Frontier for Tourists in New York City|first=Ginia|last=Bellafante|date=6 July 2012|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “Experiential travel” is already mentioned in publications from 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o_QJAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22experiential+travel%22&amp;dq=%22experiential+travel%22|title=Insights in Strategic Retail Management|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – however it was discovered as a meaningful market trend much later.

===Dark tourism===
{{Main|Dark tourism}}
[[File:Poland - Czermna - Chapel of Skulls - interior 06.jpg|thumb|The [[Skull Chapel, Czermna|Skull Chapel]] in south-western [[Poland]] is an example of [[dark tourism]]. Its interior walls, ceiling and foundations are adorned by human remains. It is the only such monument in Poland, and one of six in [[Europe]].]]
One emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-dar2.htm|title=Dark Tourism|last=Quinion|first=Michael|date=26 November 2005|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennon|first1=J.

This type of tourism involves visits to "dark" sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of [[genocide]], for example [[Internment|concentration camps]]. Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Chris|title=Tourism: Principles and Practice|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|location=Harlow|year=2005|edition= 3rd|isbn=978-0-273-68406-0|oclc=466952897|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Stone]] argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining one's own death through the real death of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Philip R.|date=1 July 2012|title=Dark tourism and significant other death: Towards a Model of Mortality Mediation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738312000564|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1565–87|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2012.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik H Cohen]] introduces the term "[[populo sites]]" to evidence the educational character of dark tourism. Populo sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors. Based on a study at [[Yad Vashem]], the Shoah (Holocaust) memorial museum in Jerusalem, a new term—''in populo''—is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell. Learning about the Shoah in Jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in Europe, but equally authentic. It is argued that a dichotomy between "authentic" sites at the location of a tragedy and "created" sites elsewhere is insufficient. Participants' evaluations of seminars for European teachers at Yad Vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject. Implications for other cases of dark tourism at ''in populo'' locations are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Erik H.|date=1 January 2011|title=Educational dark tourism at an in populo site: The Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738310001040|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=38|issue=1|pages=193–209|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, [[Peter Tarlow]] defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths, which continue to impact our lives. This issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ciW6GbT5jNEC|title=Niche Tourism|last=Novelli|first=Marina|date=1 June 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136376177|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social tourism===
Social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation. It includes [[youth hostels]] and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and [[voluntary organisation]]s, [[trade unions]], or in Communist times [[combine (enterprise)|publicly owned enterprises]]. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, [[Walter Hunziker#Social tourism|Walter Hunziker]] proposed the following definition: "Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/261135450|title=Tourism : principles, practices, philosophies|last=R.|first=Goeldner, Charles|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley|others=Ritchie, J.

===Doom tourism===
[[File:Perito Moreno Glacier Patagonia Argentina Luca Galuzzi 2005.JPG|thumb|[[Perito Moreno Glacier]], [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].]]

Also known as "Tourism of Doom," or "Last Chance Tourism" this emerging trend involves traveling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the melting glaciers of [[Patagonia]], or the coral of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]) before it is too late. Identified by travel trade magazine [[Travel Age West]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.travelagewest.com/Travel-News/Viewpoint/The-Tourism-of-Doom/ |title=TravelAge West – TravelAge West |publisher=Travelagewest.com |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; editor-in-chief Kenneth Shapiro in 2007 and later explored in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salkin |first=Allen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/world/americas/16iht-tourism.1.8762449.html |title='Tourism of doom' on rise|publisher=Nytimes.com |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise. Some see the trend as related to [[sustainable tourism]] or [[ecotourism]] due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual’s [[carbon footprint]] and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing.&lt;ref&gt;Lemelin, H., Dawson, J., &amp; Stewart, E.

Religious tourism, in particular religious travel, is used to strengthen faith and show devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafari|first=Jafar|last2=Scott|first2=Noel|date=1 January 2014|title=Muslim world and its tourisms|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738313001199|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=44|pages=1–19|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2013.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious tourists seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self-identity in a positive manner. Given this, the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self-identity or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gannon|first=Martin Joseph|last2=Baxter|first2=Ian W.

==Growth==
The [[World Tourism Organization]] (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4%.&lt;ref name="predict"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2004| url = http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm| title = Long-term Prospects: Tourism 2020 Vision| publisher = World Tourism| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619001112/http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm| archivedate = 19 June 2004| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]], tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jie|last2=Lu|first2=Zi|date=1 July 2004|title=Development, Distribution and Evaluation of Online Tourism Services in China|journal=Electronic Commerce Research|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=221–39|doi=10.1023/B:ELEC.0000027981.81945.2a|issn=1389-5753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karanasios|first=Stan|last2=Burgess|first2=Stephen|date=1 March 2008|title=Tourism and internet adoption: a developing world perspective|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=169–82|doi=10.1002/jtr.649|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.

It has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context.&lt;ref name="correl"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/2007/01/27/airports-tourists/ | title =airports &amp; tourists | publisher = Global Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their [[Community-based economics|local economies]]. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.

There has been a limited amount of orbital [[space tourism]], with only the [[Russian Space Agency]] providing transport to date. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion-dollar market by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U.

===Sports tourism===
{{Main|Sports tourism}}

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Since the late 1980s, [[sports tourism]] has become increasingly popular. Events such as rugby, Olympics, Commonwealth games, Asian Games and football World Cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights, hotels and excursions.

===Latest trends===
As a result of the [[late-2000s recession]], international arrivals suffered a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008. Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7% during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with a negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8%.&lt;ref name="UNWTO"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNWTO|title=UNWTO Tourism Highlights|url=http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights11enhr_1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=UNWTO|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6% over six quarters. While this is considerably milder than what occurred after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], the decline was at twice the rate as real GDP has fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/commerce/tourism-impacts-world-economic-crisis-north-america/ | title=Impacts of the World Recession and Economic Crisis on Tourism: North America}} JournalistsResource.org.

However, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term. It has been suggested that travel is necessary in order to maintain relationships, as social life is increasingly networked and conducted at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urry|first=John|title=Social Networks, Travel and Talk|journal=British Journal of Sociology|year=2003|volume=54|issue=2|pages=155–75|doi=10.1080/0007131032000080186|pmid=12945865}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many people vacations and travel are increasingly being viewed as a necessity rather than a luxury, and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some 6.6% globally over 2009, with growth up to 8% in emerging economies.&lt;ref name="UNWTO"/&gt;

The '''Vailala Madness''' was a social movement in the [[Papuan Gulf]], in the [[Papua (Australian territory)|Territory of Papua]], beginning in the later part of 1919 and diminishing after 1922. It is generally accepted as the first well-documented [[cargo cult]], a class of [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] religio-political movements, although the expression ''cargo cult'' itself dates from the mid-1940s.

== Name ==
The Vailala Madness acquired its name from observations of the behaviour of people who participated in it, which included [[glossolalia]], shaking and psychosomatic symptoms. In the indigenous language, participants called it ''iki haveva'', or "belly-don't know," meaning, roughly, "dizziness."

== Return of the Ancestors ==
The movement included the belief that a 'Ghost Steamer' piloted by the returning dead, would arrive presently, bringing with it a cargo that included, besides departed relatives: tinned food, tools, various other resources, and in one version, guns with which to expel the white colonizers. The last item is disputed,{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} and may{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} stem from the account of contemporary expatriate plantation owners, who were highly distressed by events.{{According to whom|date=April 2010}}

== White ancestors ==
The ancestors who would return with the ship were conceived as being white, an idea which recurs in many post-war cargo cults. Communication with them was possible by using an apparatus described as a 'flag pole' - a tall pole, attached by cane to the movement's 'office'. An expatriate observer suggested{{Who|date=April 2010}} this was the imitation of a wireless set, and claimed to have seen a pumpkin hoisted up the pole for transmission to the ancestors. However, [[Albert Maori Kiki]], who grew up in the area, suggested that this device was actually related to a myth whereby Morning Star used a long string of cane to come from his home, which is very distant, to the village to meet a woman he fancied. This is an illustration of the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] nature of many cargo cult rituals.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== Regulation of life after colonial fashion ==
Another aspect of the movement which presages features of later cargo cults is the so-called "imitation of the white man". The leaders of the movement would drill the [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] as if they were soldiers, they enforced a curfew after the manner of regimented life at plantations, and they held a ceremony which looked for all intents and purposes like [[tea party (social gathering)|having tea]] in the European fashion. A table would be decorated with [[Croton (genus)|crotons]], and food would be served for the participants to eat while sitting on stools. According to [[Francis Edgar Williams]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} the anthropologist who observed this, under no other circumstances would an indigenous person suffer through sitting at a table in this way. However, there was no explanation linking this to the ancestors, for instance. This illustrates another aspect of cargo cults, which is that some activities described as cargo cults could be rituals with secret meanings, or their description as such could be an outcome of the observer's expectation of secret meanings.

== Strict moral code ==
Some reports{{Who|date=April 2010}} suggested that the movement led to widespread sexual license, but this cannot be verified. Indeed, the movement officially taught a strict moral code, which included the prohibition of adultery and other moral offenses. Such offenses would be rectified by fines levied by the leaders of the movement. To discover who had committed any sin, these leaders organized divining ceremonies which involved a very large log, held by several men, which was said{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} to have the capacity to seek out anyone who had guilt.

This resulted in the movement being classified as a form of extortion by the colonial administration. This offense was added to that of 'spreading false [[rumor]]s,' punishable under the legal code of the [[Australian Papua]] territory. Several of the leaders were in fact jailed, for an unknown period of time.

== Abandonment of ceremonies ==
The Vailala Madness also took a rigid line on the abandonment of the great cycle of [[initiation]]s that were formerly a centre of social life in the Papuan Gulf. The cycle, known as ''hevehe'' and ''semese'', would take over a decade to complete and involved the building of a huge man's cultic house, known as the ''eravo'', in which were put ritual paraphernalia that were prohibited to women. The Vailala Madness destroyed the paraphernalia, and often the first step towards this was displaying the forbidden items to the non-initiated.

== Source of these beliefs ==
The source of the model of organization incorporating drills, curfews and tea was most likely observed{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} by the leaders of the movement whilst working in plantations far away from the Papuan Gulf, where they also picked up [[Tok Pisin]].{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} It is likely{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} that there they also learned about the war with Germany, since the glossolalia was described as "djaman".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It has been suggested{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} that ideas about 'cargo' - specifically, the belief that it was diverted from the ancestors by whites - emerged within the context of the plantation indigenous labour force.

It is clear{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} that Christianity, which had been introduced by [[James Chalmers (missionary)|Rev. James Chalmers]] in the 1890s,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} had a profound effect on the people, and it is possible{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} that many ideas in the moral code stemmed from it. The movement set out to "throw'em away bloody new guinea somethings",{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} which should not be interpreted{{According to whom|date=April 2010}} as the internalization of colonialist ideology. In fact, colonialist ideology in Papua demanded that indigenous society remain relatively stable within tradition and culture, and for this reason, the Vailala Madness was considered to be a troubling indicator that society might collapse under the pressure of change.

== Observers and the end of the movement ==
The movement was observed first hand by [[G. M. Murray]] in 1919, the Acting Resident Magistrate for the [[Kerema]] Patrol Station.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Francis Edgar Williams, the Government Anthropologist of the Australian Papuan administration, arrived in 1922, at which time the movement was still strong, though already showing signs of disintegration.

== Locomotion ==
{{main|propulsion}}

Locomotion consists of a means that allows displacement with little opposition, a power source to provide the required [[kinetic energy]] and a means to control the motion, such as a [[brake]] and [[steering]] system. By far, most vehicles use [[wheel]]s which employ the principle of [[rolling]] to enable displacement with very little [[rolling friction]].

=== Energy source ===
[[File:China E-bike.jpg|thumb|An [[electric bike]] in China (2011)]]
{{main|Energy storage#Storage methods}}
{{see also|Hybrid vehicle}}
It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it. Energy can be extracted from external sources, as in the cases of a [[sailboat]], a [[solar-powered car]], or an electric [[streetcar]] that uses overhead lines. Energy can also be stored, provided it can be converted on demand and the storing medium's [[energy density]] and [[power density]] are sufficient to meet the vehicle's needs.

[[Human power]] is a simple source of energy that requires nothing more than humans. Despite the fact that humans cannot exceed {{convert|500|W|hp|abbr=on}} for meaningful amounts of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Bicycle Power – How many Watts can you produce?| publisher = Mapawatt| url = http://blog.mapawatt.com/2009/07/19/bicycle-power-watts/| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cycling records|land speed record for human-powered vehicles]] (unpaced) is {{convert|133|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, as of 2009 on a [[recumbent bicycle]].&lt;ref name="Speed2009"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/whpsc2009/results.htm|title = Battle Mountain World Human Powered Speed Challenge|accessdate = 25 August 2011|last = WHPSC|date = September 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130811101125/http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/whpsc2009/results.htm|archive-date = 11 August 2013|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common type of energy source is [[fuel]]. External combustion engines can use almost anything that burns as fuel, whilst internal combustion engines and rocket engines are designed to burn a specific fuel, typically gasoline, [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[ethanol]].

Another common medium for storing energy is [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], which have the advantages of being responsive, useful in a wide range of power levels, environmentally friendly, efficient, simple to install, and easy to maintain. Batteries also facilitate the use of electric motors, which have their own advantages. On the other hand, batteries have low energy densities, short service life, poor performance at extreme temperatures, long charging times, and difficulties with disposal (although they can usually be recycled). Like fuel, batteries store chemical energy and can cause burns and poisoning in event of an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Battery Safety| publisher = Electropaedia| url = http://www.mpoweruk.com/safety.htm| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batteries also lose effectiveness with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Lifecycle of an Electric Car Battery| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/vehicles/electric-car-battery4.htm| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of charge time can be resolved by swapping discharged batteries with charged ones;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Advantages and Disadvantages of EVs| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/vehicles/electric-car-battery3.htm| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this incurs additional hardware costs and may be impractical for larger batteries. Moreover, there must be standard batteries for battery swapping to work at a gas station. [[Fuel cells]] are similar to batteries in that they convert from chemical to electrical energy, but have their own advantages and disadvantages.

[[Third rail|Electrified rails]] and overhead cables are a common source of electrical energy on subways, railways, trams, and trolleybuses.
[[Solar energy]] is a more modern development, and several [[solar vehicles]] have been successfully built and tested, including [[NASA Pathfinder|Helios]], a solar-powered aircraft.

[[Nuclear power]] is a more exclusive form of energy storage, currently limited to large ships and submarines, mostly military. Nuclear energy can be released by a [[nuclear reactor]], [[nuclear battery]], or repeatedly detonating [[nuclear bombs]]. There have been two experiments with nuclear-powered aircraft, the [[Tupolev Tu-119]] and the [[Convair X-6]].

[[Deformation (mechanics)|Mechanical strain]] is another method of storing energy, whereby an elastic band or metal spring is deformed and releases energy as it is allowed to return to its ground state. Systems employing elastic materials suffer from [[hysteresis]], and metal springs are too dense to be useful in many cases.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}

[[Flywheel energy storage|Flywheels]] store energy in a spinning mass. Because a light and fast rotor is energetically favorable, flywheels can pose a significant safety hazard. Moreover, flywheels leak energy fairly quickly and affect a vehicle's steering through the [[gyroscopic effect]]. They have been used experimentally in [[gyrobus]]es.

[[Wind energy]] is used by sailboats and [[land yacht]]s as the primary source of energy. It is very cheap and fairly easy to use, the main issues being dependence on weather and upwind performance. [[Balloon (aircraft)|Balloons]] also rely on the wind to move horizontally. Aircraft flying in the [[jet stream]] may get a boost from high altitude winds.

[[Compressed gas]] is currently an experimental method of storing energy. In this case, compressed gas is simply stored in a tank and released when necessary. Like elastics, they have [[hysteresis]] losses when gas heats up during compression.

[[Gravitational potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|Gravitational potential energy]] is a form of energy used in gliders, skis, [[bobsled]]s and numerous other vehicles that go down hill. [[Regenerative brake|Regenerative braking]] is an example of capturing [[kinetic energy]] where the brakes of a vehicle are augmented with a generator or other means of extracting energy.&lt;ref name="regenerative"&gt;{{cite web| title = How Regenerative Braking Works| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/regenerative-braking.htm| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motors and engines ===
{{main|Engine}}

When needed, the energy is taken from the source and consumed by one or more motors or engines. Sometimes there is an intermediate medium, such as the batteries of a diesel submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How do the engines breathe in diesel submarines?| publisher = [[How Stuff Works]]| date = 24 July 2006| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/question286.htm| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most motor vehicles have [[internal combustion engines]]. They are fairly cheap, easy to maintain, reliable, safe and small. Since these engines burn fuel, they have long ranges but pollute the environment. A related engine is the [[external combustion engine]]. An example of this is the steam engine. Aside from fuel, steam engines also need water, making them impractical for some purposes. Steam engines also need time to warm up, whereas IC engines can usually run right after being started, although this may not be recommended in cold conditions. Steam engines burning coal release [[sulfur]] into the air, causing harmful [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Coal and the environment| publisher = Kentucky Coal Education| url = http://www.coaleducation.org/lessons/twe/envi.pdf| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While intermittent internal combustion engines were once the primary means of aircraft propulsion, they have been largely superseded by continuous internal combustion engines: [[gas turbine]]s. Turbine engines are light and, particularly when used on aircraft, efficient.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On the other hand, they cost more and require careful maintenance. They can also be damaged by ingesting foreign objects, and they produce a hot exhaust. Trains using turbines are called [[gas turbine-electric locomotive]]s. Examples of surface vehicles using turbines are [[M1 Abrams]], [[MTT Turbine SUPERBIKE]] and the [[Millennium (ship)|Millennium]]. [[Pulse jet]] engines are similar in many ways to turbojets, but have almost no moving parts. For this reason, they were very appealing to vehicle designers in the past; however their noise, heat and inefficiency has led to their abandonment. A historical example of the use of a pulse jet was the [[V-1 flying bomb]]. Pulse jets are still occasionally used in amateur experiments. With the advent of modern technology, the [[pulse detonation engine]] has become practical and was successfully tested on a [[Rutan VariEze]]. While the pulse detonation engine is much more efficient than the pulse jet and even turbine engines, it still suffers from extreme noise and vibration levels. [[Ramjets]] also have few moving parts, but they only work at high speed, so that their use is restricted to [[tip jet]] helicopters and high speed aircraft such as the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,834721,00.html|title=Here Comes the Flying Stovepipe |work=TIME|accessdate=22 July 2011| date=26 November 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = the heart of the SR-71 "Blackbird" : the mighty J-58 engine| publisher = aérostories| url = http://aerostories.free.fr/technique/J58/J58_01/page9.html| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket engines are primarily used on rockets, rocket sleds and experimental aircraft. Rocket engines are extremely powerful. The heaviest vehicle ever to leave the ground, the [[Saturn V]] rocket, was powered by five [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 rocket engines]] generating a combined 180 million horsepower&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| title = Historical Timeline| publisher = [[NASA]]| url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/timeline/1950_prt.htm| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (134.2 gigawatt). Rocket engines also have no need to "push off" anything, a fact that the [[New York Times]] [[Robert H. Goddard#The New York Times editorial|denied in error]]. Rocket engines can be particularly simple, sometimes consisting of nothing more than a catalyst, as in the case of a [[hydrogen peroxide]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Can you make a rocket engine using hydrogen peroxide and silver?| publisher = [[How Stuff Works]]| url = http://www.howstuffworks.com/question159.htm| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes them an attractive option for vehicles such as jet packs. Despite their simplicity, rocket engines are often dangerous and susceptible to explosions. The fuel they run off may be flammable, poisonous, corrosive or cryogenic. They also suffer from poor efficiency. For these reasons, rocket engines are only used when absolutely necessary.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Electric motors are used in [[electric vehicle]]s such as [[electric bicycle]]s, electric scooters, small boats, subways, [[Electric locomotive|trains]], [[trolleybus]]es, [[tram]]s and [[electric aircraft|experimental aircraft]]. Electric motors can be very efficient: over 90% efficiency is common.&lt;ref&gt;NEMA Design B electric motor standard, cited in [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/electrical-motor-efficiency-d_655.html Electrical Motor Efficiency] Retrieved 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Electric motors can also be built to be powerful, reliable, low-maintenance and of any size. Electric motors can deliver a range of speeds and torques without necessarily using a gearbox (although it may be more economical to use one). Electric motors are limited in their use chiefly by the difficulty of supplying electricity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Compressed gas motors have been used on some vehicles experimentally. They are simple, efficient, safe, cheap, reliable and operate in a variety of conditions. One of the difficulties met when using gas motors is the cooling effect of expanding gas. These engines are limited by how quickly they absorb heat from their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| title = Pneumatic Engine| publisher = Quasiturbine| url = http://sites.google.com/site/quasiturbines/enginetypes/etypepneumatic| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooling effect can, however, double as air conditioning. Compressed gas motors also lose effectiveness with falling gas pressure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;!--http://quasiturbine.promci.qc.ca/EProductQT600SCPneumatic.htm: not sure if that graph is proof of this sentence but I think it's self evident that lower pressure = lower torque in these engines--&gt;

[[Ion thrusters]] are used on some satellites and spacecraft. They are only effective in a vacuum, which limits their use to spaceborne vehicles. Ion thrusters run primarily off electricity, but they also need a propellant such as [[caesium]], or more recently [[xenon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Fact Sheet| publisher = [[NASA]]| url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs08grc.html| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = NASA – Innovative Engines| publisher = [[Boeing]], Xenon Ion Propulsion Center| url = http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/xips/xips.html| accessdate = 22 July 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110712022654/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/xips/xips.html| archive-date = 12 July 2011| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ion thrusters can achieve extremely high speeds and use little propellant; however they are power-hungry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Frequently asked questions about ion propulsion| publisher = [[NASA]]| url = http://nmp.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/ionpropfaq.html| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Converting energy to work ===
The mechanical energy that motors and engines produce must be converted to [[Work (physics)|work]] by wheels, propellers, nozzles, or similar means.
Aside from converting mechanical energy into motion, wheels allow a vehicle to roll along a surface and, with the exception of railed vehicles, to be steered.&lt;ref name="steering"&gt;{{cite web| title = How Car Steering Works| work = [[HowStuffWorks]]| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://www.howstuffworks.com/steering.htm| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheels are ancient technology, with specimens being discovered from over 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = World's Oldest Wheel Found in Slovenia| url = http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/culture/worlds_oldest_wheel_found_in_slovenia/| date = March 2003| publisher = Government Communication Office of the Republic of Slovenia| author = Alexander Gasser| accessdate = 23 July 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120714033224/http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/culture/worlds_oldest_wheel_found_in_slovenia/| archivedate = 14 July 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheels are used in a plethora of vehicles, including motor vehicles, [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, amphibious vehicles, airplanes, trains, skateboards and wheelbarrows.

Nozzles are used in conjunction with almost all reaction engines.&lt;ref name="nozzle"&gt;{{cite web| title = Nozzles| publisher = [[NASA]]| url = http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/nozzle.html| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles using nozzles include jet aircraft, rockets and [[personal watercraft]]. &lt;!--While nozzles are not strictly necessary to produce thrust, they do increase thrust by a great deal.--&gt; While most nozzles take the shape of a cone or [[de Laval nozzle|bell]],&lt;ref name="nozzle"/&gt; some unorthodox designs have been created such as the [[Aerospike engine|aerospike]]. Some nozzles are intangible, such as the electromagnetic field nozzle of a vectored ion thruster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = LTI-20 Flight Dynamics| publisher = Lightcraft Technologies International| url = http://www.lightcrafttechnologies.com/rpi_www/technical/flight_dynamics.html| accessdate = 22 July 2011| quote = The ion thrusters use electromagnetic fields to vector the engine exhaust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Continuous track]] is sometimes used instead of wheels to power land vehicles. Continuous track has the advantages of a larger contact area, easy repairs on small damage, and high maneuverability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Week 04 – Continuous Track| publisher = Military Times| url = http://militarytimes.com/blogs/warrior-made/innovations/continuous-track/| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of vehicles using continuous track are tanks, snowmobiles and excavators. Two continuous tracks used together allow for steering. The largest vehicle in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Biggest (and Hungriest) Machines| publisher = Dark Roasted Blend| url = http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2006/11/biggest-and-hungriest-machines.html| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bagger 288]], is propelled by continuous tracks.

Propellers (as well as screws, fans and rotors) are used to move through a fluid. Propellers have been used as toys since ancient times, however it was [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who devised what was one of the earliest propeller driven vehicles, the "aerial-screw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Early Helicopter Technology| publisher = U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission| url = http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Rotary/early_helicopters/HE1.htm| accessdate = 23 July 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110821031541/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Rotary/early_helicopters/HE1.htm| archive-date = 21 August 2011| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1661, Toogood &amp; Hays adopted the screw for use as a ship propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Brief History of Screw Development| publisher = Rod Sampson – School of Marine Science and Technology, [[Newcastle University]]| format = PDF| page = 10| url = http://research.ncl.ac.uk/cavitation/archive/MAR2010%20-%20propeller%20history.pdf| accessdate = 23 July 2011 |date=5 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the propeller has been tested on many terrestrial vehicles, including the [[Schienenzeppelin]] train and numerous cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cars with Propellers: an Illustrated Overview| publisher = Dark Roasted Blend| url = http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2008/12/cars-with-propellers-essential.html| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, propellers are most prevalent on watercraft and aircraft, as well as some amphibious vehicles such as hovercraft and [[ground effect vehicle]]s. Intuitively, propellers cannot work in space as there is no working fluid, however some sources have suggested that since [[vacuum state|space is never empty]], a propeller could be made to work in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Vacuum Propellers| author = [[John Walker (programmer)|John Walker]]| publisher = Fourmilab Switzerland| url = http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/vprop/| accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to propeller vehicles, some vehicles use wings for propulsion. Sailboats and sailplanes are propelled by the forward component of lift generated by their sails/wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How Sailboats Move in the Water| work = [[HowStuffWorks]]| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/water-sports/sailboat3.htm| accessdate = 2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Three Forces on a Glider| work = [[NASA]]| publisher = [[NASA]]| url = http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/glidfor.html| accessdate = 2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ornithopter]]s also produce thrust aerodynamically. Ornithopters with large rounded leading edges produce lift by leading-edge suction forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How It Works| work = Project Ornithopter, [[University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies]]| publisher = Project Ornithopter, [[University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies]]| url = http://www.ornithopter.net/how_it_works_e.html| accessdate = 2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paddle wheels are used on some older watercraft and their reconstructions. These ships were known as [[paddle steamer]]s. Because paddle wheels simply push against the water, their design and construction is very simple. The oldest such ship in scheduled service is the [[Skibladner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Skibladner: the world's oldest paddle steamer| work = [[Skibladner]]| publisher = [[Skibladner]]| url = http://www.skibladner.no/engelsk/index.htm| accessdate = 2 August 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110809043151/http://www.skibladner.no/engelsk/index.htm| archivedate = 9 August 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[pedalo]] boats also use paddle wheels for propulsion.

[[Screw-propelled vehicle]]s are propelled by [[auger (drill)|auger]]-like cylinders fitted with helical flanges. Because they can produce thrust on both land and water, they are commonly used on all-terrain vehicles. The [[ZiL#Models|ZiL-2906]] was a Soviet-designed screw-propelled vehicle designed to retrieve cosmonauts from the Siberian wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Véhicules Insolites (Strange Vehicles)| language = French| author = Jean Pierre Dardinier| publisher = Fédération Française des Groupes de Conservation de Véhicules Militaires| url = http://mvcgfrance.org/vzil.htm| accessdate = 23 July 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111202213122/http://mvcgfrance.org/vzil.htm| archivedate = 2 December 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Friction ===
All or almost all of the useful energy produced by the engine is usually dissipated as friction; so minimising frictional losses is very important in many vehicles. The main sources of friction are [[rolling friction]] and [[drag (physics)|fluid drag]] (air drag or water drag).

Wheels have low bearing friction and pneumatic tyres give low rolling friction. Steel wheels on steel tracks are lower still.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nice |first=Karim |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/tire4.htm |title=HowStuffWorks – How Tires Work |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=19 September 2000 |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aerodynamic drag]] can be reduced by streamlined design features.

Friction is desirable and important in supplying [[traction (engineering)|traction]] to facilitate motion on land. Most land vehicles rely on friction for accelerating, decelerating and changing direction. Sudden reductions in traction can cause loss of control and accidents.

== Control ==

=== Steering ===
{{main|Steering}}
Most vehicles, with the notable exception of railed vehicles, have at least one steering mechanism. Wheeled vehicles steer by angling their front&lt;ref name="steering"/&gt; or rear&lt;ref name="rear_steering"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Reason for Rear-Wheel Steering| work = [[ThrustSSC]] Team| publisher = [[ThrustSSC]] Team| url = http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/Engineering/rearster.html| accessdate = 8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; wheels. The [[B-52 Stratofortress]] has a special arrangement in which all four main wheels can be angled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = B-52 Stratofortress Design| work = Globalsecurity.org| publisher = Globalsecurity.org| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-52-design.htm| accessdate = 8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skids can also be used to steer by angling them, as in the case of a [[snowmobile]]. Ships, boats, submarines, [[dirigible]]s and aeroplanes usually have a [[rudder]] for steering. On an airplane, [[aileron]]s are used to [[Banked turn|bank]] the airplane for directional control, sometimes assisted by the rudder.

=== Stopping ===
{{main|Brake}}
With no power applied, most vehicles come to a stop due to [[friction]]. But it is often required to stop a vehicle faster than by friction alone: so almost all vehicles are equipped with a braking system. Wheeled vehicles are typically equipped with friction brakes, which use the friction between brake pads (stators) and brake rotors to slow the vehicle.&lt;ref name="regenerative"/&gt; Many airplanes have high performance versions of the same system in their [[landing gear]] for use on the ground. A [[Boeing 757]] brake, for example, has 3 stators and 4 rotors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Flight Crew Training Manual – Brake Units| work = [[Boeing]]| publisher = Biggles-Software| url = http://www.biggles-software.com/software/757_tech/landing_gear/brake_units.htm| accessdate = 7 August 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110510170416/http://www.biggles-software.com/software/757_tech/landing_gear/brake_units.htm| archive-date = 10 May 2011| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle]] also uses frictional brakes on its wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Landing gear system| date = 31 August 2000| publisher = [[NASA]]| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-gear.html| accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as frictional brakes, hybrid/electric cars, trolleybuses and electric bicycles can also use regenerative brakes to recycle some of the vehicle's potential energy.&lt;ref name="regenerative"/&gt; High-speed trains sometimes use frictionless [[Eddy-current brake]]s; however widespread application of the technology has been limited by overheating and interference issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Eddy-current braking: a long road to success| author = Jennifer Schykowski| date = 2 June 2008| newspaper = Railway Gazette| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-gear.html| accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from landing gear brakes, most large aircraft have other ways of decelerating. In aircraft, [[air brake (aircraft)|air brakes]] are aerodynamic surfaces that create friction, with the air flow causing the vehicle to slow. These are usually implemented as flaps that oppose air flow when extended and are flush with aircraft when retracted. [[Reverse thrust]] is also used in many aeroplane engines. Propeller aircraft achieve reverse thrust by reversing the pitch of the propellers, while jet aircraft do so by redirecting their engine exhaust forwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Thrust Reversing| work = [[Purdue University]]| publisher = [[Purdue University]]| url = https://engineering.purdue.edu/~propulsi/propulsion/jets/basics/reverse.html| accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[arresting gear]]s are used to stop an aircraft. Pilots may even apply full forward throttle on touchdown, in case the arresting gear does not catch and a go around is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How to land a jet plane on an aircraft carrier| author = ring_wraith| publisher = [[Everything2]]| url = http://everything2.com/title/How+to+land+a+jet+plane+on+an+aircraft+carrier| accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parachute]]s are used to slow down vehicles travelling very fast. Parachutes have been used in land, air and space vehicles such as the [[ThrustSSC]], [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and [[Apollo Command Module]]. Some older Soviet passenger jets had braking parachutes for emergency landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Aircraft Museum – Tu-124| work = Aerospaceweb.org| publisher = Aerospaceweb.org| url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/tu124/| accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boats use similar devices called [[sea anchor]]s to maintain stability in rough seas.

To further increase the rate of deceleration or where the brakes have failed, several mechanisms can be used to stop a vehicle. Cars and [[rolling stock]] usually have [[parking brake|hand brakes]] that, while designed to secure an already parked vehicle, can provide limited braking should the primary brakes fail. &lt;!--The [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] 1C was designed to use aerodynamic drag from its landing gear in conjunction with reverse thrust to slow the aircraft while still in flight. GOING TO LOOK FOR REF IN BOOKS--&gt;A secondary procedure called [[Forward slip|forward-slip]] is sometimes used to slow airplanes by flying at an angle, causing more drag.

== Legislation ==
Motor vehicle and trailer categories are defined according to the following international classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/rf/DEFINITION_OF_VEHICLE_CATEGORIES.pdf |title=ACEA.be |publisher=ACEA.be |date= |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221224651/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/rf/DEFINITION_OF_VEHICLE_CATEGORIES.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Category M: passenger vehicles.
* Category N: motor vehicles for the carriage of goods.
* Category O: [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] and semi-trailers.

=== European Union ===
In the European Union the classifications for vehicle types are defined by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/s06021.htm |title=Scadplus: Technical Harmonisation For Motor Vehicles |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=8 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015125920/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/s06021.htm |archive-date=15 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2002 relating to the type-approval of two or three wheeled motor vehicles and repealing Council Directive 92/61/EEC

European Community, is based on the Community's WVTA (whole vehicle type-approval) system. Under this system, manufacturers can obtain certification for a vehicle type in one Member State if it meets the EC technical requirements and then market it EU-wide with no need for further tests. Total technical harmonization already has been achieved in three vehicle categories (passenger cars, motorcycles, and tractors) and soon will extend to other vehicle categories ([[Coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and [[utility vehicle]]s). It is essential that European car manufacturers be ensured access to as large a market as possible.

While the Community type-approval system allows manufacturers to benefit fully from internal market opportunities, worldwide technical harmonization in the context of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ([[UNECE]]) offers a market beyond European borders.

=== Licensing ===

In many cases, it is unlawful to operate a vehicle without a license or certification. The least strict form of regulation usually limits what passengers the driver may carry or prohibits them completely (e.g., a Canadian [[Ultralight aviation|ultra-light]] license without endorsements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Transport Canada]] |date=1 June 2010 |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/regserv/cars/part4-401-1073.htm |title=Canadian Aviation Regulations, Part IV – Personnel Licensing and Training, Subpart 1 – Flight Crew Permits, Licences and Ratings |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104223559/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/regserv/cars/part4-401-1073.htm |archive-date=4 January 2012 |access-date=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next level of licensing may allow passengers, but without any form of compensation or payment. A private driver's license usually has these conditions. Commercial licenses that allow the transport of passengers and cargo are more tightly regulated. The most strict form of licensing is generally reserved for school buses, [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] transports and emergency vehicles.

The driver of a motor vehicle is typically required to hold a valid [[driver's license]] while driving on public lands, whereas the pilot of an aircraft must have a license at all times, regardless of where in the jurisdiction the aircraft is flying.

=== Registration ===

Vehicles are often required to be registered. Registration may be for purely legal reasons, for insurance reasons or to help law enforcement recover stolen vehicles. [[Toronto Police Service]], for example, offers free and optional bicycle registration online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webapp1.torontopolice.on.ca/BicycleRegistry/Submit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720184408/https://webapp1.torontopolice.on.ca/BicycleRegistry/Submit |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 21 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On motor vehicles, registration often takes the form of a [[vehicle registration plate]], which makes it easy to identify a vehicle. In [[Russia]], trucks and buses have their licence plate numbers repeated in large black letters on the back.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On aircraft, a similar system is used where a [[Aircraft registration|tail number]] is painted on various surfaces. Like motor vehicles and aircraft, watercraft also have registration numbers in most jurisdictions, however the vessel name is still the primary means of identification &lt;!-- yes I will get into more detail / proof whatever gimme some time here--&gt; as has been the case since ancient times. For this reason, duplicate registration names are generally rejected. In [[Canada]], boats with an engine power of {{convert|10|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} or greater require registration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/boats/pleasurecraft.shtml|title=Retrieved 2011-07-21|publisher=Servicecanada.gc.ca|date=|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323103828/http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/boats/pleasurecraft.shtml|archivedate=23 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the ubiquitous "{{convert|9.9|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}}" engine.

=== Mandatory safety equipment ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
In many jurisdictions, the operator of a vehicle is legally obligated to carry safety equipment with or on them. Common examples include seat belts in cars, helmets on motorcycles and bicycles, fire extinguishers on boats, buses and airplanes and life jackets on boats and commercial aircraft. Passenger aircraft carry a great deal of safety equipment including inflatable slides are rafts, oxygen masks, oxygen tanks, life jackets, satellite beacons and first aid kits. Some equipment such as life jackets has led to debate regarding their usefulness. In the case of [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961]], the life jackets saved many people but also led to many deaths when passengers inflated their vests prematurely.

== Right-of-way ==

There are specific real-estate arrangements made to allow vehicles to travel from one place to another. The most common such arrangements are public highways, where appropriately licensed vehicles can navigate without hindrance. These highways are on public land and are maintained by the government. Similarly, toll routes are open to the public after paying a toll. These routes and the land they rest on may be government or privately owned or a combination of both. Some routes are privately owned but grant access to the public. These routes often have a warning sign stating that the government does not maintain the way. An example of this are [[byway (road)|byways]] in [[England and Wales]]. In [[Scotland]], land is open to un-motorised vehicles if the land meets [[Rights of way in Scotland|certain criteria]]. Public land is sometimes open to use by [[off-road vehicle]]s. On US [[public land]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) decides where vehicles may be used. Railways often pass over land not owned by the railway company. The right to this land is granted to the railway company through mechanisms such as [[easement]]. Watercraft are generally allowed to navigate public waters without restriction as long as they do not cause a disturbance. Passing through a [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]], however, may require paying a toll. Despite the [[common law]] tradition ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' of owning all the air above one's property, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled that aircraft in the US have [[Air rights|the right]] to use air above someone else's property without their consent. While the same rule generally applies in all jurisdictions, some countries such as Cuba and Russia have taken advantage of air rights on a national level to earn money.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news| title = Russia 'Blackmails' Lufthansa over Cargo Hubs| author = Daryl Lindsey| url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,515032,00.html| newspaper = Spiegel Online| date = 2 November 2007| accessdate = 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some areas that aircraft are barred from overflying. This is called [[prohibited airspace]]. Prohibited airspace is usually strictly enforced due to potential damage from espionage or attack. In the case of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], the airliner entered prohibited airspace over [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territory and was shot down as it was leaving.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

== Safety ==
For a comparison of transportation fatality rates, see: [[Air safety#Statistics|Air safety statistics]].

Several different metrics used to compare and evaluate the safety of different vehicles. The main three are ''deaths per billion passenger-journeys'', ''deaths per billion passenger-hours'' and ''deaths per billion passenger-kilometers''.

[[File:«Մենք ենք, մեր լեռները»4.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the 2013 reconstruction-revitalisation of the monument]]
"'''We Are Our Mountains'''" ({{lang-hy|Մենք ենք, մեր լեռները}}, {{lang|hy-Latn|Menk' enk' mer lernerə}}) is a large monument north of [[Stepanakert]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Holding, ''Armenia with Nagorno Karabagh,'' 2nd ed. (London: Bradt, 2006; {{ISBN|1-84162-163-3}}), p.210.&lt;/ref&gt; the capital city of the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Artsakh]] (which was initially named Nagorno-Karabakh).

The sculpture, completed in 1967 by [[Sargis Baghdasaryan]], is widely regarded as a symbol of the Armenian heritage of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The monument is made from volcanic [[tuff|tufa]] and depicts an [[Old age|old]] [[man]] and [[woman]] hewn from rock, representing the mountain people of [[Karabakh]]. It is also known as "'''tatik-papik'''" (տատիկ-պապիկ) in Armenian, which translates as "'''Grandma and Grandpa'''". The sculpture is prominent in [[Coat of arms of the Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh's coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haut-karabagh.com/?p=163 Coat of Arms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurovision image controversy==
The use of the monument during a video clip preceding a performance at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]] was the first of several political conflicts during the competition surrounding [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The conflict stemmed from an introductory "postcard" video played before Armenia's performance in a semi-final round, which depicted the monument alongside other symbols of Armenia. Representatives from Azerbaijan complained to the [[European Broadcasting Union]] about the use of "We Are Our Mountains" in the Armenian intro, since the territory of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] is ''[[de jure]]'' part of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="meltingpot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/content/Eurovision_A_MeltingPot_Contest_Where_Native_Doesnt_Always_Mean_Best/1732594.html|title=Eurovision: A Melting-Pot Contest, Where Native Doesn't Always Mean Best|last=Deasy|first=Kristin|date=2009-05-15|publisher=''[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]''|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the complaint, the image was edited out of the video in the finals. However, Armenia retaliated for the decision by including multiple images of the monument in its voting presentation&amp;mdash;on a video screen in the background, and on the back of their spokesperson, [[Sirusho|Sirusho's]], clipboard.&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/festering_wounds_overshadow_eurovision_in_the_south_caucasus |title=Ethnic rivalry wins over kitsch in the Caucasus |last=Krikorian |first=Onnik |date=2009-05-16 |publisher=''[[Frontline Club]]'' |accessdate=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''We Know the Devil''''' is a [[visual novel]] developed and published by [[Date Nighto]]. It was released on September 12, 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MacOS]]. It received a release on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on February 15, 2016.

The game was positively received by critics, who cited its distinctive art style and themes.

== Gameplay ==
The game allows for little player interaction beyond making choices to decide how the game's story will progress. The choices generally involve deciding which pair of characters will perform a certain action, while the other stays behind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.darkstation.com/reviews/we-know-the-devil/|title=We Know the Devil|work=DarkStation|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The game's plot is [[Magic realism|magic realist]], with [[anime]] influences, and takes place at a [[Christian]] [[summer camp]] where misbehaving teenagers are sent to do combat with the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/09/15/we-know-the-devil-is-a-horror.html|title=We Know The Devil is a horror game about being the odd friend out|website=[[Boing Boing]]|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main characters are named [[Neptune]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://datenighto.com/game/we-know-the-devil|title=We Know the Devil - Date Nighto - Visual Novels in Your Browser|website=datenighto.com|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are sent to a cabin in the woods overnight to confront the Devil, who, along with [[God]], can be spoken to over the [[radio]]. The ending can change depending on who has a relationship with whom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In three of the endings, the character who was most excluded becomes the Devil and is transformed into a monstrous form.&lt;ref name="marysue"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smit|first1=Alexander|title=We Know The Devil: Adolescence Apocalypse|url=https://www.themarysue.com/we-know-the-devil-visual-novel-is-an-adolescence-apocalypse/|website=[[The Mary Sue]]|date=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an equal amount of time is spent with each character, the fourth ending is unlocked, in which all three choose to become the Devil.&lt;ref name="waypoint"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unkle|first1=Jennifer|title='We Know the Devil' Taught Me to Be Proud|url=https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/4x5jzd/we-know-the-devil-taught-me-to-be-proud|website=Waypoint|publisher=[[Vice Media]]|date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[narration]] switches from [[Gender in English#Transgender persons|male to female pronouns]] for Venus, as she comes to terms with her identity as a [[transgender]] girl.{{r|marysue}}{{r|waypoint}}

== Development ==
The game's writer, Aevee Bee, stated that the game was created with three main characters in order to explore how, in the process of creating friendships, other bonds must also be weakened to do so.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/258439/The_Fragility_and_Pain_of_Friendship_in_We_Know_the_Devil.php|title=The Fragility and Pain of Friendship in We Know the Devil|last=Couture|first=Joel|website=[[Gamasutra]]|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game itself, while two characters can form a close relationship, one character must always be left out.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was intended to be a difficult choice in order to parallel real life, where everyone is equally deserving of attention and natural closeness is what draws people together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The game's main characters were influenced by the Sailor Scouts of ''[[Sailor Moon]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/sailor-moon-devil-horror-story-about-internet-queerdom/|title=It's Sailor Moon vs. the Devil in this horror story about pre-internet queerdom - Kill Screen|date=2015-10-08|work=[[Kill Screen]]|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong female role models and explicit gay relationships" of the series made it a "rallying point" for "young queer women of the 90's", making it a foil for the stifling rural, religious setting that forces the characters to hide their sexuality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The game was made available on Date Nighto for [[666 (number)#Number of the Beast|$6.66]]. The developers attempted to set the same price for it on Steam, but were unable to due to Steam's price brackets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grayson|first1=Nathan|title=Why A Game About The Devil Couldn't Sell For $6.66 On Steam|url=https://steamed.kotaku.com/why-a-game-about-the-devil-couldnt-sell-for-6-66-on-st-1759316115|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[game demo|demo]] was released on March 19, 2017 through [[itch.io]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Know the Devil by pillowfight|url=https://pillowfight.itch.io/we-know-the-devil|website=itch.io}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Dylan Jones of DarkStation scored the game 100/100, saying that "its greatest strengths stem from its eerie atmosphere" and "terrifically deep lead characters", and comparing its setting to that of ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''whitehead''' (''Mohoua albicilla''; Māori: ''pōpokotea'') is a small species (15&amp;nbsp;cm in length, 18.5/14.5 g.&lt;ref name="FGB"&gt;Barrie Heather and Hugh Robertson, ''"The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand" (revised edition)'', Viking, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[passerine]] bird [[endemism|endemic]] to [[New Zealand]]. It is classified in the family [[Mohoua|Mohouidae]]. The male whitehead's upperparts, wings and tail are a pale brown in colour, while the head and underparts are white – in the case of the male an almost pure white in colour. Females and juveniles have similar colouration except that the [[nape]] and crown (top of the head) are shaded brown.&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGBNZ"&gt;R.A Falla, R.B. Sibson and E.G. Turbott, ''" The new guide to the Birds of New Zealand"'', Collins, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The black [[beak]] and eyes contrast with the white head and the feet are bluish black in colouration.

Formerly quite common and widespread in native forests in the [[North Island]], the whitehead has suffered a marked decline in the past two centuries since European colonisation and today is restricted to a fraction of its former range. Historically, [[deforestation]] has destroyed large areas of habitat for this species but today the greatest threat is from predation by [[invasive species|invasive mammalian species]] such as [[rat]]s and [[stoat]]s. It has been the subject of an active conservation campaign and has been successfully reintroduced into reserves near [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] respectively. In the past whiteheads held a special place in Māori culture. As well as the species appearing in many legends, whiteheads were viewed by Māori to have roles as messengers of the gods and as fortune tellers or [[Clairvoyance|seer]]s – and because of these beliefs, live birds were caught and used in several different kinds of ceremonial rites.

==Habitat and distribution ==

The [[range (biology)|range]] of this species has always been restricted to the [[North Island]] of New Zealand, as well as several offshore islands surrounding it, including [[Little Barrier Island]] (where it is the most common forest bird),&lt;ref name="GG"&gt;Gill,B.J. and G. Maclean, Ian, ''"Morphometrics of the whitehead Mohoua albicilla on Little Barrier Island, New Zealand"'', New Zealand Journal of Zoology, 1986, volume 13:267–271&lt;/ref&gt; [[Great Barrier Island]] and [[Kapiti Island]];&lt;ref name="BNZ"/&gt; it has however, contracted markedly since the 19th century due to a number of human induced factors (see the Conservation section below). The distributions of the whitehead and its close relative, the yellowhead are [[allopatric]], with the range of the yellowhead being restricted to the [[South Island]]. Whiteheads are generally restricted to the larger tracts of older scrub and native forest that remain in the North Island but have proven their adaptability by establishing populations in a number of exotic pine plantations, particularly on the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau]].&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGBNZ"/&gt;

==Ecology and behaviour==
When encountered whiteheads often display [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behaviour. The flocks generally consist of small family groups.&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt;

=== Feeding ===
[[Image:Whitehead-Roger-South.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Whitehead, ''Mohoua albicilla''&lt;ref&gt;Photo by [https://flickr.com/photos/33852082@N00 Roger South]&lt;/ref&gt;]]The diet of whiteheads is primarily [[insectivorous]] in nature – they are classed as [[arboreal]] insectivores.&lt;ref&gt;John Dawson and Rob Lucas,"''The Nature Guide to the New Zealand Forest''", Godwit, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Their main prey are spiders, moths, caterpillars and beetles&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt; which are [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaned]] from tree trunks, leaves and branches in the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] and [[subcanopy]]. They rarely feed on the forest floor.&lt;ref name="NGBNZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BNZ"&gt;Chloe Talbot Kelly,''" Collins handguide to the Birds of New Zealand"'', Collins, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; They will supplement their predominantly insectivorous diet with the fruits of native plants such as [[Melicytus ramiflorus|māhoe]] and matipo and like the [[Yellowhead (bird)|yellowhead]], they frequently hang upside down from branches or twigs while feeding. Whiteheads will often form [[mixed-species feeding flock]]s with [[tieke|saddleback]]s, [[kākāriki]] or [[silvereye]]s to catch the insects these birds dislodge as they feed.&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Unlike the yellowhead, which nests only in the cavities of tree trunks which are generally high up in the canopy, the whitehead builds a more conventional cup shaped nest at a height between 1 and 15 metres above the ground; either in the canopy of the forest or lower down in smaller trees or shrubs.&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt; Between 2–4 [[bird egg|eggs]] of variable colouration are laid, the [[incubation period]] is generally around 18 days and fledging takes a further 16–19, the chicks being fed by both parents.&lt;ref name="NGBNZ"/&gt; In November and December, the [[long-tailed cuckoo]] frequently acts as a [[brood parasite]] of nesting whiteheads by pushing their eggs out of the nest and laying a single egg of its own in their place&lt;ref name="HCNZB"&gt;F.C. Kinsky, C.J.R. Robertson, illustrated by Janet Marshall, ''" Handbook of common birds of New Zealand"'', Reed Methuen, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WNZB"&gt;Andrew Crowe, illustrated by David Gunson, ''"Which New Zealand bird?"'', Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whiteheads and humans==

=== Place in Māori culture; legends and ceremonial rites ===
In times past, the whitehead held a special place within [[Māori culture]] among the forest birds of New Zealand. They featured not only in [[Māori mythology|Māori folklore]] and legends but also in a number of rites for which live individuals were captured.&lt;ref name="MBL"&gt;Murdoch Riley, "'’Māori Bird Lore; An Introduction''", Viking Sevenseas Ltd., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Flocks of whiteheads form part of the [[hākuturi]], a multitude of small birds sometimes called ''Te Tini o te Hākuturi'' – "The myriads of Hākuturi", the spirit guardians of the forest. In a [[Ngāti Mahuta]] story, the culture hero [[Rātā (Māori mythology)|Rata]] went into the forest and cut down a tree to make a canoe, but failed to perform the proper placatory rites to [[Tāne]], god of the forest. Whiteheads and [[Rifleman (bird)|riflemen]] whistled shrilly at him in admonishment and gathered together the pieces of the tree until it stood whole again. This happened several times until Rata showed remorse and the birds felled the tree and made the canoe for him.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; In some stories, the whitehead was one of several small birds chosen by [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]] to accompany him in his (ultimately unsuccessful and fatal) quest to abolish death by killing [[Hine-nui-te-pō]], the goddess of night and death.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; The mobbing behaviour sometimes seen in whiteheads is reflected in one legend which tells of swarms of whiteheads scratching out the eyes of [[Whaitiri]], goddess of thunder, as they pass her house, thus causing her to go blind.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt;

[[Image:Mohoua albicilla.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Whitehead on Tiritiri Matangi Island]]

The whitehead, as a messenger between man and the gods, was a very ''tapu'' (sacred) bird.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; This status was reflected in its role in the tohi rite, a ritual performed over an infant. This entailed a [[tohunga]] touching the head of an infant with a live whitehead and reciting a ''[[karakia]]'' (incantation) firstly to cause the ''mana'' (power and prestige) of the gods to descend on the child from the gods and secondly to open the child's eyes and ears to the knowledge of the ancestors.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; After the karakia was complete the bird was freed to demonstrate that the mana received would return to the gods when the child died. The whitehead also held this role as a messenger to the gods when a new ''[[Pā (Māori)|pā]]'' (fortified village) was dedicated. Once the ceremonies were complete a single whitehead was released unharmed, the pā became free of tapu, and could be safely entered. The purpose of this rite was to bring prosperity and vitality to the pā and its people in times of war and peace.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; When a candidate was applying to a senior tohunga to become a ''matakite'', or seer, he had first to catch a small bird such as a whitehead. After more ritual the applicant was shut in a hut to sleep with the bird for a night. Next morning he opened the door and if the bird flew away of its own accord, his suitability to be a seer, as indeed the whitehead was regarded to be, was confirmed.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; In the past, the appearance of a flock of whiteheads was interpreted by Māori from the upper regions of the [[Whanganui River]] as a sign that kēhua (ghosts) were nearby&lt;ref name="WNZB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elsdon Best, ''"Forest Lore of the Maori"'', [[Te Papa Press]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===In general New Zealand culture===
19th-century forestry workers (bushmen) regarded the whitehead as a useful forecaster of the weather: "They kept up a lively chirping some hours before an approaching storm. It was a warning which the bushmen never allowed to pass unnoticed".&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Harper, 1896, ''"Pioneer work in the Alps"'', T. Fisher unwin, London&lt;/ref&gt; Colonists called this bird "Joey whitehead" for its distinctive head colouration.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; This is the origin of the English-language name of the bird.

=== Threats and Conservation ===

[[Subfossil]] remains of whiteheads have been found on the North Island&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt; and the species was still very widespread when European settlement of New Zealand began in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt; However, soon after, they began to decline as a result of both the widespread clearance of lowland forests for agriculture&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt; and the predation by several species of mammalian predators introduced by Europeans, including several species of [[rodent]]s and [[mustelid]]s. Such [[introduced species]] remain a problem for many whitehead populations today, as they both compete with them for food and prey upon the birds themselves. As a result, the species has experienced local extinctions of many of its populations throughout the North Island, particularly in its northern regions; whiteheads disappeared from [[Northland Region|Northland]] in the 1870s and from the greater [[Auckland]] area in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="FGB"/&gt; They also disappeared from [[Great Barrier Island]] in the 1950s.

In an effort to restore this species to its former range, a number of conservation reintroductions have been carried out in the last twenty years. All these reintroductions were carried out as part of wider efforts towards eco-restoration at each of the native forest sites concerned.

Due to the northern North Island local extinctions, whiteheads were, until recently, extinct on the mainland of the North Island north of about [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]. However, this situation has been rectified by 3 of the above releases in the Hunua Ranges, Waitakere Ranges and on Tiritiri Matangi Island. The Karori and Tiritiri Matangi reintroductions were done independently while the Hunua reintroduction was an [[Auckland Regional Council]] initiative. The Auckland Regional Council also played a part in the Waitakere Ranges ''"Ark in the Park"'' project release  – the project is a joint effort being a joint effort between this local government body and the NZ conservation not for profit NGO [[Forest and Bird]].

: ''This is a page about the French subculture. For the French musician, see [[Hector Zazou]]
The '''zazous''' were a [[subculture]] in [[France]] during [[World War II]]. They were young people expressing their individuality by wearing big or garish clothing (similar to the [[zoot suit]] fashion in [[United States|America]] a few years before) and dancing wildly to [[swing jazz]] and [[bebop]]. Men wore large striped lumber jackets, while women wore short skirts, striped stockings and heavy shoes, and often carried umbrellas.

==Origins of the movement==
During the German occupation of France, the [[Vichy State|Vichy]] regime, which collaborated with the Nazi occupiers, had an ultra-conservative morality and started to use a whole range of laws against a youth that was restless and disenchanted. These young people expressed their resistance and nonconformity through aggressive dance competitions, sometimes against soldiers from the occupying forces.

The Zazous were to be found throughout France, but were most concentrated in [[Paris]]. The two most important meeting places of the Zazous were the terrace of the Pam Pam cafe on the [[Champs-Élysées]] and the Boul’Mich (the [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]] near the [[Sorbonne]]).

The Zazous of the Champs Elysées came from a more middle-class background and were older than the Zazous of the Latin Quarter. The Champs Elysées Zazous were easily recognisable on the terrace of the Pam Pam and took afternoon bike rides in the [[Bois de Boulogne]]. In the [[Latin Quarter]], the Zazous met in the cellar clubs of Dupont-Latin or the Capoulade.

==Characteristics==
The male Zazous wore extra large jackets, which hung down to their knees and which were fitted out with many pockets and often several half-belts. The amount of material used was a direct comment on Government decrees on the rationing of clothing material. Their trousers were narrow, gathered at the waist, and so were their ties, which were cotton or heavy wool. The shirt collars were high and kept in place by a horizontal pin. They liked thick-soled suede shoes, with white or brightly coloured socks. Their hairstyles were greased and long. Many ''Zazous'' liked to dress in the ''style anglais'' with umbrellas (seen as a symbol of Britishness in France) a popular fashion accessory and their hair done up ''á la mode d'Oxford'' , had a fondness for speaking to each in English as it was more "cool" and loved British and American popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Willett, Ralph "Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939-49" pages 157-163 from ''Popular Music'', Volume 8, No. 2, May 1989 page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The French writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]] described the ''Zazou'' look in 1942 as "the young men wore dirty drape suits with 'drainpipe' trousers under their sheep-skinned lined jackets and brillianted liberally their long hair, the girls favored tight roll-collar sweaters with short flared skirts and wooden platform shoes, sported dark glasses with big lenses, put on heavy make-up and went bare-headed to show their dyed hair, set off by a lock of a different hue".&lt;ref&gt;Willett, Ralph "Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939-49" pages 157-163 from ''Popular Music'', Volume 8, No. 2, May 1989 page 159 &lt;/ref&gt;

Female Zazous wore their hair in curls falling down to their shoulders, or in braids. Blonde was the favourite colour, and they wore bright red lipstick, as well as sunglasses, also favoured by some male Zazous. They wore jackets with extremely wide shoulders and short, pleated skirts. Their stockings were striped or sometimes net, and they wore shoes with thick wooden soles.

In his autobiography, [[Christian Dior]] wrote of the style:

"Hats were far too large, skirts far too short, jackets far too long, shoes far too heavy... I have no doubt that this ''zazou'' style originated in a desire to defy the forces of occupation and the austerity of Vichy.  For lack of other materials, feathers and veils, promoted to the dignity of flags, floated through Paris like revolutionary banners.  But as a fashion I found it repellent."&lt;ref&gt;Christian Dior, "Dior By Dior" {{ISBN|9781851778690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zazous were big fans of checkered patterns, on jacket, skirt or brolly. They started appearing in the vegetarian restaurants and developed a passion for grated [[carrot salad]]. They usually drank fruit juice or beer with [[grenadine]] syrup, a cocktail that they seem to have{{Weasel-inline|date=September 2010}} invented.

The Zazous were numbered in the hundreds rather than thousands and were generally between 17 and 20. There were Zazous from all classes, races, and both sexes but with apparently similar outlooks. Working class Zazous used theft of cloth and black market activities to get their outfits, sometimes stitching their own clothes. Some of the more bohemian Zazous in the Latin Quarter varied the outfit, with sheepskin jackets and multicoloured scarves. It was their ironic and sarcastic comments on the Nazi/Vichy rulers, their dandyism and hedonism, their suspicion of the work ethic and their love of ‘decadent’ jazz that distinguished them as one of the prototype youth movements questioning society.

While they did not suffer like their contemporaries in Germany, the Hamburg and Berlin based [[Swing Kids|Swingjugend]] (many of whom were imprisoned in concentration camps) and the working class, mostly Cologne based [[Edelweiss Pirates]] (some of whom were hanged by the Nazis), the Zazou subculture represented an important dissident minority in a society of widespread complicity and acquiescence.

=="Syncopated"==
One fascist magazine commented on the male Zazou, "Here is the specimen of Ultra Swing 1941: hair hanging down to the neck, teased up into an untidy quiff, little moustache à la [[Clark Gable]]... shoes with too-thick soles, syncopated walk."

The Zazous were directly inspired by jazz and swing music. A healthy black jazz scene had sprung up in [[Montmartre]] in the inter-war years. Black Americans felt freer in Paris than they did back home, and the home-grown jazz scene was greatly reinforced by this immigration. [[Manouche]] [[Romani people|Gypsy]] musicians like [[Django Reinhardt]] started playing swinging jazz music in the Paris clubs.

The Zazous probably got their name from a line in a song – Zah Zuh Zah by the black jazz musician [[Cab Calloway]],&lt;ref name="delli" /&gt; famous for his ''[[Minnie the Moocher]]''. [[Johnny Hess]], a French crooner popular with the Zazous, released ''Je suis swing'' in early 1942, in which he sang the lines "Za zou, za zou, za zou, za zou ze", selling more units than any previously released record in France.&lt;ref name="portis"&gt;{{Cite book| title = French Frenzies: A Social History of Pop Music in France | author = Larry Portis | editor = [[Virtualbookworm Publishing]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-58939-547-6 | pages = 96–97 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QNi4KH0yYYgC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=zazou+subculture#PPA97,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An associate of the Zazous, the anarchist singer/songwriter, jazz trumpeter, poet and novelist [[Boris Vian]] was also extremely fond of z words in his work. The long drape jacket was also copied from [[zoot suit]]s worn by the likes of Calloway.&lt;ref name="delli"&gt;{{Cite book| title = All my jazz: figures et accords majeurs | author = Julien Delli Fiori | editor = [[Le Cavalier Bleu]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 2-84670-140-7 | page = 164 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3rPF5qHsxhcC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=zazou+calloway | quote = it was an imitation of the scene uniform of Cab Calloway, and Zazou comes from his song "Zaz zuh zaz" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Zazous were very obviously detested by the Nazis, who on the other side of the Rhine, had [for] a long time decimated the German cultural avant garde, forbidden jazz and all visible signs of...degenerations of Germanic culture…" (Pierre Seel, who, as a young Zazou, was deported to a German concentration camp because of his homosexuality.)

When the [[yellow badge|yellow star]] was forced on Jews, non-Jews who objected began to wear yellow stars with ‘Zazu’, ‘Goy’ (Gentile) or ‘Swing’.

==Antagonism during the War==
Vichy had started ‘Youth Worksites’ in July 1940, in what Zazous perceived as an attempt to indoctrinate French youth. As in 1870-1, France reacted to her shattering defeat by reforming existing institutions and creating new ones. The Vichy regime was very concerned about the education, moral fibre and productivity of French youth. In 1940 a Ministry of Youth was established. They saw the Zazous as a rival and dangerous influence on youth.

In 1940, 78 anti-Zazou articles were published in the press, a further nine in 1941 and 38 in 1943. The Vichy papers deplored the moral turpitude and decadence that was affecting French morality. Zazous were seen as work-shy, egotistical and Judeo-Gaullist shirkers.

By 1942 the Vichy regime realised that the national revival that they hoped would be carried out by young people under their guidance was seriously affected by widespread rejection of the patriotism, work ethic, self-denial, asceticism and masculinity this called for.

Soon, round-ups began in bars and Zazous were beaten on the street. They became Enemy Number One of the fascist youth organisations, [[Jeunesse Populaire Française]]. "Scalp the Zazous!" became their slogan. Squads of young JPF fascists armed with hairclippers attacked Zazous. Many were arrested and sent to the countryside to work on the harvest.

At this point the Zazous went underground, holing up in their dance halls and basement clubs. The Zazous were suspected by the official Communist resistance of having an apathetic, even flippant attitude to the war in general.
