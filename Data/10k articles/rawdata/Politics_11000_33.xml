The '''Alliance for Europe of the Nations''' was a [[European political party|pan-European political party]] that gathered [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[national conservatism|national-conservative]] political parties from across the continent.

==History==
The AEN was founded in 2002, designed to complement the existing [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] [[Political groups of the European Parliament|group in the European Parliament]].  Moves towards establishing standardised funding block grants for European political parties were at this point well afoot, and the parties affiliated with UEN required a corresponding organisation to take advantage of them.

Almost immediately upon its founding, the AEN began to decline in terms of membership and influence.  At its first meeting, participants included the Czech [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]], Portuguese [[Democratic and Social Centre – People's Party|CDS-PP]], Israeli [[Likud]], Irish [[Fianna Fáil]], Italian [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and the Greek [[Popular Orthodox Rally]],&lt;ref name="EUO6785"&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/6785 "List of Political Parties participating at the A.E.N. meeting on June, 25th - 26th 2002"] 25 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; all of which later left the organisation.

The AEN had a broadly national-conservative political line, but many members were uncomfortable with this. There was a strong movement for the [[centrism|centrist]] [[Fianna Fáil]] to leave AEN and join the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]], which it did on 17 April 2009. Also, [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], which despite its [[neo-fascism|post-fascist]] background was a moderate national-conservative party strongly promoting [[European integration]], grew uncomfortable with AEN and left it for the [[European People's Party]] by merging with [[Forza Italia]] to form [[The People of Freedom]] party on 27 March 2009.

MEPs elected from its member-parties were expected to sit in the affiliated [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] (UEN) [[Political groups of the European Parliament|group]] in the [[European Parliament]], but UEN collapsed in 2009 following the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament elections]], and MEPs from AEN member parties were scattered across the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] and [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] groups, and their respective European-level parties, the [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists]] and [[Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy]].

After those realignments, there were too few AEN member parties left to retain its EU-funded status as a [[European political party|political party at European level]]. The AEN's 2009 grant was rescinded.&lt;ref name="EPgrantamounts_2010"&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/grants/grant_amounts_parties.pdf "Grants from the European Parliament to political parties at European level 2004-2010"], 14 April 2010, from [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The grants from the European Parliament to AEN from 2004-2010 were as follows:&lt;ref name="EPgrantamounts_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EP0408"&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/grants/grant_amounts_parties_2004_2008.pdf "Grants from the European Parliament to political parties at European level 2004-2008"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ansar-e-Hezbollah'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html#Govt ''CIA - The World Factbook''] see the "Government" section, "Political pressure groups and leaders" subsection in the 2006 version&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fa|انصار حزب‌الله|lit=the supporters of the party of God}}) is a [[Iranian Principlists|conservative]] [[paramilitary]] organization in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/iran-evin-prison-ansar-hezbollah-face-sanctions-180531132138656.html Iran's Evin prison, Ansar-e Hezbollah face new US sanctions] May 31, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism, it is a "semi-official quasi-[[Clandestine cell system|clandestine organization]] of a [[paramilitary]] character that performs [[vigilante]] duties".&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;
[[Hossein Allahkaram]], one of the organization's known leaders has described it as "groups of young [[Iran–Iraq War|war]] veterans who, based on their [[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]]-Islamic duty, claim to be carrying out the [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Imam]]'s will and rectifying existing shortcomings in Iran".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Factional Politics in Post-Khomeini Iran|first=Mehdi|last=Moslem |date=2002|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0815629788|page=136}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018, the group was targeted with sanctions by the US for its involvement "in the violent suppression of Iranian citizens" and for working with the [[Basij]] carrying out attacks on student protesters using "knives, tear gas and electric batons".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/iran-evin-prison-ansar-hezbollah-face-sanctions-180531132138656.html Iran's Evin prison, Ansar-e Hezbollah face new US sanctions] May 31, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and status==
{{main|Hezbollah of Iran}}
'''Ansar-e Hizbullah''', or ''Followers of the Party of God'' or more literally ''Helpers of [[Hezbollah of Iran|Hizbullah]]'' in [[Persian language|Persian]], is said to be a semi-official, paramilitary group&lt;ref name="intel" /&gt; formed in 1995.  Unlike some other paramilitary groups, Ansar-e Hizbullah undergoes formal training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/basij_militia/index.html Basij Militia. NYT.com] June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to be financed and protected by many senior government clerics. It is often characterized as a [[wikt:vigilante|vigilante]] group&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/391618.stm Debate hots up in Iranian media] July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; as they use force but are not part of government law enforcement, although it may not meet the strict definition of the word inasmuch as the group pledge loyalty to the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] [[Ali Khamenei]]&lt;ref name="fray" &gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EF19Ak01.html Vigilantes join the fray] June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and is thought to be protected by him.

It has been described as an "offshoot" &lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International. 1997. "Iran: Human Rights Violations Against Shi'a Religious Leaders and Their Followers." London: Amnesty International. (MDE 13/18/97)&lt;/ref&gt; 
or "vigilante associate" of the Iranian [[Hezbollah of Iran|Hezbollah]],&lt;ref&gt;''Middle East International'', 15 Oct. 1999, 23&lt;/ref&gt; 
a loose-knit movement of groups formed at the time of the [[Iranian Revolution]] to assist the Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] and his forces in consolidating power.

===Membership===
Most of the members of Ansar e Hezbollah are either members of the [[Basij]] militias or veterans of the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="intel" &gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/ansar.htm Ansar-i Hizbullah Followers of the Party of God]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Ansar-e-Hezbollah is known for attacking protesters at anti-government demonstrations, in particular during the [[Iran student riots, July 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/027/2004/en/ Injustice and ill treatment]  ''[[Amnesty International]]'' 7 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and is thought to have been behind public physical assaults on two reformist government ministers in Sept. 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/79ddf7f5e0b41a94802566560054f16e?Opendocument Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ansar-e-Hezbollah is thought to have been behind death threats and a "series of physical assaults" on philosopher and ex-hardliner [[Abdolkarim Soroush]] "that left him bruised, battered and often in tattered clothes." &lt;ref&gt;''The Last Great Revolution'' by Robin Wright c2000, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has been associated with a crackdown on "mal-veiling", i.e. the wearing of a [[hejab]] by a woman such that some hair is visible, which has been blamed in Iran for inciting sexual assaults.  They operate ''[[Yalasarat]]'', a newspaper and associated website that explain the official positions of hardliners in the Iranian government on female behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/07/the-hejab-hype-and-the-force-of-fear.html|title=Paint it Black: The Hejab Hype and the Force of Fear|author=CORRESPONDENT|publisher=PBS Frontline|date=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/ansar.htm|title=Ansar-i Hizbullah|publisher=Globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad killing===
A 2000 expose of Ansar-e Hezbollah involved the murder of [[Ezzat Ebrahim-Nejad]]. Ebrahim-Nejad was a university student and poet whose killing by "plain-clothesmen" following a peaceful protest over a newspaper closing was partially responsible for the destructive five-day-long [[Iran student riots, July 1999|Iran student riots]] in July 1999.
In March 2000, human rights lawyer [[Shirin Ebadi]] reports a man by the name of [[Amir Farshad Ebrahimi]] appeared at her office claiming to have 
&lt;blockquote&gt;firsthand information about his comrades who had carried out the attack on the dormitory. He said he belonged to … Ansar-e Hezbollah … and that the group's chief had thrown him in prison for trying to resign from his unit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ebadi made a videotape of Ebrahimi confession in which he claimed that not only had his group been involved in the attack on the dormitory where Ebrahim-Nejad was killed, but that "During the time he was active in the group, he had also been involved in violent attacks on two reformist ministers" in president Khatami's cabinet.&lt;ref name=ebadi&gt;Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, p.160-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardline newspapers reported the existence of the confession, which they called the "Tape makers" case. In a number of inflammatory stories they claimed Ebrahimi was mentally unstable and that Ebadi and another lawyer Rohami had manipulated him into testifying, and in any case confession blemished the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]].&lt;ref name=ebadi/&gt; Ebadi and Rohami were sentenced to five years in jail and suspension of their law licenses for sending Ebrahimi's videotaped deposition to President Khatami. Ebarahimi was sentenced to 48 months jail, including 16 months in solitary confinement.

===2009 Election Protests===

On 18 June 2009 the [[Los Angeles Times]] newspaper reported that "hard-line Ansar-e Hezbollah militiamen warned that they would be patrolling the streets to maintain law and order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-protests19-2009jun19,0,4249713.story|work=Los Angeles Times|first1=Borzou|last1=Daragahi|first2=Ramin|last2=Mostaghim| first3=Kim|last3=Murphy|title=Iran protests continue for fourth day|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Kuratorium pro výchovu mládeže'') was an organization in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] that provided athletic and cultural activities for youth ages ten to 18. Though created at the impetus of officials in the German-backed Protectorate government, it evolved to promote a distinctive form of "Reich-loyal" Czech nationalism that was viewed with concern by some quarters of the [[Nazi Party]]. Following World War II, it was banned as a fascist organization and its principal leaders put on trial.  

==History==
The Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth (or Kuratorium) was established in 1941 partly on the initiative of Colonel [[Emanuel Moravec]] to provide athletic and cultural activities for Czech youth between the ages of ten to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= |first= |date= |title=Tělesná výchova v Kuratoriu pro výchovu mládeže v Čechách a na Moravě (1942–1945) |type=[[doctoral dissertation]] |chapter= |publisher=[[Masaryk University]] |docket= |oclc= |url=https://is.muni.cz/th/213777/fsps_d/?lang=en |access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frommer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frommer|first1=Benjamin|title=National Cleansing: Retribution Against Nazi Collaborators in Postwar Czechoslovakia|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521008964|pages=22, 274|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wobiTHpAXbAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Kuratorium leaders were functionaries or supporters of the [[fascist]] ''[[Vlajka]]'' and [[Livia Rothkirchen]] has characterized its programming as an effort at Nazi indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothkirchen|first1=Livia|title=The Jews of Bohemia and Moravia: Facing the Holocaust|date=2006|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803205023|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hx2xBWN3hX0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tara"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zahra|first1=Tara|title=Kidnapped Souls: National Indifference and the Battle for Children in the Bohemian Lands, 1900–1948|date=2008|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801446287|pages=245-250}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, [[Tara Zahra]] has noted that at the group's camping trips and other retreats for Czech boys and girls a special focus was made in celebrating Czech culture, with ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' informants reporting to the German authorities that a kind-of "Reich-loyal" Czech nationalism was being organically developed by the Kuratorium.&lt;ref name="tara"/&gt; 
[[File:Ceska_mladez.png|thumb|left|150px|Kuratorium fanfare trumpeters pictured at the Week of Czech Youth in 1944.]]
Moravec was chair of the Kuratorium throughout its existence, while the organization was operationally managed by the Czech physician František Teuner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuratorium|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/873537-hledani-ztraceneho-casu/208522161510020-kuratorium/|website=ceskatelevize.cz|publisher=[[Česká televize]]|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, the [[Beneš decrees]] proscribed the Kuratorium as a "fascist organization".&lt;ref name="frommer"/&gt; In 1947, leaders of the Kuratorium were tried over their involvement in the organization, resulting in the conviction of Teuner and seven others: Eduard Chalupa, Jan Svoboda, Josef Victorin, Karel Žalud, Jiri Málek, Vaclav Krigar, Jaroslav Krigar, and Karel Mihaliče.&lt;ref name="frommer"/&gt;
[[File:Concert in Prague organized by the Kuratorium pro výchovu mládeže.ogv|thumb|right|Newsreel footage of a Kuratorium youth concert during the 1944 Week of Czech Youth]]

==Activities==
According to a 1944 report in ''[[The Guardian]]'', the Kuratorium was then putting on "180 theatrical shows a week. In Prague alone its concerts, films, and exhibitions are visited by 13,000 children every day. It has arranged 13 great sports meetings in which 30,000 boys and girls took part. It has taught 80,000 children to swim. Some 200,000 have actively participated in its 'Art for Youth' competition, and 20,000 have been entertained at free holiday camps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schrich|first1=Josef|title=Bringing Up Robots|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/259426838|accessdate=February 27, 2018|page=4|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 19, 1944}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuratorium's nationalist-oriented programming reached a zenith in the summer of 1944 when the "Week of Czech Youth" was staged in [[Prague]], activities during which included thousands of Kuratorium participants attired in [[Czech traditional clothing|Czech national costume]] singing traditional Czech songs.&lt;ref name="tara"/&gt; Observers from the [[Hitler Youth]] came to the conclusion that Kuratorium activities had essentially become nothing more than a continuation of the banned [[Sokol]] movement and were concerned that "Reich-loyal" Czech nationalism would transform into a dangerous "double-edged sword".&lt;ref name="tara"/&gt;  On the one hand, the existence of the Kuratorium showcased Germany's supposed tolerance for Czech institutions and helped educate Czech youth towards an anti-communist worldview, however, on the other hand it severely undermined the ultimate goal of [[Germanisation|Germanizing]] the population of the [[Czech lands]].&lt;ref name="tara"/&gt;

A person who is of '''Cabinet rank''' holds a ministerial position in a government. They sit in [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] and form the highest body of leadership in a government.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[UK]], tradition holds that the top three Ministers after the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] are the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Home Secretary]]. In that order these 4 positions are referred to as the [[Great Offices of State]], the most prestigious positions in government. However the high prestige of these positions has not always run with Cabinet rank. In the modern political era Cabinet rank is often a gift of the Prime Minister who releases a list detailing the seniority of all Cabinet ministers. Sometimes positions that one would not expect to be as high ranking as, say, the post of Foreign Secretary can in fact be placed higher than a Great Office of State. This is best displayed during the premiership of [[Gordon Brown]] when after a reshuffle of his Cabinet [[Peter Mandelson]], the Business Secretary was ranked the 3rd most senior minister out of 23 and outranked all Great Offices of State except the Prime Minister himself.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Just as traditionally lower Cabinet jobs can be placed high so can traditionally higher positions be placed low in the rankings such as when [[Bob Ainsworth]] (then [[Secretary of State for Defence]]) was ranked the 3rd lowest ranking minister in Gordon Brown's Cabinet. {{cn|date=February 2017}}

After the UK General Election of 2010 Cabinet rankings have gone back to a more traditional pattern, with the highest ranking ministers being those holding the Great Offices of State and holding quite important posts, for example the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. {{cn|date=February 2017}}

Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017]], in which the number of Conservative seats fell from 330 to 317, [[Theresa May]] appointed [[Damian Green]] as her ''de facto'' [[Deputy Prime Minister]] as [[First Secretary of State]] and [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] and with the ranking of 2nd most senior Cabinet member; above the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]]. As a result of sexual misconduct allegations, Green resigned and was replaced by [[David Lidington]] as [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] and [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and also holds the same position of seniority.

The largest application of CSL is in yeast leavened bakery products.  Although CSL was introduced to the market first, most applications use [[Lactylate#Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate|SSL]].  The main reason for the preference of SSL over CSL is that CSL has less crumb softening effects than SSL.  However, CSL is still preferred in some applications, such as lean hearth bread-type formulations.  In these applications, CSL is preferred because CSL performs better than SSL as a dough strengthener, while the finished product does not require a soft crumb or a perfectly symmetrical loaf shape.&lt;ref name="Boutte"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Boutte | first1=T. | last2 = Skogerson | first2=L. | chapter = Stearoyl-2-lactylates and oleoyl lactylates | title = Emulsifiers in Food Technology | editor-last = Whitehurst | editor-first=R.J | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | place = Oxford | year=2004 | pages=207–225|doi=10.1002/9780470995747.ch9|isbn=9780470995747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler Air Raid Siren''' (second generation), or known as the '''Chrysler Bell Victory Siren''' (first generation) was an [[civil defense siren|outdoor warning siren]] produced during the [[Cold War]] era that had an output of 138 [[DBc|dBC]] at {{convert|100|ft|m}}.

==History==
Built during the Cold War era from 1952 to 1957 (second generation) by [[Chrysler]], its power plant contained a newly designed FirePower [[hemi engine|Hemi]] [[V8 engine]] with a [[engine displacement|displacement]] of {{convert|331|cuin|l}} and producing {{convert|180|hp}}.&lt;ref name="Victory Siren"&gt;[http://www.victorysiren.com VictorySiren.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

They were {{convert|12|ft}} long, built atop a quarter section of a [[Dodge#Dodge trucks|Dodge truck chassis]] rail, and weighed an estimated {{convert|3|ST|t}}. Its six horns were each {{convert|3|ft|cm}} long. The siren had an output of 138 [[decibel|dB]]C (30,000 [[watt]]s), and could be heard as far as {{convert|25|mi|km}} away. 

In 1952, the cost of a Chrysler Air-raid Siren was $5,500&lt;ref name="Victory Siren"/&gt; ({{Inflation|US|5500|1952|fmt=eq}}). The [[United States government]] helped buy sirens for selected state and county [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]]. In [[Los Angeles County]], six were placed around key locations of populated areas, and another ten were sold to other government agencies in the [[California|state of California]]. These "Big Red Whistles" (as they were nicknamed) only saw testing use. Some were located so remotely that they deteriorated due to lack of maintenance.

The main purpose of the siren was to warn the public in the event of a [[nuclear attack]] by the [[Soviets]] during the Cold War. The operator's job was to start the engine and bring it up to operating speed, then to pull and release the transmission handle to start the wailing signal generation. The Chrysler air raid siren produced the loudest sound ever achieved by an air raid siren.&lt;ref name="Victory Siren"/&gt;

==Today==
Some sirens are still located above buildings and [[watchtowers]]. Many are [[rust]]ed, and in some cases, the [[salvage value]] is less than the cost to remove them. A majority have been moved to museums, and some have been restored to fully functioning condition.{{citationneeded|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12227">Section 70 of the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]] stipulates that pupils of [[Community school (England and Wales)|community]], [[foundation school|foundation]] or [[Voluntary aided school|voluntary schools]] in England and Wales must take part in a daily act of '''Collective Worship''',&lt;ref name="Section70SSFA1988"&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 70, School Standards and Framework Act 1988|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/31/contents|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they have been explicitly withdrawn by their parents.&lt;ref name="Section71SSFA1988"&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 71, School Standards and Framework Act, 1988|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/31/section/71|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same requirement is applied to [[academy schools]] via their funding agreements,&lt;ref name="NatreAcademyFAQs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Education (RE) and Collective Worship in Academies and Free Schools Q&amp;A|url=http://www.natre.org.uk/uploads/Free%20Resources/RE%20%26%20Collective%20Worship%20in%20Academies%20and%20Free%20Schools.pdf|website=Natre.org.uk|publisher=National Association of Teachers of Religious Education|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is true to say that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; [[State_school#United_Kingdom|maintained schools]] in England and Wales are subject to the same rules.  However, in practice there is widespread non-compliance with the legislation, which has not been monitored by [[Ofsted]] since 2004.&lt;ref name="Ofsted2004"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Curtis|first1=Polly|title=End daily worship in schools, says Ofsted head|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jun/11/schools.uk|accessdate=17 February 2018|work=The Guardian|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responsibility for ensuring that the rules are applied rests with a school's head teacher, its governing body and the [[Local Education Authority]]. Local Education Authorities normally exercise this function via a [[Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education]] (SACRE).&lt;ref name="Section70SSFA1988" /&gt;

== Definition &amp; Aims of Collective Worship ==
Guidance from the [[Department for Education]] (DfE) defines worship in this context as "reverence or veneration paid to a divine being or power."&lt;ref name="Guidance2004" /&gt;  It makes a distinction between the terms "collective worship" and "'''corporate worship'''", with the latter being worship amongst a group with beliefs in common.

It also describes the aims of the legislation as follows: "Collective worship in schools should aim to provide the opportunity for pupils to worship God, to consider spiritual and moral issues and to explore their own beliefs; to encourage participation and response, whether through active involvement in the presentation of worship or through listening to and joining in the worship offered; and to develop community spirit, promote a common ethos and shared values, and reinforce positive attitudes."&lt;ref name="Guidance2004" /&gt;

== Required Attributes of Collective Worship ==
The nature of the required daily act of collective worship in England and Wales is set out in Schedule 20 of the School Standards and Framework Act.&lt;ref name="Schedule20SSFA1988"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule 20, School Standards and Framework Act 1988|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/31/schedule/20|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This defines collective worship as "a single act of worship for all pupils" or separate acts of worship for groups of pupils.  It should normally take place on school premises.  The nature of the acts of worship should take into account the ages, aptitudes and family backgrounds of the pupils.  

Schools with a formal faith designation are required to arrange worship in accordance with their trust deed or, if they have no trust deed, in line with the practices of their designated faith.  For schools &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; a formal faith designation, the majority of the acts of worship should be "of a broadly Christian character".  In practical terms, this has been interpreted to mean that 51% of school days each school term must have an act of worship of a broadly Christian character.&lt;ref name="HUKCollectiveWorship1"&gt;{{cite web|title=“COLLECTIVE WORSHIP” AND SCHOOL ASSEMBLIES: YOUR RIGHTS|url=https://humanism.org.uk/education/parents/collective-worship-and-school-assemblies-your-rights/|website=Humanists UK|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation is supplemented by non-statutory DfE guidance.&lt;ref name="Guidance2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collective worship in schools|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/collective-worship-in-schools|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes it clear that [[sixth-formers]] can decide for themselves whether or not to take part in collective worship.  It also sets out circumstances under which a local SACRE can grant a formal determination that an individual school can provide alternatives to the "broadly Christian" collective worship arrangements required by the legislation.

While head teachers have a duty to ensure that the law on collective worship is upheld within their school, they cannot themselves be required to participate in it, or to direct other teachers to participate it, against their will. Nor can they make the willingness to participate in, or lead, collective worship a condition of teachers' employment.&lt;ref name="Guidance2004" /&gt;  If necessary, head teachers are required to source "appropriate people
from the local community who would be willing and able to lead collective worship".&lt;ref name="Guidance2004" /&gt;

== Compliance with, and Challenges to, the Law on Collective Worship ==
When the head of Ofsted announced that it would no longer inspect the provision of Collective Worship in 2004, he stated that 76% of secondary schools were not compliant with the law.&lt;ref name="Ofsted2004" /&gt; An opinion poll commissioned by the BBC in 2011 indicated that 64% of parents in England say their children do not attend a daily act of worship at school, and that 60% of the general public are not in favour of the law on collective worship being enforced.&lt;ref name="ComResPoll2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC COLLECTIVE WORSHIP POLL|url=http://www.comresglobal.com/polls/bbc-collective-worship-poll/|publisher=ComRes|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, amendments were proposed to the law on collective worship, which would have made it optional at schools without a formal faith designation, and which would have also made it easier for pupils to opt themselves out of collective worship.  The amendments were debated in the House of Lords, but were not adopted.&lt;ref name="LordsDebate18July2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Bill, Amendments 92 - 95|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110718-gc0001.htm|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups campaigning to amend the law on Collective Worship include [[Humanists UK]] and the [[National Secular Society]], who argue that the requirement for daily worship should be replaced by a requirement for inclusive assemblies instead.&lt;ref name="HUKCollectiveWorship2"&gt;{{cite web|title=COLLECTIVE WORSHIP|url=https://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/schools-and-education/collective-worship/|publisher=Humanists UK|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSSBriefing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Briefing: Collective Worship in Schools|url=http://www.secularism.org.uk/uploads/collective-worship-briefing.pdf|publisher=National Secular Society|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Governors Association]] is also seeking an end to compulsory collective worship in schools without a religious affiliation.&lt;ref name="NGA2014Statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=NGA responds to Telegraph article on Collective Worship|url=https://www.nga.org.uk/News/NGA-News/Pre-2016/May-Sept-14/NGA-responds-to-Telegraph-article-on-Collective-Wo.aspx|publisher=National Governors Association|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 a leading education spokesperson for the Church of England, [[John Pritchard (bishop)|Bishop Pritchard]], publicly expressed a view that the term collective worship should be re-framed as "'''spiritual reflection'''" to make it "more honest, and more in tune with contemporary culture."&lt;ref name="BishopPritchard2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holness|first1=Margaret|title='Rethink collective worship', says Bishop Pritchard|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2014/11-july/news/uk/rethink-collective-worship-says-bishop-pritchard|accessdate=18 February 2018|work=Church Times|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] have adopted a policy to make collective worship in non-religious schools optional rather than compulsory,&lt;ref name="LibDems2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=F16: The Role of Faith in State-Funded Schools|url=https://www.libdems.org.uk/conference-spring-17-f16-faith-schools|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a change in the law has also been called for by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]].&lt;ref name="AHRC2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collective Worship and Religious Observance in Schools: An Evaluation of Law and Policy in the UK|url=https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3ijyaknnt5cl9jx/AAC8PyypvTS9t-zxPsx_E2Vta?dl=0&amp;preview=Collective+Worship+Religious+Observance.+AHRC+network+report.pdf.pdf|publisher=Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, the [[United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child]] called for an end to compulsory collective worship in UK schools.

== History of the Law on Collective Worship ==
The law on compulsory collective worship was first introduced by Section 25 of the [[1944 Education Act]].&lt;ref name="Section255EducationAct1944"&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 255, Education Act 1944|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/7-8/31/part/II/crossheading/religious-education-in-county-and-voluntary-schools/enacted|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation was subsequently developed by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]],&lt;ref name="ERA1988"&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Reform Act 1988|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/40/contents|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Chapter III of the [[Education Act 1996]],&lt;ref name="ChapterIIIEA1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter III, Education Act 1996|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/part/V/chapter/III|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, most recently, by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.&lt;ref name="Section70SSFA1988" /&gt;

== Collective Worship in other parts of the UK (Scotland and Northern Ireland) ==
Collective worship is also a daily legal requirement in Northern Ireland, although regulations on the nature of the worship are different to that of England and Wales.&lt;ref name="AHRC2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EducationActNI1986"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, Sections 21-22|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1986/594/contents|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Scotland there is no requirement for collective worship, but the practice of '''religious observance''' should be available to pupils, unless the local education authority has resolved to discontinue it and this resolution has been approved by local electors.&lt;ref name="AHRC2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EdScotlandAct1980"&gt;{{cite web|title=Education (Scotland) Act 1980, Sections 8-9|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/44/contents|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commission of National Education''' ({{lang-pl|Komisja Edukacji Narodowej}}, abbreviated '''KEN''', {{lang-lt|Edukacinė komisija}}, {{lang-be|Адукацыйная камісія}}) was the central educational authority in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], created by the [[Sejm]] and the King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] on October 14, 1773. Because of its vast authority and autonomy, it is considered the first [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of [[Education]] in European history and an important achievement of the [[Polish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="TT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ND"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hugon Kołłątaj.PNG|thumb|[[Hugo Kołłątaj]] reformed [[Jagiellonian University|Cracow Academy]] during 1777–1780]]
[[File:Ignacy Potocki.PNG|thumb|[[Ignacy Potocki]] – chairman of the [[Society for Elementary Books]]]]

===Genesis===
The chief reason behind its creation was that in Poland and [[Lithuania]], the [[Jesuit]]s ran an extensive system of educational institutions.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; Although the Jesuit schools were fairly efficient and provided the Polish youth with a good education, they were also very [[conservatism|conservative]]. In addition, in 1773 the [[Pope]] decided to close down the Jesuit order ([[Dominus ac Redemptor]]).&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; This threatened a complete breakdown of education in the Commonwealth.

One of the first items on the parliamentary agenda of the [[Partition Sejm]] (1773–1775), which acceded to the [[First Partition of Poland]], was the assessment in how to best utilise the former Jesuit property and declaration of a firm intention to the continuity of the education system.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt;

The Commission was formally created on October 14, 1773.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; It was one of the newly set-up "Grand Commissions";  organisations with the status of a [[Christian ministry|ministry]], albeit with a collegiate structure.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; Its main mastermind and chief figure was a Catholic priest, [[Hugo Kołłątaj]]; other notable supporters included [[Ignacy Potocki]] and [[Adam K. Czartoryski]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; Initially, the governing body consisted of 4 senators and 4 members of the Sejm, half of them representing the eastern "counties"[[voivodships of the Commonwealth]] (from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]). The first head of the KEN was [[Prince Bishop]] [[Michał Jerzy Poniatowski]]. Although the other members were mostly [[magnates|magnate]] politicians, the main founders of the body were the prominent writers and scientists of the epoch: [[Franciszek Bieliński]], [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], [[Feliks Oraczewski]], [[Andrzej Gawroński]], [[Dawid Pilchowski]], [[Hieronim Stroynowski]] and [[Armenians in Poland|Grzegorz Piramowicz]]. They were joined by [[Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours]], the Secretary of the [[King of Poland]] (and father of the founder of the [[DuPont]] company).

Despite the fact that, initially, the KEN had to face a strong opposition in the [[Sejm]], it was supported by both the monarch and the [[Familia (Polish political party)|Familia]] party, which accorded it almost complete independence in management of its affairs.

===Early (formative) period (1773–1780)===
{{Main|Society for Elementary Books}}
In 1773 the KEN was granted much of the former property of the [[Jesuit]] order, including all the schools, and many palaces and Church-owned villages.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; Due to this fact, the Commission had not only  benefited from the necessary infrastructure, but also had its own profit-yielding farms.

The Commission supervised two universities (the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]] and the [[Vilnius University]] in [[Vilnius]]), 74 secondary schools and about 1600 parish schools.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; The third Commonwealth's university, the [[Lwów University]], had been lost to the [[Austrian Partition]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt;

Soon afterwards Hugo Kołłątaj prepared a three-level-based education plan:
# Parochial schools – for peasants and burghers;
# [[Powiat]] schools – mostly for children of the [[szlachta]] (nobility); however, children of lower classes were also admitted;
# Universities – [[Warsaw University|Academy of Warsaw]], [[Vilnius University|Academy of Vilnius]] and [[Jagiellonian University|Academy of Kraków]]

Since all prior education in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was conducted mostly in [[Latin]], the KEN faced the problem of an almost complete lack of books and manuals. To cope with the problem the [[Society of Elementary Books]] (''Towarzystwo Ksiąg Elementarnych'') was, therefore, established.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; The Society sponsored competitions for creating the best textbooks.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-163"/&gt; The scientists—working on the new [[Polish language]] textbooks—had, at times, to come up with the necessary vocabulary entries. Much of the vocabulary they invented (in relation to Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics or Grammar) is still in use up to this day.

The Commission also devised several documents, outlining the whole educational process. However, several of the new principles were considered too novel for that age, and were often ignored. These included, inter alia, the principle of 'equality of both sexes' in education. 
In 1780, the Opposition refused to sign the Statute on Elementary Schools (which was drafted by Kołłątaj).

In 1774 the Commission took over the [[Załuski Library]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Second phase (1781–1788)===
After the formative period, during which the prerogatives of the Commission were established, the KEN started to convert schools to the new model. The three universities in [[Warsaw]], [[Vilnius]] and [[Kraków]] were granted the right of curatorship over schools of lower degree. This included the schools which remained under the influence of the Roman Church. Gradually, the teachers, who were frequently former Jesuit priests, were exchanged for young lay teachers - graduates of the three academies. Thanks to this move, the opposition inside the local schools was finally broken.

===Third phase (1788–1794)===
[[File:Otto Magnus von Stackelberg.JPG|thumb|The Russian ambassador [[Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (ambassador)|Otto Magnus von Stackelberg]] was persuaded to accept (in the name of the Empress Catherine II) the law establishing the Commission of National Education]]
After 1789 the supporters of reforms in the Polish [[Sejm]] gradually started to lose their influence. Similarly, the KEN was deprived of many of its former privileges. During the [[Sejm Wielki]] the ''Reformers'' had to sacrifice many of those privileges in order to gain support for the [[May Constitution of Poland|Constitution of May the 3rd]]. Ultimately, after the victory of the [[Confederation of Targowica]], in 1794, the KEN lost control over most of the schools in the Commonwealth and many of its members were banished or had to defect abroad. This included [[Hugo Kołłątaj]] himself, who had to escape to [[Dresden]].

==Legacy==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
Although the Commission had only functioned for around 20 years, it managed to completely change the shape of education in Poland. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-based school programmes and books influenced the whole generation of Poles. Also, although education was still far from being universal, it became accessible to a much wider group of people, including peasants. Thousands of teachers—trained in lay teachers' seminaries—became the backbone of Polish science during the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] and the generation, educated in the schools created and supervised by the KEN, gave rise to the most prominent personalities of the [[Polish Uprisings]] and of politics in [[Central Europe]] in the 19th century. In addition, the 27 elementary textbooks and manuals, published by the Commission, laid the foundations for the [[Polish language]] terminology in Chemistry, Physics, Logics, Grammar and Mathematics. They were used by all prominent Polish scientists and authors of the 19th century, from [[Adam Mickiewicz]] to [[Bolesław Prus]] and from the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] to the [[Askenazy school|Lwów–Warsaw School of History]]. The Guidebook to Chemistry, by [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]], remained in use in the Polish schools well beyond the 1930s.

It is often argued, with quite some force, that because of the efforts of the Commission of National Education, the Polish language and culture did not disappear into oblivion, during the [[Partitions of Poland]] – heavy [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] notwithstanding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3013">The '''Corregedor''' (''Inspector-General'' or ''Magistrate'') was a position established by the Portuguese crown in the 14th-15th century, with the authority to "correct" acts of a local, administrative or judicial nature within the kingdom. Although common throughout the kingdom, the role was more common and important in the administration of the [[Azores]].

==History==
The King of Portugal had by ordination, in the entire [[Kingdom of Portugal|kingdom]], the right to send important authorities, in his name, to correct the acts at all levels of the local administration and judiciary.&lt;ref name="MeloBento62"&gt;Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.62&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, since he was unable to participate directly, he established the post of ''Corregedor''.&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt;

The first Corregedor with jurisdiction over the Azores, Dr. Afonso de Matos, was nominated by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] in 1503.&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt; Part of his obligation was that he was required to visit the Azores once per year, at the expense of the local authorities.&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar Frutuoso (''Saudades da Terra''), Book VI, Chapter XII, p.91 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1535, King [[John I of Portugal|John]] established a time frame for corrections to be made in each island of the Azores, and by each [[Captaincies of the Portuguese Empire|Captaincy]].&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt; In that statement, a four-month plan was established specifically for the islands of São Jorge,&lt;ref&gt;On São Jorge, a judge was appointed a non-permanent judicial appointee that only visited briefly to carry out his role on the island.&lt;/ref&gt; Graciosa, Faial, Pico and Flores, the islands of Santa Maria and São Miguel established a specific working division and, the island of Terceira alone. In special circumstances, the Corregedor could visit each island for longer stays.&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt;

==Role==
The Corregedor in the Azores was the most important judicial magistrate, judging at the second tier, providing appeals and conflicts between presiding judges and ''ouvidors'' (the counsels, of the Captains-General).&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt; The royal edict of 1767 established the predominance of the corregador, recognizing his power to judge appeals, something that the corregedors on the continent were not permitted to do.&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt; In this role, the Corregedor could suspend the jurisdiction or their powers to judge, during his visit.&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt; Similarly, the Corregedor was responsible for inspecting the functioning of the Municipal authorities ({{lang-pt|Câmaras Municipais}}) and audit the books of the public finances.&lt;ref name=MeloBento62/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Corridart''' (occasionally, though incorrectly, stylized as Corrid'Art) was an almost 6-km-long public exhibit of monumental installation artwork that took place in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada on [[Sherbrooke Street]] for about six days in the summer of 1976. It was intended to be the principal arts and cultural component of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], but was destroyed illegally on the direct order of the city's executive council, itself having been told to do so by then mayor [[Jean Drapeau]]. The exhibit showcased approximately 60 artists, and the collective efforts of hundreds more in the creation of 16 installations, with additional stages at two points along the street to host hundreds of performances throughout the duration of the games. It was considered an act of outright [[censorship]] at the time and by some measures may stand as the single largest episode of artistic censorship in [[Censorship in Canada|Canadian history]].

Corridart included artworks that engaged with the history of [[Montreal]] as well as the social and economic problems that were then current within the city, province, country and world, reflecting the difficulties in striking a societal balance between increasing [[globalization]] and the desire for a national [[Quebec nationalism|identity]]. Sherbrooke Street was chosen because it provided the most direct link between the urban core and the Olympic Park in the East End of Montreal, but also because it is a symbolic street in the city's history, acting as both the dividing line between rich and poor (especially before the mid-20th century), while simultaneously uniting multiple communities across two thirds of the island. Moreover, it was a street caught in the middle of Montreal's metamorphosis, as the artists were additionally commenting on the Drapeau administration's approval of the demolition of many heritage properties on that storied street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives3.concordia.ca/P119 Concordia University Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately Corridart never officially opened to the public. In a controversial decision, Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] had the entire exhibit torn down on July 13, two days before the Olympic games began.&lt;ref name=Curran&gt;{{cite news|last=Curran|first=Peggy|title=Melvin Charney: A towering figure in Montreal architecture|url=https://montrealgazette.com/travel/towering+figure+Montreal+architecture/7268289/story.html|accessdate=22 September 2012|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noakes|first1=Taylor C.|title=The Mayor Who Wouldn't Let Art Ruin His Olympics|url=http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/11/the-mayor-who-wouldnt-let-art-ruin-his-olympics/509102/|website=[[The Atlantic#CityLab|Citylab]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the works were destroyed beyond repair or recognition, leading to a legal battle that lasted for ten years and saw very little compensation awarded to the artists. The total cost in 1976 dollars for the project was a scant $386,000 (about $1.6 million in 2017 Canadian dollars), and it was considered an expensive mistake by city officials who ironically masterminded the most costly Olympiad of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadianart.ca/features/11-2/ Canadian Art: interview with Melvin Charney]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2001, the Leonard &amp; Bina Ellen Art Gallery at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] honored Corridart by presenting an exhibition for the 25th anniversary of its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ellengallery.concordia.ca/oldSite/archive/july2001.html Corridart revisited at Leonard &amp; Bina Ellen Art Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706173454/http://ellengallery.concordia.ca/oldSite/archive/july2001.html |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WaterSense''' is a [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) program designed to encourage [[water efficiency]] in the [[United States]] through the use of a special [[label]] on [[consumer]] [[Product (business)|products]].  It was launched in June 2006.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/about_us/timeline.html "WaterSense Timeline."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217053814/http://www.epa.gov/watersense/about_us/timeline.html |date=February 17, 2011 }} Revised 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
WaterSense is a partnership program sponsored by EPA with the goal of protecting the future of the U.S. water supply. By promoting and enhancing the market for water efficient products and services, WaterSense makes every drop count by leveraging relationships with key [[public utility|utility]], manufacturer and retail partners across the U.S.

WaterSense is not a [[regulation|regulatory program]], but rather a [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] program.  EPA develops [[specifications]] for water efficient products through a public process.  If a [[manufacturer]] makes a product that meets those specifications, the product is eligible for third-party testing to ensure the stated efficiency and performance criteria have been met.  If the product passes the test, the manufacturer is rewarded with the right to put the WaterSense label on that product.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/about_us/product_certification_labeling.html "WaterSense: Product Certification and Labeling."] Revised 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

WaterSense makes it easy for consumers to differentiate among products that use less [[water]] and reinforces that saving water is easy and often does not require a major lifestyle change.

==Products==
[[File:Save Energy, Save Money (15812223659).jpg|thumb|Poster promoting WaterSense showerheads]]
[[Toilets]], [[bathroom]] [[sink]] [[faucets]] (and accessories), flushing urinals, single family new homes, showerheads and [[irrigation]] professionals who have undergone training by WaterSense-labeled [[certification]] programs are all products/services that are readily available to consumers.

Products that seek the WaterSense label must:
* Achieve national water savings
* Provide measurable results
* Perform as well as or better than similar products in the same category
* Be water-efficient, using at least 20 percent less water than EPA's fixture-specific water use baseline.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/about_us/watersense_label.html "The WaterSense Label."] Revised 2011-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==
To help get products on shelves and spread the word about WaterSense, EPA recruits partners in several different categories including:
* Utilities, communities, state and local governments
* Manufacturers
* Retailers and distributors
* Organizations that provide qualified certification programs
* Certified professionals
* Non-profit organizations and trade associations.

Partner responsibilities include:
* Promoting WaterSense as well as water efficiency
* Adhering to WaterSense partner logo guidelines
* Providing annual data
* Granting EPA rights to use partner name on the Agency website or alongside other program promotional efforts.

WaterSense also utilizes promotional partners who endorse and publicize the program among their [[wikt:constituent|constituents]].  Promotional partners include utilities, state and [[Local government in the United States|local governments]], [[trade associations]], and other [[non-governmental organizations]]. Landscape irrigation professionals who are certified by WaterSense-labeled certification programs can also become partners.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/partners "WasterSense Partners."] Revised 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
EPA’s first specification, released in January 2007, was written for WaterSense-labeled toilets. Final specifications have also been written for bathroom sink faucets, flushing urinals, new single family homes, showerheads and certification programs for irrigation professionals.&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt;

The Agency issued revised draft specifications for landscape irrigation controllers in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/partners/controltech.html "Revised Draft Specification for Weather-Based Irrigation Controllers."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifications for pre-rinse spray valves and water softeners are under development as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/products/prsv.html "Pre-Rinse Spray Valves."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/products/watersofteners.html "Cation Exchange Water Softeners."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2008, the EPA initiated its WaterSense Partners of the Year award, designed to recognize organizations and individuals who did the most in the previous year to promote water efficiency and saving water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/85fcaffd326429d6852574dd004c83f7!OpenDocument | title= Doing More with Less Water - First WaterSense Partners of the Year}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards have four categories: promotional partner of the year; manufacturer partner of the year; retailer and distributor partner of the year; and, irrigation partner of the year. In 2010, the awards were expanded to include Excellence Awards, which recognize additional organizations and individuals whose WaterSense support stood out in one or more of the evaluation categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/ec5b6cb1c087a2308525735900404445/dcea19e53a7456d3852577b500536fae!OpenDocument | title= EPA Announces WaterSense Partners of the Year}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, WaterSense added an additional category to recognize partners for exemplary efforts with WaterSense initiatives called the Sustained Excellence Awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9257">The '''Flag Group''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] political party, formed from one of the two wings of the [[British National Front|National Front]] in the 1980s. Formed in opposition to the [[Political Soldier]] wing of the [[Official National Front]], it took its name from ''The Flag'', a newspaper the followers of this faction formed after leaving and regrouping outside the main and diminishing rump of the rest of the party.

==Emergence==
During the early 1980s the Political Soldier wing of the NF held sway within the party and was on good terms with chairman [[Andrew Brons]] who, although a [[Strasserite]] by conviction rather than a disciple of [[Julius Evola]] and ruralism, largely supported the young radicals and co-operated with them to remove [[Martin Webster]], the former ally of Brons' predecessor [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], from the party in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerry Gable]], 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, and M. Vaughan, ''Neo-Fascism in Europe'', London: Longman, 1992, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; However cracks between the two factions soon began to show and a power struggle ensued. This culminated in 1986 when the two wings of the party split, with around 3000 of the 5000 registered NF members breaking away with Brons to form a new separate group.&lt;ref name="Gable255"&gt;Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate actual cause of the split had been the refusal of the Political Soldiers to contest elections and the Brons group made this the issue on which they started their own group, initially called the National Front Support Group before adopting their more usual Flag Group moniker.&lt;ref&gt;N. Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy'', Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Activists such as [[Martin Wingfield]], [[Ian Anderson (British politician)|Ian Anderson]], [[Joseph Pearce]] and Tom Acton emerged as the new leading figures within this group and the Flag Group initially grew at a much faster rate than the Official National Front, although this was in part due to the Political Soldiers closing off membership of their wing.&lt;ref name="Gable255"/&gt;

==Ideology==
The Flag Group rejected the mysticism of the Political Soldiers and the ONF's technique of establishing contacts with non-white groups such as [[Black Power]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]] activists. Despite these differences with the ONF the Flag Group was not a direct copy of the earlier NF as it was also influenced by '[[left-wing]]' economics ideals of [[Strasserism]], albeit whilst emphasising [[anti-immigration]] and [[anti-Semitism]] alongside this.&lt;ref&gt;Piero Ignazi, ''Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on and Brons was sidelined in favour of Wingfield and Anderson the Flag Group began to look more towards the [[populism]] of the ''[[National Front (France)|Front National]]'', which was enjoying comparative success in [[France]] at the time, resulting in a return to more basic [[racism|racist]] sentiments and less emphasis on economics as opposed to Strasserism.&lt;ref name="Euro"&gt;European Parliament, ''Committee of Inquiry on Racism and Xenophobia - Report on the Findings of the Inquiry'', Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 1991, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst their more crudely racialist policies the Flag Group stressed the importance of having large families and included ideas about the [[white race]] being bred out of existence in their election literature.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Durham, ''Women and Fascism'', Routledge, 1998, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Brady, formerly a leading figure in the [[National Party (UK, 1976)|National Party]], championed this idea within the Flag Group although his other favoured idea, his opposition to [[Christianity]] in particular and religion in general and his desire to see a purely secular basis for Flag Group nationalism, was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;Durham, ''Women and Fascism'', pp. 129-130&lt;/ref&gt; Wingfield's strategy for growth included recruiting new members at [[association football|football]] grounds, a tactic that initially paid dividends.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony King, ''The European Ritual: Football in the New Europe'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Brons had a history of low-level co-operation with the [[British National Party]] whilst he and BNP leader [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] went back to the early 1960s when they were both active in the [[National Socialist Movement (UK, 1962)|National Socialist Movement]] and so not long after the split Brons contacted Stanley Clayton-Garnett, the BNP's Northern leader, with a view to closer co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Tyndall and Brons met formally in [[Leeds]] in May 1987 to discuss the formation of a 'Nationalist Alliance' to be organised along the lines of the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]] in existence at the time. A Liaison Committee was set up as a result of this meeting and Brons put the idea to the Flag Group's steering committee that same July.&lt;ref name="Copsey37"&gt;Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The plan however came to nothing as it was rejected by the steering committee and so disavowed by Brons in October 1987. Within the Flag Group it was widely reported that the rejection had happened because of a fear that Tyndall intended only to swallow up the party and make himself sole leader whilst within the BNP it was suggested that the Flag Group's Strasserism made them incompatible with the party.&lt;ref name="Copsey37"/&gt; It has also been argued that ''Flag'' editor Martin Wingfield, who published an editorial denouncing notions of merger, sabotaged the move because he bore a grudge against Tyndall and his father-in-law [[Charles Parker (UK politician)|Charles Parker]] after Wingfiled had attempted, unsuccessfully, to replace the latter as NF organiser in [[Sussex]] some years earlier, a struggle that resulted in Wingfield's temporary expulsion from the NF.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism'', pp. 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the parties did continue to co-operate unofficially whilst Tom Acton also managed to win support for the Group from the influential publisher [[Anthony Hancock (publisher)|Anthony Hancock]] who had initially favoured the ONF in the split.&lt;ref&gt;Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; As well as their monthly newspaper ''The Flag'' the group also published a monthly magazine ''Vanguard'' and ''Lonheart'', a quarterly.&lt;ref name="Euro"/&gt;

==Decline==
As a separate group, the Flag Group contested [[Bristol East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol East]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]].&lt;ref name="Boothroyd"&gt;David Boothroyd, ''[[Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties]]'', 2001, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Vauxhall by-election, 1989]], they had resumed using the National Front name, even though their candidate [[Ted Budden]] faced opposition from Official National Front candidate [[Patrick Harrington]].&lt;ref name="Boothroyd"/&gt; Other elections contested included the [[Epping Forest by-election, 1988|Epping Forest by-election of December 1988]], the [[European Parliament election, 1989 (United Kingdom)|European Parliament election of 1989]] in which the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands seat]] was fought by Wingfield and the [[Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990|Mid-Staffordshire by-election of March 1990]] in which the party finished behind even parody candidate [[Screaming Lord Sutch]]. This policy of contesting elections, invariably with very disappointing results, left the Flag Group with a significant funding shortage.&lt;ref name="Copsey46"/&gt; By 1989 the Flag Group had around 1,500 members with most activity centred on the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]].&lt;ref name="Copsey46"&gt;Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Another activity centre had been [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] although following the failure of the 'Nationalist Alliance' initiative this group, which included future BNP Campaign Director [[Eddy Butler]], switched en bloc to the BNP.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, ''Contemporary British Fascism'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1980s drew to a close, the ONF disintegrated with its place being taken by the [[International Third Position]] and the [[Third Way (UK organisation)|Third Way]]. This allowed the Flag Group to assume sole control of the name, mantle and traditions of NF and effectively signalled the end of the Flag Group as a name.&lt;ref&gt;Ignazi, ''Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe'', p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Soon they would attempt to relaunch the NF as the [[National Democrats (United Kingdom)|National Democrats]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8429">Every year, around 100 girls travel to the State capitol building of [[Pennsylvania]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. There, these girls have the chance to shadow and lobby their state representatives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is '''Girlgov'''. The goal for the girls is to increase civic engagement and the goal for the state is to increase political representation among women and decrease the gender disparity within the state [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Pennsylvania State Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wgfpa.org/what-we-do/activities/girl-gov/|title=GirlGov « Women and Girls Foundation|website=wgfpa.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its start Girlgov has served over 500 girls over the years. It is one of the [[Women and Girls Foundation]]'s core projects.

== History ==

In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation launched a program in conjunction with FISA Foundation, Eden Hall Foundation, and the Jewish Women’s Foundation called Girls as Grantmakers. In this program, around two dozen girls from across [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/southwest-pennsylvania-foundations-launch-girls-as-grantmakers-initiative|title=Southwest Pennsylvania Foundations Launch Girls as Grantmakers Initiative|last=Center|first=Foundation|website=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These girls were of different race, ages, types of schools,  geographic locations, and economic levels. The 2-year program took place from 2005-2007. The girls granted up to $10,000 to different organizations and groups aimed at increasing the quality of a girl within the county.  Before the end of their term, these girls launched a campaign against [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]]. They encouraged girl nationwide to boycott Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for shirts containing racist and sexist imagery and themes in their 2005 [[Girlcott incident|Girlcott]]. This Girlcott successfully joined the efforts of girls across the country to pressure Abercrombie &amp; Fitch to pull 2 of its shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1517726/girl-cotters-propose-girl-power-tees-to-abercrombie-execs/|title='Girl-Cotters' Propose Girl-Power Tees To Abercrombie Execs|website=MTV News|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the company did not take down all the shirts that the girls wanted, the experience and the coalition building inspired them to create another county based group under the title Regional Change Agents. The Allegheny County Regional Change Agents came up with the idea for Girlgov.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wgfpa.org/2010/12/2010-press-releases/|title=2010 Press Releases « Press Releases « Wgf Updates « Women and Girls Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time Pennsylvania was ranked low in terms of representation of women and girls in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenslawproject.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/pennsylvania-women-rank-low-in-politics/|title=Pennsylvania Women Rank Low in Politics|last=womenslawproject|date=2009-04-13|website=Women's Law Project Blog|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girlgov served 60 girls in 2009, its first year. This number has since increased.

== Trip to Capitol   ==

The trip to Harrisburg has ranged from three days to a week. Because of the overarching goal of the program, increased political engagement among girls, the program is more than simply a day of shadowing and a trip back home. The girls do follow State Senators, Representatives, and their staff around for a day, experiencing the day in the life in the capitol, but the trip includes additional programming.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pghyouthmedia.com/2015/08/10/girlgov-will-work-for-equality/|title=GirlGov: Will Work for Equality|date=2015-08-10|website=Pittsburgh Youth Media|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous iterations of the trip, girls have taken part in a Mock Congress. In this Mock Congress, the girls would be split into separate committees directly mirroring committees within the state government. Each committee would read a series of proposals from real organizations in the southwestern part of the state. The Mock Congress would be allocated a set number of funds, one year this amount was $10,000, then debate until they came to a consensus about which organizations should receive the money and how much money they should hope to receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grable.org/girlgov-visits-harrisburg/|title=GirlGov Visits Harrisburg - The Grable Foundation|last=Foundation|first=The Grable|date=2015-09-22|website=The Grable Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before doing this, they get a crash course in legislation 101. They learn of all the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0 stops a bill takes on its path to becoming a law]: committee in the Senate, community support, the House floor, etc. The girls are heavily prepared to encounter law officials. This preparation also takes the form of self care. The girls take part in activities that strengthen the bonds between each other and those that have gone before them into the male dominated world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Panels and dinners provide opportunities for the girls to encounter women in leadership positions in all fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bravogroup.us/blog/women-and-girls-foundation-encouraging-girl-power-in-politics/|title=Bravo Group -   Women and Girls Foundation: Encouraging "Girl Power" in Politics|website=bravogroup.us|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls network. In actuality, the trip more perfectly resembles a conference.

== Advocacy Work  ==

Returning participants have the option to shadow a representative again or lobby. These girls would either lobby for a bill of their own choosing or lobby a bill agreed upon by the entire body of Girlgov goers. Girlgov girls have advocated for passage of the Demi Brae Bill which would introduce teen dating violence protection and education legislation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A Girlgov participant, Sarah Pesi, created her own bill. Sarah's bill was aimed at loosening the requirements to obtain restraining orders to include, minors, non-familial or romantic relationships, and varied forms of harassment. With assistance from Girlgov, Sarah oversaw and participated in the editing, networking, and lobbying of her own bill.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wgfpa.org/what-we-do/sarahs-bill/|title=Sarah’s Bill « Women and Girls Foundation|website=wgfpa.org|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law by the acting governor of the time, [[Tom Corbett]], in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://triblive.com/neighborhoods/yourcarlynton/yourcarlyntonmore/8975331-74/girls-foundation-women|title=W.Pa. girls participate in GirlGov program|last=Smith|first=Charlotte|website=TribLIVE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the girls held a rally at the Capitol too demand comprehensive science-based sexual education in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://local21news.com/news/local/students-call-for-better-sex-ed-in-pa|title=Students call for better sex ed in PA|last=Staff|first=CBS 21 Web|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Girlgov participants organized the first International Day of the Girl Celebration in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Those that participate in the summer have the opportunity to continue their involvement during the year. In the WGF newsletter, girls are seen helping at rallies, volunteering in the offices of local officials, heading efforts to lower school bus emissions, raising awareness on the conflict in Syria, advocating for LGBT+ rights, and attending a luncheon at the White House, among other things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A few of the girls make up the Girlgov leadership council which organizes initiatives and leads activities on the trips to Harrisburg.

== Noteworthy Alumni ==
Sarah Pesi drafted a bill to fortify anti-stalker laws.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Julia Johnson is a local activist for the [[Black Lives Matter|#BlackLivesMatter]] movement in Pittsburgh.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21437">The '''Guatemalan Peace Process''' lasted from 1994 to 1996 and resulted in the Guatemalan Peace Accords.

== Background ==

=== Guatemalan Armed Conflict ===
The [[Guatemalan Civil War]] was a thirty-six-year internal conflict that took place from November 1960 to December 1996. The conflict was fought between the [[Guatemalan government]] and smaller leftist guerrilla groups that fought under the [[Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca]] (URNG). It resulted in about 200,000 casualties and "disappearances", making it the deadliest armed conflict in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1215811.stm|title=BBC News - Timeline: Guatemala|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Peace Attempts ===
After a series of dictatorships, Guatemala was greatly pressured internationally to make efforts towards reincorporating democracy. In 1985, the then ruler General Oscar Mejía Victores allowed for the formation of a [[Constituent assembly|Constituent Assembly]], which began working on a new democratic constitution. This new constitution was then finalized and ratified on May 30, 1985. The following year, democratic elections were held and [[Vinicio Cerezo]] was sworn in as president of Guatemala.

Prior to this, in 1983, the Contadora Group in Latin America, which was an initiative formed by Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, began promoting peace in the Central American countries undergoing internal conflicts (El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala). The group served as mediators in peace talks among all Central American rulers, which led to the drafting of the Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation in Central America. The document did not fully receive the support of the United States and was ultimately rejected by three of the Central American countries (Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica) in 1986.

Although the Contadora process was not successful, it was continued by President Vinicio Cerezo in his pursuit for peace as president of Guatemala. In 1986, all five Central American rulers attended a series of meetings in Esquipulas, Guatemala. In August 1987, all five countries signed the [[Esquipulas II Accord]], which drew heavily from the previous Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation. This agreement outlined a framework for the resolution of the current Central American civil wars. Two important components of this accord were an amnesty law and an urgency to disarm rebel groups. The government would then have further peace talks with forces who accepted these terms.  The Esquipulas II Accord also created the National Reconciliation Commission (NRC),  which allowed for a civil influence on the peace process. Although this early accord opened the dialogue for peace in Guatemala, it did not come to a concrete close of the country's internal armed conflict.

Starting in 1988 and continuing for the following years, the NRC and URNG met on several occasions and engaged in peace talks, but did not come to an end to the Guatemalan civil war. Still, the two groups signed documents, such as the Oslo Accord, Mexico Accord, and Querétaro Agreement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mersky|first=Marcie|date=2005|title=HUMAN RIGHTS IN NEGOTIATING PEACE AGREEMENTS: GUATEMALA|url=http://www.ichrp.org/files/papers/58/128_-_Guatemala_-_Human_Rights_in_Negotiating_Peace_Agreements_Mersky_Marcie__26_May_2005.pdf|journal=THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== President Serrano Elías Auto Coup ===
[[Jorge Serrano Elías]] was democratically elected and became president of Guatemala in January 1991. Two years and a half into his presidency, on May 25, 1993, he attempted to proclaim sole power over the country through an autocoup. He dissolved the Guatemalan congress and fragmented the Supreme Court with the help of allies in the government and military. With this, he caused a [[1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] in the country. However, there was strong opposition by civilians and the Constitutional Court and Serrano Elías ultimately fled to El Salvador on June 2, failing in his attempts towards dictatorship. The congress then named [[Ramiro de León Carpio]], who was the country's Human Rights Ombudsman, as president for the time remaining of Serrano's original presidential term.

==Beginnings==

Under Ramiro de León Carpio's presidency, the Guatemalan peace process took on new life.  President de Leon made an initial proposal to restart the peace process, which was rejected by the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1997|title=Negotiating Rights: The Guatemalan Peace Process|url=http://www.c-r.org/downloads/02_Guatemala_1997_ENG_F.pdf|journal=Accord|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in January 1994, representatives of the government of Guatemala and the UNRG met in Mexico City and signed the Framework Agreement. This agreement resumed efforts towards peace in the country and settled a new peace process through two-way negotiations brokered by the United Nations. It also established an instrumental "Group of Friends" to the Guatemalan peace process that consisted of the governments of Colombia, Mexico, Norway, Spain, the United States of America and Venezuela. Another contribution of the Framework Agreement was the creation of the Civil Society Assembly (ASC) aimed towards allowing a civil, non-governmental, sector to influence and critique the bilateral negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/peace_agreements/guat_940110.pdf|title=Peace Agreements Digital Collection Framework Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Institute of Peace|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this new moderation structure, the Guatemalan government and the URNG continued to make efforts to achieve a Firm and Lasting Peace in Guatemala. In 1994, four more major agreements were signed by the disputing sides in Mexico and Oslo.

The Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights signed on March 29 in Mexico City committed the government and the URNG to implement and enforce specified human rights. To achieve these human rights, the agreement addressed issues regarding impunity, regulations for bearing arms, the need for security forces to act under the law, the freedoms of association and movement, compulsory military service, security for parties protecting human rights, protection and services for victims of human rights violations, and halting harm inflicted on the Guatemalan population. Lastly, the agreement also required verification by part of the United Nations of the compliance of both negotiating parties with peace process agreements. This led to the successive creation of the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala, which was then renamed as United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala ([[United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala|MINUGUA]]) and involved a peacekeeping mission after the final peace accord was signed in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The two groups also signed the [[wikisource:Agreement on a timetable for negotiations of a firm and lasting peace in Guatemala|Agreement on a Timetable for the Negotiation of a Firm and Lasting Peace]] on March 29. This agreement outlined a schedule for the continuing discourse and negotiations for peace in Guatemala. It set December of the same year as the anticipated culmination date for the process and the signing of a final peace accord. However, this goal was delayed and achieved two years after the planned date.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Peace negotiations were also concerned with the large numbers of internally displaced populations. On June 17, the government and the URNG met in Oslo and settled the Agreement on Resettlement of the Population Groups Uprooted by the Armed Conflict. This agreement targeted the safe reintegration of the previously mentioned population into their homelands prior to the armed conflict, as well as the reestablishment of state power, much of which had been lost to municipal governments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Lastly in 1994, with the Agreement on the Establishment of the Commission to Clarify Past Human Rights Violations and Acts of Violence the two parties committed to the creation of a Clarification Commission dedicated to investigating possible crimes throughout the entirety of the Guatemalan Armed Conflict, up to the final peace accords. This commission was not given any legal power but was instead expected to collect information and give recommendations to address human rights violations resulting from the conflict.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On March 31, 1995, representatives of the Guatemalan government and the URNG met again in Mexico and signed The Agreement on the Identity and Rights of Indigenous People. Later that year, the ASC and serious efforts became stagnated due to a change in focus towards upcoming elections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Peace Process Under Alvaro Arzú ==
Later in 1995, [[Guatemalan general election, 1995|democratic elections were held]] and the candidate of the National Advancement Party (PAN), [[Álvaro Arzú|Alvaro Arzú Yrigoyen]], won the presidency to the populist runner-up Alfonso Portillo. When Ramiro de León Carpio completed Serrano Elías's term on January 14, 1996, Alvaro Arzú was sworn in as president.

Since Alvaro Arzú's presidency accelerated the peace process between the government of Guatemala and the URNG for several reasons. Mainly, the absent ties between him and the military, and pressures from the international community and the business community in the country allowed for productive negotiations for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holiday|first=David|date=February 2000|title=Guatemala's Precarious Peace|url=http://davidholiday.com/publications/Guatemalas_Precarious_Peace.pdf|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the president's commitments towards peace, he appointed Gustavo Porras Castejón, a former leader of the Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres (EGP), which was affiliated with the URNG, as the president of the country's Peace Commission (COPAZ). Under this organization, the URNG and the government continued constant peace talks and signed a series of agreements leading up to the final peace accord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/hemisphereinitiatives/promise.htm|title=Promise and Reality - Implementation of the Guatemalan Peace Accords|website=lanic.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 1996, representatives of the two groups met in Mexico and signed the Agreement on Socio-Economic Aspects and the Agrarian Situation. This agreement concerned the economic model and structure of the country and targeted four areas: Democratisation and Participatory Development, Social Development, Agrarian Situation and Rural Development, and Modernization of Government Services and Fiscal Policy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swisspeace.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Mediation/Guatemala_Case_Study_-_National_Dialogue_Handbook.pdf|title=Case Study on Guatemala: Observations and Reflections on the Negotiation and National Dialogue Process|last=|first=|date=|website=Swiss Peace|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later that year, in September, they signed the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civil Power and the Function of the Army in a Democratic Society, which had the main goal of establishing a stable democracy and moving the country away from the previous prevalence of authoritarian military rule. In these efforts, it also created several primary organizations such as Guatemala's Civil National Police (PNC).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These two agreements then led to the final agreements in the last month before the final peace accord. These included the Agreements on a Definitive Ceasefire, Constitutional Reforms and the Electoral Regime, the Basis for Legal integration of the URNG, the Law of National Reconciliation, and the Implementation, Compliance, and Verification Timetable for the Peace Agreements.

This last one was signed in Guatemala City together with the Agreement for a Firm and Lasting Peace on December 29, 1996. This signaled the legal culmination of the Guatemalan internal armed conflict after thirty-six years.

== Accord for a Firm and Lasting Peace 1996 ==
Signed on December 29, 1996, this final Accord officiated the implementation of the peace agreements signed under the Framework Agreement in the previous 10 years of attempted negotiations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onu.org.gt/2016/04/14/acuerdos-de-paz/|title=Acuerdos de Paz {{!}} ONU|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Document Structure ===
The legal document is divided into four main sections. First, it outlines a list of concepts addressed throughout the peace process and decided upon in the final agreement. In the second section,  it explicitly establishes the implementation of 10 accords previously signed by the URNG and Guatemalan governments. These 10 are as follows:
* The Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights
* The Agreement on Resettlement of the Population Groups Uprooted by the Armed Conflict
* The Agreement on the Establishment of the Commission to Clarify Past Human Rights Violations and Acts of Violence
* The Agreement on the Identity and Rights of Indigenous People
* The Agreement on Socio-Economic Aspects and the Agrarian Situation
* The Agreement on the Strengthening of Civil Power and the Function of the Army in a Democratic Society
* The Agreement on a Definitive Ceasefire
* The Agreement on Constitutional Reforms and the Electoral Regime 
* The Agreement on the Basis for Legal integration of the URNG
* The Agreement on the Implementation, Compliance, and Verification Timetable for the Peace Agreements
The third section recognizes the support and role of entities such as the ASC, the United Nations, and the countries part of the Group of Friends to the Guatemalan Peace Process.

Lastly, the fourth section establishes the validity of the Firm and Lasting Peace document as soon as it is signed and states that the document's means and goals would be widely announced, especially through official education programs.

The agreement was then signed by representatives of the government of Guatemala, the URNG, and the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Public Response ===
The signing of a final peace agreement was greatly expected by the Guatemalan population. Thousands of people attended this signing ceremony, which was held in front of the National Palace and projected on large screens in the main square.  The accords were well anticipated and agreed upon by Guatemalans, as the population was eager for an end to the thirty-six years of war. However, there was hesitation due to expected failure in the implementation of the accords. A poll conducted by Prensa Libre, a national newspaper, showed that 78% of respondents agreed with the accords but only 38% believed these peace negotiations "would be respected".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/30/world/guatemalans-formally-end-36-year-civil-war-central-america-s-longest-deadliest.html|title=Guatemalans Formally End 36-Year Civil War, Central America's Longest and Deadliest|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=1996-12-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the leading leftist group, URNG, signed the final peace accords with the government of Guatemala, not all smaller branches fighting under the URNG were satisfied with the agreements. The [[Revolutionary Organization of Armed People]] (ORPA) stated that they did not agree completely with the accords signed by the URNG on December 29, 1996. As a demonstration of this disagreement, they refused to attend a reconciliation ceremony in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. However, this did not impede the end of the war in the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Challenges of Implementation  ===
The general language of the peace accords and the lack of representation of several Guatemalan groups caused challenges of implementation in the years following the signing of peace.  Although the peace agreement was the start to establish significant changes to Guatemala, many problems in the third-world country have thwarted progress in several areas. Major problems have stemmed from the corruption, bureaucracy, and self-interest prevalent in political positions in the country.

A problematic characteristic of this country is the extreme poverty and inequality among the population. Most of the country's population is indigenous, and have the lowest levels of education and live in the highest levels of poverty. Although the accords acknowledged the historical vulnerability and exploitation of this group, it did not outline effectively specific approaches to aid these people. This has allowed the continuation of a separated and racist society unable to collaborate with each other.

Another challenge has been the implementation of accords concerning land conflicts. Illegal occupations of land have continued and the government has not been able to address them so as to create a deterrent factor. The head of the governmental institution designated to deal with these cases resigned on the basis that they were not given the resources necessary to accomplish needed results. This, along with vague guidelines in the peace accords, has been problematic in the reincorporation of displaced populations and has not benefited the large rural and poor populations in the country.

Another characteristic promised by the accords that have failed to be accomplished or implemented properly is the topic of security in the country. The Civil National Police force, created after the war in compliance with peace agreements, is ill-trained and corrupt. In has proved unable to fight against organized crime or collaborate in prosecutions against human rights crimes. In addition, the government has also caused insecurity and distrust by being involved in corruption and defraudation cases.

The country has also found it difficult to comply with agreed targets in the areas of social welfare and tax legislation. Although the government promised to invest more money in education and healthcare budgets, it has not complied with its initial targets. In addition, as promised, in 1998 the government passed a law increasing taxes but repealed it after civil protests, and did not pursue any further changes.

Furthermore, there was significant pressure from international entities who had contributed resources and money to the peace process, many of which were conditional on the right implementation of established accords. Therefore, the challenges and inability to comply with parts of the peace accords has led to budget cuts that further complicate the fulfillment of promised changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/hemisphereinitiatives/promise.htm|title=Promise and Reality - Implementation of the Guatemalan Peace Accords|website=lanic.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salvesen|first=Hilde|date=March 2002|title=GUATEMALA: FIVE YEARS AFTER THE PEACE ACCORDS: THE CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTING PEACE|url=http://file.prio.no/Publication_files/Prio/Salvesen%20(2002)%20Guatemala%20five%20years%20after%20(PRIO%20Report%201-02).pdf|journal=International Peace Research Institute|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
Although the country has not fully implemented the 1996 peace accords, the civil war did not continue. However, there have been many accusations of human rights violations that have been faced with high levels of impunity for members involved. Cases of people "disappeared" by the military in the armed conflict have gone unsolved and families continue to look for justice, in many cases to no avail. In May 2013, the former Guatemalan President, Efrain Rios Montt, was found guilty of coordinating the killing of nearly 1,800 indigenous Ixil Maya from 1982 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-guatemala-trial/genocide-trial-for-guatemala-ex-dictator-rios-montt-suspended-idUSKCN0UP21F20160111&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of people "disappeared" by the military in the armed conflict have gone unsolved and families continue to look for justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/guatemala-peace-accords-anniversary-militarization/|title=20 years after peace accords, Guatemalans resist remilitarization|work=Waging Nonviolence|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are still ideological frictions in the country that have created tensions among the population and psychological effects that have affected the country's progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esparza|first=Marcia|date=September 2005|title=Post-war Guatemala: long-term effects of psychological and ideological militarization of the K'iche Mayans|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623520500190330?src=recsys|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Laz people}}
'''Hellenisation of Laz people''' was [[cultural assimilation]] of the [[Laz people]] into the [[Ottoman Greeks|Ottoman Greek]] society. conditioned by the different reasons: it could be political, economical and especially religious factors. 

[[Hellenization]] is the historical spread of [[Greek culture]], religion and, to a lesser extent, language, over foreign peoples conquered by Greeks or brought into their sphere of influence.

== Background == 
After the [[fall of Constantinople]] the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] was established by the Ottoman sultans as the head of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'', which encompassed all Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire, regardless of ethnic origin; not only Greeks, but also [[Bulgarians]], [[Serbs]], [[Albanians]], [[Romanians|Wallachians]], [[Moldavia]]ns, [[Croatians]], [[Syrians]], orthodox [[Arabs]], [[Georgians]] and [[Laz people|Laz]] were submitted to the jurisdiction of the Greek-dominated Patriarchate. 

This jurisdiction was not only religious, but also had a secular simension, as the Patriarchate and its bishops had control over education of the Orthodox population.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

== History == 
[[Laz people]] made up the majority of the [[Trebizond Eyalet]]'s native population.{{cn|date=February 2018}} They were a target of the Ottoman [[Islamization]] policy and gradually converted to [[Islam]], while part of the people who remained Orthodox were subordinated to the Greek Church, and were thus gradually subjected to Hellenization: the Christian Laz had Greek names and had to study and perform the [[Greek liturgy]].{{cn|date=February 2018}} The Laz language was even banished from families as a language of irreligious people.{{cn|date=February 2018}} According to [[Hrachia Adjarian]] "There are orthodox Lazs who are under the control of the Greek patriarchate in Istanbul. They speak Greek and call themselves Greeks."{{cn|date=February 2018}} Lazs who were under the control of Constantinople, soon lost their language and self-identity as they became Greeks and learned Greek,{{cn|date=February 2018}} especially the [[Pontic Greek|Pontic dialect]] of Greek language, although native language was preserved by Lazs who had became Muslims.{{cn|date=February 2018}} 

Nowadays, officially there are not Christian Lazs in [[Turkey]], they are called Greeks{{cn|date=February 2018}} although they still remember about their Laz roots.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Xu_Xiaobing_Hou_Bo_Mao_Zedong_1949.jpg|thumb|250px|Xu Xiaobing, Hou Bo, Mao Zedong &lt;br&gt;  Fragrant Hills 1949]]
'''Hou Bo''' 侯波 (1924 – 26 November 2017) was a [[Chinese photography|Chinese photographer]] who, with her husband [[Xu Xiaobing]], was among the best known photographers of [[Mao Zedong]].  Born into a poor peasant family, Hou Bo joined the Communist Party at the age of fourteen and learned photography during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in order to present a better image of the Party's work to the world. After 1949, she and Xu Xiaobing lived in the same compound as Mao and took both official photos, some used for posters and publicity, which became the most widely circulated photos of Mao, and some family photos, taken informally behind the scenes.

Among her best known photographs are "The Founding of the PRC" (1949), "Mao Zedong Swimming Across the Yangzi" (1955), "Chairman Mao at Work in an Airplane" (1959), and "Mao Zedong with Students from Latin America" (1959), which won First Prize in the National Photography Exhibition of 1959.{{sfnb|Roberts|2003}}

==Early life==
Hou Bo was born in 1924 and was from a poor peasant background. She joined the [[Chinese Communist Party]] at 14. Her father, a laborer, was beaten to death by factory owner who refused to pay him, and her mother died of grief soon after. When she made her way to Yan'an, she finished school and enrolled in the Anti-Japanese Military and Politics University, where she studied politics.&lt;ref name="Her Own Lens"/&gt;

She and her future husband, [[Xu Xiaobing]], then a PLA photographer, met in Yan'an in early 1942 and he introduced her to photography. They married in the spring of 1943. Hou Bo later recalled, "About 10 friends gathered with us in our cave; we bought jujubes and dried buns, and we all sang together". Work assignments separated the couple for long periods of time, but Hou studied photography with Japanese prisoners. In January 1949, when the PLA entered [[Beiping]], Hou and Xu were reunited in Mao's summer house in his Fragrant Hills temporary headquarters outside the city where Xu was photographing Mao's meetings with foreign delegations. Mao took an interest in Hou Bo, asking where she came from, and saying that she "grew up on the millet of Yan'an, so you must serve the people." Mao asked her to join his group of official photographers.&lt;ref name="Her Own Lens"&gt; {{cite |title = Through her own lens to Mao| last = Yang |first = Guang |journal = China Daily| date =  2010-02-05 |url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-02/05/content_9431509.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:PRCFounding.jpg|Hou Bo|thumb|250px|left|alt=October 1, 1949.|The Founding of the PRC]]
Hou's photo of Mao and other new leaders on October 1, 1949, proclaiming the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] is one of the most widely distributed photographs of modern times, but she also took less formal pictures of the leadership.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; She later recalled that when, "after all present sang the national anthem, Chairman Mao solemnly declared the founding of new China, I felt so exhilarated that I forgot about the danger and leaned as far out from the rostrum guardrails as I could and took a photo of Chairman Mao as he declared the rising of the new nation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lens On a Rising Nation | author = Huang Hai, Gong Lei| journal = Women of China| url = http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/people/others/9/9642-1.htm | date = 14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After 1949==
From 1950 to 1961, Hou Bo lived in the [[Zhongnanhai]], the residence of top party officials, where she set up the Photography Department. She was joined by her husband and two children, who were reared in the Party nursery there.{{sfnb|Roberts|2003}} Mao's children called her "Aunt Hou Bo." By one count, although she was the only woman on the film crew, Hou Bo took more than 400 of the 700 officially published photographs of Mao in this period.&lt;ref name="Her Own Lens" /&gt; She and Xu Xiaobo became, as one China watcher put it, "court photographers" who took photos both of Mao in "Stalinesque" poses that became famous propaganda posters, and also relaxed pictures of him with his family, some on the beach at [[Beidaihe]].&lt;ref name="Gittings " &gt;{{cite | first = John |last = Gittings | title = Monster at the Beach| journal = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/apr/10/photography.china |date = 10 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her assignment was to make a photographic record not only of Mao, but of Central Committee members including Zhou Enlai, [[Zhu De]], and [[Liu Shaoqi]]. She travelled with these officials and often caught them in unguarded moments, such as "Chairman Mao at Work on an Aeroplane" (1957), which showed him intent on reading a document. These personal photos were not circulated to the public or the press; one print of each was for Zhongnanhai and one for the archive.{{sfnb|Roberts|2003}}

Hou Bo had a mixed relation with Mao's wife, [[Jiang Qing]], who pursued photography as an avid amateur and had Hou Bo transferred from Zhongnanhai to [[New China News Agency]] in 1961. When she left Zhongnanhai, however, she recalled later, Mao told her "For 12 years, you took a lot of very good pictures of me".&lt;ref name="Her Own Lens"/&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Jiang Qing attacked Hou.{{sfnb|Roberts|2003}} "She said I was a fake communist, because I had joined when I was 14 even though the official age was 18," Hou said in a 2009 interview. "And she said the fact I had photographed disgraced figures like Liu Shaoqi meant I was definitely a counter-revolutionary. I hate her, but she did what she believed in".&lt;ref name=indy&gt;Clifford Coonan, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/snapshots-from-maos-comrade-in-revolution-1795747.html Snapshots from Mao's Comrade in Revolution]," ''The Independent'', October 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In their later years, she and her husband also received recognition outside China. They were the subjects of a documentary film, ''Hou Bo et Xu Xiaobing, photographes de Mao'' (Claude Hudelot et Jean-Michel Vecchiet, 2003, 52 mins), and an exhibition of their photographs of Mao was presented at the Photographers' Gallery, London, during April and May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photonet.org.uk/index.php?pxid=125 Hou Bo &amp; Xu Xiaobing Mao's Photographers]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After her husband's death in 2009 she noted that she was still a communist and an admirer of Mao Zedong's legacy. She said that she and her husband were "just ordinary workers who gave our lives for the foundation of a new China." Mao made mistakes in the Cultural Revolution, and "everyone's life was hard, but so was his. China was very poor, and he made a big contribution to provide a foundation for our country to be great." &lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Bo died on 26 November 2017, aged 93.

==Legacy and reputation==
[[File:Mao Zedong rice field.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mao Zedong in a rice field&lt;br&gt;
Poster based on a photo by Hou Bo]] The critic [[Claude Hudelot]] remarks that the widely circulated poster of Mao in the midst of a rice field, taken from Hou's photo, shows that Hou's farm background made her comfortable among China's cultures, where she "immersed herself with an almost childlike joy". She shows Mao wearing a straw hat that "seems to accentuate the effect of an Emperor of Nature, radiating rays of sunlight".  Her photography explored deeper into the history of Mao Zedong, as well as attempt to highlight and depict the features of his image that made him a historical leader in Chinese history.  The poster was issued in millions of copies in 1958, just at the start of the eventually devastating [[Great Leap Forward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Claude | last=Hudelot | url=https://blogs.mediapart.fr/claude-hudelot/blog/171013/foto-industria-lu-la-voie-propagandiste-de-hou-bo-et-xu-xiaobing | title=Lu / La Voie propagandiste de Hou Bo et Xu Xiaobing | date=17 October 2013 | publisher=Mediapart | accessdate=12 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taiwan photographer [[Zhang Zhaotang]] said when an exhibition of Hou and Xu's photos reached Taiwan, "As an official photographer, Hou has managed to avoid showing rigid and affected postures; she's given her subject a natural and vivid shot, thanks to her diligence and perseverance"&lt;ref name="Her Own Lens"/&gt;

'''''How to Steal a City''''' (2017) is a book by Crispian Olver, a medical doctor and government official, from [[South Africa]]. The book is about the process of [[state capture]] and corruption within the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality]], how it grew and efforts made by the government to fight it.&lt;ref name="gr"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36470081-how-to-steal-a-city |title=How to Steal a City |website=www.goodreads.com |access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.iol.co.za/ios/behindthenews/review-insiders-guide-to-greed-and-factionalism-in-pe-11955478 |title=Review: Insider's guide to greed and factionalism in PE |publisher=Independent on Saturday |language=en |date=2018-11-11 |access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jb"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jonathanball.co.za/component/virtuemart/backlist-highlights-1/2017-releases-1/how-to-steal-a-city-detail?Itemid=6 |title=2017 Releases : How to Steal a City |last=JonathanBall.co.za |website=www.jonathanball.co.za |language=en-gb |access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and synopsis ==
In the book Olver alleges that the metro's government was controlled by a criminal syndicate closely associated with the [[African National Congress]] (ANC). The book details how the syndicate had build a sophisticated network of front companies, improper tenders, and network of corrupt local officials that the syndicate used to steal large amounts of public money from local government. The book concludes that the corruption, political divisions, and political disenchantment that the situation created led to the ANC losing the municipality in the [[South African municipal elections, 2016|2016 municipal elections]]. Despite the region being an ANC political stronghold in the past.&lt;ref name="gr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iol" /&gt;

==Reception==
The book was widely discussed in the media at the time of its publication.&lt;ref name="n24"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/how-to-steal-a-city-allegations-to-be-probed-20171023 |title='How to Steal a City' allegations to be probed |last=Nyoka |first=Nation |date=23 October 2017 |website=News24 |language=en |access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://readinglist.click/sub/crispian-olver-discusses-his-book-how-to-steal-a-city-the-battle-for-nelson-mandela-bay/ |title=Crispian Olver discusses his book How to Steal a City: The Battle for Nelson Mandela Bay |website=readinglist.click |access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kristoff Adelbert, Chief of Staff for Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality stated that all the allegations in the book would be investigated in an effort to fight corruption.&lt;ref name="n24" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3135">'''Inter-Active Terminology for Europe''' ('''IATE''') is the inter-institutional [[terminology database]] of the [[European Union]]. The project was launched in 1999 with the objective of creating a web-based interface for all EU terminology resources so as to make the information more easily available and ensure its [[standardisation]] throughout the EU institutions. It has been used in the EU institutions and agencies since summer 2004. A public [[user interface]] was released for testing in early 2007 and was officially opened on 28 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/962&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=A single database for all EU-related terminology (InterActiveTerminology for Europe) in 23 languages opens to the public |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2008-01-11 |publisher=EU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATE incorporated all of the existing terminology databases of the EU’s translation services into one interinstitutional database containing approximately 1.4 million multilingual entries. The following legacy databases were imported into IATE:
*[[Eurodicautom]] ([[European Commission]])
*TIS ([[Council of the European Union]])
*Euterpe ([[European Parliament]])
*Euroterms ([[Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union]])
*CDCTERM ([[European Court of Auditors]]).

The project partners are the European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the European Union, [[European Court of Justice]], European Court of Auditors, European [[Economic and Social Committee]], [[European Committee of the Regions]], [[European Central Bank]], [[European Investment Bank]], and the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union.

The IATE web site is administered by the [[Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union|EU Translation Centre]] in [[Luxembourg]] on behalf of the project partners. The subject 'domains' are based on [[Eurovoc]].

The entire IATE glossary database [http://iate.europa.eu/tbxPageDownload.do can be downloaded] for free in a zipped format, then multilanguage glossaries can be generated using a free tool.

The '''Jewish Party''', in full '''Jewish Party of Romania''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Evreiesc din România}}, PER; {{lang-he|המפלגה היהודית הרומנית}}) or '''Jewish National Party''' (''Partidul Național Evreiesc'' or ''Evreesc'', PNE; {{lang-hu|Országos Zsidó Párt}}),&lt;ref name="anlecție2"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Niculescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/O-lectie-a-istoriei-%28II%29*articleID_2044-articles_details.html "O lecție a istoriei (II)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 72, July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; was a right-wing political party in [[Romania]], representing [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]] interests. It originally followed an undercurrent of [[Zionism]], promoting [[communitarianism]] as a prerequisite of resettlement in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], and later progressed toward [[Religious Zionism]] and [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionism]]. Founded by Tivadar Fischer, József Fischer, and [[Adolphe Stern]], it had particularly strong sections in [[Transylvania]] and [[Bessarabia]]. In the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]], where it registered least support, it was mainly represented by [[A. L. Zissu]] and ''Renașterea Noastră'' newspaper.

The PER was strongly opposed to the liberal and [[Jewish assimilation|assimilationist]] program of [[Wilhelm Filderman]] and his [[Union of Romanian Jews]] (UER). It managed to undermine the UER's spread into Transylvania and other regions, presenting its own candidates in elections for [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] during the 1930s, when it also became a vocal opponent of antisemitism. Effectively pushed out of national politics in unfavorable circumstances during the [[Romanian general election, 1933|elections of 1933]], it formed alliances with the UER, before being ultimately banned in 1938. Its support basis was scattered by territorial changes during World War II, and decimated by the [[Holocaust in Romania|Holocaust]].

The PER reemerged soon after the [[King Michael's Coup|anti-Nazi coup of 1944]], clashing with the [[Romanian Communist Party]] and its satellite [[Jewish Democratic Committee]], but also with [[Ihud]]-type Zionism. Failing to obtain recognition for its communitarian platform, the party was split between two camps. One was anti-communist, supported Zissu's platform of [[Aliyah Bet|mass emigration into Palestine]], and stood by the Revisionists in their [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|conflict with Britain]]. The other, led by [[Mișu Benvenisti]], was more open to cooperation with the communists, and was in control of the PER by 1946. Under Benvenisti, the PER adhered to a communist-controlled "Jewish Representation", presenting candidates in the [[Romanian general election, 1946|election of 1946]]. Within two years, the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] dissolved all the Zionist organizations, imprisoning both Zissu and Benvenisti.

==History==

===Origins===
The PER came into being as a result of dissensions within the Jewish community. These followed the [[Jewish emancipation]] decrees of the early 1920s, and were aggravated by cultural and political differences between the regions of [[Greater Romania]]. Filderman's Union of Native Jews (as the UER was known before 1923) believed that a separate Jewish party was unnecessary, as it would isolate the Jews politically after they had struggled for decades to win Romanian citizenship. The Union stated that specific demands could be obtained more easily by participating in Romanian parties and collaborating with the Romanian government.&lt;ref name="scurtu"&gt;Ioan Scurtu (ed.), ''Enciclopedia partidelor politice din România, 1859-2003'', pp. 58–59. Bucharest: Editura Meronia, 2003.  {{ISBN|973-8200-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Filderman argued, the "specific interests" of the Jews "are not in disagreement with the general interests of the Romanian state".&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Henry Eaton, its stance was "politically cooperative" toward Romanian parties, seeking to "deflect the charge that Jews in Romania represented a separate and alien nation".&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the UER stood for a platform of [[Jewish assimilation]]: it was "rather supportive of integration",&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt; or even "moderate [[Romanianization]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; However, the UER was not fundamentally adverse to Zionism, with Filderman himself noting: "a Romanian Jew cannot oppose the creation of a [[Jewish state|Jewish national state]]".&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The UER's assimilationist viewpoint was not shared by a group led by Tivadar (Theodor) Fischer, József Fischer, and [[Adolphe Stern]]. Stern, who represented the "[[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]]" regions, had been the original leader of the Union of Native Jews, serving from 1909 to 1923, in which capacity he supported emancipation and criticized the growth of violent antisemitism as embodied by the [[National-Christian Defense League]] (LANC).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2011), pp. 9, 209&lt;/ref&gt; He had been elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] [[Romanian general election, 1922|in 1922]], as an ally of the non-Jewish [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], caucusing with the [[Bukovina]] Zionist group headed by [[Mayer Ebner]].&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 82, 89&lt;/ref&gt; The UER itself had opted for an alliance with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), perceived by its Jewish sympathizers as the party of "order and peace".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2011), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Tivadar Fischer and József Fischer were [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] from [[Transylvania]]. According to one account, they were sons of an [[Alba Iulia]] rabbi, stranded in Romania upon the end of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Kinga Frojimovics, Géza Komoróczy, Viktoria Pusztai, Andrea Strbik, ''Jewish Budapest: Monuments, Rites, History'', p. 136. Budapest &amp; New York: [[Central European University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|963-9116-37-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Attila Gidó writes that they were unrelated by blood, but united by their common defense of [[Orthodox Judaism]]; József Fischer had been a critic of Zionism, before being drawn into it by other Transylvanian activists, to become "one of Transylvanian Zionism's most important personalities".&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2014), pp. 184–185, 192&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by political scientist [[Randolph L. Braham]], the Fischers' constituency's "political culture was forged by their earlier experiences in the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian Kingdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;Braham, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; As founders of the Transylvanian Jewish National League (EZNSz/UNET) and the single-issue Transylvanian People's Party, they had expressed their opposition to the UER as early as 1923, calling for its transformation into a "general union" of loosely affiliated bodies. Against the position taken by pro-UER Transylvanians such as Miksa Klein, they advised in favor of [[communitarianism]], rejecting assimilation into the Romanian mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 86–87, 89; (2014), pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and growth===
[[File:Clubul Parlamentar Evreiesc, 1928. Landau, T. Fischer, Ebner, J. Fischer.jpg|thumb|340px|The Jewish Parliamentary Club in 1928. From the left: [[Michel Landau]], Tivadar Fischer, [[Mayer Ebner]], József Fischer]]
The EZNSz/UNET formed a cartel with the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ) during the [[Romanian general election, 1928|1928 election]], which won both Fischers seats in the Assembly. They coalesced into a "parliamentary club" with Ebner and the [[Bessarabia]]n Zionist [[Michel Landau]], calling themselves part of a "country-wide Jewish party".&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 87, 89–90. See also ''Politics and Political Parties...'', p. 290; Eaton, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Their calls for the establishment of a registered party were poorly received by the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist]] government. [[Constantin Argetoianu]], the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Minister of the Interior]], opined: "Beyond equality as citizens, the Israelites cannot state any demand. Those of an ethnic nature, as taken up by a national Jewish party, would trap the Israelites in a political ghetto and would render difficult the matter of their integration."&lt;ref&gt;ISAS, "En Roumanie. A la veile des élections parlementaires", in ''Paix et Droit: Organe de l'Alliance Israélite Universelle'', Vol. 11, Issue 5, May 1931, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the Jewish deputies accused government of "inertia" and unwillingness to confront LANC antisemitism, registering with the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;ISAS, "En Roumanie. 1931. — Contagion hitlérienne", in ''Paix et Droit: Organe de l'Alliance Israélite Universelle'', Vol. 11, Issue 10, December 1931, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The PER was formally the fusion of two other short-lived Jewish Parties: a Fischer group and a Stern group.&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), p. 90; (2014), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting unified Jewish Party was established on May 4, 1931, in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), p. 90; Heinen, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; It had as its symbol the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]],&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt; but also used "two small convex arcs joined together by a horizontal line".&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Radu, "Semnele electorale ale partidelor politice în perioada interbelică", in ''Anuarul Apulum'', Vol. XXXIX, 2002, p. 578. See also drawing in "Haosul electoral", in ''[[Realitatea Ilustrată]]'', Nr. 285, July 1935, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; It published as its central organ ''Tribuna Evreiască'' of Bucharest,&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt; and its regional newspapers were the EZNSz/UNET's ''[[Új Kelet]]'' of [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] and ''Neue Zeit–Új Kor'' of [[Timișoara]].&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first-ever conference elected Tivadar Fischer as party president.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Political Parties...'', p. 290. Gidó (2009) has "József Fischer" (p. 90), but this is corrected in Gidó (2014, p. 186).&lt;/ref&gt; He was seconded by an eight-member committee, while Stern (who died later that year) was honorary president,&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt; and József Fischer led the Transylvanian wing.&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2014), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; In Bukovina, where the PER was foremost known as the ''Jüdische Reichspartei'', its chapter came to include, alongside Ebner, the unorthodox Zionist [[Max Diamant]], formerly of the [[Jewish National People's Party]],&lt;ref&gt;Stourzh, pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Klüger]], Saul Klüger, Josef Mann, Leon Mizrachi, Benedikt Kaswan, Manfred Reifer (or Reiffer), and Leon Schmelzer.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 93, 97, 98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernő Marton|Ernő (Ernest) Marton]], Mișu Weissman, and Landau were other prominent members of the PER.&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt; Lawyer Eugen Kertész headed the PER chapter in Cluj,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2011), p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; later joined by the UER defector Miksa Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2014), pp. 187, 243&lt;/ref&gt;

At a later stage, the party was joined by the Zionist writer-industrialist [[A. L. Zissu]], who brought in his own Zionist cell, ''Renașterea Noastră''.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, pp. 80, 89, 94&lt;/ref&gt; Zissu, a "[[Liberal conservatism|bourgeois conservative]]",&lt;ref&gt;Glass, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; also advocated "[[Integral nationalism|integral]]" Zionism, communitarianism and [[self-segregation]] within the "poly-ethnic state",&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, pp. 97–100&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Filderman's stances were "coherently liberal".&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt; Strongly inclined to a prophetic form of [[Religious Zionism]], Zissu defined himself as "''the'' political opponent" of the UER.&lt;ref&gt;Crăciun, pp. 82–83, 88–90&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas were also found in Marton's own essays, which were addressed to the Hungarian Jews of Transylvania: "The Jews", Marton noted, "would be able to live among [[Gentile|the peoples]] only as a people."&lt;ref&gt;Miron, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The PER took part in the [[Romanian general election, 1931|June 1931 election]]. The UER, accused by the PER of electoral fraud,&lt;ref name="agcadr92"/&gt; preferred to join Argetoianu's "National Union" alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 93, 94&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the PER obtained some 60,000 votes, 2.19&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 152, 464&lt;/ref&gt; or 2.38%&lt;ref name="agcadr90"&gt;Gidó (2009), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; of the total—depending on the number of deputies considered as part of the PER. It formally won four seats in the Assembly of Deputies,&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; but later received another affiliation, raising it two five seats. The Fischers, Ebner, Diamant, and Reifer all won seats; in accordance with a previous agreement that no affiliate region would go unrepresented, Tivadar Fischer was replaced by Landau, and Ebner ceded his seat to Sami Singer.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Political Parties...'', pp. 290–291. See also Gidó (2009), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===1932 election===
[[File:PoblaciónJudíaRumana1930.svg|thumb|330px|Concentration of the Jewish population per [[Counties of Romania|county]] in [[Greater Romania]]. Particularly strong and non-assimilated communities existed in [[Maramureș]], [[Bukovina]], and northern [[Bessarabia]], where the PER drew most of its votes]]
The UER failed to renew its PNL alliance before the [[Romanian general election, 1932|July 1932 race]],&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt; and was approached by the Zionist Lazar Margulies to negotiate a merger with the PER. The talks were inconclusive. Subsequently, the UER, absorbing into its ranks dissident Zionists from the PER's Bukovina chapter, caucused with the nationwide Traders' Council.&lt;ref&gt;Mihai, pp. 95, 98&lt;/ref&gt; The PER took 2.26% and 5 seats: Fischer and Landau were returned; Marton, Weissman, and Ebner won the other three seats.&lt;ref name="agcadr90"/&gt; These elections, organized and won by the PNȚ government of [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], were noted as the least fraudulent of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the PER was the sole Jewish party in the Assembly, the UER having failed to win sufficient votes.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;

The party's electoral basin was in Romania's "new regions", with only a slim presence in the Old Kingdom: some 40% of its total voters were from Transylvania, where over 70% of the emancipated Jewish population voted PER. Its main competitor was the [[Magyar Party (Romania)|Magyar Party]], which took away votes from Hungarian-assimilated Jews; Jews from the less [[Magyarization|Magyarized]] zones, in particular [[Maramureș]], were predominantly PER voters.&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 91–92, 93; (2014), pp. 186–187, 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; In the east, Landau's Bessarabian constituency, comprising some of the poorest and least integrated sections of Romanian Jews, provided the PER with its other main electoral resource.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;

The parliamentary period refined the PER's program, adopted at a general congress in November 1933,&lt;ref name="agcadr91"&gt;Gidó (2009), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; into a doctrine. It sought to raise awareness among Romanian Jews that they belonged to a larger Jewish people, while at the same time re-affirming their devotion to the country in which they lived.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Political Parties...'', p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; The party fought for legal, moral and material rights, with a view toward the spiritual development of the Jewish minority (including state support for primary and professional schools, as well as for Jewish worship).&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agcadr91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Political Parties...'', pp. 292–296&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the PER program noted the need to promote collaboration with the political groups representing [[Minorities of Romania|Romania's other nationalities]].&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;

===Revisionist and antifascist turn===
Over these years, the PER became more supportive of [[Revisionist Zionism]], its radicalism on this topic being spurred on by the steady growth of antisemitic intolerance in Romania, represented by groups such as the LANC and the [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 87–88, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Weissman had seconded the Revisionist ideologue [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] during the elections for the [[Seventeenth Zionist Congress]] in June 1931, against Singer, who ran on a ''Renașterea Noastră'' list.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Through the EZNSz/UNET, which continued to exist as a cultural extension, the PER gathered funds for the colonization of destitute Maramureș Jews into [[Mandatory Palestine]], founding there the settlement [[Kiryat Bialik|Tzur Shalom]].&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; It also initiated sociological research into the impoverished communities, sponsoring a survey team headed by István Barzilay, and organized a chapter for traders and artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2014), pp. 84, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] was established in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], the PER stood in solidarity with the parties that defended [[liberal democracy]]. It organized meetings to condemn the antisemitic actions in Germany and the manifestations of extreme-right sentiment then gaining currency in Romanian political life.&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt; This created a rift with the major parties of the establishment: the PNL called it a party of "provocateurs", whose activity actually "stokes the right-wing extremist reaction".&lt;ref name="f-rm96"&gt;Mihai, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In the Assembly, LANC deputy [[Nichifor Robu]] was suspended in 1932 for having hit Landau with a chair.&lt;ref&gt;Radu Florian Bruja, "Nichifor Robu – trepte către monografia unui politician antisemit", in ''Anuarul Institutului de Istorie George Barițiu din Cluj-Napoca. Supliment'', Vol. LII, 2013, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

The PER defied an agreement between other Jewish organizations, over not presenting Jewish candidates in [[Romanian general election, 1933|elections of December 1933]]. Its dissidence was met with anger in other community circles, and a scuffle erupted between PER supporters and their assimilationist candidates in the city of [[Galați]].&lt;ref&gt;M. C., "Bagarres politiques entre israélites roumains", in ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'', December 9, 1933, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the UER called on Jewish voters to support those parties that defended "constitutional order through the cooperation in harmony of all citizens [...], without barriers of race or creed".&lt;ref name="f-rm96"/&gt; A powerful setback followed: winning 1.29% of the vote, the PER lost all its seats in parliament.&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, p. 40; Gidó (2009), pp. 90–91, 92; Heinen, pp. 152, 465&lt;/ref&gt; This fall was attributed by the party itself to the machinations of PNL [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion G. Duca]], but may in fact have been a perverse effect of antisemitism: many Jews followed the UER stance and voted for non-Jewish democratic parties, in hopes of keeping the far-right out of parliament.&lt;ref name="agcadr92"&gt;Gidó (2009), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Another contributing factor was the growing number of minority voters who were disenfranchised by the successive governments: 120,000 to 135,000 Jewish men were reportedly stripped of their right to vote between 1920 and 1935.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;

These issues highlighted the political work of Zionist radicals. In 1935, the PER, alongside the PNȚ and the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927–48)|Social Democrats]], was approached by the illegal [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) with an offer to form an antifascist "[[popular front]]", but the negotiations stalled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Cioroianu]], "Un stalinist de catifea: profesorul Petre Constantinescu-Iași – militant pro-comunist, abonat la trenurile europene, inculpat într-un proces politic, propagandist al guvernului Petru Groza și pensionar al lui Nicolae Ceaușescu", in Adrian Cioroianu (ed.), ''Comuniștii înainte de comunism: procese și condamnări ale ilegaliștilor din România'', p. 147. Bucharest: [[Editura Universității București]], 2014.  {{ISBN|978-606-16-0520-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siguranța]] secret police followed Zissu, who had returned from an extended stay in Berlin, as he resumed contacts with the ''Renașterea Noastră'' group and discussed sponsoring them.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 1936, the PER agreed to sign a pact of collaboration with the UER, together forming the Central Council of Romanian Jews (''Consiliul Central al Evreilor din România'', CCER), which fought in defense of Jewish rights and against antisemitic actions.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Le Conseil central...", ''passim''; ''Politics and Political Parties...'', pp. 291, 296–300; Eaton, p. 40; Gidó (2009), pp. 89, 91&lt;/ref&gt; The CCER did not represent "a third organization—added to or supplanting [the PER and UER]—nor a single body resulting from their fusion", and declared itself apolitical, committed to the defense Jews "within the framework of organic laws".&lt;ref&gt;"Le Conseil central...", p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; In its appeal to the Romanian nation, it excoriated the tenets of [[economic antisemitism]], citing data which showed that Jews were a minority in enviable professions, and that, statistically, they were similarly exposed to the problems of the [[Great Depression]], including homelessness and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;"Le Conseil central...", pp. 375–377&lt;/ref&gt; The CCER also defended itself against claims that it was stoking antisemitism, dismissing them as "cynical, with the purpose of making victims into culprits."&lt;ref&gt;"Le Conseil central...", p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisemitic laws and 1938 ban===
Running on its own lists in the [[Romanian general election, 1937|December 1937 election]], the PER won 1.42% of the vote,&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 91, 92&lt;/ref&gt; again below the electoral threshold. The only parliamentarian still representing Jews was Rabbi [[Jacob Itzhak Niemirower]], who held a supplementary seat in [[Senate of Romania|Senate]]. He was twice physically assaulted by LANC militants.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt; Weissman himself briefly left the PER, heading the Revisionist list in elections for representatives to the [[Twentieth Zionist Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Party was touched by the [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic laws]] first reintroduced by the [[National Christian Party]] (PNC) government in 1937. Weissman, by then the PER's vice president, was suspended from the [[bar association]], following a review of his Romanian citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1938/01/30/archive/jews-appeal-against-citizenship-decree ''Jews Appeal Against Citizenship Decree''], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] release, January 30, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; with some 30% of the Romanian Jews being eventually stripped of their citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, p. 47; Hirsch &amp; Spitzer, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; The PER was again drawn into cooperation with the UER, issuing common protests against the measure,&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2014), pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; and reestablishing the CCER. It intensified support for [[Aliyah Bet|emigration into Palestine]], and organized the ''Totzeret Haaretz'' campaign (preferential imports from Palestine, and a boycott of Romanian merchandise).&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 88–89, 91&lt;/ref&gt; The latter policy, thought of by Filderman, effectively toppled the PNC cabinet in February 1938, but could not overturn antisemitic laws.&lt;ref name="anlecție2"/&gt;

The PER, along with all other parties extant in Romania, was dissolved by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] when he established the [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN) on March 30, 1938.&lt;ref name="scurtu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), pp. 88, 89; (2014), pp. 129–130, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were banned from either joining the FRN or creating their own parties.&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2014), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; EZNSz/UNET created an apolitical, regional, replacement for the PER. Called Social Zionist Council (''Consiliul Sionist Social''), it grouped together the Fischers and other former party members. It continued to exist until the [[Second Vienna Award]], when [[Northern Transylvania]] was ceded by Romania to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]]; it was banned in September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Gidó (2009), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Tivadar Fischer, József Fischer, and Marton remained on Hungarian territory. In 1944, they were moved into [[Kolozsvár Ghetto]], where the former two functioned as ''[[Judenrat]]'' members, answering to [[Rudolf Kastner]] (Fischer's son-in-law) and [[Dieter Wisliceny]].&lt;ref&gt;Braham, p. 26; Gidó (2014), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Marton also stayed behind in Cluj, writing works which looked beyond fascism to a future "new Emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Miron, pp. 163–165&lt;/ref&gt; The party was decimated by the Nazis, with all three of its [[Năsăud County|Năsăud]] candidates in the 1931 election being killed in [[extermination camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Moldovan]], ''Memoriile unui politician din perioada interbelică.

They were instead transported by the Nazis to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], and subsequently allowed to leave for Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Braham, pp. 36–37; Gidó (2014), p. 251; Szabolcs Szita, Sean Lambert, ''Trading in Lives?: Operations of the Jewish Relief and Rescue Committee in Budapest, 1944–1945'', pp. 94–97, 165–172, 195–196, 212.

Other former party cells existed in Nazi-aligned Romania, where FRN officials allowed Weissman and Singer to canvass for the [[Jewish National Fund]], and set up a Zionist Union dedicated to the emigration project.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, pp. 172, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Ion Antonescu]], the Romanian government began confiscations of Jewish property and, after the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], their deportation into the [[Transnistria Governorate]]. Opposing the collaborationist [[Central Jewish Office (Romania)|Central Jewish Office]], both Zissu and his Zionist rival, [[Mișu Benvenisti]], spent terms in Romanian concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, pp. 163–164. See also Crăciun, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly Diamant stayed behind in [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet-occupied Bukovina]] after 1940. He was deported to the [[Gulag]], where he died some time after.&lt;ref&gt;Stourzh, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Reifer, fearing fascism, had also opted to remain in Soviet territory, where he only narrowly escaped Diamant's plight.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch &amp; Spitzer, pp. 106, 108, 111, 117&lt;/ref&gt; He was also arrested by the returning Romanians and sent to Transnistria; he eventually fled to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch &amp; Spitzer, pp. 268–269, 288&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943, after establishing direct contacts with the bureaucrat [[Mihai Antonescu]], Zissu obtained from the regime that Jews be allowed to leave for Palestine, as an alternative to deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, pp. 253–259&lt;/ref&gt; He helped organize the sea transports through to Turkey and Palestine, and resumed contacts with Marton, together with whom he helped smuggle in Hungarian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; At odds with Filderman and with many of the [[Yishuv]] sponsors, he gathered crucial support from the Zionist resistance organizer, [[Dan Yeshayahu|Shaike Dan Trachtenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, pp. 257–262, 266, 297–300, 374–375&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Zissu claimed to have personally rescued some 14,000 Jews in this manner,&lt;ref&gt;Glass, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and was credited with fitting at least seven individual transports, including the ill-fated ''[[MV Mefküre|Mefküre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reestablishment and communist repression===
Re-founded, with Zissu as president, on September 18, 1944,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p. 17. See also Glass, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; days after the [[King Michael's Coup|fall of Antonescu]], the PER was still organizing itself a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Its new opponents by then were the governing and expansive PCR and its [[Jewish Democratic Committee]] (CDE), part of the [[People's Democratic Front (Romania)|National Democratic Front]]. Zissu initially "hoped for a truly democratic change in Romania, as the one chance for Jews to obtain citizenship rights".&lt;ref name="ln30"&gt;Nastasă (2003), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted with communization, he sketched out a two-stage plan for the Jewish community: a short-term recognition for the Jews as a distinct [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minority]]; later, its mass emigration to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, p. 164; Leibovici-Laiș, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was rejected outright by [[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]], the Minister for Minorities, who refused to award ethnic recognition to the Jews&lt;ref&gt;Glass, p. 164; Nastasă (2003), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and, the PER suspected, blocked out pledges of financial support for [[Holocaust in Romania|Holocaust survivors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Peter Weber, [http://www.historica-cluj.ro/anuare/AnuarHistorica2007/23.pdf "Repatrierea deportaților evrei din Transnistria și chestiunea integrării lor în România postbelică"], in ''Anuarul Institutului de Istorie George Barițiu din Cluj-Napoca. Series Historica'', Vol. XLVI, 2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Zissu was denigrated in the PCR and CDE press.&lt;ref&gt;Leibovici-Laiș, pp. 21–22; Nastasă (2003), pp. 29–31, 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The PER developed its own moderate wing, which looked more favorably on cooperation between Zionism and communism.&lt;ref&gt;Leibovici-Laiș, pp. 23–25; Nastasă (2003), pp. 31, 50, 183&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, p. 180. See also Crăciun, pp. 89–90; Leibovici-Laiș, p. 23; Glass, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Zissu resigned from the PER presidency (being followed shortly after by the group's general secretary, Moți (or Motti) Moscovici); he was later forced out from the Zionist Executive by a cartel of CDE and [[Ihud]] members.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The PER was then attracted, with the Ihud, into the Jewish Representation, running in the [[Romanian general election, 1946|election of 1946]] as a proxy of the National Democratic Front. Its main candidate was P. Rohrlich, of [[Botoșani County]].&lt;ref&gt;Leibovici-Laiș, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; On the campaign trail, communist leaders embraced Zionist slogans, with [[Vasile Luca]] declaring himself favorable to a Jewish state, when addressing an all-Jewish audience, and the official newspaper ''[[Timpul]]'' hosting reportage pieces about Jewish life in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Leibovici-Laiș, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; During the race, an independent, religious Zionism was only represented by [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]].&lt;ref name="leibl25"&gt;Leibovici-Laiș, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The PER failed to get any of its candidates elected, its votes having only helped CDE candidates.&lt;ref name="leibl25"/&gt; In the post-election interval, the PER returned to anti-communism. Shortly before the eruption of a [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war in Palestine]], [[Siguranța]] men reported that Zissu still directed the PER from the shadows, noting his Revisionist, anti-British, stance and his support of "[[Zionist political violence|terrorist action]]" in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, pp. 182–183, 197–198&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1947, Benvenisti, who was Zissu's replacement, made a show of his own disappointment with the National Democratic Front government, accusing Prime Minister [[Petru Groza]] of tolerating antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1947/03/06/archive/rumanian-government-charged-with-failure-to-implement-election-promises-to-jews ''Rumanian Government Charged with Failure to Implement Election Promises to Jews''], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] release, March 6, 1947; Kuller, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1948, following the onset of a [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], all the Zionist organizations were shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, a propaganda and intimidation campaign was taken up by the CDE and the PCR. There followed clashes between the pro-communists and religious groups such as the [[Bnei Akiva]], which led to the Zionist issue being assigned directly to the [[Securitate]] secret police.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, there were mass arrests of the Zionist militants, followed by their torturing and nine separate waves of show trials.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was a trial of thirteen Zionist leaders, including Zissu, Benvenisti, and Moscovici.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, pp. 165–167; Kuller, p. 145.

'''Koliyivshchyna''' ({{lang-uk|Коліївщина}}, {{lang-pl|koliszczyzna}}) was a major [[haidamaka]] rebellion that broke out in [[Right-bank Ukraine]] in June 1768,&lt;ref name=koliyiv/&gt; caused by the dissatisfaction of the peasants because of the serfdom oppression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Ukraine|last=P.R.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is not certain. Itself the word similar to Ukrainian word which means "impaling".

On the other hand, it could be an adaptation of the Polish words "kolej", "kolejno", "po kolei", which implies "służba kolejna" (patrolling service) so called Cossack militia on a service of aristocrats ([[magnate]]). To that etymology point such historians like [[Władysław Andrzej Serczyk]] and Volodymyr Shcherbyna.&lt;ref&gt;Chukhlib, T. ''[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2015/12/16/148812/view_pr/ Judge or understand haidamakas? Taras Chukhlib about Koliivshchyna (Судити чи розуміти гайдамаків? Тарас Чухліб про Коліївщину)]''. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 16 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outlook==
It was simultaneous to the [[Confederation of Bar]] which originated out of the adjacent region in the city of [[Bar, Vinnytsia Oblast|Bar]] (historical [[Podolia]]) and was a ''[[de facto]]'' [[civil war]] in [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]].

The rebellion was fueled by the circulation of a fictitious proclamation of support and call to arms by Russia's Empress Catherine II, the so called "Golden Charter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CG%5CO%5CGoldenCharter.htm Golden Charter] at [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly based on rumors, the charter however had a real foundation and was connected with the Catherinian rescript that in 1765 she issued it to Archimandrite Melkhisedek and obligated the Russian ambassador in Warsaw to facilitate assertion of rights and privileges of the Right-bank Ukraine Orthodox confession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?Z21ID=&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Zolota_gramota_Kateryny_II Catherinian Golden Edict] at Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that in 1764, on territory of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] of [[Right-bank Ukraine]] and along the southern borders of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the Russian Empire created [[New Russia Governorate]] in place of previously existing [[New Serbia (historical province)|New Serbia]] province and was intensively militarised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?Z21ID=&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Novorosijska_huberniia First New Russia Governorate] at Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation to uprising and the initial raid of the Cossack detachment of [[Maksym Zalizniak]] started at the Motrynine Saint Trinity Monastery (today a covenant in [[Chyhyryn Raion]]), a [[hegumen]] of which was Archimandrite Melkhisedek (Znachko-Yavorsky) who also served as the director of all Orthodox monasteries and churches in the [[Right-bank Ukraine]] (in 1761-1768).&lt;ref name=koliyiv&gt;[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Koliivshchyna Koliyivshchyna] at Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt;

The peasant rebellion quickly gained momentum and spread over the territory from the right bank of the [[Dnieper River]] to the river [[San River|Syan]]. At [[Uman]] it led to a [[Massacre of Uman|big massacre]]. Poles, Jews and Uniates were herded into their churches and synagogues and killed in cold blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hajdamacy|last=Serczyk|first=Władysław|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=Cracow|pages=325- 326}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quotation|text=Crowds of insurgents broke into the city [...] Most of the nobles and Jews gathered in the churches, synagogue and town hall. Catholic priests communicated and gave absolution [...] the slaughter initiated, most likely by vengeful peasants, began. According to modern testimonies, about three thousand Jews died in the synagogue alone. Killed and tormented. Jews were cut off their hands and ears. They were pulled out of cellars, houses and even ditches, where they sought shelter in vain. Catholic and Uniate priests became the next victims of the hatred of the insurgent crowd.|sign=|source=}}

In three weeks of unbridled violence the rebels slaughtered 20,000 people, according to numerous Polish sources.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The leaders of the uprising were [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] [[Maksym Zalizniak]] and [[Ivan Gonta]]. While being the commander of the Potocki's private Uman city Cossack militia garrison, the latter joined Zalizniak at [[Uman]] after being despatched by Polish Count [[Franciszek Salezy Potocki]] to protect it.

Eventually the uprising was crushed by Russian troops, aided by Polish army. Both its leaders were arrested by the Russian troops on 7 July 1768.&lt;ref name="koliyiv" /&gt; [[Ivan Gonta]] was handed over to Polish authorities who tortured him to death, while [[Maksym Zalizniak]] was exiled to Siberia.&lt;ref name="Koliivshchyna rebellion"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CO%5CKoliivshchynarebellion.htm|title=Koliivshchyna rebellion|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine|publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion was suppressed by the joint forces of Polish and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] armies, with numerous hangings, decapitations, quarterings and impalings.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman Davis|title=God's playground.

'''Laurent-Désiré Kabila''' (November 27, 1939 – January 16, 2001), or simply '''Laurent Kabila''' (&lt;small&gt;[[American English|US]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{Audio|En-us-Laurent Kabila from Congo-Kinshasa pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|pronunciation}}), was a [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[revolutionary]] and politician who served as the third [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from May 17, 1997, when he overthrew [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], until his assassination by one of his bodyguards on January 16, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/indepthmain.aspx?InDepthId=57&amp;ReportId=72398|title=IRIN - In Depth Reports|work=IRIN|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded eight days later by his son [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]].

== Early life ==
Kabila was born to a member of the [[Luba people]] in Baudoinville, [[Katanga Province]], (now [[Moba, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Moba]], [[Tanganyika Province]]) in the [[Belgian Congo]]. His father was a Luba and his mother was a [[Lunda people|Lunda]]. It is claimed that he studied abroad (political philosophy in [[Paris]], got a PhD in [[Tashkent]], in [[Belgrade]] and at last in [[Dar es Salaam]]) but no proof has been found or provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/afrique/l-obscur-m-kabila_493335.html |title=L'obscur M. Kabila |author= |work=[[L'Express]] |date=June 25, 1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activities ==
{{moresources|section|date=December 2017}}
=== Congo crisis ===
Shortly after the Congo achieved independence in 1960, [[State of Katanga|Katanga seceded]] under the leadership of [[Moïse Tshombe]]. Kabila organised the Baluba in an anti-secessionist rebellion in [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]]. In September 1962 a new province, [[Tanganyika Province|North Katanga]], was established, and he became a member of the provincial assembly{{sfn|Colvin|1968|p=169}} and served as chief of cabinet for Minister of Information Ferdinand Tumba.&lt;ref name=Dunn54&gt;
Kevin C. Dunn, "A Survival Guide to Kinshasa: Lessons of the Father, Passed Down to the Son" in John F. Clark, ed., ''The African Stakes of the Congo War'', Palgrave MacMillan: New York, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4039-6723-7}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1963 he and other young members of the assembly were forced to resign, facing allegations of communist sympathies.{{sfn|Colvin|1968|p=169}}

Kabila established himself as a supporter of hard-line Lumumbist [[Prosper Mwamba Ilunga]]. When the Lumumbists formed the [[Conseil National de Libération]], he was sent{{by whom|date=November 2013}} to eastern Congo to help organize a revolution, in particular in the [[Kivu]] and North Katanga provinces. In 1965, Kabila set up a cross-border rebel operation from [[Kigoma]], Tanzania, across [[Lake Tanganyika]].&lt;ref name="Dunn54"/&gt;

=== Che Guevara ===
[[Che Guevara]] assisted Kabila for a short time in 1965. Guevara had appeared in the Congo with approximately 100 men who planned to bring about a Cuban-style revolution. Guevara judged Kabila (then 26) as "not the man of the hour" he had alluded to, being too distracted. This, in Guevara's opinion, accounted for Kabila showing up days late at times to provide supplies, aid, or backup to Guevara's men. The lack of cooperation between Kabila and Guevara contributed to the suppression of the revolt that same year.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/Fichiers/MFI/PolitiqueDiplomatie/2264.asp |title=Mfi Hebdo |publisher=Rfi.fr |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Guevara's view, of all of the people he met during his campaign in Congo, only Kabila had "genuine qualities of a mass leader"; but Guevara castigated Kabila for a lack of "revolutionary seriousness"&lt;!-- (cf page 244 Ernesto "Che" Guevara The African Dream - Publisher: Harvill Panther) --&gt;. After the failure of the rebellion, Kabila turned to smuggling gold and timber on Lake Tanganyika. He also ran a bar and brothel in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/481974|title=Laurent Kabila|work=The Economist|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxist mini-state (1967–1988) ===
In 1967, Kabila and his remnant of supporters moved their operation into the mountainous [[Fizi Territory|Fizi – Baraka]] area of [[South Kivu]] in the Congo, and founded the [[People's Revolutionary Party (Zaire)|People's Revolutionary Party]] (PRP). With the support of the People's Republic of China, the PRP created a secessionist [[Marxism|Marxist]] state in [[South Kivu]] province, west of [[Lake Tanganyika]].

The PRP state came to an end in 1988 and Kabila disappeared and was widely believed to be dead. While in [[Kampala]], Kabila reportedly met [[Yoweri Museveni]], the future [[president of Uganda]]. Museveni and former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] later introduced Kabila to [[Paul Kagame]], who would become [[president of Rwanda]]. These personal contacts became vital in mid-1990s, when Uganda and Rwanda sought a Congolese face for their intervention in [[Zaire]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

== First Congo War ==
Kabila returned in October 1996, leading ethnic [[Tutsi]]s from [[South Kivu]] against [[Hutu]] forces, marking the beginning of the [[First Congo War]]. With support from [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]], Kabila pushed his forces into a full-scale rebellion against Mobutu as the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire]] (ADFL). He used [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|children]] in the conflict and it was estimated that up to 10,000 children served under him.

By mid-1997, the ADFL had almost completely overrun the country and the remains of Mobutu's army.  Only the country's decrepit infrastructure slowed Kabila's forces down; in many areas, the only means of transit were irregularly used dirt paths.&lt;ref name=Dickovick&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012|last=Dickovick |first=J. Tyler |authorlink= |authors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-1-61048-881-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following failed peace talks held on board of the South African ship [[SAS Outeniqua|SAS ''Outeniqua'']], Mobutu fled into exile on 16 May.

The next day, from his base in Lubumbashi, Kabila proclaimed himself [[List of Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|president]]. Kabila suspended the Constitution, and changed the name of the country from Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the country's official name from 1964 to 1971. He made his grand entrance into Kinshasa on 20 May and was sworn in on 31 May, officially commencing his term as president.

== Presidency (1997–2001)==
[[Image:Flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.svg (1997-2003).svg|thumb|The [[Flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] used by Kabila.]]

Kabila had been a committed Marxist, but his policies at this point were a mix of capitalism and [[collective farming|collectivism]]. He declared that elections would not be held for two years, since it would take him at least that long to restore order. While some in the West hailed Kabila as representing a "new breed" of African leadership, critics charged that Kabila's policies differed little from his predecessor's, being characterised by authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights abuses.  As early as late 1997, Kabila was being denounced as "another Mobutu".&lt;ref name=Edgerton&gt;Edgerton, Robert. ''The Troubled Heart of Africa: A History of the Congo'.' [[St. Martin's Press]]. {{ISBN|0-312-30486-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabila was also accused of self-aggrandizing tendencies, including trying to set up a [[personality cult]], with the help of Mobutu's former minister of information, Dominique Sakombi Inongo. Sakombi Inongo branded Kabila as "the [[Mzee]]", and posters reading "Here is the man we needed" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Voici l'homme dont nous avions besoin}}) appeared all over the country.

By 1998, Kabila's former allies in Uganda and Rwanda had turned against him and backed a new rebellion of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD), the [[Second Congo War]]. Kabila found new allies in [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], and [[Zimbabwe]], and managed to hold on in the south and west of the country and by July 1999, peace talks led to the withdrawal of most foreign forces.

==Assassination==
{{Moresources|section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Joseph kabila.jpg|thumb|right|Laurent-Désiré Kabila's son and successor, [[Joseph Kabila]]]]
On the afternoon of 16 January 2001 Kabila was shot by his bodyguard, Rashidi Muzele, who was killed as he attempted to flee the scene at Kabila's Palais de Marbre residence. According to a Rwandan former intelligence chief and allegations made by government officials, his assassination was committed by some of his bodyguards and masterminded by [[Rwanda]]. According to the documentary film ''Murder in Kinshasa'', made by Marlène Rabaud and Arnaud Zajtman, a Lebanese diamond dealer allegedly organized the logistics of the assassination.

The DRC's authorities managed to keep power, despite Kabila's assassination. The exact circumstances are still disputed. Kabila reportedly died on the spot, according to DRC's then health minister [[Leonard Mashako Mamba]], who was in the next door office when Kabila was shot and arrived immediately after the assassination. The government claimed that Kabila was still alive, however, when he was flown to a hospital in [[Zimbabwe]] after he was shot so that DRC authorities could organize the tense succession.

The Congolese government announced that he had died of his wounds on 18 January. One week later, his body was returned to Congo for a state funeral and his son, [[Joseph Kabila]], became president ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/27/world/glimpse-of-new-president-as-joseph-kabila-takes-oath-in-congo.html|title=Glimpse of New President as Joseph Kabila Takes Oath in Congo|last=Onishi|first=Norimitsu|date=2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, DRC officials were accomplishing the "verbal testimony" of the deceased President. Then Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo and Laurent-Désiré Kabila's aide-de-camp Eddy Kapend have reported that Laurent Kabila had told them that his son Joseph, then number two of the army, should take over, if Laurent-Désiré Kabila were to die in office.

===Aftermath===
The investigation into Kabila's assassination led to 135 people – including 4 children – being tried before a special [[military tribunal]]. The alleged ringleader, Colonel Eddy Kapend (one of Kabila's cousins), and 25 others were sentenced to death in January 2003, but not executed. Of the other defendants 64 were jailed, with sentences from six months to life, and 45 were exonerated. Some individuals were also accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow his son. Among them was Kabila's special advisor [[Emmanuel Dungia]], former ambassador to South Africa. Many people believe the trial was flawed and the convicted defendants are innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/2011/10/20111027131838717148.html|title=Murder in Kinshasa|author=Special programme|website=Aljazeera.com|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20100125-focus-rdc-justice-assassinat-republique-democratique-du-congo-kabila |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705184514/http://www.france24.com/fr/20100125-focus-rdc-justice-assassinat-republique-democratique-du-congo-kabila |archivedate=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Capitalism}}
'''Manchester Liberalism''', '''Manchester School''', '''Manchester Capitalism''' and '''Manchesterism''' are terms for the political, economic and social movements of the 19th century that originated in Manchester, England. Led by [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], it won a wide hearing for its argument that free trade would lead to a more equitable society, making essential products available to all.  Its most famous activity was the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] that called for repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] that kept food prices high. It expounded the social and economic implications of [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]]. The Manchester School took the theories of [[economic liberalism]] advocated by [[Classical economics|classical economists]] such as [[Adam Smith]] and made them the basis for government policy. It also promoted [[pacifism]], [[anti-slavery]], [[freedom of the press]] and [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manchester background ==
[[Manchester]] was the hub of the world's textile manufacturing industry, and had a large population of factory workers who were disadvantaged by the Corn Laws, the [[protectionism|protectionist]] policy that imposed [[tariff]]s on imported wheat and therefore increased the price of food. The Corn Laws were supported by the land-owning aristocracy because they reduced foreign competition and allowed landowners to keep grain prices high. That increased the profits from agriculture as the population expanded. However, the operation of the Corn Laws meant that factory workers in the textile mills of northern England were faced with increasing food prices. In turn, mill owners had to pay higher wages, which meant that the price of finished goods was higher and the foreign trade competitiveness of their products was reduced.

== Anti-Corn Law League ==
[[Mercantilism]] holds that a country’s prosperity is dependent on large exports, but limited imports of goods. At the beginning of the 19th century, trade in Britain was still subject to [[import quota]]s, [[price ceiling]]s and other state interventions. That led to shortages of certain goods in British markets, in particular [[cereal|corn]] (grains usually requiring grinding, most often, but not always wheat).

Manchester became the headquarters of the Anti-Corn Law League from 1839. The League campaigned against the Corn Laws, which it said would reduce food prices and increase the competitiveness of manufactured goods abroad. Manchester Liberalism grew out of that movement. That has led to the situation seen in modern Britain, where the country has become dependent upon imported food as part of a globalised interdependence.

Manchester Liberalism has a theoretical basis in the writings of Adam Smith, [[David Hume]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Say]].

The great champions of the Manchester School were Richard Cobden and John Bright. As well as being advocates of free trade, they were radical opponents of war and imperialism, and proponents of peaceful relations between peoples. The "[[Little Englander]]" movement saw little benefit in paying taxes to defend colonies such as [[Canada]], which contributed little trade to Manchester manufacturers and could not supply their main raw material of [[cotton]].&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nzumalaEe40C&amp;pg=PA24 | pages=24-27 | title=British Businessmen and Canadian Confederation: Constitution Making in an Era of Anglo-Globalization | first=Andrew | last=Smith | publisher = McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP | year=2008 | isbn= 9780773575004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchesterism can therefore be seen as a belief in free and consensual relations amongst individuals and groups at all levels.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Cobden's efforts to promote free trade were always subordinate to what he deemed the highest moral purpose, i.e. the promotion of peace on earth and goodwill among men.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Terminology ==
In March 1848, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]] first used the term "the School of Manchester".&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Greenleaf, ''The British Political Tradition. Volume Two: The Ideological Heritage'' (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Ralph Raico]] and as indicated by the German liberal [[Julius Faucher]] in 1870, the term "Manchesterism" was invented by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] (the founder of German socialism) and was meant as an abusive term.&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [http://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th Century''] Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee, Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''median voter theorem''' states that "a [[majority rule]] voting system will select the outcome most preferred by the [[median]] voter".&lt;ref name=Holcbome&gt;Holcombe, Randall G. (2006). ''Public Sector Economics'', Upper Saddle River: Pearson Prentice Hall, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The median voter theorem rests on two main assumptions, with several others detailed below. First, the theorem assumes that voters can place all election alternatives along a [[one-dimensional]] [[political spectrum]].&lt;ref name="SiC"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hotelling, Harold | title=Stability in Competition | journal=The Economic Journal | volume=39| year=1929 | pages=41–57 | doi=10.2307/2224214}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems plausible that voters could do this if they can clearly place political candidates on a left-to-right continuum, but this is often not the case as each party will have its own policy on each of many different issues. Similarly, in the case of a [[referendum]], the alternatives on offer may cover more than one issue. Second, the theorem assumes that voters' preferences are [[Single peaked preferences|single-peaked]], which means that voters have one alternative that they favor more than any other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Downs, Anthony | title=An Economic Theory of Political Action in a Democracy | journal=Journal of Political Economy | volume=65| year=1957 | pages=135–150 | doi=10.1086/257897}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also assumes that voters always vote, regardless of how far the alternatives are from their own views. The median voter theorem implies that voters have an incentive to vote for their true preferences. Finally, the median voter theorem applies best to a [[majoritarian]] [[election system]].

==Assumptions==
[[File:Example 1 of Single-Peaked Preferences.png|thumb|Example 1 of Single-Peaked Preferences]]
[[File:Example 2 of Single-Peaked Preferences.png|thumb|Example 2 of Single-Peaked Preferences]]
[[File:Example of Multi-Peaked Preferences.png|thumb|Example of Multi-Peaked Preferences]]
For the median voter theorem to be successful, there is a total of seven assumptions that are made,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Finance and Public Policy|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4292-7845-4|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each includes exceptions for when politicians decide to move away from the median voter:

As mentioned above, (1) the first assumption is that there is single-dimensional voting. Put simply, this means that there is only one issue that is being voted on at a time. Additionally, it is assumed that (2) voters' preferences are single-peaked, which is just the notion that people's preferences are a spectrum of utility, with the strongest preference at the maximum (see figures to the right). This assumption is critical because it prevents a phenomenon called "cycling" which is detailed below. The third assumption (3) is that voters are only choosing between two options. This is important because when there are more than two choices for voters, the median voter may not have voted for the most popular option. For example, in a population of 100 people voting between A, B, and C imagine 33 people vote for A, 33 people vote for B, and 34 people vote for C. Assuming A, B, and C lie on a spectrum (i.e. a scale from liberal to neutral to conservative) the median voter would have voted for B even though choice C was the most popular. If each choice is a candidate, and all three start at the median, any slight move captures the entire voting group on that end of the spectrum. No equilibrium exists in this situation, because every candidate has the incentive to move across the ideological spectrum based on the positions of their competitors. The fourth assumption (4) is that there is no ideology or influence with regards to the voting options. Essentially, this means that politicians only care about maximizing votes, not necessarily sticking true to their beliefs. In reality, this ignores politician’s ability to change voters’ ideologies to mirror their own. Additionally, career politicians may purposely take positions away from the ideological center in order to gain favor with specific voting bases. The fifth assumption (5) is that there is no selective voting and all eligible voters for an election will turn out to vote. The sixth assumption (6) says that money and lobbying have no effect on elections because introducing these incentives can dramatically change voting patterns. In reality, money is one of many variables that contribute to the outcome of elections. The theorem ignores the fact that politicians sometimes take positions with the primary goal of raising money for their campaigns. Political contributions can be used for advertising and campaign trips, and gaining monetary support may require moving away from the median. The final assumption (7) is the notion that all parties of elections have full information. This means that voters have knowledge on the issues, candidates have knowledge on the issues, and candidates have knowledge on voter preferences.

==Explanations==
To appreciate the logic of the median voter model, consider a setting where three individuals, Al, Bob, and Charlie, are to choose a restaurant for lunch. Al prefers a restaurant where lunch costs $5, Bob favors somewhat better fare at a restaurant serving $10 lunches, and Charlie wants a [[gourmet]] restaurant where lunch will cost around $20. Bob can be said to be the median voter, because there are exactly the same number of people who prefer a more expensive restaurant than Bob as there are who prefer a less expensive restaurant than Bob: here one each. For convenience assume that, given any two options, each member of the lunch group prefers restaurants with prices closer to their preferred restaurant to those that are farther from it. Now consider some majority decisions over alternative restaurants:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Options !! colspan="3" |&lt;!-- Pattern of votes --&gt; Pattern of votes !! Result
|-
| $20 vs. $5 || A: 5  ||    B: 5    ||   C: 20 || 5 
|-
| $10 vs. $20 || A: 10  ||   B: 10  ||   C: 20 || 10
|-
| $10 vs. $5 || A: 5   ||   B: 10   ||    C: 10 || 10 
|}

The [[Weak formulation|weak form]] of the median voter theorem says the median voter always casts his or her vote for the policy that is adopted. Note that Bob always votes in favor of the outcome that wins the election. Note also that Bob's preferred $10 restaurant will defeat any other. If there is a median voter, his or her preferred policy will beat any other alternative in a pairwise vote. (The median voter's ideal point is always a [[Condorcet winner]].) Consequently, once the median voter's preferred outcome is reached, it cannot be defeated by another in a pairwise majoritarian election. The strong form of the median voter theorem says the median voter always gets his or hers most preferred policy.&lt;ref name="Roger"&gt;[[Congleton, Roger]] (2002). [http://rdc1.net/forthcoming/medianvt.pdf The Median Voter Model]. In * C. K. *Rowley (Ed.); F. Schneider (Ed.) (2003). The Encyclopedia of Public Choice. Kluwer Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-8607-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The median voter theorem seems to explain some of the things that happen in majoritarian voting systems. First, it may explain why politicians tend to adopt similar [[Party platform|platforms]] and [[Political campaign|campaign]] [[rhetoric]]. In order to win the majority vote, politicians must tailor their platforms to the median voter.&lt;ref name="SiC" /&gt; For example, in the United States, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates typically move their campaign platforms towards the middle during congressional election campaigns. Just as sellers in a free market try to win over their competitors' customers by making slight changes to improve their products, so too do politicians deviate only slightly from their opponent's platform so as to gain votes.&lt;ref name="SiC" /&gt;

Second, the median voter theorem reflects that [[Political radicalism|radical]] candidates or parties rarely get elected. For example, a politician or party which is at an extreme end of the [[political spectrum]] will usually not get nearly as many votes as a more moderate party. Finally, the theorem may explain why two major political parties tend to emerge in majoritarian voting systems ([[Duverger's law]]). In the United States there are countless political parties, but only two established major parties play a part in almost every major election: the Democratic and Republican parties. According to the median voter theorem [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] will rarely, if ever, win elections for the same reason why extreme candidates do not tend to win. The major parties tend to co-opt the platforms of the minor parties in order to secure more votes.&lt;ref name=Holcbome /&gt; In many other long-established democratic countries there are several parties who each get a substantial share of the vote, although most of these have some form of proportional representation.

=== Representative Democracy ===
[[File:Example_of_Two_Politicians_in_a_Representative_Democracy.pdf|thumb|Example of Two Politicians in a Representative Democracy.]]

While the median voter theorem traditionally applies to [[direct democracy]], in reality most nations function as some sort of [[representative democracy]]. An adjusted version of the theorem suggests that, in representative democracy, politicians legislate and execute the laws based on the preferences of the median voter.

Consider the example in the Figure&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to the right of two politicians, Hillary and Donny, who initially hold different views about what percentage of federal government spending should be dedicated to entitlement programs. While Hillary wants to increase the current amount by 25%, Donny represents supporters who want to see a decrease of 25%. Meanwhile, the median voter prefers that entitlement spending remain the same. To capture some of Donny's voters, Hillary decides that she will now campaign on a spending increase of 10%. To prevent her from gaining an electoral advantage, Donny counters by advocating for a 5% decrease in spending. This cycle continues until both candidates arrive at the outcome preferred by the median voter. Politicians have the incentive to reach this position because, if they don’t, they risk allowing their opponents to capture additional voters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
In his 1929 paper titled ''Stability in Competition'', [[Harold Hotelling]] notes in passing that political candidates' platforms seem to converge during majoritarian elections.&lt;ref name="SiC" /&gt; Hotelling compared political elections to businesses in the private sector. He postulated that just as there is often not much difference between the products of different competing companies, so, too, there is not a stark contrast between electoral platforms of different parties. This is because politicians, just like salesmen with consumers, seek to capture the majority of voters. [[Duncan Black]], in his 1948 paper titled ''On the Rationale of Group Decision-making'', provided a formal analysis of majority voting that made the theorem and its assumptions explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Black, Duncan | title=On the Rationale of Group Decision-making | journal=Journal of Political Economy | volume=56 | year=1948 | pages=23–34 | doi=10.1086/256633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black wrote that he saw a large gap in economic theory concerning how voting determines the outcome of decisions, including political decisions. Black's paper thus triggered research on how economics can explain voting systems. In 1957 with his paper titled ''An Economic Theory of Political Action in Democracy'', [[Anthony Downs]] expounded upon the median voter theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Downs, Anthony| title=An Economic Theory of Democracy | publisher=Harper Collins | year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
Several important economic studies strongly support the median voter theorem. For example, [[Randall G. Holcombe|Holcombe]] analyzes the Bowen equilibrium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowen|first1=Howard R.|title=The Interpretation of Voting in the Allocation of Resources|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=1943|volume=58|issue=1|pages=27–48|doi=10.2307/1885754}}&lt;/ref&gt; level of education expenditures for 257 [[Michigan]] school districts and finds that the actual expenditures are only about 3% away from the estimated district average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holcombe, Randall G. | title=An Empirical Test of the Median Voter Model | journal=Economic Inquiry | volume=18| year=1980 | pages=260–275 | doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1980.tb00574.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujiwara also supported the theorem through his study of the 1998 Brazil general elections. He analysed the effect of an exogenous increase in the voter base on the policies implemented by the subsequent government chosen through the introduction of EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines), which enabled a large section of the less educated communities to cast their vote. The outcome of this election was an increase in policies targeted at issues affecting these communities, specifically healthcare. Thus, Fujiwara’s conclusions show that an increase in voter base shifted the median voter, and hence the middle ground for politicians, to a stance more favourable to the new total voter base, indicating that the voters do have a say in the policies implemented by candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Fujiwara, T. | title=Voting Technology, Political Responsiveness, and Infant Health: Evidence from Brazil. | journal=Econometrica | volume=83 | issue=2| year=2015| pages=423–464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem also explains the rise in government [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] programs over the past few decades. Thomas Husted and Lawrence W. Kenny examined growth of redistribution programs especially between the years of 1950 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Husted, Thomas A.  |author2=Lawrence W. Kenny  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Effect of the Expansion of the Voting Franchise on the Size of Government Model | journal=Journal of Political Economy | volume=105| year=1997 | pages=54–82 | doi=10.1086/262065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Rice also writes that voters with the median income will take advantage of their status as deciders by electing politicians who will tax those who are earning more than the median voter, and then redistribute the money, including to those who are at the median.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rice, Tom W. | title=An Examination of the Median Voter Hypothesis | journal=The Western Political Quarterly | volume=38| year=1985 | pages=211–223 | doi=10.1177/106591298503800204}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, Rice demonstrates that if a systematic closing of the gap between the median and mean income levels in the United States could be shown, more credibility could be given to the median voter theorem. Until the mid-1960s, Rice says that the gap between median and mean income levels tightened. Three main forces served to tighten this gap. First, the strength of the Democratic Party in the [[United States Congress]] in the decades leading up to the 1960s, as Democrats are more disposed to redistribution of wealth. Second, increased turnout at the polls, just as Husted and Kenny postulated, tightened the gap because an increase in voters means more individuals of lower income are voting. Finally, since [[unemployment]], which causes median income families to fall below the median income{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}, was relatively low compared to after the 1960s, this tightened the gap.

==Limitation==
=== Abstract Social Choice Problem ===
How do we choose the best outcome from an election for society? This question is the root of the median voter theorem and provides the basis for how and why this theorem was created. It starts with the idea of a "social decision rule." Essentially, this is a tool that is used to aggregate preferences of all members of society that, ultimately, provides a clear-cut and consistent answer for what outcome is most preferred. This choice rests on three main principles that allow the most preferred social choice to be salient. The first (1) is weak [[Pareto efficiency]] or unanimity. This is the idea that if all voters prefers one choice to all other choices, the social decision should reflect this and this option will be the outcome. The second principle (2) is a concept called [[Transitive relation|transitivity]], which is analogous to the mathematical property. This phenomenon simply means that if option A is preferred to option B, and option B is preferred to option C, then option A is preferred to option C. The final principle (3) is the idea of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (IIA). This suggests that if something is not relevant to the election or the issues involved, then it should not affect the outcome or results. For example, imagine there is a vote for the Most Valuable Player in a baseball league and player A has the most votes, player B has the second most and player C has the third most. Now, say, player C is disqualified for cheating - this should not change the outcome of the vote. If the voting system was set up in a way in which aggregate votes are shifted and player B ends up with more votes, this is not a consistent aggregation method.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Cycling&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
If any of the above-mentioned principles is violated, it could result in cycling. Cycling happens when there is no clear winner from a majority vote that results in a constant cycle of trying to determine which outcome is most preferred. This is a crucial concept because it exposes how majority voting in general and the median voter theorem can fail when assumptions are not met. There are several more failures that come about from this model that stem from this phenomenon.

==== Arrow's Impossibility Theorem ====
{{main|Arrow's impossibility theorem}}
With the difficulties associated with aggregating society's preferences, what are some alternatives that can be considered? Potentially, members of society could simply vote for their first choice rather than rank their preferences. Alternatively, there could be weights distributed based on the intensity and passion that members feel for specific issues. Both of these are problematic for several reasons, including the frequent occurrences of ties.

In 1972, Kenneth Arrow received the Nobel Prize in economics for [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|a theorem based]] on these challenges with aggregating ranked preferences consistently. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that there is no general solution to the abstract social choice problem which is based on ranked preferences (although his theorem does not apply to [[cardinal voting|rated scores]]). Arrow found that the only way for the social choice problem to have any consistent solution is to (1) assume individual preferences fit some particular pattern or (2) impose a dictatorship or (3) accept a rule that violates IIA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Median voter theorem is an example of option (1).

==== Two Common Solutions ====
Restrict preferences to single peaks, meaning that individuals vote on a spectrum and allow the median voter theorem to be implemented naturally.This is essentially the function of the party system mentioned briefly above. Another common solution is to allow people's intensities on issues play a factor in their vote. This is difficult to achieve since both [[social welfare function]]s and the [[Samuelson condition|Samuelson rule]] are necessary to calculate.

=== Political ===
In reality, many of the assumptions of this model do not hold. One assumption the theorem makes is that there is only single dimensional voting. This is never true of government representatives - politicians do not only take stances on only one issue but rather several. To test the median voter theorem further, think about the Senate. If the median voter theorem holds, it would mean that the two Senators from a state should vote the same way every time because the median voter in the state would be the voter that chooses the outcome. However, when there is one democratic Senator and one republican, they typically vote opposite to each other, effectively canceling each other's votes.

The median voter theorem has several limitations. Keith Krehbiel postulates that there are many factors which prevent the political process from reaching maximum efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Krehbiel, Keith | title=Legislative Organization | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume=18| year=2004 | pages=113–128 | doi=10.1257/089533004773563467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as [[transaction cost]]s prevent efficiency in market exchanges, the limitations of the majoritarian voting process stop it from reaching optimality. With the median voter theorem in particular, Krehbiel argues that voters' inability to directly amend [[legislation]] acts against the theorem. Sometimes, as Krehbiel writes, the policies being voted on are too complex to be placed within a one-dimensional continuum. [[James M. Buchanan|Buchanan]] and [[Robert Tollison|Tollison]] also note that this is a problem for the median voter theorem, which assumes that decisions can be made on a one-dimensional field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Buchanan, James M. | author2=Tollison, Robert D. | title=The Theory of Public Choice | year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If voters are considering more than one issue simultaneously, the median voter theorem is inapplicable. This may happen if, for example, voters may vote on a referendum regarding education spending and police spending simultaneously.

Lee, Moretti &amp; Butler also show that the theorem does not hold in certain cases. They studied the US Congress to see whether voters were only voting for policies pre-decided by candidates or if they had an actual influence on where candidates stood on various political issues, i.e., made candidates converge. Their empirical evidence showed that voters had little effect on the policy stances taken by candidates, meaning that despite a large exogenous change in the probability a candidate would win an election, their policies remained unchanged. Hence, the median voter theorem, which supports the claim that voters make political candidates converge towards a middle ground, is outweighed by candidates refusing to compromise on their political standpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lee, D. S., Moretti, E., &amp; Butler, M. J | title=Do voters affect or elect policies? Evidence from the US House. | journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics| volume=119 | issue=3| year=2004 | pages=807–859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A larger problem for the median voter theorem, however, is the incentives structure for government representatives. Downs, in ''A Theory of Bureaucracy'', writes that people's decisions are motivated by self-interest, an idea deeply rooted in the writings of [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref name="ToB"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Downs, Anthony | title=A Theory of Bureaucracy| journal=American Economic Review | volume=55| year=1965 | pages=439–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; This holds for the government system as well, because it is composed of individuals who are self-interested. One cannot guarantee the degree to which a government representative will be committed to the [[public good]], but it is certain that, to some degree, they will be committed to their own set of goals. These goals can include a desire to serve the public interest, but most often they include the desire for power, income, and prestige. To continue obtaining these things, then, officials must secure re-election. When representatives are constantly focused on becoming re-elected, this distorts the mandate they receive from their constituents: representatives will translate the wishes of their constituents into benefits for themselves.&lt;ref name="ToB" /&gt; They will tend to vote for short-term policies that they hope will get them reelected.&lt;ref name=Holcbome /&gt;

=== Social Efficiency ===
While the median voter outcome simplifies the political process, the question of efficiency still remains. The social efficiency problem is best explained using the following example. Society’s marginal benefit of a public good is calculated by summing all individual marginal benefits:

A town of 1,001 voters wishes to pay for a $40,040 public good by taxing every individual $40. 500 voters decide that they value the new public good at $100 each, while the remaining 501 voters will not contribute any money towards the good. Based on these revealed preferences, the total social benefit (500 * $100 = $50,000) is greater than the previously established cost. While the efficient outcome is to fund the public good, in this scenario the median voter (number 501 in the opposition) is not willing to pay, so the vote fails.

Inefficiency in the median voter outcome results from the [[intensity of preference]]s. While a large number of people were willing to pay a considerable sum ($100 each) to fund the good, this fact is ultimately irrelevant when the median voter favors the opposite result. In any scenario, intensity of preferences can cause the median voter outcome to be inefficient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Scope of the policy ==

The policy requires non-governmental organizations to "agree as a condition of their receipt of [U.S.] federal funds" that they would "neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations".&lt;ref name="bush1"&gt;Bush, George. W. (January 22, 2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20010604032136/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/20010123-5.html Restoration of the Mexico City Policy]. Retrieved September 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has exceptions for abortions done in response to [[rape]], [[incest]], or life-threatening conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cincotta, R. P. &amp; Crane, B. B. (2001). [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/294/5542/525 The Mexico City Policy and U.S. Family Planning Assistance]. ''Science'', ''294''(5542), 525–26. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1063403}}. Retrieved September 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy has significant impacts internationally. All NGO's, Non Government Agencies, internationally, regionally and locally in other countries that receive United States aid cannot "directly or indirectly" offer abortion as a course of family planning. This includes but is not restricted to, "providing advice and information about or offering referral for abortion, even if it is legal in said country", "promote changes in a country's laws or policies related to abortion as a method of family planning", or "conducting public information campaigns about abortion as a method of family planning". The policy doesn't prohibit international NGO's from providing advice, a referral, or performing an abortion if the pregnancy causes a severe risk to the life of the mother or was a result of incest or rape. It is also possible for these international NGO's to answer questions about an abortion if the woman makes it clear she has decided to have a safe, legal abortion. This only applies if the country the woman is living in has abortion rights laws and the information is given "passively" instead of providing the information as "medically appropriate".&lt;ref name="kff.org" /&gt;

== History of the policy ==
Named for [[Mexico City]], the venue of the [[United Nations]] [[International Conference on Population and Development]] where it was announced, the policy was instituted by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1973537 US Policy Statement for the International Conference on Population]. (1984). ''Population and Development Review'', ''10''(3), 574–79. Retrieved September 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Neil A. (June 1, 1987).

After the establishment of the Mexico City policy, organizations were required to meet its specified conditions in order to be eligible for federal funding from the United States, and as a result, several international abortion agencies no longer received a portion of their funds from this source. The [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) did not alter its operation and lost more than 20% of its total funding. Other [[family planning]] organizations, such as the Family Guidance Association of [[Ethiopia]] and the Planned Parenthood Association of [[Zambia]], likewise did not make the changes required by the Mexico City policy and had their funding cut. NGOs in [[Romania]] and [[Colombia]] adapted to the new U.S. guidelines and continued to qualify for federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;Motluk, Alison. (October 6, 2004).

Retrieved September 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 and 1988, the policy was challenged by two [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Appeals court]] rulings in ''DKT Memorial Fund Ltd. vs. USAID'', involving [[Phil Harvey]] and two foreign NGOs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=DKT Memorial Fund v. Agency for International Development, 13 February 1987 |journal=Annual Review of Population Law |year=1987 |issue=14 |page=42 f. |pmid=12346727}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood Federation of America]], Inc. v.

Agency for International Development, 29 January 1988. |journal=Annual Review of Population Law |year=1987 |issue=14 |page=42 f. |pmid=12289567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the two court rulings contributed to the policy being used only against foreign NGOs, while not invoked against U.S. NGOs.
[[File:Presidential Memorandum Regarding the Mexico City Policy.pdf|thumb|Presidential Memorandum Regarding the Mexico City Policy (2017)]]
President [[Bill Clinton]] rescinded the Mexico City policy on January 22, 1993. He referred to the policy as being "excessively broad" and stated that it had "undermined efforts to promote safe and efficacious family planning programs in foreign nations".&lt;ref name="clinton-rescind" /&gt; On January 22, 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] reinstated the policy by [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]], stating, "It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad. It is therefore my belief that the Mexico City Policy should be restored". In September 2007, [[Barbara Boxer]], a [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[California]], created an amendment designed to lift the funding conditions put in place by the Mexico City policy. It passed by a vote of 53–41. President Bush promised to veto any legislation which would eliminate the Mexico City policy.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20638087/ Senate lifts foreign family-planning funds ban]." (September 7, 2007). ''MSNBC News''. Retrieved September 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was rescinded again by President [[Barack Obama]] on January 23, 2009,&lt;ref name="obama-rescind" /&gt; and further reinstated on January 23, 2017 by President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Trump not only reinstated the policy but expanded it, making it cover all global health organizations that receive U.S. government funding, rather than only family planning organizations that do, as was previously the case. This includes offices such as, USAID, the Department of State, Global Aids Coordinator, Center of Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Health, and Department of Defense.&lt;ref name="kff.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardenswartz |first=Jacob |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/26/14384260/global-gag-rule-trump-abortion-womens-health-global-health-world |title=Trump's global abortion gag rule goes much further than any previous administration |publisher=Vox |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the policy has implications for organizations in certain countries such as [[Abortion in South Africa|South Africa]]. Even if these organizations support the policy itself, it is illegal for them not to inform a woman seeking an abortion of her rights, and/or refer her to a facility where she may have an abortion. The [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) was excluded from the Mexico City policy under the [[George W. Bush]] administration, but has not been excluded since the Mexico City policy was reinstated on Jan 23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Population Action International.

Retrieved September 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Rex Tillerson announced an expansion of the policy:
:Originally a ban covering roughly $600 million in family planning money, the Trump policy now applies to all international health care aid doled out by the U.S. government — nearly $9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/15/mexico-city-policy-expansion-ends-abortion-aid-abr/ Trump cuts all health care aid to international groups performing or promoting abortion]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debate over the policy ==
The policy originally enacted from 1984 to 1993 spoke to abortion only, not family planning in general.  However, in 2001, the policy was re-implemented and expanded to cover all voluntary family planning activities, and critics began to refer to it as the "global [[gag rule]]."  These critics argue that the policy not only reduces the overall funding provided to particular NGOs, it closes off their access to [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]-supplied [[condom]]s and other forms of [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="pai"/&gt; This, they argue, negatively impacts the ability of these NGOs to distribute birth control, leading to a downturn in contraceptive use and from there to an increase in the rates of unintended [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] and abortion.&lt;ref name="pai" /&gt; A study of nations in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that unintended pregnancies increased and abortions approximately doubled while the policy was in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Bendavid |first1=Eran |last2=Avila |first2=Patrick |last3=Miller |first3=Grant |date=2012-10-27 |title=United States aid policy and induced abortion in sub-Saharan Africa |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/12/11-091660/en/ |magazine=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |publisher= |access-date= |doi=10.2471/BLT.11.091660 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics also argue that the ban promotes restrictions on [[free speech]] as well as restrictions on accurate medical information.&lt;ref&gt;Sierra Club. It has also been proved that the Global Gag Rule inhibited women worldwide from access to gynecological exams, AIDS prevention and treatment, and contraceptive options. It also halted shipment of condoms and contraceptives to more than 20 countries (Feminist Majority). (n.d.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4952">The '''military–industrial–media complex''' is an offshoot of the [[military–industrial complex]]. Organizations like [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] have accused the military industrial media complex of using their media resources to promote militarism, which, according to Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's hypothesis, benefits the defense resources of the company and allows for a controlled narrative of armed conflicts. In this way, media coverage can be manipulated to show increased effectiveness of weapons systems and to avoid covering civilian casualties, or reducing the emphasis on them. Examples of such coverage include that of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="vfair"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fair.org/extra/the-military-industrial-media-complex/|title=The Military-Industrial-Media Complex|last=Solomon|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Solomon|date=July–August 2005|work=[[Extra!]]|publisher=''[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]''|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common practice by defense contractors and weapons systems manufacturers to hire former military personnel as media spokespersons&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;. In 2008, the New York Times found that aproximately 75 military analysts - many with military industry ties - were being investigated by the [[Government Accountability Office]] and other federal organizations for taking part in a years long campaign to influence them into becoming "surrogates" for the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s military policy in the media &lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;.

== Gulf War ==
[[General Electric]] is a subcontractor for the [[Tomahawk cruise missile]] and [[Patriot missile|Patriot II missile]], both of which were used extensively during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].&lt;ref name="vfair" /&gt; . General Electric also manufactures components for the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 stealth bomber]] and [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] and the [[E-3 AWACS]] aircraft which were also used extensively during the conflict. During the first [[Gulf War]], General Electric received $2 billion in defense contracts related to weapons which would be used in Gulf War and [[Operation Enduring Freedom|the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq]] by [[Coalition of the willing|Coalition Forces]]. As FAIR observed, "when correspondents and paid consultants on NBC television praised the performance of U.S. weapons, they were extolling equipment made by GE, the corporation that pays their salaries."&lt;ref name="vfair" /&gt;

== NATO bombing of Yugoslavia ==
During the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], media coverage specifically avoided mentioning civilian casualties, even when mentioning the bombing of civilian targets such as infrastructure. &lt;ref name="vfair" /&gt;  Media coverage relied extensively on official NATO government and military sources for reporting, and repeatedly talked about current and future weaponry of NATO in favorable and expectant terms. &lt;ref name="vfair" /&gt; 

== Iraq War ==
Media-Military coordination was such that media executives met in the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] with military officials to decide what to cover and how. &lt;ref name="vfair" /&gt; In 2007, a company named Defense Solutions hired former four-star general and [[NBC]] analyst [[Barry_McCaffrey|Barry McCaffrey]] to petition [[David Petraeus]] to buy 5000 armored vehicles from Defense Solutions&lt;ref name = "nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barstow |first1=David |title=One Man’s Military-Industrial-Media Complex |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/washington/30general.html |accessdate=1 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Subsequently, McCaffrey appeared on [[CNBC]] and praised Petraeus. The next month he encouraged congress in public testimony to purchase more armored vehicles, and criticized a plan that would see the purchase of vehicles from a competitor of Defense Solutions &lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;.

'''Network''' is a [[sans-serif typeface]] created by [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]] for use on the transport network in the [[West Midlands (county)|Birmingham/West Midlands metropolitan area]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The typeface is based on [[VAG Rounded]], which was previously the typeface used by the [[West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive]] for public information in the county.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.monotype.com/resources/case-studies/a-typeface-that-travels-for-the-city-of-birmingham/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently used by [[Transport for West Midlands]] for transport information, covering bus, rail, [[Midland Metro|Metro]], walking and cycling. It will be phased out in 2018, when TfWM replaces Network West Midlands as the transport network brand.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/andy4wm/status/1003930623755603969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://governance.wmca.org.uk/documents/g176/Public%20reports%20pack%2009th-Apr-2018%2013.00%20Transport%20Delivery%20Committee.pdf?T=10|title=Agenda for Transport Delivery Committee on Monday 9th April|last=|first=|date=|website=West Midlands Combined Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noel B. Salazar''' (born 1973) is a sociocultural anthropologist known for his transdisciplinary work on mobility and travel, the local-to-global nexus, discourses and imaginaries of 'Otherness', heritage, cultural brokering, cosmopolitanism and endurance.

==Life==
Noel B. Salazar was born in [[Dunkirk]], France, of a Spanish father and a Belgian mother. He grew up in the historical Flemish town of [[Bruges]], a celebrated cultural tourism destination. Salazar studied psychology, philosophy, and development studies at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]] (Belgium), neuropsychology at the [[University of Essex]] (UK), and anthropology and African studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (United States). He is currently research professor in anthropology at the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Leuven, where he founded [http://soc.kuleuven.be/immrc/cumore/ CuMoRe] (Cultural Mobilities Research).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00059545|title=KU Leuven Who's Who Noel B. Salazar|website=kuleuven.be|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he is visiting professor at the [[University of Bergamo]] (Italy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unibg.it/struttura/struttura.asp?rubrica=1&amp;persona=3411&amp;nome=Noel+B.&amp;cognome=Salazar|title=UniBg - Prof. Noel Bernard Salazar|website=Unibg.it|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ethnographic fieldwork so far has focused on [[Indonesia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Chile]] and Belgium. Salazar currently lives in [[Brussels]], the "capital of Europe", together with his spouse and two daughters.

==Theory==
Noel B. Salazar's main research interests include anthropologies of (im)mobility and travel, the local-to-global nexus, discourses and imaginaries of alterity, cultural brokering, cosmopolitanism and endurance. His anthropological work synthesizes ethnographic findings with conceptual frameworks developed within anthropology, sociology, geography, cultural studies, tourism studies, philosophy and psychology. Salazar has won numerous grants for his research projects (including from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[European Union|EU]] [[Seventh Framework Programme]], and [[NFWO|FWO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0514129|title=NSF Award Search: Award#0514129 - Dissertation research: Global connections and local tour guiding in Indonesia|website=nsf.gov|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;PJ_LANG=EN&amp;PJ_RCN=10323416&amp;pid=0&amp;q=3E950FFBB081982B0A7CFB0C6F4AA3FF&amp;type=sim|title=European Commission : CORDIS : Search : Simple|website=cordis.europa.eu|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fwo.be/CMSDownload.aspx?ID=0f2c0056-50ba-48fa-b30c-f630a3facd1e&amp;L=nl|title=Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen  - Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen|website=Fwo.be|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the University of Pennsylvania, Salazar experienced first-hand the benefits of transdisciplinary research. His involvement within the Department of Anthropology's Public Interest Anthropology project taught him the necessity of bridging the divide between academia and the wider public. Together with archaeologist [[Benjamin W. Porter]], now professor at the Near Eastern Studies Department, [[UC Berkeley]], he applied the [[public interest]] perspective to [[heritage tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/anthropology/|title=Department of Anthropology|website=Sas.upenn.edu|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/13527250500337397 | volume=11 | title=Heritage Tourism, Conflict, and the Public Interest: An Introduction | journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies | pages=361–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the changing meaning and value of (intangible) [[cultural heritage]] is still high on his research agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trrworld.org/article.php?aid=343&amp;year=2007&amp;vol=32&amp;issue=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094805/http://www.trrworld.org/article.php?aid=343&amp;year=2007&amp;vol=32&amp;issue=3 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It forms part of Salazar's broader work within the subfield of the anthropology of tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scitopics.com/The_anthropology_of_tourism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623180350/http://www.scitopics.com/The_anthropology_of_tourism.html |archivedate=2012-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the findings from his intended ethnographic fieldwork to shift the predominant focus in tourism studies on tourist and impact studies to a study of tourism service providers, showing their crucial role as intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.10.012 | volume=32 | title=Tourism and glocalization "Local" Tour Guiding | journal=Annals of Tourism Research | pages=628–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.annals.2006.03.017 | volume=33 | title=Touristifying Tanzania | journal=Annals of Tourism Research | pages=833–852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://civilisations.revues.org/index1387.html|title="Enough stories!"Asian tourism redefining the roles of Asian tour guides|first=Noel B.|last=Salazar|date=29 December 2008|journal=Civilisations.

One of Salazar's key concepts is the one of ''imaginaries'', which he describes as "culturally shared and socially transmitted representational assemblages that are used as meaning-making devices (mediating how people act, cognize, and value the world)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045302240.html|title=Representation in Postcolonial Analysis - Dictionary definition of Representation in Postcolonial Analysis - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=22044928 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920053700/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=22044928 |archivedate=2016-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently using this concept to research the role of dominant discourses and images of (im)mobility in cultures across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/1070289X.2011.672859 | volume=18 | title=The Power of Imagination in Transnational Mobilities | journal=Identities | pages=576–598}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/SalazarMomentous|title=Momentous Mobilities - Berghahn Books|website=Berghahnbooks.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salazar conceives mobility as a locally circulating socio-cultural construct that positively values the ability to move, the freedom of movement, and the tendency to change easily or quickly. Salazar tries to bridge the academic gap between tourism and migration studies by studying the analytical purchase of (im)mobility as an overarching concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/news/wp20-published-tanzanian-migration-imaginaries |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318143952/http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/news/wp20-published-tanzanian-migration-imaginaries |archivedate=2014-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.annals.2011.10.004 | volume=39 | title=Tourism Imaginaries: A Conceptual Approach | journal=Annals of Tourism Research | pages=863–882}}&lt;/ref&gt; More concretely, his cultural mobilities research helps us to understand the complex (dis)connections between tourism imaginaries and ideas of transcultural migration. This work happens in close collaboration with established anthropologists such as Nina Glick Schiller ([[University of Manchester]]), [[Nelson H. H. Graburn]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]) and Alan Smart ([[University of Calgary]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/1369183X.2013.723253 | volume=39 | title=Regimes of Mobility Across the Globe | journal=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies | pages=183–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=SalazarTourism|title=Tourism Imaginaries|website=Berghahnbooks.com|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/1070289X.2012.683674 | volume=18 | title=Anthropological Takes on (Im)Mobility | journal=Identities | pages=i–ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10680">The '''Philadelphia Election Riot''' in 1742 was a [[riot]] occurred due to political disagreements among the constituents of the increasingly diverse population in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slaughter |first=Thomas P. |title=Crowds in Eighteenth-Century America: Reflections and New Directions |journal=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=3–34 |year=1991 |jstor=20092570 |url=https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/viewFile/44648/44369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politics in Pennsylvania, including [[Philadelphia]], had long been dominated by the [[Quakers]] but, with their political dominance being increasingly threatened by the predominantly [[Anglican]] Proprietary party, tensions grew in the city of Brotherly-Love.

== Background ==

The Quakers had dominated the political landscape of Philadelphia for years and the growing German population seemed to be a means by which they could continue this domination. Realizing this, John Kinsey and, particularly, Isaac Norris II led the Quakers in attempting to convince the Germans to vote along their interests.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parsons |first=William T. |title=The Bloody Election of 1742 |journal=Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies |volume=36 |issue=3 |year=1969 |pages=290–306 |jstor=27771792 |url=https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/download/23390/23159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to persuade the increasing German population seemed to be paying off, as voter turnout tripled between 1739 and 1740.&lt;ref name=crucible&gt;{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Gary B.|title=The Urban Crucible: The Northern Seaports and the Origins of the American Revolution|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1986|isbn=978-0-674-93059-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German population found the Pacifism of the Quakers attractive, as the former saw it as protection from the draft and high taxes.&lt;ref name=crucible /&gt; However, John Isaac also drew the Germans to their cause by making property available to them, in addition to doing regular business with the Germans.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Although the Quakers had won the favor of the German citizens, they, like the Anglicans, resented the Germans who had begun migrating to the colony after 1715.&lt;ref name="Nash, Gary B. 1765. pp. 605"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nash |first=Gary B. |title=The Transformation of Urban Politics 1700–1765 |journal=The Journal of American History |volume=60 |issue=3 |year=1973 |pages=605–632 |jstor=1917681 |doi=10.2307/1917681}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1750s the German population of Pennsylvania had increased greatly, with 40% of the colony's constituents being German.&lt;ref name="Nash, Gary B. 1765. pp. 605"/&gt; Throughout the same decade, the German vote was effectively split and didn't play much of a factor in elections; however, it began to change in the 1760s, when the Propriety party began to recruit the equally disliked Dutch to their side, and the Quakers saw it necessary to double down on their attempts to gain the support of the Germans.&lt;ref name="Nash, Gary B. 1765. pp. 605"/&gt; The Germans were much more fond of farming than politics, thus, rather than striving to gain political power themselves, they fancied their position as the swing votes, as it ensured that they would benefit from those who needed their support.&lt;ref name="Nash, Gary B. 1765. pp. 605"/&gt;

Failing to win the favor of the German vote, William Allen and his fellow Anglicans sought to amend the election process by reviving a 1739 election law that provided party-specific election inspectors.&lt;ref name=mccoy&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Michael B.|title=Absconding Servants, Anxious Germans, and Angry Sailors: Working People and the Making of the Philadelphia Election Riot of 1742|journal=Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies|volume=74|issue=4|date=October 2007|pages=427–451 |jstor=27778798 |url=https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/viewFile/59520/59244}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this was because of the distrust of the Quakers which derived from their prior electoral day shenanigans. The Quakers, from 1739 to 1741, had taken advantage of the voting process, in which the election official would collect the filled out ballot from the citizen and run it upstairs to the counting area, by blocking the stairs and only allowing favorable ballots through.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Allen hoped that the revival of the election law would allow for a fair vote. However the two sides could not agree on the means by which to guarantee a fair election and, as such, the distrust grew between the two sides.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

With election day coming fast, both sides had damning rumors swirling around their base. The Quakers believed that the Anglicans were going to attack the polls with a large number of vigilantes, which they were, as a few dozen sailors had been hired.&lt;ref name=crucible /&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; On the other hand, the Anglicans believed that the Quakers were upping their effort to obstruct the voting officials by bringing even more Germans, which they were, and other citizens who were seen as unqualified to vote.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

== Election Day ==

On October 1, 1742, the "Bloody Election" as scholars refer to it, violence broke out between the Quakers and Proprietary party. The voting was to take place in the "Market Place" for the City of Philadelphia and Philadelphia County elections at 9:00&amp;nbsp;am, and city officials had asked that no weapons be carried due to a fear of violence.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; At the polls, the two sides debated once more over who should be the inspectors of the election.&lt;ref name=mccoy /&gt; While the debate was occurring, about fifty to eighty sailors carrying blunt objects, mostly clubs, gathered among the crowd.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Just as Isaac Norris II was chosen as an inspector, the mob of sailors violently assaulted the crowd.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Even though the sailors were destroying property and injuring many, when Allen was asked to call the sailors off, he claimed they had as much right to be there as the Dutch and Germans.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Eventually, German and Dutch citizens picked up makeshift weapons of their own to beat back the assailant sailors, who retreated to their ships.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

William Allen was widely blamed for the riots and, thus, the riot politically benefitted the Quakers, who did better in the coming elections, as the Anglican's Proprietary party lost the election in a landslide.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Reports show that many voters had altered their original ballots, crossing out their original vote for the proprietary party and instead voting for the Quaker Party.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt;

Fifty-four sailors and party leaders were jailed. Allen, the proprietary leader, in an effort to clear his name, sued one of the Quaker leaders for claiming that Allen had planned to assault. The matter was turned over to the Quaker-led Assembly (over Allen's objections) for investigation. The Assembly cast the investigation as the result of public outcry, when it is likely none truly existed.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; After questioning 49 witnesses, most of whom were Quakers and including none of the sailors, the Assembly ruled that Allen, his business partner, the mayor and two others (all Anglicans) should be investigated for being negligent in their duties and subverting the [[Frame of Government of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Charter]]. Allen was ruled the instigator of the riot. After months of investigation, they turned the matter over to the Quaker-controlled Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

The Governor, an Anglican, stated that the city's Mayor's Court had jurisdiction, meaning the Recorder, Alderman and Mayor (all Anglicans) would hear the case. The Assembly protested that the Mayor was one of the accused and would be hearing his own case.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; Eventually, a Quaker-devised compromise was reached. Charges were withdrawn, as was the original slander suit, and steps were taken to define election procedures and prevent future riots.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

The Philadelphia Election Riot, along with other riots taking place during the same time period in cities like New York and Boston, are important in examining the American Revolution.&lt;ref name="Nash, Gary B. 1765. pp. 605"/&gt; Riots taking place in these cities represented a radical change in the way that citizens interacted with their government. "This transformation involved quiescent lower-class elements; the organization of political clubs, caucuses, and tickets; the employment of political literature and inflammatory political rhetoric as never before; the involvement of the clergy and churches in politics; and the organization of mobs and violence for political purposes."&lt;ref name="Nash, Gary B. 1765. pp. 605"/&gt;

'''Punctuated equilibrium in social theory''' is a method of understanding change in complex social systems. The method studies the evolution of  policy change,&lt;ref name=Baumgartner1993&gt;Baumgartner, Frank and Bryan D. Jones (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0WtEOcK_Y8wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Agendas and Instability in American Politics]''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; including the evolution of conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Cioffi-Revilla, Claudio (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Dr2xTy8NuHcC&amp;pg=PA64 "The political uncertainty of interstate rivalries: A punctuated equilibrium model."] In Paul Diehl ''The Dynamics of Enduring Rivalries''.  Chicago: University of Illinois Press, pp. 64-97.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory suggests that most social systems exist in an extended period of stasis, which are later punctuated by sudden shifts in radical change. The theory was largely inspired from the biological theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] developed by paleontologists [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

The punctuated equilibrium model of policy change was first presented by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones in 1993,&lt;ref name=Baumgartner1993 /&gt; and has increasingly received attention in [[historical institutionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, Paul. (2004). ''Politics in Time: History, Institutions, and Social Analysis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The model states that policy generally changes only incrementally due to several restraints, namely the "stickiness" of institutional cultures, vested interests, and the [[bounded rationality]] of individual decision-makers. Policy change will thus be punctuated by changes in these conditions, especially in party control of [[government]], or changes in [[public opinion]]. Thus policy is characterized by long periods of stability, punctuated by large—though less frequent—changes due to large shifts in society or government. This has been particularly evident in current trends of [[environmental policy|environmental]] and [[energy policy]]. [[Gun control]] and U.S. [[Tobacco smoking|federal tobacco]] policy have also been found to follow punctuated changes. A 2017 study demonstrates that these patterns are also found in policy-making by international organizations, such as the United Nations or the African Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|last2=Squatrito|first2=Theresa|last3=Tallberg|first3=Jonas|date=2017|title=Stability and change in international policy-making: A punctuated equilibrium approach|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=13|issue=4|pages=547–572|doi=10.1007/s11558-017-9288-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study by Michael Givel found that despite a significant mobilization to change state tobacco policy, U.S. state tobacco policymaking from 1990 to 2003 was not characterized by punctuated policy change, which also favored the pro-tobacco policy agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Givel, Michael (2006). "Punctuated Equilibrium in Limbo: The Tobacco Lobby and U.S. State Policy Making From 1990 to 2003." ''Policy Studies Journal'' 43 (3): 405-418.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Connie Gersick's research on the evolution of organizational systems (1988, 1991) revealed patterns of change mirroring those in biological species. Gersick examined models of change in six domains - developmental patterns of adults, [[group development|group]]s and organizations, the history of science, physical science, and biological evolution - and found evidence for punctuated equilibria (as opposed to steady, incremental change) across those disparate systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gersick, Connie (1991). "Revolutionary Change Theories: A Multilevel Exploration of the Punctuated Equilibrium Paradigm". The Academy of Management Review 16(1): 10-36&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of the theory have been in  [[Organizational studies|organizational theory]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael L. Tushman|Tushman, M. L.]] and E. Romanelli (1985). "Organizational evolution: Ametamorphosis model of convergence and reorientation." In B. M. Staw &amp; L. L. Cummings (Eds.), ''Research in organizational behavior''.

As some researchers have noted, the biological applications of punctuated equilibrium have rejuvenated a new "theory about change within entities."&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, H., M. S. Poole, K. B. Henry, S. Wheelan, and R. Moreland (2004). "Time, change, and development: The temporal perspective on groups." ''Small Group Research'' 35 (1): 73-105.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, social scientific applications of the punctuated equilibrium concept have been criticized for losing sight of a core idea in the original biological theory of punctuated equilibrium: the notion that geographic location plays a significant role in determining which populations are subject to abrupt changes at a given time.&lt;ref name=TilcsikMarquis /&gt;

[[Wikipedia]] has been criticized for having a systemic racial bias in its coverage, due to an under-representation of [[people of color]] within its editor base.&lt;ref name=philly&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Melamed |first1 = Samantha |title = Edit-athon aims to put left-out black artists into Wikipedia |url = http://articles.philly.com/2015-03-26/entertainment/60480419_1_new-artists-american-art-philadelphia-museum |website = Philly.com |accessdate = 13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The past president of [[List of Wikimedia chapters|Wikimedia D.C.]], James Hare, noted that "a lot of [[African-American history|black history]] is left out" of Wikipedia, due to articles predominately being written by white editors.&lt;ref name=NYtimes&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Smith |first1 = Jada |title = Howard University Fills in Wikipedia’s Gaps in Black History |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/us/at-howard-a-historically-black-university-filling-in-wikipedias-gaps-in-color.html |website = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate = 13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles that do exist on African topics are, according to some, largely edited by editors from Europe and North America and thus reflect only their knowledge and consumption of media, which "tend to perpetuate a negative image" of Africa.&lt;ref name=BusinessDay&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Goko |first1 = Colleen |title = Drive launched to ‘Africanise’ Wikipedia |url = http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/technology/2013/09/23/drive-launched-to-africanise-wikipedia |website = [[Business Day (South Africa)|BusinessDay]] |accessdate = 13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maira Liriano of the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]], has argued that the lack of information regarding [[African diaspora|black history]] on Wikipedia "makes it seem like it's not important."&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Cassano |first1 = Jay |title = Black History Matters, So Why Is Wikipedia Missing So Much Of It? |url = http://www.fastcoexist.com/3041572/black-history-matters-so-why-is-wikipedia-missing-so-much-of-it |website = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |accessdate = 13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}

Different theories have been provided to explain these racial discrepancies. Jay Cassano, writing for ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' magazine, argued that Wikipedia's small proportion of black editors is a result of the small black presence within the technology sector, and a relative lack of reliable access to the Internet.&lt;ref name="Fast Company" /&gt; [[Katherine Maher]], executive director of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], has argued that the specific focuses in Wikipedia's content are representative of those of society as a whole. She said that Wikipedia could only represent that which was referenced in [[secondary sources]], which historically have been favourable towards and focused on white men.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Lapowsky |first1 = Issie |title = Meet the Editors Fighting Racism and Sexism on Wikipedia |url = https://www.wired.com/2015/03/wikipedia-sexism/ |website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate = 13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Studies have shown that content on Wikipedia suffers from the bias of its editors – [who are] mainly [[High technology|technically inclined]], English-speaking, [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] men living in majority-Christian, developed countries in the Northern hemisphere”.&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/wikipedia-gender-racial-bias_n_7054550 |title = Editors Are Trying To Fix Wikipedia's Gender And Racial Bias Problem |last = Boboltz |first = Sara |date = 15 April 2015 |website = www.huffingtonpost.ca |publisher = Huffington Post |access-date = 20 August 2017 |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==

According to Maira Liriano, the associate chief librarian at New York City’s Schomburg Center, one of the biggest challenges is getting new editors to keep editing Wikipedia after the edit-a-thon is over.&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; One challenge with retaining new editors is that the “[n]erdy white guys” who predominate as Wikipedia editors “…aren't always warm and nurturing” to new editors.&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; For example, when new editors add content on Black history, their content may be deleted by established editors. As well, when new editors are trying to advocate for the inclusion of Black history content on Wikipedia’s talk pages (each article has an associated talk page for discussion of changes), the “[c]omments [to new editors] on [Wikipedia article] talk pages can be very blunt.”&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; An issue for women of colour is that “women in many communities have less leisure time than men,” according to [[Siko Bouterse]], the director of community resources at the Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt;

Another challenge for editors trying to add Black history articles to Wikipedia is the requirement that potential article topics, such as historical individuals or events, meet Wikipedia’s “[[WP:Notability|notability]]” criteria.&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; ‘’HuffPost’’ states that the Wikipedia notability criteria “…is a troubling problem for those fighting for more content about women and minorities”, because “…there's simply less [published] documentation on many accomplished women and minorities throughout history -- they were often ignored, after all, or forced to make their contributions as someone else's assistant”.&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt;

Maher states that one issue is that “…content on Wikipedia has to be backed up by [[secondary source]]s, sources that she says throughout history have contained a bias toward white men”; “…people of color have not been represented in mainstream knowledge creation or inclusion in that knowledge,” as “…encyclopedias of old were mostly written by European men.”&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; Another issue is the “often abusive relationships between editors” on talk pages, which “…can make Wikipedia a less than welcoming place for …minority groups looking to get involved” in editing Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; The Wikipedia editing "...community can also appear hostile, both to outsiders looking in and to those involved in it" by editing articles; indeed, article "[t]alk pages [discussions about articles] routinely devolve into seemingly petty arguments".&lt;ref name=atlantic-18nov2015&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/how-does-political-wikipedia-stay-apolitical/450948/ |title = How Does Political Wikipedia Stay Apolitical?: The seventh-most visited site is one of the first online listings for any elected official—but how does a site that stakes its reputation on neutrality walk that line |last = Montellaro |first = Zach |date = 18 November 2015 |website = www.theatlantic.com |publisher = The Atlantic |access-date = 20 August 2017 |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been "...criticism of bias [on Wikipedia], both on individual pages [articles] and as a systemic mind-set that the editing network has as a whole."&lt;ref name=atlantic-18nov2015 /&gt; [[William Beutler]], author of the blog [[The Wikipedian]] and a consultant on Wikipedia issues for clients, states that "...certain areas of Wikipedia, including certain political areas of Wikipedia...tend to be controlled by a small number of editors who tend to see things the same way."&lt;ref name=atlantic-18nov2015 /&gt; Various communities have raised concerns about "...Wikipedia and its editors, saying that the pages had obvious systemic bias against them."&lt;ref name=atlantic-18nov2015 /&gt;

[[File:WikiConference North America 20170810-7225.jpg|thumb|Sherry Antoine of [[AfroCrowd|AfroCROWD]] presents at [[WikiConference North America]], August 2017]]

Attempts have been made to rectify racial biases through [[edit-a-thon]]s, organised events at which Wikipedia editors attempt to improve coverage of certain topics and train new editors. In February 2015, multiple edit-a-thons were organised to commemorate [[Black History Month]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/us/at-howard-a-historically-black-university-filling-in-wikipedias-gaps-in-color.html|title=Howard University Fills in Wikipedia’s Gaps in Black History|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One such edit-a-thon was organized by the White House to create and improve articles on [[African Americans]] in science, technology, engineering and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]).&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; The [[Schomburg Center]], [[Howard University]], and [[National Public Radio]], also coordinated edit-a-thons to improve coverage of black history.&lt;ref name=NYtimes /&gt; "Wikipedia editors… have held 'edit-a-thons,'" to "....encourage others to come learn how to…contribute content on subjects that have been largely ignored.”&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; Liriano has endorsed Wikipedia edit-a-thons, stating that for Wikipedia’s content to "…be representative, everyone has to participate."

In 2015 and 2016, the Schomburg Center held a “Black Lives Matters” edit-a-thon to coincide with [[Black History Month]]. Volunteer editors added coverage about Black historical individuals and about key concepts in black culture (e.g., about the [[Harlem Book Fair]] and about Black costume designer [[Judy Dearing]])&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; New articles about Black history and Black historical individuals were also created. The 2016 edit-a-thon was organized by [[AfroCrowd|AfroCROWD]].&lt;ref name="nytimes-29feb2016"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Allum |first1 = Cynthia |title = Women leading movements to champion equality on Wikipedia |url = http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/02/29/women-leading-movements-to-champion-equality-on-wikipedia/ |accessdate = 20 August 2017 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = 29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia editors Michael Mandiberg and Dorothy Howard have organized diversity-themed edit-a-thons to “…help raise awareness of some of the glaring holes on Wikipedia, and the need for people with diverse backgrounds and knowledge to fill them”.&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; Liriano stated “It's really important that people of color know that there's this gap” of coverage of Black history on Wikipedia “…and they can correct it” by participating as editors.&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; In the US, the [[National Science Foundation]] has provided $200,000 to fund research on the issue of bias in the coverage of topics in Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; The National Science Foundation has commissioned two studies of why there is bias in Wikipedia editing.&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt;

The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] is trying to deal with the issue of racial bias in Wikipedia. In 2015, it was reported that the Wikipedia Foundation made numerous grants “…to organizations in the "Global South" -- including Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East -- with plans to improve [coverage of Global South topics in] Wikipedia.“&lt;ref name=huffpo-15apr2015 /&gt; While Wikipedia supports these edit-a-thons, the organization has always stressed that adequate citations must always be present and neutrality must always be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Reynosa |first1 = Peter |title = Why Don't More Latinos Contribute To Wikipedia? |url = http://eltecolote.org/content/en/commentary/why-dont-more-latinos-contribute-to-wikipedia/ |publisher = [[El Tecolote (newspaper)|El Tecolote]] |accessdate = December 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] has stated that the Wikimedia Foundation has “completely failed” to meet its goals of resolving the lack of diversity amongst Wikipedia editors.&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt;

'''Ray Comfort''' (born 5 December 1949) is a New Zealand Christian minister and [[Evangelism|evangelist]] who lives in the United States. Comfort started Living Waters Publications and ''[[The Way of the Master]]'' in [[Bellflower, California]], and has written a number of books.

==Early life==
According to Comfort's autobiography, his parents put "[[Methodist]]" on his birth certificate but he was given no religious instruction as a child.&lt;ref name=AboutRay/&gt;&lt;ref name=cz&gt;{{cite book|last=Comfort|first=Ray|title=Out of the Comfort Zone: The Authorized Autobiography|year=2003|publisher=Bridge-Logos Publishers|isbn=978-0-88270-943-7|pages=123, 202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort identifies himself as both Christian and Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Busek|first1=Craig|title=Ray Comfort: The Evidence Bible|url=http://www1.cbn.com/churchandministry/ray-comfort-the-evidence-bible|publisher=[[Christian Broadcasting Network]]|quote=I cannot express to you how grateful I am that I am a Christian.|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jew&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wqMdLiV970C&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=ray+comfort+jewish#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Nothing Created Everything: The Scientific Impossibility of Atheistic Evolution|quote=Jesus was Jewish.

==Career==
In 1989, Comfort accepted an invitation to join the pastoral staff at the non-denominational [[Calvary Chapel]] in Southern California.&lt;ref name=BullyPulpit&gt;{{cite web | last=Comfort | first=Ray | url=http://www.bullypulpit.com/raycomfort/2011/03/atheists-question-my-education.html | title=Atheists Question my Education | date=3 March 2011 | publisher=Bully Pulpit | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131114011242/http://www.bullypulpit.com/raycomfort/2011/03/atheists-question-my-education.html | archivedate=14 November 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Way of the Master'' ministry==
[[File:Inside a wild-type banana.jpg|thumb|An inedible wild banana, cut to expose its many seeds.]]In the mid-1990s Comfort persuaded [[Kirk Cameron]], star of the cancelled hit sitcom ''[[Growing Pains]]'', to become an evangelist.  In 2002, the pair formed an organization called ''[[The Way of the Master]]'', with the intention of teaching the church to more effectively preach the message of evangelical Christianity.&lt;ref name="Nightline2007page3"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=1735434&amp;page=3 | title=Kirk Cameron, From Sitcom Star to Evangelist | publisher=[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]] |date= 17 March 2006 | first=Martin | last=Bashir | accessdate =17 May 2007 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comfort says that evangelism is the main reason the Christian Church exists and that many of the evangelistic methods used over the last century have produced false conversions to Christianity. Comfort often uses the [[Ten Commandments]] to speak about [[sin]] before presenting the [[gospel|gospel of Jesus]]. In the mid-1980s he formulated two sermons entitled "Hell's Best Kept Secret"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|last=Comfort|first=Ray|title=Hell's Best Kept Secret|url=http://vimeo.com/4186384|publisher=WVCY-TV 30|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "True and False Conversions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|last=Comfort|first=Ray|title=True &amp; False Conversions|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_vRvn0rRFY|accessdate=2 April 2014|date=3 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comfort speaks professionally at churches and evangelism seminars, and preaches in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. As well as co-hosting the former ''The Way of the Master Radio'' with [[Kirk Cameron]], he is co-host of ''[[The Way of the Master Television Show]]''.

In 2006, Comfort recorded a segment for ''The Way of the Master''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s television show in which he argued that the [[banana]] was an "atheists' nightmare", arguing that it displayed many user-friendly features that were evidence of [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z-OLG0KyR4|title = Kirk Cameron and Bananas|date = 28 Apr 2006|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Living Waters|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort retracted the video upon learning that the banana is a result of [[Plant breeding|artificial selection]] by humans, and that the [[Musa acuminata|wild banana]] is small and unpalatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Behold, The Atheists' Nightmare!'|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/24/ray-comforts-banana-argument_n_4847082.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
[[File:5.5.07RRSWotMDebateBashirByLuigiNovi2.jpg|thumb|right|Comfort, seated behind [[Kirk Cameron]], at a debate on the existence of God at [[Calvary Baptist Church (Manhattan, New York)|Calvary Baptist Church]] in [[Manhattan]], 5 May 2007]]

On 13 April 2001, Comfort appeared at the 27th National Convention of [[American Atheists]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], where he debated [[Ron Barrier]], the National Spokesperson for American Atheists.&lt;ref name="assist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assistnews.net/strategic/s0104040.htm |title=Atheists National Spokesman Debates Christian Author on Good Friday at National Convention |last=Ireland |first=Michael |date=16 April 2001 |work=AssistNews.net |accessdate=23 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort later stated that "they laughed at my humor, and although there was unified mockery at some of the things that I said, I was able to go through the [[Ten Commandments]], the fact of [[Judgment Day]], the reality of [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Cross]], and the necessity of [[Repentance#Protestantism|repentance]], and no one stopped me."&lt;ref name="assist"/&gt;

On 5 May 2007, Comfort and Cameron participated in a televised debate with [[Brian Sapient]] and Kelly O'Connor of the [[Rational Response Squad]], at [[Calvary Baptist Church (Manhattan, New York)|Calvary Baptist Church]] in [[Manhattan]]. The debate focused on the existence of God, which Comfort claimed he could prove scientifically without relying on faith or the Bible. ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' correspondent [[Martin Bashir]] moderated the event.&lt;ref name=BashirFaceoff /&gt; During the debate, Cameron and Comfort repeatedly referenced the Ten Commandments and denied the theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=BashirFaceoff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3148940&amp;page=1 |title=The Nightline Face-Off |last=Bashir |first=Martin |date=7 May 2007 |work=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Comfort challenged [[Richard Dawkins]] to a debate, offering to donate $10,000 to him.&lt;ref name=DawkinsOffer /&gt; Dawkins, who had previously stated a general policy not to debate with creationists,&lt;ref name=DawkinsOffer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/119|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813202748/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/119|archivedate=13 August 2012|title=Why I Won't Debate Creationists |date=14 May 2006 |work=RichardDawkins.net |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |accessdate=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; said he would agree to do it if Comfort made a $100,000 donation to the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] non-profit organization. Comfort raised his offer to $20,000, which according to [[PZ Myers]] was "not enough."&lt;ref name=DawkinsOfferMysers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/24/got-100000/|last=Myers|first=PZ|title=Got $100,000?|work=Pharyngula|publisher=ScienceBlogs|date=24 Feb 2009|accessdate=2 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracts ===
[[File:Living Waters tracts.JPG|thumbnail|right|Gospel tracts produced by Ray Comfort's ministry, Living Waters]]
According to Comfort, he has designed dozens of [[gospel tract]]s since the 1970s, and sells millions of Living Waters tracts each year.&lt;ref name="ComfortAuto"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Comfort |given1=Ray |date=May 2004 |title=Out of the Comfort Zone: The Authorized Autobiography |publisher=Bridge-Logos Publishers |isbn=0-88270-943-7 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his tracts are designed to resemble paper money, including fake $100, $1,000 and $1 million bills. Others employ novelties intended to amuse, such as a "ticket to heaven" that invites the reader to tear it if they do not need it; the ticket is printed on a [[polymer banknote|polymer substrate]], making it extremely durable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.livingwaters.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=128&amp;category_id=8&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=369&amp;lang=en |title=Ticket to Heaven |publisher=Living Waters Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracts typically attempt to persuade the reader that on [[Last Judgment#Christianity|judgment day]], they will certainly be found guilty of breaking one or more of the [[Ten Commandments#Protestant Christianity|Ten Commandments]], and therefore will be sent to [[Hell in Christian beliefs|hell]], unless they say a [[Sinner's prayer|prayer]] to acknowledge Christ's [[substitutionary atonement]].

In June 2006, agents of the US [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] confiscated thousands of Ray Comfort's "Million Dollar Bill" gospel tracts from Darrel Rundus, president of Great News Network. A federal district court judge ruled that the tracts, which were marked as "not legal tender", did not violate federal law and ordered their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2010, ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' reported that elderly people received "appointment cards" by Comfort's California-based publishing company, Living Waters, asking them to fill out information regarding the date and time of their deaths, and advising them to contact evangelists in order to avoid hell. Recipients of these cards expressed anger and horror over receiving them, and contacted police over the matter, with one of them commenting, "It's disgusting. It was quite spooky. I just couldn't comprehend why anyone would ask you to predict the date of your death." ''The New Zealand Herald'' summarized a statement from Living Waters spokesperson Lisa Law as saying that "the cards were a way of raising awareness of human mortality in order to spark discussion about Jesus", and that Law "did not know who sent [the tracts]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Joanne|title='Appointment with death' cards shocking for elderly|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10684299|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abridged version of ''On the Origin of Species'' ====
In November 2009, Comfort released an edited and abridged version of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', with a 50-page foreword detailing [[Objections to evolution|creationist arguments against the theory of evolution]].&lt;ref name=dissA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/analysis.php |title=The Don't Diss Darwin Institute |year=2009 |work=Analysis and synopsis |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=20 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191825/http://www.dontdissdarwin.com/analysis.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }} via [[Archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was given away for free at selected schools around the United States.&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/10/29/exclusive-ray-comfort-defends-his-creationist-edition-of-on-the-origin-of-species.html |title=Exclusive: Ray Comfort Defends His Creationist Edition of 'On the Origin of Species' |last=Gilgoff |first=Dan|last2=Comfort|first2=Ray |date=29 October 2009 |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stan Guffey, a biologist at the [[University of Tennessee]], alleged that most of Comfort's section on Darwin's life was plagiarised from his work.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Laura|url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2009/11/23/origin_into_schools/|title=Creationism vs. atheism: It's on!|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall |first=Rikki |url=http://www.metropulse.com/news/2009/dec/02/ut-professor-considers-legal-action-over-use-charl/ |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[University of Tennessee]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Professor Considers Legal Action Over Use of Charles Darwin Bio |work=[[Metro Pulse]] |publisher=Scripps Interactive Newspapers Group |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727095208/http://www.metropulse.com/news/2009/dec/02/ut-professor-considers-legal-action-over-use-charl/ |archivedate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Comfort's website, "nothing has been removed from Darwin's original work",&lt;ref name="ComfortOriginsPromote"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livingwaters.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=383 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109051344/http://www.livingwaters.com/index.php?id=383&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view |title=Origin Into Schools  |archivedate=9 November 2009| year= 2009 |publisher=Living Waters|accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Eugenie C. Scott]], executive director of the [[National Center for Science Education]] (NCSE), noted that Comfort deleted four chapters by Darwin that described the evidence for evolution, adding that two of the omitted chapters, Chapters 11 and 12, showcased biogeography, some of Darwin's strongest evidence for evolution.&lt;ref name="ComfortDistorts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/10/30/how-creationist-origin-distorts-darwin.html |title=How Creationist 'Origin' Distorts Darwin |last=Scott |first=Eugenie |date=30 October 2009 |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote that Comfort's foreword is "a hopeless mess of long-ago-refuted creationist arguments, teeming with misinformation about the science of evolution, populated by legions of [[strawmen]], and exhibiting what can be charitably described as muddled thinking".

On his website, Comfort said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted in order to make the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, and that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Kit: Origin into Schools|publisher=Living Waters|url=http://www.livingwaters.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=346&amp;catid=33&amp;Itemid=74|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603010654/http://www.livingwaters.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=346&amp;catid=33&amp;Itemid=74|archivedate=3 June 2010|date=2009|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DarwinComfort&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Darwin, Charles]]|title=[[The Origin of Species]]|edition=150th Anniversary|editor-last=Comfort|editor-first=Ray|isbn=978-0882709192|date=September 2009|publisher=Bridge Logos Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCSE arranged a campaign at colleges across the US to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction, a one-page flier,&lt;ref name=dissA/&gt; and "the NCSE Safety Bookmark" in the shape of a banana, a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God.&lt;ref name=DDDI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2009/11/got-comfort-get-protection-005171 |title=Got Comfort?

In 2011, Comfort wrote and produced a 33-minute documentary film called ''[[180 (2011 American film)|180: Changing the Heart of a Nation]]''. The film was criticized by ''The Huffington Post'' for its comparison of [[abortion]] to the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/12/180-abortion-holocaust-prolife_n_1007165.html |title='180' Documentary Compares Abortion To Holocaust, Goes Viral Among Pro-Life Groups|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=12 October 2011|quote=The film, which shows a series of graphic images, is gaining attention not only because of its controversial comparison, but because it highlights 14 people who do not know who Adolf Hitler was}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{British Army}}
The [[British Army]] came into being with the unification of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707. The new British Army incorporated Regiments that had already existed in [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. The Army has traditionally relied on volunteer recruits, the only exceptions to this being during the latter part of the [[First World War]] until 1919, and then again during the [[Second World War]] when [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscription]] was brought in during the war and stayed until 1960.

==18th and 19th centuries==
{{see also|British soldiers in the eighteenth century}}

At the beginning of the 18th century, the standing strength of the British Army was reduced after the [[Treaty of Ryswick]], and stood at 7,000 troops at home and 14,000 based overseas,&lt;ref&gt;Young, p.25 para 1&lt;/ref&gt; with recruits ranging from 17 to 50 years of age. The army was kept small by the government during peacetime, mainly due to the fear that the army would be unduly influenced by the Crown or used to depose the government.&lt;ref name=Finchley&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.umich.edu/~ece/student_projects/soldier|title=The March of the Guards to Finchley; 18th Century Recruitment|publisher=Umich education|accessdate=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] of 1689 specifies that Parliamentary authority is needed to maintain a standing army in peacetime.

For much of the 18th century, the army was recruited in a wide variety of places, and many of its recruits were mercenaries from continental Europe, including [[Danish people|Danes]], [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]]s and [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanoverians]].&lt;ref name=Young254&gt;Young, p.25. para 4&lt;/ref&gt; These mercenaries were hired out by other rulers on contracted terms. Other regiments were formed of volunteers such as [[French Huguenots]]. By 1709, during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the British Army totalled 150,000 men, of whom 81,000 were foreign mercenaries.&lt;ref name=Young254/&gt; The rest of the army consisted of natives of the [[British Isles]] who, apart from the officers, were mainly recruited from the poorest sections of society. Each regiment was responsible for the recruitment of its own troops, and individual colonels would lead recruiting parties on tours of the towns and villages. This was emphasized by a popular play of the time called ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]''.&lt;ref name=Young261&gt;Young, p.26, para 1&lt;/ref&gt; Other powers were given by the British government to allow the forcible enlistment of [[vagrants]] and [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]]. Some of these powers were abused by recruiting officers desperate to fill their quotas, although a legalized [[Royal Navy]] [[Impressment|press-gang system]] would not be implemented yet,&lt;ref name=Young261/&gt; even though normal recruiting methods failed to supply the required annual influx of troops, as the army was not a popular profession, with low pay, [[flogging]] and other barbarous disciplinary measures.&lt;ref name=Finchley/&gt; The army's recruiting methods and treatment of its soldiers would remain the same for the rest of the 18th century.

[[File:Caricature-1780-press gang.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Press gang, British caricature of 1780]]
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], a policy similar to the Royal Navy's [[Impressment|Press Gangs]] was introduced. Two acts were passed, the [[Recruiting Act 1778]] and the [[Recruiting Act 1779]], for the [[Impressment#British army impressment laws|impressment]] of individuals. For some men this would have been for being drunk and disorderly. The chief advantages of these acts was in the number of volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. To avoid impressment, some recruits incapacitated themselves by cutting off the thumb and forefinger of the right hand. Both acts were repealed in 1780.&lt;ref name=americanrevolution&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americanrevolution.org/britsol.html|title= Soldier of the King; Recruitment during American Revolution| publisher=americanrevolution.org|accessdate=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Government also released [[criminals]] and [[debtors]] from prison on the condition they joined the army. Three entire regiments during the American Revolution were raised from this early release programme.&lt;ref&gt;The New Cambridge Modern History: Vol. 7: The Old Regime, p. 183, para 4&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Volunteer recruits, some would find they had been enticed to take the [[King's shilling]] under false pretenses and many men would find they had signed to a lifetime in the army.&lt;ref name=americanrevolution/&gt;

After the defeat of Great Britain by the American revolutionaries, the British Army fell into dereliction (it should be noted that the army in 1775 was in a poor state anyway), morale and discipline were low, and troops levels fell.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p. 132, para 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Army was neglected as never before and its total strength in 1793 stood at 40,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.132, para 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Napoleonic wars===
{{see also|British Army during the Napoleonic Wars}}

[[File:British Army Recruiting poster Guards.jpg|thumb|British Army recruitment poster during the Napoleonic wars offering both limited and unlimited (long-term) service]]
The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]'s struggle with [[First French Empire|France]] during the [[Napoleonic wars]] required the British Army to expand rapidly. Ordinary recruiting methods failed to supply the number of men required to fill the Army ranks. The main methods used for recruiting were: private individuals were recruited for their own interests, volunteers from the [[militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] and placing obligations on communities to enlist. Generals called for conscription for the first time in British History, although this was never enacted for the regular army.&lt;ref name=Cookson&gt;Cookson, Page 111, para 3&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Great Britain was at a disadvantage to her enemy, as due to the [[Industrial Revolution]] potential recruits were instead drawn to the cities to earn more money in the many factories now being built in the country, while France was still largely an [[agrarian society]].

Competition from civilian occupations was intense and highlighted in the disparity in pay; where a private could earn 7s per week in 1806, a dockworker could expect to earn 28s.&lt;ref name=Oxford1372&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.137, para 2&lt;/ref&gt; However soldiers would expect to supplement this meagre income with promotion and loot on campaign. During the early phases of the war, joining the Army could still mean effectively joining for life, which was frequently brutally cut short. For instance, a posting to the Caribbean in 1790 was seen as a near death sentence, as thousands of men died or were disabled by disease there.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.138, para 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Army still struggled to raise the troops required to replace the discharged, wounded and dead as the war against France continued. As early as 1794, 18,596 soldiers died on active service and another 40,639 men were discharged.&lt;ref name=Oxford1372/&gt; This would remain a constant theme during the Napoleonic wars, and the British Army also used foreign volunteers, such as [[Legitimists|French Royalists]], [[German People|Germans]], [[Greeks]] and [[Corsica]]ns to supplement its forces. In 1813 one fifth of the army, 52,000 men, were such volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.138, para 2&lt;/ref&gt; The British Army in 1813 contained over 250,000 men,&lt;ref name="Oxford132"&gt;Chandler &amp; Beckett, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; though this was much larger in comparison to the army at the beginning of the war, the all volunteer British army was still much smaller than that of France, which with conscription had an army over 2.6 million.&lt;ref name=Cookson/&gt;

====Reform====
{{see also|History of British light infantry}}

From 1798 onwards, structural, training and logistical reforms implemented or authorised by the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] (as commander-in-chief of the army) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/wars_conflict/soldiers/soldier_trade_in_world_05.shtml|title=The Soldier's Trade in a Changing World|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; slowly improved the lot of the ordinary soldier. York oversaw a crackdown on corruption&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; and removed the threat of [[corporal punishment]] for a large number of petty offences (while it was still retained for serious derelictions of duty). He also stamped down on the abuse of buying officer commissions, making it necessary for officers to serve two full years before either promotion or purchase to captain and six years before becoming a [[major]]&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, R. (2002) ''Redcoat: The British Soldier in the Age of Horse and Musket'' pg 158&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]] for officers was instigated due to York's influence,&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; while regular recruits to the army were allowed to join under contract for limited periods, rather than for life. Men such as [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]], [[Thomas Sydney Beckwith]] and [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Rowland Hill]] characterised the new breed of officers who sought to improve the relationship between officers and men, motivating troops through mutual respect, reward and promotion rather than by relying on punishment. The [[Shorncliffe System]] for [[light infantry]] was established, being devised by [[Sir Kenneth Mackenzie Douglas, 1st Baronet|Lt-Col Kenneth Mackenzie]], and trained soldiers to think for themselves and act on initiative while the light infantry officers drilled alongside the men fostering comradeship. In addition, the introduction of new tactical and organisational flexibility contributed a great deal to the successes of the Peninsula and Waterloo.

===Post-Napoleonic army===
After the victory in the Napoleonic wars, there followed 40 years of peace in Europe during which the army would again revert to its peacetime role. The Army that won the war was again neglected in the peace. The Government's immediate priority was to cut taxes, to lessen the burden of taxation on the economy, which had remained high over the previous 20 years, to pay for the expensive war that enabled Britain to be victorious over France. The British Army funding would be cut drastically in the short term, but as became evident this would apply for the next 40 years. The budget was cut from £43 million in 1815, to £10.7 million in 1820, £8 million in 1836 and only rose slightly 10 years later to £9.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of the British Army'', p.163, para 3&lt;/ref&gt; With the budget cuts, troop levels were inevitably cut from 233,592 men in 1815 to 102,529 men by 1828. There were further reductions in 1838, after which troop strength stood at 91,388.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.164, para 2&lt;/ref&gt; With the constant cuts, recruiting parties would achieve their reduced recruiting targets with greater ease.

===1870 reforms===
{{main article|Cardwell reforms}}

The army during peacetime was deliberately kept small and the recruitment methods would only change once the [[Cardwell reforms]] were implemented in the 1870s. The [[Crimean War]] nevertheless highlighted several defects and weaknesses in the Army's organisation. Although in theory, 70,000 soldiers were stationed in Britain, it was found that this number included several units in transit from distant outposts of the Empire, and some underdeveloped recruits and many old soldiers whose constitution had been ruined by harsh climate and disease and who were no longer capable of serving in the field. As a result, the provision of an expeditionary force of only 25,000 in the Crimea stripped Britain of almost every trained soldier.&lt;ref&gt;McElwee, pp.71–73&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Cardwell's reforms included the abolition of [[sale of commissions]], the banning of flogging and other measures, such as reducing the length of service, to make recruitment more appealing. An Enlistment Act saw a change in the terms of enlistment, which could at last produce some trained reserves and also made soldiering a more tempting career. A Localisation Scheme resulted in the pairing of single-battalion regiments via administrative depots on a county-based system.

===Officers and royalty===
Officers of the British army prior to the late 18th century were mainly recruited from a narrow segment of society, with a majority coming from the landed gentry and the aristocracy or often officers were from families with a military tradition. (This contrasted with the Navy, whose officers were more often from a middle-class background.)  The second son of [[King George III]], [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]], did much to improve the standard of officer recruitment from his position as Commander in Chief of the Army (from 1795 to 1809, then from 1811 to 1827). The sale of commissions, finally abolished in the Cardwell reforms in 1868–1874, and the further [[Childers Reforms]]. In spite of its abolition, the status of an officer being from a privileged background and that of another rank being from a less privileged one has, for the most part remained.

[[File:Inspection-New-Colours.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Army Parade with [[Prince Harry]]]]
The [[Royal Family]] traditionally had its members serve in the Armed Forces, usually with the Royal Navy though many have served with the Army. This occasionally warped operations in the field, for example at the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]], where Wolseley was forced to leave an entire brigade of Guards in reserve to avoid harm coming to Queen Victoria's third son, the [[Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]].&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, pp.157, 166&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition has continued into the 21st century, with [[Prince Harry]] and [[Prince William]] both joining the Army as officers. However, Royals are no longer deliberately kept out of harm's way; Prince Harry saw active service in Afghanistan until the publicity posed a threat to the troops serving with him, while [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] served as a front-line helicopter pilot with the Royal Navy during the [[Falklands War]].

Foreign Royals have also served in the Army, such as [[Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial|Eugène Bonaparte]], the son of [[Napoléon III]], who was commissioned into the [[Royal Artillery]], but was killed in 1879 while serving in [[South Africa]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]]. Later in the 20th century, [[King Abdullah II]] of [[Jordan]] served as a Second Lieutenant with the [[13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary's Own)]], and Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said al Said]] of [[Oman]] served with the [[Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]].

==First World War==
{{main article|Recruitment to the British Army during World War I}}
[[File:British recruits August 1914 Q53234.jpg|thumb|200px|British Volunteer recruits in London, August 1914, who would form [[Kitchener's Army|Kitchener's New Army]]]]

At the start of 1914, the British Army had a reported strength of 710,000 men including reserves, of which 247,432 were regular troops, also including 80,000 regular troops formed as the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.211, para 1&lt;/ref&gt; The recruitment drive would be spearheaded by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] once war had been declared in August 1914.

[[File:WWI recruitment poster with rebus.jpg|thumb|left|165px|World War I recruitment poster]]
It was abundantly clear that the army that the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser]] had referred to as a "contemptible little army" would need thousands more recruits. Young Britons answered the call, for [[King and Country]], and voluntarily joined the [[British Army]]. By early 1915 much of the regular army had been killed and were now replaced by the part-time volunteers of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Force]] and [[Kitchener's Army|Kitchener's new volunteer army]]. A feature of the volunteer army was the [[Pals battalion]]s, recruited from single communities or even factories, who were allowed to serve together. The Kitchener recruitment campaign had proved to be very successful, as on 1 September 1914, over 30,000 men enlisted.&lt;ref name=Young2163&gt;Young, p.216, para 3&lt;/ref&gt; With each day passing, thousands more were clamouring to be taken. The British Government soon realized the main drawback of this campaign, as opposed to the French and German conscriptions, which selected each individual men, a high proportion of men from skilled industries left their works, which would prove to be costly in the war effort. A better-controlled enlistment program would be required.&lt;ref name=Young2163/&gt;

The [[Military Service Act (United Kingdom)|Military Service Bill]] was enacted with effect from January 1916 and specified that men from the ages of 18 to 41 were liable to be called up for service unless they were married (or widowed with children), or else served in one of a number of reserved professions. By the end of World War I, almost a quarter of the total male population of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland had joined up, over five million men.

==Inter-war period 1919–38==
[[File:British Army Recruitment poster.JPG|thumb|right|165px|Inter-war period recruitment poster]]
After the [[World War I|Great war]] and the inevitable defence cuts that would follow, the army was reduced in size, and by 1920 had fallen to a strength of 370,000. There were a number of factors for the reductions in the size of British Army, and the cuts to the budget of the Army. The army now had competition from the new armed service, the [[History of the Royal Air Force#Formation and early history (1918–1939)|Royal Air Force]], which could patrol far greater land areas, and keep the far flung corners of [[British Empire|the Empire]] policed from the sky at a relatively cheaper cost. The defence budget for the army was repeatedly cut yearly, as in 1923 the army defence budget was 43.5&amp;nbsp;million [[pounds sterling]], and during the [[Great Depression]] in 1932 to just under 36&amp;nbsp;million pounds sterling. Only with the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], would the budget for the British army again increase, by 1938 to 123&amp;nbsp;million pounds sterling; the army again started a rapid recruitment program.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
''Further information:'' ''[[Conscription in the United Kingdom#First World War|Conscription in the United Kingdom during Second World War]]''
[[File:AVRE-Bobbin.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Skilled men were required to join the [[1st Assault Brigade Royal Engineers]] manning this modified Churchill tank, and to carry out [[combat engineering]] and other technical support]]
The pre-war army was an all-volunteer army and recruits were allotted to the corps of their wishes. The only pre-conditions placed on candidates were an interview with a recruiting officer, who could only glean partial information on a recruit, a medical examination, and some educational tests. If these requirements were met, the recruit was posted to the arm of his choice, there was no scientific selection process unlike the rapidly growing German army. This led to men being allocated to the wrong or unsuitable corps. The [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] attempted to address these problems, and the wider problems of the British army.&lt;ref&gt;Crang, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The process of allocating men would remain ad hoc at the start of the war. The army would be without the quotas of men required from skilled professions and trades, which modern warfare demanded. With the army being the least popular service compared to the navy and airforce, a higher proportion of army recruits were said to be dull and backward.&lt;ref&gt;Crang, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The following memorandum to the Executive Committee of the Army Council highlighted the growing concern. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The British Army is wasting manpower in this war almost as badly as it did in the last war. A man is posted to a Corps almost entirely on the demand of the moment and without any effort at personal selection by proper tests.”&lt;ref&gt;Crang, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Only with the creation of the [[Beveridge Report|Beveridge committee]] in 1941, and their subsequent findings in 1942, would the situation of skilled men not being assigned correctly, be addressed. The findings led directly to the creation of the [[General Service Corps]], and would remain in place long after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Crang, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Hore-Belisha had sought permission to introduce conscription in 1938 but was rebuffed by [[Neville Chamberlain]], who would not agree to increased defence spending. In early 1939, he was finally allowed to introduce conscription to meet the threat of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], with the [[Military Training Act 1939|Military Training Act of 27 April 1939]]. The act required all men aged 20 and 21 to take six months military training. This act was extended on the declaration of the war, to include all fit men between the ages of 18 and 41. [[Conscription]] was gradually brought in, starting in October 1939 and applying to all fit men between 20–23, and the age group was increased as the war continued.&lt;ref name="WW2 Peoples War"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/timeline/factfiles/nonflash/a1138664.shtml?sectionId=1&amp;articleId=1138664 |title=WW2 Peoples War |accessdate=30 August 2018 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[Second World War]], the British Army Strength stood at 897,000 men including reserves. By the end of 1939, the strength of the [[British Army]] stood at 1.1 million men, and further increased to 1.65 million men during June 1940.&lt;ref name="WW2 Peoples War" /&gt;

The Local Defence Volunteers was formed early in 1940. Very large numbers of civilians too old or too young for the Army, or barred from serving if they were in reserved occupations, volunteered for the new force. The organisation was eventually renamed the "Home Guard" and was to be part of the defence of Britain in the advent of a German invasion of Britain.

==From National Service to all-professional army==
{{further|Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945}}

As with the previous [[World War I|World War]], the end of wartime conscription saw the army reduced in size and reverting to its peacetime role of maintaining [[British Empire|the Empire]]. In 1947, [[British Raj|British India]] was given [[British Empire#End of British Raj|Independence]], which meant the loss of the [[British Indian Army]] and thousands of volunteer soldiers. The [[British Government]] had relied on the British Indian Army for Imperial matters. Now, without this army, the regular British Army was judged to be too small for the demands of an impending [[Cold War]] and maintaining [[British Empire|the Empire]]. To meet this demand, which volunteers alone would not, [[National Service Act 1948|peacetime conscription was enacted]] by the government and passed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1947. In the United Kingdom, it is this period of peacetime conscription that is usually referred to as 'National Service'. It remains the only period of peacetime conscription in UK history, apart from the periods immediately before and after World War II. The majority of National Servicemen went into the Army and, by 1951, National Servicemen made up half the force, leading to a reduced level of voluntary recruitment to the regular army. The last intake of National Servicemen took place in 1960, with the last National Serviceman being demobbed on 16 May 1963. The army reverted to an all professional volunteer service, which it remains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.britisharmedforces.org/ns/nat_history.htm|title= British Armed Forces – National Service|publisher= www.britisharmedforces.org|accessdate= |date= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120721065147/http://www.britisharmedforces.org/ns/nat_history.htm|archivedate= 21 July 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to abolish National Service was taken in 1957 with the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], which led to an enormous reduction in the number of soldiers between 1958–63, from about 330,000 to 165,000 by the end of National Service. In the decades that followed, cuts in the Army were the constant theme, although they were never on a large scale until the end of the cold war. Between 1963 and 1992, strength was reduced to 153,000. In 1990, the Government started another defence review, which concluded with the [[Defence White Paper]] of 1992. In a [[post-Soviet]] world, the white paper would again further reduce the army by 50,000,&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford History of the British Army, p.343, para 1&lt;/ref&gt; effectively ending the [[British Army of the Rhine]]. The current strength of the British army is approximately 102,000 regular personnel.

===Present day===
[[File:Army Careers Oxford 20051022.jpg|thumb|right|130px|A [[British Army]] recruitment centre.]] 
The Army mainly recruits within the United Kingdom, and normally has a recruitment target of around 25,000 soldiers per year. Low unemployment in Britain has resulted in the Army having difficulty in meeting its target, and in the early years of the 21st century there has been a marked increase in the number of recruits from mostly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

The minimum recruitment age is 16 years, after the end of [[GCSE]]s, although soldiers may not serve on operations below 18 years; the maximum recruitment age was raised in January 2007 from 26 to 33 years. The normal term of engagement is 22 years; and, once enlisted, soldiers are not normally permitted to leave until they have served at least four years. Soldiers are now Enlisted on a 24-year engagement known as versatile engagement (VEng). After 22 years service a soldier may be offered a 2-year extension. After the 2 years the soldier or officer maybe after a further 2 years service and thereafter until they reach 55 years of age.

==Empire and Commonwealth==

[[File:Australian WWI recruiting poster.jpg|thumb|Right|130px|An [[Australia]]n World War I recruitment poster]]
During both World Wars, subjects throughout the [[British Empire]] volunteered to help the [[United Kingdom]]. During World War I, the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] raised their own armies, but were under the British command structure, and very much integrated into the British fighting forces. Over 2.5 million men, which included Canada sending 418,000 men overseas, Australia sending 322,000,South Africa sending 230,000, New Zealand sending 124,000, and other volunteers from the [[Commonwealth of Nations#Members|Crown Colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/British+Empire+(World+War+I) |title=WW1 Dominion Armies |accessdate=30 August 2018 |dead-url=yes |publisher=Farlex encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During peacetime, [[British Empire]] soldiers were usually recruited into indigenous regiments, such as the [[Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps]], to garrison their own land, thus ensuring that the Army did not have to allocate its own units to garrison the territories. One of the oldest regiments raised from the empire was the [[West India Regiment]], which was raised in 1795, and was formed as an integral part of the regular [[British Army]]. The recruits of the West India Regiment were originally raised from freed slaves from [[North America]] and by the purchase of slaves in the [[West Indies]]; the regiment was disbanded in 1927. The [[Fiji Infantry Regiment]], which was raised in 1920 and consisted of a single battalion, garrisoned the Pacific territory. One of the largest units was the multi-battalion [[Royal West African Frontier Force]], which garrisoned British [[West Africa]] and included [[The Nigeria Regiment]].

===British Indian Army===
[[File:Indian Troops in France.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Indian troops on the western front]]
The largest of the colonial military forces was the British Indian Army. Up to Indian independence, this was a volunteer army, raised from the native population and staffed by British officers. The Indian Army served both as a security force in India itself and, particularly during the World Wars, in other theatres. The Indian Army proved a very useful adjunct to British forces wherever it served. Recruitment was entirely voluntary; about 1.3 million men served in the First World War, many on the Western Front, and 2.5 million in the Second. Initially the soldiers and NCOs were Indian, with British officers, but later Indian officers were promoted [[King's Commissioned Indian Officer]].

===Gurkhas===
[[File:Gurkhas exercise DM-SD-98-00170.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A British Gurkha unit]]
[[Brigade of Gurkhas|Gurkhas]] have been employed as an integral part of the Indian Army since the early 19th century. After Indian independence, some Gurkha units were transferred to the British Army. There are approximately 3,500 Gurkhas currently serving in the British Army. Joining the British Army is one of the few ways [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] people have of escaping poverty and earning a good salary. As a result, each year, there are thousands of applicants, as in 2007 when over 17,349 applied for just 230 posts.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://newsok.com/article/3245146/imperial-holdover-gurkhas-flock-to-british-army |title=Imperial holdover: Gurkhas flock to British army |last=Gray |first=Denis D. |date=17 May 2008 |work=NewsOK.com |accessdate=30 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4554870.stm|title= Current Gukhas levels and 2005 recruitment.| publisher= BBC| date=30 December 2005 | accessdate=4 January 2010| first=Martin| last=Plaut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some years, there are over 60,000 applying to join, and from 2010, women were allowed to join for the first time.&lt;ref name="Gray" /&gt; Candidates must be between 17½ and 21 years of age.

===Irish regiments===
[[File:10th (Irish) Division at Basingstoke.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Irish Volunteers of the [[10th (Irish) Division|10th (Irish) Division's]] [[Basingstoke]], 1915]]
Irishmen have served in large numbers with the British army since its inception in the early 18th century and into the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and beyond. During this time, 20 to 40 percent of soldiers in English regiments of the Army were Irish born which, together with a high proportion of Scots, meant there were, on occasion, more Irish soldiers than English in some English regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In 1800 the [[68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry)|68th Regiment]], then ~700+ strong received 2600 volunteers from the Irish Militia, enough to form a second battalion.

At the turn of the 20th century, the number of Irish volunteers reduced, as the criticism by nationalists of recruitment to the army grew. Over 28,000 Irishmen served in the army during the [[Second Boer War]], but by 1910 recruitment levels had fallen to 9 percent and for the first time were below Ireland's share of the UK population.

===Present Commonwealth &amp; foreign recruitment===
[[File:Johnson Beharry, VC.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|[[Johnson Beharry|Johnson Beharry VC]] was born in [[Grenada]]]]

Until 1998 there were restrictions on the enlistment of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizens in the British Army. Commonwealth citizens could generally join if they had been resident in the United Kingdom for five years. In 1998 the restrictions were lifted, following recruiting difficulties among British citizens. Under the new provisions Commonwealth citizens were permitted to enlist directly in any one of the British services and significant numbers did so in subsequent years. 

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] later capped the number of recruits from Commonwealth countries at 10% of any corps or regiment in the Army, although this did not affect the Gurkhas. The cap was debated, as some feared the army's "[[Britishness]]" was being diluted, and employing too many could make the army seem as employing too many [[mercenaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/05/military.defence|title= Commonwealth recruitment caps | work=The Guardian |accessdate=22 May 2010|date= 5 April 2008| location=London | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Commonwealth origin volunteers comprised approximately 6.7% of the Army's total strength. In total, 6,600 foreign soldiers from 42 countries were represented in the Army, not including [[Gurkhas]], i.e. Nepalis. After Nepal, the nation with most citizens in the British Army was [[Fiji]], with 1,900, followed by [[Jamaica]] and [[Ghana]] with 600 each; soldiers also came from more prosperous countries, such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. &lt;!--Irish Republic not a commonwealth member--&gt;There are also volunteers from the [[Republic of Ireland]] – the level of recruitment among Irish nationals has been increasing, and figures for recruitment in Northern Ireland show that 16% came from south of the border during 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breakingnews/breakingnews_ukandireland/irish-recruitment-into-british-army-doubles-28436844.html |title=Irish Recruitment |work=Belfast Telegraph |accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2013 the previous restraints were reintroduced with immediate effect, in the context of reduced establishment numbers. From July 2013, all Commonwealth citizens except for those from Ireland, Cyprus, and Malta must have resided for 5 years in the UK before being allowed to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2360771/Commonwealth-citizens-live-Britain-years-joining-Armed-Forces-ministers-try-cut-military-numbers.html |title=Commonwealth citizens will have to live in Britain for five years before joining Armed Forces as ministers try to cut military numbers |work=Daily Mail |date= 11 July 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2016, commonwealth citizens can enlist in the British army in limited roles without meeting the residence requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.army.mod.uk/join/commonwealth_joiners.aspx |title=British Army Jobs |website=www.army.mod.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523082455/http://www.army.mod.uk:80/join/commonwealth_joiners.aspx |archivedate=23 May 2016 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 2018 the Ministry of Defence once again removed the requirement of residing in the country for five years. This now meant that any citizen of the Commonwealth could join the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy as of 6 November 2018. However, the British Army will open applications early 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46092838|title=Army recruits don't need to live in Britain|date=5 November 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/04/armed-forces-recruits-no-longer-need-live-britain-mod-removes/|title=Armed Forces open door to foreign recruits who have never lived in Britain|last=Nicholls|first=Dominic|date=4 November 2018|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=6 November 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]], a '''red–green alliance''' or '''red–green coalition''' is an alliance of "red" (often [[social democracy|social-democratic]] or [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]) parties with "green" (often [[green politics|green]] and/or occasionally [[Agrarianism|agrarian]]) parties. The alliance is often based on common left political views, especially a shared distrust of [[corporation|corporate]] or [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[institution]]s. While the "red" social-democratic parties tend to focus on the effects of capitalism on the [[working class]], the "green" environmentalist parties tend to focus on the environmental effects of capitalism.

The term was coined by conservative [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] [[Carl Bildt]] in a debate against the Social Democrat opposition leader [[Ingvar Carlsson]] 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.se/nyheter/valet2010/1.442687-orden-som-praglar-valrorelsen |title=Orden som präglar valrörelsen |publisher=[[Göteborgsposten]] |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911020048/http://www.gp.se/nyheter/valet2010/1.442687-orden-som-praglar-valrorelsen |archivedate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Red–green coalition governments ==
There have been a number of red–green governments in [[Europe]] since the 1990s.
* In [[Politics of Germany|Germany]], a red–green coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] led by [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schröder]] formed the federal government from September 1998 to September 2005.
* In [[Politics of France|France]], the '[[Plural Left]]' coalition of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS), [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]], [[French Communist Party]] and allies governed from 1997 until 2002. The [[Ayrault government]] which governed from May 2012 until March 2014 had ministers affiliated with the PS, [[Radical Party of the Left]] (PRG) and [[Europe Ecology – The Greens]]. The [[second Valls government]] (August 2014 to December 2016) and [[Cazeneuve Government]] (December 2016 to May 2017) were both formed of ministers from the PS, PRG and [[Ecologist Party (France)|Ecologist Party]].
* In [[Politics of Finland|Finland]], Prime Minister [[Paavo Lipponen]]'s [[Paavo Lipponen's first cabinet|first]] and [[Paavo Lipponen's second Cabinet|second cabinet]]s contained ministers from the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]] (including Lipponen himself) and [[Green League]]. The Green League participated in government from April 1995 until May 2002.
* In [[Politics of Norway|Norway]], the [[Red–green coalition (Norway)|Red-Green Coalition]] of the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]], [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] governed Norway as a majority government from the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 general election]] until [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013|2013]]. The 'green' element was the Centre Party, an [[Nordic agrarian parties|agrarian party]] with green as its official color. Though [[Green Party (Norway)|Greens]] and [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberals]] are also green color, they are not considered as green parties.
* In [[Politics of Iceland|Iceland]], the [[First cabinet of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir|First]] and [[Second cabinet of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir|Second]] Cabinets of Prime Minister [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] were formed from a coalition of the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] and [[Left-Green Movement]], governing from February 2009 to May 2013.
* In [[Politics of Italy|Italy]], from 1996-2001 and 2006-2008, the [[Prodi I Cabinet|Prodi I]], [[D'Alema I Cabinet|D'Alema I]], [[D'Alema II Cabinet|D'Alema II]], [[Amato II Cabinet|Amato II]] and [[Prodi II Cabinet|Prodi II]] Cabinets included the social-democratic [[Democrats of the Left]] (later to become the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]) as the largest party, with the [[Federation of the Greens]] receiving at least one ministry. However, unlike a straightforward red–green alliance, these centre-left cabinets involved a broad range of political parties that were [[Catholic]]-[[Christian left]] inspired, [[centrism|centrist]], [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] and even with [[Italian Communist Party|communist]] backgrounds.
* In [[Politics of Denmark|Denmark]], the [[Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet|Thorning-Schmidt government]], which governed from October 2011 to February 2014, contained the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] as the largest party in coalition with the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberals]] and [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], the latter being a green party and member of the [[European Green Party]] and [[Global Greens]].
* In [[Politics of Sweden|Sweden]], the [[Löfven Cabinet]] established on 3 October 2014 is a [[minority government]] coalition of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and [[Green Party (Sweden)|Greens]].
* In [[Politics of Portugal|Portugal]], the [[XXI Constitutional Government of Portugal|António Costa Cabinet]] established on 26 November 2015 is a [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] [[minority government]] with external support of the [[Left Bloc]], [[Portuguese Communist Party]] and [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"|Ecologist Party The Greens]].

== Radical red–green alliances ==
{{Main|Green left}}
Political parties or [[electoral alliance|joint electoral lists]] have been formed over the years, most often between [[socialism|socialists]] and left-oriented [[green politics|greens]]. Example include:

* [[GreenLeft]] of the [[Netherlands]]: a political party that began in 1989 as a [[Political coalition|political alliance]] comprising the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] and the [[Christian left]] parties [[Evangelical People's Party (Netherlands)|Evangelical People's Party]] and [[Political Party of Radicals]]. The alliance had been known as [[Rainbow (Netherlands)|Rainbow]] for the [[European Parliament election, 1989 (Netherlands)|1989 European elections]].
* [[Red–Green Alliance (Denmark)|Unity List – The Red–Greens]] of Denmark:  a political party, originally a political alliance, formed in 1989 by the [[Left Socialists]] (VS), [[Communist Party of Denmark]] (DKP) and [[Socialist Workers Party (Denmark)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SAP).
* The [[Nordic Green Left Alliance]] was a European political alliance formed by the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] ([[Finland]]), the [[Left-Green Movement]] ([[Iceland]]), the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] ([[Sweden]]), the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] ([[Norway]]) and the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] ([[Denmark]]). The [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] of the NGLA sat in the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]] (GUE/NGL) group in the European Parliament, although the MEPs of the Socialist People's Party sat in [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] (G/EFA) group and later joined the [[European Green Party]].
* [[Left Ecology Freedom]]: a former political party in [[Italy]] that was initially formed as a political alliance comprising socialists, greens and social democrats. The political alliance was itself a partial successor to the short-lived [[The Left – The Rainbow]] electoral alliance which had existed in Italy from December 2007 until May 2008 comprising the [[Federation of the Greens]], the [[Communist Refoundation Party]], [[Party of Italian Communists]] and the [[Democratic Left (Italy)|Democratic Left]].
* The [[Syriza|Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA), a Greek party formed by the merger of a broad set of left-wing and eco-socialist parties, many of which were themselves formerly red–green alliances, such as the [[Coalition of Left, of Movements and Ecology]] (Synaspismos), [[Renewing Communist Ecological Left]] (AKOA), and [[Ecosocialists of Greece]]. The SYRIZA-led [[Second Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|cabinet of Alexis Tsipras]] contains ones junior minister, [[Giannis Tsironis]], from the [[Ecologist Greens]].

== Red–green alliances with centre-left parties ==
There are also red/green political alliances and/or electoral agreements between social-democratic or [[liberalism|liberal]] parties cooperate with green parties
*In Canada, the term ''red–green alliance'' has been used to describe the limited co-operation between the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] which uses red as its colour, and the [[Green Party of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/News/article/295588 TheStar.com | News | Could the 'red-green coalition' be revived?&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which is centre-left but not seen as being as radical as many of its overseas sister parties.
* The [[Red-Greens (Sweden)|Red-Greens]] ({{lang-sv|De rödgröna}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article3947495.ab |title=Namnet är spikat |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |accessdate=2008-12-11|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[red-green political alliance]] in [[Sweden]], established on 7 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/16190/20081207/ |title=Opposition parties to build coalition |publisher=[[The Local]] - Sweden's News in English |accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]], [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] and [[Green Party (Sweden)|Greens]] in the [[Riksdag]], sitting in opposition to the centre-right [[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance for Sweden]] coalition government. The Red-Greens aimed to achieve a majority at the [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010 Swedish general election]] held on 19 September 2010 and form its own [[coalition government]]. However, the Red-Greens failed to unseat the incumbent centre-right Alliance government, and the pact was dissolved on 26 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/29832/20101026/&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the Social Democrats and Greens remain co-operations and formed a minority government coalition after the [[Swedish general election, 2014|2014 general election]].
* A red–green alliance of sorts occurred during the campaign leading up to the [[London mayoral election, 2008]]. Incumbent mayor [[Ken Livingstone]], candidate for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], formed an electoral pact with the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] mayoral candidate [[Siân Berry]] via the [[Contingent vote#Supplementary Vote|supplementary voting system]], in which Labour voters were encouraged to place the Green candidate as their second preference, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/18/london08.politicalnews|title=Greens and Livingstone join forces against Johnson|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|date=19 March 2008|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Italy, [[The Olive Tree (Italy)|The Olive Tree]] and [[The Union (Italy)|The Union]] coalitions comprised the [[Federation of the Greens]] along with social-democratic, [[Christian left|social Christian]], [[centrism|centrist]] and other parties in a broad heterogenous centre-left alliance. The successor party to the Olive Tree, the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], maintains an internal faction of greens called the [[Democratic Ecologists]].
* In Australia, the term ''red–green alliance'' has been used to describe the co-operation between the centre-left [[Australian Labor Party]] and the [[Australian Greens]]. The Greens supported Labor to form the [[minority government]] in [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010]]. As the Greens is the third party in the [[Australian Senate]] which hold the balance power from [[crossbench]], the Labor minority government needed to rely support from the Greens from 2010 to 2013.
* In New Zealand, after the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 general election]], the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] and the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]] signed a [[memorandum of understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/305285/labour,-greens-to-work-to-change-govt|title=Labour, Greens to work to change govt|date=2016-05-31|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2017-06-07|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formed a loose relationship between the two parties with the goal of working together when possible to unseat the incumbent [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National Government]]. Later, the two parties also agreed to a set of budget responsibility rules, committing both parties to sustainable surpluses and capping debt, amongst other rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/90775621/Labour-Greens-have-signed-up-to-a-joint-position-on-surpluses-cutting-debt|title=Labour-Greens have signed up to a joint position on surpluses, cutting debt|last=Small|first=Vernon|date=2017-03-24|work=Stuff.co.nz|access-date=2017-06-07|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, a Labour-led coalition government was formed, supported by the Greens through a confidence and supply arrangement.

The '''Republic of Serbian Krajina''' or '''Serb Republic of Krajina''' ({{lang-sr|Република Српска Крајина}} / ''Republika Srpska Krajina'' or РСК / '''''RSK'''''), {{IPA-sh|rɛpǔblika sr̩̂pskaː krâjina|pron}}), known as '''Serb Krajina'''{{Cref2|a}} ({{lang-sr|Српска Крајина}} / ''Srpska Krajina'') or simply '''Krajina''', was a self-proclaimed [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb]] [[proto-state]],&lt;ref name=hicvs&gt;[http://www.hic.hr/velika-srbija29.htm HIC: VJESNIK, Podlistak, 16 i 17. travnja 2005., ''VELIKOSRPSKA TVOREVINA NA HRVATSKOM TLU: IZVORNI DOKUMENTI O DJELOVANJU 'REPUBLIKE SRPSKE KRAJINE' (XXIX.)'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indeks_oluja&gt;[http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/godisnjica-oluje-hrvatska-slavi-srbija-zali-/564772.aspx Godišnjica Oluje: Hrvatska slavi, Srbija žali]&lt;/ref&gt; a territory within the newly independent [[Croatia]] (formerly part of Yugoslavia), which it defied, active during the [[Croatian War]] (1991–95). It was not recognized internationally. The name ''[[Krajina]]'' ("Frontier") was adopted from the historical [[Military Frontier]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], which had a substantial Serb population and existed up to the late 19th century. The RSK government waged a war for ethnic Serb independence from Croatia and unification with [[FR Yugoslavia]] and [[Republika Srpska]] (in Bosnia and Herzegovina). 

The government of Krajina had ''de facto'' control over central parts of the territory while control of the outskirts changed with the successes and failures of its military activities. The territory was legally protected by the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR).

Its main portion was overrun by Croatian forces in 1995 and the Republic of Serbian Krajina was ultimately disbanded as a result; a [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995-1998)|rump remained in eastern Slavonia]] under [[United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium|UNTAES]] administration until its peaceful reintegration into Croatia in 1998.

==Background==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
The name ''[[Krajina]]'' (meaning "frontier") stemmed from the [[Military Frontier]] which [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] carved out of parts of the [[crown land]]s of [[Croatia in the Habsburg Empire|Croatia]] and [[Banovina of Slavonia|Slavonia]] between 1553–1578 with a view to defending itself against the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Many Croats, Serbs and [[Vlach]]s immigrated from nearby parts of the Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Bosnia and Serbia) into the region and helped bolster and replenish the population as well as the garrisoned troops in the fight against the Ottomans. The Austrians controlled the Frontier from military headquarters in Vienna and did not make it a [[crown land]], though it had some special rights in order to encourage settlement in an otherwise deserted, war-ravaged territory. The abolition of military rule took place between 1869 and 1871. In order to attract Serbs to become part of Croatia, on 11 May 1867, the [[Croatian Parliament|Sabor]] solemnly declared that "the Triune Kingdom recognizes the Serbian/Vlach people living in it as a nation identical and equal with the Croatian nation". Subsequently, the Military Frontier was incorporated into [[Croatia in the Habsburg Empire|Habsburg Croatia]] in 1881.

[[File:Militargrenze, Wojwodowena und Banat.jpg|left|thumb|Map of the original Krajina, the [[Military Frontier]]]]

Following the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, the regions formerly forming part of the Military Frontier came under the control of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], where they formed part of the [[Sava Banovina]], along with most of the old Croatia-Slavonia. [[Interwar period|Between the two World Wars]] the Serbs of the Croatian and Slavonian Krajinas, as well as those of the [[Bosnian Krajina]] and of other regions west of [[Serbia]], organized a notable political party, the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]] under [[Svetozar Pribićević]]. In the new state there existed much tension between the Croats and Serbs over differing political visions, with the campaign for Croatian autonomy culminating in the assassination of a Croatian [[leader]], [[Stjepan Radić]], in the parliament, and repression by the Serb-dominated security structures.

Between 1939 and 1941, in an attempt to resolve the Croat-Serb political and social antagonism in the first Yugoslavia, the kingdom established an autonomous [[Banovina of Croatia]] incorporating (amongst other territories) much of the former [[Military Frontier]] as well as parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In 1941 the [[Axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia and in the aftermath the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (which included whole of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Serbia ([[Eastern Syrmia]]) as well) was declared. The Germans installed the [[Ustaše]] (who had allegedly plotted the assassination of the Serbian [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander I]] of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in 1934) as rulers of the new country; the Ustaše authorities promptly pursued a genocidal policy of [[persecution of Serbs]], Jews and Croats (from opposition groups), leading to hundreds of thousands being killed.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} During this period, individual Croats coalesced around the ruling authorities or around the communist anti-fascist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. Serbs from around the [[Knin]] area tended to join the [[Chetniks]], whilst Serbs from the [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[Slavonia]] regions tended to join the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].

At the end of World War II in 1945, the communist-dominated Partisans prevailed and the Krajina region became part of the [[People's Republic of Croatia]] until 7 April 1963, when the federal republic changed its name to the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]]. [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] suppressed the autonomous political organisations of the region (along with other movements such as the [[Croatian Spring]]); however, the Yugoslav constitutions of 1965 and 1974 did give substantial rights to national minorities - including to the Serbs in SR Croatia.

The Serbian "Krajina" entity to emerge upon Croatia's declaration of independence in 1991 would include three kinds of territories:

* a large section of the historical Military Frontier, in areas with a majority Serbian population;
* areas such as parts of northern Dalmatia, that never formed part of the Frontier but had a majority or a plurality of Serbian population, including the self-proclaimed entity's capital, [[Knin]];
* areas that bordered with Serbia and where Serbs formed a significant minority ([[Baranja region|Baranja]], [[Vukovar]]).

Large sections of the historical Military Frontier lay outside of the Republic of Serb Krajina and contained a largely Croat population - these including much of [[Lika]], the area centred around the city of [[Bjelovar]], central and south-eastern [[Slavonia]].

The Serb-populated regions in Croatia were of central concern to the Serbian nationalist movement of the late 1980s, led by [[Slobodan Milošević]]. In September 1986 the [[SANU Memorandum|Serbian Academy's memorandum]] on the status of Serbia and Serbs was partially leaked by a Serbian newspaper. It listed a series of grievances against the Yugoslav federation, claiming that the situation in Kosovo was 'genocide', and complained about alleged discrimination of Serbs at the hands of the Croatian authorities. Among the claims that it makes is that 'except for the time under the [[Independent State of Croatia]], the Serbs in Croatia have never been as jeopardized as they are today’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaurdic|first=Josip|title=The Hour of Europe: Western Powers and the Breakup of Yugoslavia|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=London|isbn=030016629X|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tension was further fuelled by the overthrow of Vojvodina and Montenegro's government by Milošević's loyalists, and the abrogation of Kosovo's and Vojvodina's autonomy in 1989, which gave Milošević 4 out of 8 votes on the Yugoslav Federal Presidency, thus gaining the power to block every decision made by the Presidency. Furthermore, a series of Serb nationalist rallies were held in Croatia during 1989, under pressure from Serbia. On 8 July 1989 a large nationalist rally was held in Knin, during which banners threatening JNA intervention in Croatia, as well as [[Chetnik]] iconography were displayed, stunning the Croatian public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaurdic|first=Josip|title=The Hour of Europe: Western Powers and the Breakup of Yugoslavia|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=London|isbn=030016629X|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian pro-independence party victory in 1990 made matters more tense, especially since the country's Serb minority was supported by Milošević. At the time, Serbs comprised about 12.2% (581,663 people) of Croatia's population (1991 census).

Serbs became increasingly opposed to the policies of Franjo Tuđman, elected president of Croatia in April 1990, due to his overt desire for the creation of an independent Croatia.  On 30 May 1990, the [[Serb Democratic Party (Croatia)|Serb Democratic Party]] (SDS) of Jovan Rašković broke all ties to the Croatian parliament. The following June in Knin, the SDS-led Serbs proclaimed the creation of the Association of Municipalities of Northern Dalmatia and Lika.  In August 1990, the Serbs began what became known as the [[Log Revolution]], where barricades of logs were placed across roads throughout the South as an expression of their secession from Croatia.  This effectively cut Croatia in two, separating the coastal region of [[Dalmatia]] from the rest of the country. The [[Constitution of Croatia]] was passed in December 1990, which reduced the status of Serbs from "constituent" to a "national minority" in the same category with other groups such as Italians and Hungarians. Some would later justify their claim to an independent Serb state by arguing that the new constitution contradicted the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]], because in their view, Croatia was still legally governed by the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], although this ignores the fact that Serbia's constitution, promulgated three months before Croatia's, also contained several provisions violating the 1974 Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building And Legitimation, 1918-2005|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253346568|pages=383–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbs in Croatia had established a Serbian National Council in July 1990 to coordinate opposition to Croatian independence.  Their position was that if Croatia could secede from Yugoslavia, then the Serbs could secede from Croatia. [[Milan Babić]], a dentist by profession from the southern town of [[Knin]], was elected president. At his [[ICTY]] trial in 2004, he claimed that "during the events [of 1990–1992], and in particular at the beginning of his political career, he was strongly influenced and misled by Serbian propaganda, which repeatedly referred to the imminent threat of a Croatian genocide perpetrated on the Serbs in Croatia, thus creating an atmosphere of hatred and fear of Croats."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/icty/babic/trialc/judgement/index.htm Milan Babic – Sentencing Judgement]. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Retrieved 8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebel Croatian Serbs established a number of [[paramilitary]] militia units under the leadership of [[Milan Martić]], the police chief in Knin.

In August 1990, a referendum was held in Krajina on the question of Serb "sovereignty and autonomy" in Croatia. The resolution was confined exclusively to Serbs so it passed by an improbable majority of 99.7%. As expected, it was declared illegal and invalid by the Croatian government, who stated that Serbs had no constitutional right to break away from Croatian legal territory - as well as no right to limit the franchise to one ethnic group.

Babić's administration announced the creation of a [[SAO Krajina|Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina]] (or ''SAO Krajina'') on 21 December 1990. On 16 March 1991 another referendum was held which asked "Are you in favour of the SAO Krajina joining the Republic of Serbia and staying in Yugoslavia with Serbia, Montenegro and others who wish to preserve Yugoslavia?". With 99.8% voting in favour, the referendum was approved and the Krajina assembly declared that "the territory of the SAO Krajina is a constitutive part of the unified state territory of the Republic of Serbia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612.pdf Prosecutor v. Milan Martić Judgement]. p. 46. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Retrieved 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1991, it declared that it would secede from Croatia.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Separation-1Apr1991"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/world/rebel-serbs-complicate-rift-on-yugoslav-unity.html?ref=croatia | title = Rebel Serbs Complicate Rift on Yugoslav Unity | author= Chuck Sudetic | date = 2 April 1991 | accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Serb-dominated communities in eastern Croatia announced that they would also join SAO Krajina and ceased paying taxes to the [[Zagreb]] government, and began implementing its own currency system, army regiments, and postal service.

Croatia held a [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|referendum on independence on 19 May 1991]], in which the electorate—minus many Serbs, who chose to boycott it—voted overwhelmingly for independence with the option of confederate union with other Yugoslav states - with 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum by 93 percent.  On 25 June 1991, Croatia and Slovenia both declared their independence from Yugoslavia. As the JNA attempted unsuccessfully to suppress Slovenia's independence in the short [[Slovenian War]], clashes between revolting Croatian Serbs and Croatian security forces broke out almost immediately, leaving dozens dead on both sides. Serbs were supported by remnants of the JNA (whose members were now only from Serbia and Montenegro), which provided them weapons. Many Croatians fled their homes in fear, or were forced out by the rebel Serbs. The [[European Union]] and [[United Nations]] unsuccessfully attempted to broker ceasefires and peace settlements.
 [[File:Demographics of RSK.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Change in the ethnic composition of Krajina from April 1991 to July 1992. Serbs increased from 52.3% to 88% of the total population]]
Around August 1991, the leaders of Serbian Krajina and Serbia allegedly agreed to embark on a campaign which the ICTY prosecutors described as a "[[joint criminal enterprise]]" whose purpose "was the forcible removal of the majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from approximately one-third of the territory of the Republic of Croatia, an area he planned to become part of a new Serb-dominated state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icty.org/sid/7946 Judge Rodrigues confirms Indictment charging Slobodan Milosevic with Crimes committed in Croatia].

Retrieved 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to testimony given by Milan Babić in his subsequent war crimes trial, during the summer of 1991 the Serbian secret police (under Milošević's command) set up "a parallel structure of state security and the police of Krajina and units commanded by the state security of Serbia".&lt;ref&gt;Judith Armatta.

Pp. 160–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Paramilitary groups such as [[Wolves of Vučjak]] and [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]], funded by the Serbian secret police, were also a key component of this structure.&lt;ref name="Seselj indictment"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ses-ii030115e.htm|title=ICTY - TPIY :|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wider-scale war was launched in August 1991. Over the following months, a large area of territory, amounting to a third of Croatia, was controlled by the rebel Serbs. The Croatian population suffered heavily, fleeing or evicted with numerous killings, leading to [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="ICTY evidence"&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/dhr/Archive/2004/Jan/29-319268.html ICTY evidence; Babic pleads guilty to crimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109115648/https://usinfo.state.gov/dhr/Archive/2004/Jan/29-319268.html |date=9 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the fighting occurred between August and December 1991 when approximately 80,000 Croats were expelled (and some were killed).&lt;ref name="Croatian refugees"&gt;[http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=822 Croatian refugees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315041821/http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=822 |date=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more died and or were displaced in fighting in eastern [[Slavonia]] (this territory along the Croatian/Serbian border was not part of the Krajina, and it was the JNA that was the principal actor in that part of the conflict).

In the latter half of 1991, Croatia was beginning to form an army and their main defenders, the local police, were overpowered by the JNA military who supported rebelled Croatian Serbs.

==Formal proclamations==
On 19 December 1991, the SAO Krajina proclaimed itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The Constitution of Serbian Krajina came into effect the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Krajina-const.pdf Text of the Constitution] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 26 February 1992, the SAO Western Slavonia and SAO Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia were added to the RSK, which initially had only encompassed the territories within the SAO Krajina. The [[Serb Army of Krajina]] (Srpska Vojska Krajine, SVK) was officially formed on 19 March 1992. The RSK occupied an area of some 17,028&amp;nbsp;km² at its greatest extent.

==1992 ceasefire==
[[File:Map of war in Yugoslavia, 1993.png|thumb|300px|right|War in former Yugoslavia, 1993]]
Under the [[Vance plan]], signed in November 1991, Presidents Tuđman and Milošević agreed to a United Nations peace plan put forward by [[Cyrus Vance]].
A final ceasefire agreement, the [[Sarajevo Agreement]], was signed by representatives of the two sides in January 1992, paving the way for the implementation of the Vance plan. Four United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) were established in Croatian territory which was claimed by RSK, and the plan called for the withdrawal of the JNA from Croatia and for the return of refugees to their homes in the UNPAs.

The JNA officially withdrew from Croatia in May 1992 but much of its weaponry and many of its personnel remained in the Serb-held areas and were turned over to the RSK's security forces. Refugees were not allowed to return to their homes and many of the remaining Croats and other nationalities left in the RSK were expelled or killed in the following months.&lt;ref name="Tanner: Croatia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Babic Guilty"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3433721.stm | work=BBC News | title=Babic admits persecuting Croats | date=27 January 2004 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 1992, the creation of the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) was authorised by the [[UN Security Council]] for an initial period of a year, to provide security to the UNPAs.

The agreement effectively froze the front lines for the next three years. Croatia and the RSK had effectively fought each other to a standstill. The Republic of Serbian Krajina was not recognised [[de jure]] by any other country or international organisation. Nevertheless, it gained support from Serbia's allies, like [[Russia]].

==After the ceasefire==

UNPROFOR was deployed throughout the region to maintain the ceasefire, although in practice its light armament and restricted rules of engagement meant that it was little more than an observer force. It proved wholly unable to ensure that refugees returned to the RSK. Indeed, the rebel Croatian Serb authorities continued to make efforts to ensure that they could ''never'' return, destroying villages and cultural and religious monuments to erase the previous existence of the Croatian inhabitants of the Krajina.&lt;ref name="Tanner: Croatia" /&gt;  Milan Babić later testified that this policy was driven from Belgrade through the Serbian secret police—and ultimately Milošević—who he claimed were in control of all the administrative institutions and armed forces in the Krajina.&lt;ref name="Babic testification"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;s=f&amp;o=164710&amp;apc_state=henitri200407|title=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|work=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would certainly explain why the Yugoslav National Army took the side of the rebelled Croatian Serbs in spite of its claims to be acting as a "peacekeeping" force. Milošević denied this, claiming that Babić had made it up "out of fear".

The Army of Serbian Krajina frequently attacked neighbouring [[Bihać]] enclave (then in the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) with heavy artillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RWFGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KOkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6084,4117396&amp;dq=bihac+bosnia&amp;hl=en|title=The Daily Gazette - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kotar Glina i Knin.jpg|right|thumb|Two proposed autonomous districts of Croatia are shown in dark green.]]
With the creation of new [[Counties of Croatia|Croatian counties]] on 30 December 1992, the Croatian government also set aside two autonomous regions (''kotar'') for ethnic Serbs in the areas of Krajina:
* Autonomous District of Glina ({{lang-hr|Autonomni kotar Glina}}, {{lang-sr-Cyrl|Аутономни котар Глина}})
** Municipalities ''[[de jure]]'' within the Autonomous District of Glina were [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]], [[Vrginmost]], [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]], [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]] and [[Vojnić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_06_34_896.html | language = Croatian | title = Ustavni zakon o ljudskim pravima i slobodama i pravima etničkih i nacionalnih zajednica ili manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj | author = [[Croatian Parliament]] | journal = [[Narodne novine]] | issue = 34/92 | location = Zagreb | date = 3 June 1992 | accessdate =7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Autonomous District of Knin ({{lang-hr|Autonomni kotar Knin}}, {{lang-sr-Cyrl|Аутономни котар Книн}})

However, Serbs considered this too late, as it was not the amount of autonomy they wanted, and by now they had declared [[de facto]] independence.

The districts never actually functioned since they were located within the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. Existence of the Autonomous District of Glina was also provided in the draft of the [[Z-4 plan]], that was rejected.
After [[Operation Storm]], the application of the law which allowed autonomy would be temporarily suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1995_09_68_1192.html | language = Croatian | title = Ustavni zakon o privremenom neprimjenjivanju pojedinih odredbi Ustavnog zakona o ljudskim pravima i slobodama i o pravima etničkih i nacionalnih zajednica ili manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj | author = [[Croatian Parliament]] | journal = [[Narodne novine]] | issue = 68/95 | date = 21 September 1995 | accessdate =7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 this part of the law was formally repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2000_05_51_1127.html | language = Croatian | title = Ustavni zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Ustavnog zakona o ljudskim pravima i slobodama i o pravima etničkih i nacionalnih zajednica ili manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj | author = [[Croatian Parliament]] | journal = [[Narodne novine]] | issue = 51/2000 | date = 19 May 2000 | accessdate =7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
[[File:Goran Hadzic 1992 2.jpg|right|150px|thumb|1992: RSK president [[Goran Hadžić]].]]
The partial implementation of the Vance Plan drove a wedge between the governments of the RSK and Serbia, the RSK's principal backer and supplier of fuel, arms and money. Milan Babić strongly opposed the Vance Plan but was overruled by the RSK's assembly.&lt;ref name="Tanner: Croatia" /&gt;

On 26 February 1992, Babić was deposed and replaced as President of the RSK by [[Goran Hadžić]], a Milošević loyalist. Babić remained involved in RSK politics but as a considerably weaker figure.

The position of the RSK eroded steadily over the following three years. On the surface, the RSK had all the trappings of a state: army, parliament, president, government and ministries, currency and stamps. However its economy was wholly dependent on support from the rump Yugoslavia, which had the effect of importing that country's [[hyperinflation]].

The economic situation soon became disastrous. By 1994, only 36,000 of the RSK's 430,000 citizens were employed. The war had severed the RSK's trade links with the rest of Croatia, leaving its few industries idle. With few natural resources of its own it had to import most of the goods and fuel it required. Agriculture was devastated, and operated at little more than a subsistence level.&lt;ref name="svarm" /&gt; Professionals went to Serbia or elsewhere to escape the republic's economic hardships. To make matters worse, the RSK's government was grossly corrupt and the region became a haven for black marketeering and other criminal activity. It was clear by the mid-1990s that without a peace deal or support from Yugoslavia the RSK was not economically viable.&lt;ref name="Evidence"&gt;Milosevic and the JNA http://hrw.org/reports/2006/milosevic1206/4.htm#&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially evident in Belgrade, where the RSK had become an unwanted economic and political burden for Milošević. Much to his frustration, the rebel Croatian Serbs rebuffed his government's demands to settle the conflict.&lt;ref name="Tanner: Croatia" /&gt; 
In July 1992 the RSK issued its own currency, the [[Krajina dinar]] (HRKR), in parallel with the [[Yugoslav dinar]]. This was followed by the "October dinar" (HRKO), first issued on 1 October 1993 and equal to 1,000,000 Reformed Dinar, and the "1994 dinar", first issued on 1 January 1994, and equal to 1,000,000,000 October dinar.
The RSK's weakness also adversely affected its armed forces, the [[Vojska Srpske Krajine]] (VSK). Since the 1992 ceasefire agreement, Croatia had spent heavily on importing weapons and training its armed forces with assistance from American contractors. In contrast, the VSK had grown steadily weaker, with its soldiers poorly motivated, trained and equipped.&lt;ref name="Tanner: Croatia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Security"&gt;Testimony from RSK generals http://www.nsf-journal.hr/issues/v3_n3-4/11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There were only about 55,000 of them to cover a front of some 600&amp;nbsp;km in Croatia plus 100&amp;nbsp;km along the border with the [[Bihać]] pocket in Bosnia. With 16,000 stationed in eastern Slavonia, only about 39,000 were left to defend the main part of the RSK. Overall, only 30,000 were capable of full mobilization, yet they faced a far stronger Croatian army. Also, political divisions between Hadžić and Babić occasionally led to physical and sometimes even armed confrontations between their supporters; Babić himself was assaulted and beaten in an incident in [[Benkovac]].&lt;ref name="Dokumenti"&gt;[http://www.profil.hr/index.php?cmd=show_proizvod&amp;proizvod_id=30205 Republika Hrvatska i Domovinski rat 1990. – 1995. dokumenti]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DAfb6gsS?url=http://www.profil-mozaik.hr/?cmd=show_proizvod&amp;proizvod_id=30205 |date=25 December 2012 }} {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Pdf/2005%5C10%5C22%5C30A30.PDF | title=U ljeto '91. pripremana i pobuna u Gorskom kotaru | work=[[Vjesnik]] | date=22 October 2005 | first=Željko | last=Krušelj | language=Croatian | format=PDF | accessdate=5 August 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1993 the revitalized Croatian army attacked the Serbian positions around [[Maslenica]] in southern Croatia which curtailed their access to the sea via [[Novigrad, Zadar County|Novigrad]].

In mid-1993, the RSK authorities started a campaign to formally create a [[United Serbian Republic]].

In a second offensive in September 1993 the Croatian army overran the [[Medak pocket]] in the southern Krajina in a push to regain Serb-held Croatian territory. This action was halted by international diplomacy but although the rebel Croatian Serbs brought reinforcements forward fairly quickly, the strength of the Croatian forces proved superior. Hadžić sent an urgent request to Belgrade for reinforcements, arms and equipment. In response, around 4,000 paramilitaries under the command of [[Vojislav Šešelj]] (the [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]]) and "[[Arkan]]" (the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]]) arrived to bolster the VSK.

== Operation Storm ==
{{Main|Operation Flash|Operation Storm}}
[[File:Martic-order1995.jpg|thumb|The order to evacuate ethnic Serbs from RSK territory, issued by the Krajina Defence Council and signed by [[Milan Martić]]; 4 August 1995]]

Following the rejection by both sides of the [[Z-4 plan]] for reintegration, the RSK's end came in 1995, when Croatian forces gained control of [[SAO Western Slavonia]] in [[Operation Flash]] (May) followed by the biggest part of occupied Croatia in [[Operation Storm]] (August). The Krajina Serb Supreme Defence Council met under president [[Milan Martić]] to discuss the situation. A decision was reached at 16:45 to "start evacuating the population unfit for military service from  the municipalities of [[Knin]], [[Benkovac]], [[Obrovac, Croatia|Obrovac]], [[Drniš]] and [[Gračac]]." The RSK was disbanded and most of its Serb population (from 150,000 to 200,000 people) fled.&lt;ref name="Tanner: Croatia" /&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;[[Amnesty International]], [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur64/002/2005/en/ Croatia: Operation "Storm" – still no justice ten years on] , 04.08.2005&lt;/ref&gt; Only 5,000 to 6,000 people remained, mostly the elderly.&lt;ref name="goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, Ivo (1999). ''Croatia: A History''. p. 253–254. C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers. {{ISBN|1-85065-525-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian historian [[Ivo Goldstein]] wrote, "''The reasons for the Serb exodus are complex. Some had to leave because the Serb army had forced them to, while others feared the revenge of the Croatian army or of their former Croat neighbours, whom they had driven away and whose homes they had mostly looted (and it was later shown that this fear was far from groundless).''".&lt;ref name="goldstein" /&gt;

Most of the refugees ended up in Serbia, Bosnia and eastern Slavonia. Some of those who remained were murdered, tortured and forcibly expelled by the Croatian Army and police.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;

Between 2001 and 2012, the ICTY had prosecuted Croatian generals [[Ante Gotovina]], [[Mladen Markač]] and [[Ivan Čermak]] in the [[Trial of Gotovina et al]] for their involvement in crimes committed during and in the aftermath of Operation Storm. The indictment and the subsequent trial on charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war described several killings, widespread arson and looting committed by Croatian soldiers.&lt;ref name="Gotovina indictment" /&gt; In April 2011, Gotovina and Markač were convicted to prison sentences, while Čermak was acquitted.&lt;ref name="Gotovina indictment"&gt;Gotovina indictment http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/gotovina/cis-gotovina.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gotovina and Markač appealed the verdict and in November 2012 the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY overturned their convictions, acquitting them.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/tribunal-overturns-convictions-croat-generals-17735745#.UKYFtGdL7cs | agency = [[Associated Press]] | publisher = [[ABC News]] | title = Tribunal Overturns Convictions of Croat Generals | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later events==
[[File:Hrvatsko Podunavlje.png|thumb|right|Map of the remaining Krajina territory in eastern Croatia]]

The parts of the former RSK in eastern Croatia (along the [[Danube]]) remained in place, in what was previously the [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]].

In 1995, Milan Milanović, formerly a Republic of Serbian Krajina official, signed the [[Erdut Agreement]] as a representative of the Serbian side. This agreement, co-signed by the representative of the Croatian Government, was sponsored by the United Nations, and it set up a transitional period during which the [[United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]] (UNTAES) peacekeeping mission would oversee a peaceful reintegration of this territory into Croatia, starting on 15 January 1996. In 1998, the UNTAES mission was complete and the territory was formally returned to Croatia. Based on the Erdut Agreement, the [[Joint Council of Municipalities]] was established in the region in 1997.

After the peaceful reintegration, two Croatian islands on the Danube, the [[Island of Šarengrad]] and the [[Island of Vukovar]], remained under Serbian military control. In 2004, Serbian military was withdrawn from the islands and replaced with Serbian police. The islands remain an open question as the Croatian side insists on applying [[Badinter Arbitration Committee]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=1&amp;status=jedna&amp;vest=70384 | language = Serbian | newspaper = [[Večernje novosti]] | title = Ko muti Dunav | date = 12 December 2004 | accessdate = 2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 a Croatian court sentenced former RSK president [[Goran Hadžić]] ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' to 20 years in prison for rocket attacks on [[Šibenik]] and [[Vodice, Croatia|Vodice]]. In 1999 he was sentenced to an additional 20 years for war crimes in [[Tenja]], near [[Osijek]],&lt;ref name="rferl-hr-2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/hadzic_ne_moze_biti_izrucen_hrvatskoj/24272781.html|language=Croatian|title=Hadžić ne može biti izručen Hrvatskoj|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] – Croatian edition|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 Croatia's state attorney brought another indictment against him for the murder of almost 1,300 Croats in Vukovar, Osijek, Vinkovci, [[Županja]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="rferl-hr-2011"/&gt; On 4 June 2004, the ICTY indicted him on 14 counts of war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/07/25/feature-02|title=War crimes fugitive: Goran Hadzic|publisher=Setimes.com|date=25 July 2008|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he was arrested and extradited to the Hague, where his initial trial hearing was held on 25 July the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/07/2011725143544135906.html|title=Serb war crimes suspect appears at UN court|work=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the indictment of prosecutor [[Carla Del Ponte]] against [[Slobodan Milošević]] at the ICTY, the Croat and non-Serb population from the 1991 census was approximately as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/ind/en/mil-2ai020728e.htm The Prosecutor of the Tribunial Against Slobodan Milosevic].

Thus Serbs comprised 52.3% and Croats 35.8% of the population of SAO Krajina respectively in 1991.

According to data set forth at the meeting of the Government of the RSK in July 1992, its ethnic composition was 88% Serbs, 7% Croats, 5% others.&lt;ref name="Dokumenti"/&gt; As of November 1993, less than 400 ethnic Croats still resided in UNPA Sector South,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.hri.org/docs/USSD-Rights/93/Croatia93.html | title = CROATIA HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES, 1993; Section 2, part d.

On 29 November 1991, the [[Badinter commission]] concluded that Yugoslavia was "in dissolution" and that the republics – including Croatia – should be recognized as independent states when they asked so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/80-1/Hasani%20PDF3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227044821/http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/80-1/Hasani%20PDF3.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol3/No1/art13.html The Opinions of the Badinter Arbitration Committee: A Second Breath for the Self-Determination of Peoples&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181749/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol3/No1/art13.html |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also assigned these republics territorial integrity. For most of the world this was a reason to recognize Croatia. However, Serbia did not accept the conclusions of the commission in that period and recognized Croatia only after Croatian military actions (Oluja and Bljesak) and the Dayton agreement.

On 20 November 1991 [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] asked [[Badinter commission]]: "Does the [[Serbs|Serbian]] population in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as one of the constituent peoples of Yugoslavia, have the right to [[self-determination]]?" The commission concluded on 11 January 1992 "that the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is entitled to all the rights concerned to [[minority group|minorities]] and [[ethnic group]]s[...]" and "that the Republics must afford the members of those minorities and ethnic groups all the [[human right]]s and fundamental [[freedom (political)|freedom]]s recognized in [[international law]], including, where appropriate, the right to choose their [[nationality]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://207.57.19.226/journal/Vol3/No1/art12-13.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529223410/http://207.57.19.226/journal/Vol3/No1/art12-13.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milan Babić]], former President of Serbian Krajina, testified to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) that Krajina was provided with weapons by [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s government in [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]], and that Krajina was economically and financially dependent upon Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Armatta.

==Government in exile==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

There existed a self-proclaimed [[government in exile]] for the Republic of Serbian Krajina. This government existed for a short time period after Operation Storm, but was reconstituted in 2005. This self-proclaimed government has changed the official name of the Republic of Serbian Krajina to Republic of Serb-Krajina. At the Belgrade meeting, the former legislators declared themselves to be the legitimate continuation of the RSK government and called for the re-creation of the RSK on the basis of the 1994 [[Z-4 plan]], which had called for Krajina to have a status of "more than [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]], less than independence" within [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="b92-dokumenti-z-4-plan"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.b92.net/specijal/oluja/index.php?start=0&amp;nav_id=173983 | publisher = [[B92]] | language = Serbian | title = Dokumenti: Plan Z-4 | work = B92 specijal: 10 godina od ''Oluje'' nad Krajinom | accessdate =2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They announced that a parliamentary election would be held and that the new name of the self-proclaimed state would be "Republic of Serb-Krajina". The meeting elected [[Milorad Buha]], member of the [[Serbian Radical Party]], as [[prime minister]] as well as six ministers without portfolio whose names were not revealed.

This move was criticized by many, including top [[Serbia]]n and [[Croatia]]n government officials, as well as senior representatives of Serbs in Croatia. They all stated that such a meeting would harm Serb-Croat reconciliation and relations between the communities in [[Croatia]]. It was pointed out that the Krajina Serb legislators had rejected the Z-4 proposal when it had originally been put forward. Some Serbian nationalists also criticized the move, saying that a government in exile should have been created as soon as possible after Operation Storm, not 10 years later.

The Romanian Financial Supervisory Authority (Ro:'''Autoritatea de Supraveghere Financiară''' ('''ASF''')) is a national Romanian governmental agency. Its mandate is to regulate, supervise, and control nonbank markets in Romania. 

The Authority was founded through the merger of three prior regulatory bodies that had covered the same area of responsibility - the CSA, CNVM, and CSSP. 

The ASF is placed under the control of the Romanian Parliament. It has three areas of activity, insurance-reinsurance, capital markets, and private pensions. 

The ASF is run by a council of nine members with five of the nine in its executive. The executive consists of a president, a head vice president, and three vice presidents for sectors: insurance-reinsurance, capital markets and private pensions.

'''{{Self reference|For Wikipedia's meaning of separatism, see [[m:Separatism]].}}

{{basic forms of government}}
{{Politics}}

A common definition of '''separatism''' is that it is the advocacy of a state of cultural, ethnic, tribal, religious, racial, governmental or gender separation from the larger group. While it often refers to full political [[secession]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/separatism Free Dictionary]; [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/separatism Merriam Webster dictionary]; [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-separatist.html ''The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current= English 2008''].&lt;/ref&gt; separatist groups may seek nothing more than greater autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=R.|last1=Harris|first2=Jerry|last2=Harris|title=The Nation in the Global Era: Conflict and Transformation|publisher=Brill|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UQQujqyOJJIC&amp;pg=PA320 |page=320|isbn=90-04-17690-X|quote=9789004176904}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some critics{{Who|date=December 2016}} may equate separatism with [[religious segregation]], [[Racial segregation|racist segregation]], or [[Sexual segregation|sexist segregation]], most separatists{{Who|date=December 2016}} argue that separation by choice  may serve useful purposes and is not the same as government-enforced segregation. There is some academic debate about this definition, and in particular how it relates to [[secessionism]], as has been discussed online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/3911/discussions/90459/secessionism-and-separatism-monthly-series-secession-and/|title=Secessionism and Separatism Monthly Series: "Secession and Secessionism" by Alexandar Pavković - H-Nationalism - H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separatist groups practice a form of [[identity politics]], or political activity and theorizing founded in the shared experiences of injustice visited upon members of certain social groups. Such groups believe attempts at integration with dominant groups compromise their identity and ability to pursue greater self-determination.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|title=Identity Politics|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|work=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic and political factors usually are critical in creating strong separatist movements as opposed to less ambitious identity movements.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"/&gt;

==Motivations==
[[File:Somunanacio11(2).jpg|thumb|190px|Support for [[Catalan independence]] is based on the concept that [[Catalonia]] is a nation]]
Groups may have one or more motivations for separation, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Metta|last=Spencer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz6vDcL8Q90C|title=Separatism: Democracy and Disintegration|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date=1998|pages=2–4|isbn=9780847685851}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emotional resentment and hatred of rival communities.
* Protection from [[genocide]] and [[ethnic cleansing.
* Resistance by victims of oppression, including denigration of their language, culture or religion.
* Influence and propaganda by those inside and outside the region who hope to gain politically from intergroup conflict and hatred.
* Economic and political dominance of one group that does not share power and privilege in an egalitarian fashion.
* Economic motivations: seeking to end economic exploitation by more powerful group or, conversely, to escape economic redistribution from a richer to a poorer group.
* Preservation of threatened religious, language or other cultural tradition.
* Destabilization from one separatist movement giving rise to others.
* Geopolitical power vacuum from breakup of larger states or empires.
* Continuing fragmentation as more and more states break up.
* Feeling that the perceived nation was added to the larger state by illegitimate means.
* The perception that the state can no longer support one's own group or has betrayed their interests.
* Opposition to political decisions.

==Governmental responses==
[[File:Battle of Kenesaw Mountian.png|thumb|upright|right|In 1861, the [[American Civil War]] started after a separatist movement of [[Confederate States of America|southern US states]] seceded from the [[United States]].]]
How far separatist demands will go toward full independence, and whether groups pursue constitutional and nonviolent or armed violence, depend on a variety of economic, political, social and cultural factors, including movement leadership&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/one/prol/prol01/index.php?click_key=1 Link to:]
Chima, Jugdep. "Effects of Political Leadership on Ethnic Separatist Movements in India" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association, Palmer House Hotel, Chicago, Illinois, April 12, 2007, (PDF); Chima, Jugdep. "How Does Political Leadership Affect the Trajectories of Ethnic Separatist Insurgencies?: Comparative Evidence from Movements in India" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Marriott Wardman Park, [[Omni Shoreham]], Washington Hilton, Washington, DC, September 01, 2005 (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; and the government's response.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;See D.L. Horowitz's "Patterns of Ethnic Separatism", originally published in ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', 1981, vol 23, 165-95. Republished in John A. Hall, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9_matAX1z8cC The State: Critical Concepts],'' Routledge, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments may respond in a number of ways, some of which are mutually exclusive. Some include:&lt;ref&gt;Metta Spencer, 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* accede to separatist demands
* improve the circumstances of disadvantaged minorities, be they religious, linguistic, territorial, economic or political
* adopt "asymmetric federalism" where different states have different relations to the central government depending on separatist demands or considerations
* Allow minorities to win in political disputes about which they feel strongly, through parliamentary voting, referendum, etc.
* Settle for a [[confederation]] or a [[commonwealth]] relationship where there are only limited ties among states.
Some governments suppress any separatist movement in their own country, but support separatism in other countries.

=={{anchor|Ethnic}}Ethnic separatism==
{{Original research section|date=November 2015}}
[[Ethnic]] separatism is based more on cultural and linguistic differences than [[Religion|religious]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] differences, which also may exist. Ethnic separatist movements include the following:

==Racial separatism==
{{Globalize/US|section|date = August 2011}}
Some separatist groups seek to separate from others along [[Race (human classification)|racial]] lines. They oppose interracial marriage and integration with other races and seek separate schools, businesses, churches and other institutions; and often separate societies, territories, countries, and governments.
[[File:Aztlán in United States (US48).svg|thumb|upright|Territories considered for "Aztlán"]]
* [[Black separatism]] (also known as [[black nationalism]]) is the most prominent wave advancing the concepts of "Black racial identity" in the United States and has been advanced by black leaders like [[Marcus Garvey]] and organizations such as the [[Nation of Islam]]. [[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] like [[New York University]]'s [[Derrick Bell]] and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]'s [[Richard Delgado]] argue that US legal, education and political systems are rife with blatant racism.

* [[White separatism]] in the United States and Western Europe seeks separation of the white race and limits to nonwhite [[immigration]]  under the argument that these policies are necessary for white race's  survival. According to two sociologists writing in 2000, most separatists formally reject any ideology of [[white supremacy]], but some left-wing advocacy groups still continue to oppose such separatist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Betty A.|last1=Dobratz|first2=Stephanie L.|last2=Shanks-Meile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC|title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!"|publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year=2000|pages=1–3, 10|isbn=9780801865374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Zionism]] sought the creation of the [[State of Israel]] as a [[Jewish]] homeland, with separation from [[gentile]] Palestinians. [[Simon Dubnow]], who had mixed feelings toward Zionism, formulated [[Jewish Autonomism]], which was adopted in eastern Europe by Jewish political parties such as the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] and his own [[Folkspartei]] before World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Koppel S.|last=Pinson|title=Simon Dubnow|pages=13–69|date=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zionism can also be seen as somewhat ethnic too, however, as its definition of who is Jewish has often included people of Jewish background who do not practice the Jewish religion.

* The [[Partition of India|Partition]] of India and (later Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]]) arose as a result of separatism on the part of Muslims.
* [[Sikh]]s in India sought an independent nation of [[Khalistan]] after an agitation in the 1970s and 1980s for implementation of the [[Anandpur Resolution|Anandpur Sahib Resolution]] (demanding things such as a greater share of river water and autonomy for Punjab) resulted in the storming of the Harimandir Sahib (Golden Temple) by the Government of India troops in 1984. The storming of the temple to flush out Sikh Militants who were gaining momentum in their agitation for greater autonomy for Punjab resulted in Sikhs demanding an independent state for the Sikhs situated in Punjab [[Khalistan movement]]. The conflict escalated and led to an assassination of the [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Indira Gandhi]] as a retaliation of an Indian military operation called 'Operation Blue Star' directed against the Sikhs' holiest shrine, the Golden Temple, in which many innocent Sikh civilians too lost their lives. The revenge murder of Gandhi evoked a Congress Party led backlash in the form of the Sikh genocide, which started in New Delhi and swept India in November 1984. That only further strengthened the Khalistan Movement, but it was largely subdued owing to the efforts of the police in Punjab. The controversial response by the Punjab State reportedly involved the use of human rights violations in the form of unexplained disappearances, faked encounters killings, rape and torture. However, many in the Sikh diaspora in the West and even Sikhs in India, still support the idea of Khalistan, but support is dying and generally the Indian Sikh population is patriotic towards India or at least not supportive of the idea of Khalistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Blbir|last=Punj|url=http://www.sikhtimes.com/news_061605a.html|title=The Ghost of Khalistan|work=Sikh Times|date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shan State Army-North''' ({{lang-my|ရှမ်းပြည်တပ်မတော် - မြောက်ပိုင်း}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''SSA-N'''), also known as '''Shan State Army/Special Region 3''' (SSA/SR-3) is a [[Shan nationalist]] [[Insurgency|insurgent group]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma). It is the armed wing of the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmpeacemonitor.org/stakeholders/stakeholders-overview/167-ssa-n Shan State Progress Party/ Shan State Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Shan State Army was founded in 24 April 1964 and The Shan State Progress Party was founded in 1971, for the political wing of SSA. In 1989, the SSPP signed a ceasefire in 1989 after negotiations with the [[SLORC]] and was able to obtain a degree of autonomy for the areas under its control, establishing the ''Special Region 3'' of the Shan State. This area included Nam Kham, Langkho, Hsipaw, Kyauk Mae, Mong Hsu, Tang Yang, Mongyai, Kehsi and Lashio Township. The size of the armed group at that time was of about 4.000 fighters. Even after having signed a ceasefire, the [[Burmese military]] continued to attack the Shan State Army-North areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmapartnership.org/tag/shan-state-army-north/ Elusive Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement Continues to Distract from Substantial Peace Talks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the SSA-N is more conciliatory towards the government than other armed Shan separatist groups, in 2005 it abandoned its base rather than disarm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5169 Uncertainty Reigns in Shan State]&lt;/ref&gt; At one point the Burmese government wished the Shan State Army - North to join its border guard force. Two of the three brigades reportedly agreed to join the border guard, while the other refused.

===Renewed hostilities===
In 2014 the group has clashed with the Burmese army in Kehsi Mansam Township, home to the SSA-N Wanhai headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dvb.no/news/shan-state-army-north-and-govt-discuss-troop-clashes-burma-myanmar/42154 Shan State Army-North and govt discuss troop clashes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 6 October 2015 a large scale offensive by the [[Tatmadaw]] comprising 20 Burma Army battalions has been launched in central Shan State. The aim of the military is to seize Shan ceasefire territories in [[Kehsi Township|Kehsi]], [[Mong Nawng]], [[Mong Hsu Township|Mong Hsu]] and [[Tangyan Township|Tangyan]] townships, using heavy artillery and with fighter jet and helicopter gunship air support to indiscriminately shell and bomb civilian areas. These attacks have displaced thousands of [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Palaung people|Palaung]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]] and [[Lahu people]] causing a new humanitarian crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/741396/govt-invasion-of-shan-state-mocks-ceasefire-pact Govt invasion of Shan state mocks ceasefire pact- Bangkok Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shanhumanrights.org/index.php/news-updates/233-naypyidaw-must-immediately-stop-its-attacks-in-central-shan-state-and-let-communities-return-home Attacks in central Shan State]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The SSA-N originally had three brigades: the 1st, 3rd, and 7th brigades,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shanland.org/politics/2005/One_ceasefire_commander_has_had_enough_of_it.htm/?searchterm=ssna Shan Herald] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204151713/http://www.shanland.org/politics/2005/One_ceasefire_commander_has_had_enough_of_it.htm/?searchterm=ssna |date=4 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but currently only has two.

'''Subsidized housing''' is government sponsored economic assistance aimed towards alleviating [[home|housing]] costs and expenses for [[Poverty|impoverished people]] with low to moderate incomes. Forms of subsidies include direct housing subsidies, non-profit housing, public housing, rent supplements, and some forms of co-operative and private sector housing. In the [[United States]], subsidized housing is often called "[[affordable housing]]."

There are scientific research suggesting that actions to facilitate people's access to housing contribute to lower poverty situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00553|title=Providing a more efficent opportunity to international and interdisciplinary of research in the housing and property field|last=|first=|date=|website=Social Impact Open Repository|archive-url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00553|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Co-operative housing ===
{{main|Housing cooperative}}
Some co-operative housing may offer subsidized units, but its main mandate is not subsidization. Its operating mandate is to offer non profit housing, where the rents or housing charges as they are called, goes back into the maintenance of the building instead of the profit of a landlord.  Co-operative housing is controlled by the members of the co-op, which is run by a board of directors.  There is no outside landlord. In most cases, all residents of the co-op become members and are owners, and agree to follow certain by-laws.  Some co-ops are subsidized housing because they receive government funding to support a rent-geared-to-income program for low-income residents. There are other co-ops that are market-rate and limited equity, these types of cooperatives do not receive government funding and are not subsidized housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Housing Cooperatives |publisher= U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|url=http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/omhar/owners/hsgcoops.cfm|accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing affordable housing, some co-ops serve the needs of specific communities, including seniors, artists, and persons with disabilities.

Examples of co-operative housing include: College Houses, Urban Homesteading Assistance Board ([[UHAB]]), and [[Habitat '67]], and regular rental housing be they regular looking apartments, townhouses or high end buildings such as those overlooking Central Park in New York City.

=== Housing subsidies ===
{{main|Housing subsidies}}

Housing subsidies are government financial assistance to help provide housing.  The largest housing subsidy in the US is the home mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners with mortgages on first homes, second homes, and even boats with bathrooms to lower their taxes owed. The cost to the federal government of the mortgage interest deductions in 2012 was approximately $110 billion.  Some states also have the mortgage interest deduction provision.  The majority of the home mortgage interest deduction goes to the top 5% income earners in the United States. Some housing subsidies are also provided to low income tenants in renting housing. These subsidies are often defined by whether the subsidy is given to the landlord and then criteria are set for the tenants they can lease to or whether the subsidy is given to the tenant, typically as a voucher, and they are allowed to find suitable private housing. The subsidy amount is typically based on the tenant's income, usually the difference between the rent and 30% of the tenant's gross income, but other formulas have been used.&lt;ref&gt;Haffner, M and Oxley, M, Housing Subsidies: Definitions and Comparisons, Housing Studies, Volume 14, Number 2, 1 March 1999 , pp. 145-162(18)&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare cases a financial institution or non-profit organization will provide mortgage loans at rates that are not profitable for the sake of a specific group.  In Canada one such organization is Non-Profit Housing Subsidies Canada which provides subsidized mortgage loans to employees and volunteers of other non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nphsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-profit housing'''{{main|Non-profit housing}}

Non-profit housing is owned and managed by private non-profit groups such as [[church (building)|churches]], ethnocultural communities or by governments. Many units are provided by [[community development]] corporations (CDCs). They use private funding and government subsidies to support a rent-geared-towards-income program for low-income tenants.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]], [http://www.huduser.org/publications/affhsg/nonprof.html "Status and Prospects of the Nonprofit Housing Sector"], June 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Koebel (1998), chapters on Non-Profit Housing&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

=== Public housing ===
{{main|Public housing}}

Public housing is real property owned and managed by the government. Tenants must meet specific eligibility requirements.

=== Rent supplements ===
Rent supplements are subsidies paid by the government to private landlords who accept low-income tenants. The supplements make up the difference between rental "market price" and the amount of rent paid by tenants, for example 30% of the tenants income. A notable example of a rent supplement in the [[United States]] is [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] of the [[Housing Act of 1937]] ({{USC|42|1437f}}).

According to a 2018 study, major cuts in rental subsidies for poor households in the United Kingdom led to lowered house prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046217304180|title=Housing subsidies and property prices: Evidence from England|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3185">'''Swing producer''' is a supplier or a close [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]] group of suppliers of any [[commodity]], controlling its global deposits and possessing large spare production capacity. A swing producer is able to increase or decrease commodity supply at minimal additional internal cost, and thus able to influence prices and balance the markets, providing downside protection in the short to middle term. Examples of swing producers include [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/03/26/ebr5.htm Iraq emerges as new ‘swing producer’ in Opec]&lt;/ref&gt; in oil,&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Naimi |first1=Ali |title=Out of the Desert |date=2016 |publisher=Portfolio Penguin |location=Great Britain |isbn=9780241279250 |pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]] in [[potash]] fertilizers,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20150106040331/http://www.mineweb.com/archive/russia-becomes-swing-producer-in-global-potash-market/ Russia becomes swing producer in global potash market.

Boone, David L. Kurtz, page 72]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes==
By modeling the swing producer behavior, John Morecroft describes two modes: normal swing mode and punitive mode. Usually in the normal mode, the swing producer responds to market price fluctuations by marginally increasing or decreasing its output in order to maintain stable prices for all producers. However, independent participants can take unjust advantage of the reduced supply and increase their output in order to win a larger market share. In such cases, the swing producer switches to the punitive mode and greatly increases its product output in order to reduce prices, causing losses for other producers and making them cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morecroft |first1=John D.

Two referendums were held in [[Taiwan]] on 12 January 2008, alongside [[Taiwan legislative election, 2008|legislative elections]]. One (officially numbered as Question 3) concerned [[transitional justice]] and the treatment of contentious properties acquired by the [[Kuomintang]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_7160000/newsid_7165000/7165026.stm 台選舉公投爭議落幕將采一階段投票] BBC News, 30 December 2007 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst a counter-referendum (Question 4) was initiated by the Kuomintang on alleged corruption in politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_7160000/newsid_7166000/7166028.stm 國民黨抵制追討黨產公投] BBC News, 31 December 2007 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was considered to be a dress rehearsal for a [[Taiwanese United Nations membership referendums, 2008|more contentious referendum]] on support for Taiwan admission to the United Nations to be held in March.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Although a majority of voters voted in favour of both proposals, voter turnout was only 26%, well below the 50% required to make the results valid. The legislative elections had a turnout of around 58%.

==Questions==
===Proposal 3===
This question was officially championed by former premier [[Yu Shyi-kun]].
{{cquote|Do you agree that the following principles should be followed to legislate a ‘Regulation for the Disposal of Properties Inappropriately Acquired by Political Parties’, in order to return such properties of the Kuomintang to the people?: Kuomintang’s and its associate organization’s properties{{spaced ndash}}outside of party dues, political donations, and public subsidies{{spaced ndash}}should be presumed inappropriately acquired and returned to the people. Those already liquidated, the party should compensate at market value. (你是否同意依下列原則制定「政黨不當取得財產處理條例」，將中國國民黨黨產還給全民：國民黨及其附隨組織的財產，除黨費、政治獻金及競選補助金外，均推定為不當取得的財產，應還給人民。已處分者，應償還價額。)}}

===Proposal 4===
This question was officially championed by former finance minister [[Wang Chien-shien]].

{{cquote|Do you agree that legislation should be enacted to investigate the responsibility of leaders of the nation and their subordinates, when there is grave damage to the nation due to their wrongful intentions or grave failure in carrying out their duties? Further, do you agree that Commissions of Inquiry should be set up by the [[Legislative Yuan]] to investigate such matters; and that the departments of the government should co-operate fully without resistance, in order that the benefits of the people will be preserved? That the personnel criminally at fault should be punished and their illegal income be recovered? (您是否同意制定法律追究國家領導人及其部屬，因故意或重大過失之措施，造成國家嚴重損害之責任，並由立法院設立調查委員會調查，政府各部門應全力配合，不得抗拒，以維全民利益，並懲處違法失職人員，追償不當所得？)}}

==Campaign==
The Kuomintang urged voters to boycott both referendums to prevent them from reaching the 50% voter turnout needed to for validate the result, and there was much pre-election controversy over the format and structure of the balloting.  Initially, the Kuomintang was in favor of a two-step balloting system where voters would vote for the legislative elections and then for the referendum, while the DPP was in favor of a one-step system in which voters would get all four ballots to vote. The final system was a one-step, two-table system in which voters would get the ballots at separate tables but would mark the ballot papers together.

'''The Elders''' is an international non-governmental organisation of [[public figure]]s noted as elder [[Politician|statesmen]], [[peace activist]]s, and [[Human rights activists|human rights advocates]], who were brought together by [[Nelson Mandela]] in 2007. They describe themselves as "independent global leaders working together for peace and human rights". The goal Mandela set for the Elders was to use their "almost 1,000 years of collective experience" to work on solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems such as [[Global warming|climate change]], [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], and poverty, as well as to "use their political independence to help resolve some of the world's most intractable [[Group conflict|conflicts]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/59C0C017-4A63-4F97-9D91-D1A336A2B83A.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821142020/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/59C0C017-4A63-4F97-9D91-D1A336A2B83A.htm|date=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Elders is, as of November 2018, chaired by [[Mary Robinson]], and consists of eight Elders and five Elders Emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theelders.org/article/mary-robinson-appointed-new-chair-elders|title=Mary Robinson appointed new Chair of The Elders|website=The Elders|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/about|title=About The Elders|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=TheElders.org|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kofi Annan]] served as chair from 2013 until his death in 2018; [[Desmond Tutu]] served for six years as chair before stepping down in May 2013, and remains an Elder Emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/kofi-annan-appointed-chair-elders |title=  Kofi Annan appointed Chair of The Elders |publisher=TheElders.org |date=10 May 2013 |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was initiated by [[Richard Branson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/branson-planned-mandela-mission-to-prevent-iraq-war-1-1050218 Branson planned Mandela mission to prevent Iraq war], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 18 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and musician and human rights activist [[Peter Gabriel]], together with anti-[[apartheid]] activist and former [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Nelson Mandela]]. Mandela announced the formation of the group on his eighty-ninth birthday on 18 July 2007 in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=C801BC01AA46FEC2 |title= The Elders press launch in Johannesburg, South Africa |publisher=YouTube |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the launch ceremony, an empty chair was left on stage for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the human rights activist who was a [[political prisoner]] in [[Burma]]/Myanmar at the time. Present at the launch were Kofi Annan, [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Graça Machel]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Mary Robinson]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Muhammad Yunus]], and [[Li Zhaoxing]]. Members who were not present at the launch were [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], and [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/world/africa/18safrica.html?_r=1&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=%22the+elders%22+mandela+branson&amp;st=cse|title=Former Leaders Create Freelance Global Diplomatic Team|first=Michael|last=Wines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martti Ahtisaari]] joined The Elders in September 2009, [[Hina Jilani]] and [[Ernesto Zedillo]] in July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/martti-ahtisaari-joins-elders|title=Martti Ahtisaari joins The Elders|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ricardo Lagos]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/former-president-chile-ricardo-lagos-join-elders|title=Former President of Chile Ricardo Lagos to join The Elders|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, former UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] also joined the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/former-un-secretary-general-ban-ki-moon-joins-elders|title=Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joins The Elders|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elders are funded by a group of donors who are named on the advisory council.

===Current Work===

====Universal Health Care====
At the [[Women Deliver]] conference in May 2016, The Elders launched a new initiative to campaign for [[Universal health care|Universal Health Coverage]] (UHC) as part of their efforts to support and implement the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-launch-new-initiative-universal-health-coverage-women-deliver|title=The Elders launch new initiative on Universal Health Coverage at Women Deliver|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative focuses on four areas: 
1)	Promoting UHC as the best way to achieve the health Sustainable Development Goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/faqs-uhc-and-sustainable-development-goals|title=UHC explained: Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
2)	Promoting UHC's health, economic and political benefits;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/faqs-uhc-delivers-substantial-health-economic-and-political-benefits|title=UHC explained: Universal Health Coverage delivers substantial health, economic and political benefits|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
3)	Prioritising women, children and adolescents in UHC's implementation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/faqs-women-children-and-adolescents-uhc-priority|title=UHC explained: Women, children and adolescents as a UHC priority|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
4)	Reiterating the role of public financing in sustainably funding UHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/faqs-public-financing-key-uhc|title=UHC explained: Public financing is the key to UHC|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Gro Harlem Brundtland delivered a keynote speech at a high-level event on the sidelines of the [https://www.un.org/en/ga/71/meetings/ 71st UN General Assembly] in New York. Joined by [[Margaret Chan]], Director-General of the [[WHO]] and health ministers of South Africa and Thailand, she called for courageous leadership to achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/accelerating-progress-toward-uhc-2030|title=Accelerating progress toward UHC by 2030|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Kofi Annan sent letters to Indian leaders to commend the progress made in reforming the Indian healthcare system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/after-kofi-annan-former-norway-pm-praises-aap-govt-s-mohalla-clinics/story-PErXELux8KNYtyT7wLQ4uM.html|title=After Kofi Annan, another world leader praises AAP govt’s mohalla clinics|date=2 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-urge-bold-steps-reach-universal-health-coverage-india|title=The Elders urge bold steps to reach Universal Health Coverage in India|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gro Harlem Brundtland and Ernesto Zedillo delivered keynote speeches at the [http://www.pmaconference.mahidol.ac.th/index.php Prince Mahidol Awards Conference] in Bangkok, Thailand. Gro Harlem Brundtland highlighted the importance of inclusive health policy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/social-inclusion-what-does-it-mean-health-policy-and-practice|title=Social Inclusion: What Does It Mean for Health Policy and Practice?|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ernesto Zedillo explained how to sustainably implement Universal Health Coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/four-pillars-ensure-inclusive-uhc|title=Four pillars to ensure inclusive UHC|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlighting the link between access to affordable health care and gender equality, in January 2017, two members of The Elders expressed concern at the re-introduction of the [[Mexico City Policy]] by the recently inaugurated [[President of the United States]], [[Donald J. Trump]]. The pro-abortion activist Gro Harlem Brundtland said: "This decision puts the health of women and children at risk" and warned that "vulnerable people will die unnecessarily."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-statement-us-reintroduction-global-gag-rule|title=The Elders’ statement on US reintroduction of "Global Gag Rule"|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Refugees and Migration====
In October 2015, Kofi Annan, Gro Brundtland and Hina Jilani joined [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]] and the Director General of the [[International Organization for Migration]] [[William L. Swing]] at an event on the refugee and migration crisis at the [[Graduate Institute]] in Geneva.

During the event, Gro Harlem Brundtland said "Too many leaders are not only shy when it comes to making this case to their people, they fundamentally lack the courage to do so…". Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein also rejected the dehumanising rhetoric adopted by some politicians towards refugees and migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/show-political-courage-over-refugee-crisis|title=Show political courage over the refugee crisis|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants in September 2016, Kofi Annan, Maarti Ahtisaari and Lakhdar Brahimi visited Germany to launch a report calling for political will to ensure that responsibility is truly shared between countries, and for the vulnerable are protected. They met the then-Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Federal President Joachim Gauck, and also visited a refugee resettlement centre in Berlin to hear directly from new arrivals to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-hail-germanys-engagement-refugee-and-migration-issues|title=The Elders hail Germany&amp;amp;#039;s engagement on refugee and migration issues|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report "[http://theelders.org/article/challenge-lies-opportunity-how-world-must-respond-refugees-and-mass-migration In Challenge Lies Opportunity: How the world must respond to refugees and mass migration]" outlined four key principles which The Elders believe should be at the heart of the international response to refugees and mass migration:

# Response mechanisms to large flows of people must be developed and properly coordinated, both regionally and internationally
# Assistance to major refugee-hosting countries must be enhanced
# Resettlement opportunities must be increased, along with additional pathways for admission
# Human rights and refugee protection must be upheld and strengthened

Three Elders attended the [https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/events/ga/2016/addressrefugeesmigrantssummit.html UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants] on 19 September 2016, which was held during the 71st Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations' General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-visit-unga-high-level-week-new-york-17-22-september-2016|title=Elders’ Visit to UNGA High-Level Week, New York, 17-22 September 2016|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martti Ahtisaari, Hina Jilani and Mary Robinson spoke at the high-level Round Tables which addressed different aspects of the topic: vulnerabilities of refugees and migrants, responsibility-sharing and respect for international law, and addressing the drivers of migration, respectively.

In January 2017, The Elders condemned the US [[refugee ban]], enacted by the recently inaugurated President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Kofi Annan said: "It is deeply regrettable that a nation of immigrants should turn its back so harshly on refugees escaping violence and war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-condemn-us-refugee-ban-call-global-protection-vulnerable|title=The Elders condemn US refugee ban, call for global protection of vulnerable|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stronger UN====
At the [[Munich Security Conference]] in February 2015, the Elders launched the "Stronger UN" initiative, which promoted a series of reforms to strengthen the [[United Nations]]. This included a review of the composition of the [[Security Council]] and of the appointment of the [[Secretary-General]].&lt;ref name="theelders.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/elders-call-strengthening-united-nations|title=The Elders call for strengthening of the United Nations|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting that seventy years since its founding, the UN was still falling short of its Charter pledge "''to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war''",&lt;ref name="theelders.org"/&gt; The Elders proposed to:

# Make the Security Council more representative of the world today, by introducing a new category of non-permanent members that can be immediately re-elected if they obtained the trust of the other members. As such, they would become de facto permanent members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/un-fit-purpose|title=A UN fit for purpose|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Break the deadlock in the Security Council in situations of atrocity crimes by compelling [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|P-5 member]]'s to pledge that they will not use or threaten to use their veto in case of humanitarian crisis where people are victims of genocide or other atrocities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# Urge the Security Council to make more regular and systematic use of the "[https://www.un.org/en/sc/about/methods/arriaformula.shtml Arria formula]" to give groups representing people in zones of conflict the opportunity to inform and influence Council decisions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# Make the selection process of the Secretary-General more transparent and fair&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the [[World Humanitarian Summit]] in May 2016, several Elders featured in a video alongside [[Salil Shetty]], Secretary-General of [[Amnesty International]] and Simon Adams, Executive-Director of the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect, calling for veto restraint and increased cooperation amongst the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|Permanent Members of the UN Security Council]] to prevent mass atrocities and save lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/ahead-world-humanitarian-summit-elders-urge-un-action-stop-mass-atrocities|title=Ahead of World Humanitarian Summit, The Elders urge UN action to stop mass atrocities|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, some of The Elders' recommendations on the selection of the new Secretary-General were adopted by the UN. For the first time, the names of candidates for the position of Secretary-General were publicly circulated, and all declared candidates participated in public hearings in the General Assembly. These changes led to a notable increase in the transparency of the selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-welcome-nomination-antonio-guterres-next-un-secretary-general|title=The Elders welcome nomination of António Guterres as next UN Secretary-General|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate Change====
Prior to the 2009 [[United Nations Climate Change conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen, The Elders launched the Climate Change initiative together with their grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-enlist-their-grandchildrens-help-climate-change|title=The Elders enlist their grandchildren’s help on climate change|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elders believe that strong leadership is required at all levels in order to deliver a sustainable future. They strongly welcomed the [[Paris Agreement on Climate Change]] reached at the [[COP21]] summit in December 2015, and are working to ensure it is now implemented fully and fairly.

The Elders believe that as climate change goes hand in hand with sustainable development, a holistic policy approach that is able to incorporate the voice of civil society and grassroots activities is needed. In this regard, in 2012, The Elders engaged with four young activists in an inter-generational debate on the change needed to secure a sustainable future for the planet, in the run-up to the [[UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/eldersyoungers-building-sustainable-and-more-equitable-world-all|title=Elders+Youngers: building a sustainable and more equitable world for all|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2016, Elders such as Mary Robinson and Gro Harlem Brundtland participated in the Social Good Summit in New York, in which they took part in dialogues with global climate and young activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/bad-weather-human-cost-climate-change|title=Bad weather: The Human Cost of Climate Change|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While The Elders condemned the announcement in June 2017 by President Trump of his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theelders.org/article/elders-condemn-us-quitting-paris-climate-agreement-no-one-country-can-dismantle-it|title=The Elders condemn US for quitting Paris climate agreement: no one country can dismantle it.|website=The Elders|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; they note that this has in fact galvanised action by states and cities. They maintain the need to hold governments and businesses to their word so that the deal is implemented in full and in good faith, with adequate means to ratchet up ambition and have reiterated this in subsequent meetings including with Pope Francis and President Macron in late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theelders.org/climate-change|title=Climate change|website=The Elders|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Equality for Women and Girls====
Commitment to gender equality is a cornerstone of The Elders' engagement in securing dignity and rights for all. From Universal Health Coverage to climate change and mass migration, to peacebuilding and protecting human rights defenders, The Elders believe that women and girls have specific needs that demand appropriately-tailored policy responses.

This includes considering the impact of religion and tradition on women's rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/religious-and-traditional-practices-discriminate-against-women-and-girls|title=Religious and traditional practices discriminate against women and girls|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the harmful practice of [[child marriage]], supporting efforts to promote women as [[peacemakers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/you-cannot-have-sustainable-peace-without-women|title="You cannot have sustainable peace without women"|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the specific burdens and responsibilities women face in societies most threatened by climate change, highlighting the scale of violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/violence-against-women-increasing-public-awareness|title=Violence against women – increasing public awareness|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the effect of impunity in prolonging the occurrence of sexual violence in conflict &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/jimmy-carter-end-impunity-sexual-violence|title=Jimmy Carter: end impunity for sexual violence|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;—including exploitation by [https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/ UN Peacekeeping missions]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-welcome-un-secretary-generals-commitment-fight-sexual-exploitation|title=The Elders welcome UN Secretary-General’s commitment to fight sexual exploitation|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and prioritising the health needs of women in the implementation of Universal Health Coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/why-must-women-children-adolescents-be-uhc-priority|title=Why must women, children &amp; adolescents be a UHC priority?|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 The Elders called for an end to harmful and discriminatory practices that are justified on the grounds of religion and tradition. Fernando Henrique Cardoso said that "the idea that God is behind discrimination is unacceptable"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree|title=This page has been removed – News|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Carter stated that the Elders call upon "all leaders to challenge and change the harmful teachings and practices, no matter how ingrained, which justify discrimination against women. We ask, in particular, that leaders of all religions have the courage to acknowledge and emphasise the positive messages of dignity and equality that all the world's major faiths share".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/opinion/10kristof.html?ref=opinion|title=Opinion – Religion and Women|first=Nicholas|last=Kristof|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' columnist [[Nicholas Kristof]] later wrote that "The Elders are right that religious groups should stand up for a simple ethical principle: any person's human rights should be sacred, and not depend on something as earthly as their genitals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrw.org/child-marriage-facts-and-figures/|title=Child Marriage Facts and Figures – ICRW – PASSION. PROOF. POWER.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elders+Youngers====
When Nelson Mandela founded The Elders in 2007, he told the group to listen to the marginalised – especially young people. The Elders' work with young people has consisted in meeting many passionate young people on peace, equality and protecting the environment. 
In 2012, The Elders and four young activists began an inter-generational debate about the change needed to secure a sustainable future, in the run-up to the U [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/rio20 N Conference on Sustainable Development] ([[Rio+20]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Beside collaborating with young climate activists, The Elders have also hold roundtable discussions on African leadership, debated Egypt's revolution with young people in Cairo, discussed the refugee crisis and UN reform with young students at Sciences Po in Paris and, featured guest blogs from youth contributors on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/africa-2010-game-plan-winning-continent|title=Africa 2010: A Game Plan for a Winning Continent|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-egyptian-youth-you-are-future|title=Elders to Egyptian youth: &amp;quot;You are the future&amp;quot;|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/lakhdar-brahimi-discuss-migration-and-security-sciences-po|title=Lakhdar Brahimi to discuss migration and security at Sciences Po|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/martti-ahtisaari-calls-un-reform-sciences-po-event-paris|title=Martti Ahtisaari calls for UN reform at Sciences Po event in Paris|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/news-media/elders-youngers/guest-blog|title=News &amp;amp; Media|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
The Elders support greater openness and dialogue between Iran and the international community, and encourage Iran to play a stabilising role in the wider Middle East.

In their first visit to Iran as a group, The Elders travelled to Tehran in January 2014 to meet privately with the Iranian leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-conclude-fruitful-first-visit-iran|title=The Elders conclude fruitful first visit to Iran|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegation leader Kofi Annan and fellow Elders Martti Ahtisaari, Desmond Tutu and Ernesto Zedillo held a series of productive meetings on the easing of regional tensions; the spread of extremist violence internationally; human rights; and the Syrian crisis. They were encouraged by Iran's new spirit of openness and dialogue with the outside world.

In February 2015, The Elders met again with Foreign Minister [[Javad Zarif]], on the margins of the [[Munich Security Conference]], to encourage a successful conclusion of the [[P5+1]] nuclear negotiations and to discuss solutions to regional security issues.

In July 2015, The Elders welcomed the agreement reached on Iran's nuclear programme between Iran, the P5+1 countries (US, Russia, China, UK, France and Germany) and the [[EU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-welcome-iranian-nuclear-agreement-boost-middle-east-peace|title=The Elders welcome Iranian nuclear agreement as boost to Middle East peace|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They believe the agreement represents a historic opportunity to end decades of animosity between Iran and the West, especially the US, and to rebuild relationships on the basis of trust and mutual respect.

In 2016, The Elders issued a press release welcoming the lifting of sanctions against Iran as part of the implementation of the P5+1 nuclear deal, the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], which they continued to support throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-welcome-lifting-sanctions-against-iran|title=The Elders welcome the lifting of sanctions against Iran|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 The Elders issued a statement following the death of former Iranian President Rafsanjani, stating that "Iran has lost one of its most influential leaders and a strong voice for reform and for the improvement of regional relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-statement-death-former-iranian-president-rafsanjani|title=The Elders’ statement on the death of former Iranian President Rafsanjani|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Munich Security Conference in February 2017 Ernesto Zedillo and Lakhdar Brahimi met again with Javad Zarif. They also hosted a panel debate to defend the Iran Nuclear Agreement, joined by [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud|HRH Prince Turki]] of Saudi Arabia and [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani|HE Sheikh Hamad of Qatar.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/iran-nuclear-agreement-deal-worth-keeping|title=The Iran Nuclear Agreement: A Deal Worth Keeping?|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel and Palestine====
The long-running [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] has been one of The Elders' top priorities since the group was founded. Given the far-reaching impact of the unresolved conflict and the power imbalance between the parties, The Elders believe the international community has a vital role to play in helping Israelis and Palestinians reach a lasting solution. Particularly, they insist that the peace efforts must be based on the respect for universal human rights and international humanitarian law, as well as that the siege on [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] must be permanently lifted and that the boundaries between Israel and a viable Palestinian state must be based on the 1967 borders, including a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/israel-palestine|title=Israel-Palestine|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, in August 2009, The Elders visited [[Israel]] and the [[West Bank]] to draw attention to the impact of the long-running conflict on ordinary people, and to support efforts by Israelis and Palestinians to promote peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/richard-branson-without-mideast-resolution-something-ghastly-could-happen-1.282760|title=Richard Branson: Without Mideast Resolution, 'Something Ghastly' Could Happen|first1=Mike|last1=Dagan|first2=Guy|last2=Rolnik|first3=Asher |last3=Schechter|date=27 August 2009|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined on the trip by Richard Branson and Jeff Skoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/elders-of-peace-israel-must-freeze-west-bank-settlements-1.282718|title=Elders of Peace: Israel Must Freeze West Bank Settlements|date=26 August 2009|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elders met Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]], Palestinian Prime Minister [[Salam Fayyad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By ETHAN BRONNERAUG. 27, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/world/middleeast/28bilin.html?_r=2 |title=In Village, Palestinians See Model for Their Cause |work=The New York Times |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local peace activists involved in non-violent demonstrations. The report of their visit said they hoped it would "spur leaders and ordinary citizens alike to actions that will further peace, human rights and justice for all in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?ID=324344|title=Ex-leaders of US, Ireland to visit region|agency=Maan News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Elders, Mary Robinson, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, and Jimmy Carter, returned to the Middle East in October 2010 to visit [[Egypt]], Gaza, Israel, [[Jordan]], [[Syria]] and the West Bank. The aim was to encourage peace efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mideast-carter-idUSTRE69D5PD20101014|title=Ex-President Carter to start Mideast peace tour|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on the need to reach "a just and secure peace for all" based on [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/10/21/israel.elders.visit/|title='Elders' visit Israel on Mideast peace tour|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the trip, The Elders held discussions on the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|peace process]] with political leaders, representatives of human rights organisations, student and youth groups, women's groups, business, civil society and opinion leaders.

During the trip, Mary Robinson said that "As Elders, we believe the two-state solution has the potential to deliver peace – but a more energetic and comprehensive approach is needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/carter-in-syria-israel-must-fully-lift-gaza-blockade-1.320044|title=Carter in Syria: Israel Must Fully Lift Gaza Blockade|date=19 October 2010|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elders also called for an immediate end to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip]], describing it as an "illegal collective punishment" and "an impediment to peace." The Elders released a report outlining their conclusions following the visit, which they hoped would "be a helpful contribution to peace efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Elders-meet-Peres-over-stalemate-in-peace-process|title=Elders meet Peres over stalemate in peace process|work=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson returned to the region, travelling to Israel, the West Bank and Egypt.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/jimmy-carter-says-mideast-peace-vanishing-155117602.html|title=Jimmy Carter says Mideast peace is 'vanishing'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/we-are-heading-towards-one-state-outcome|title=‘We are heading towards a one-state outcome’|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their discussions with political leaders, civil society, and humanitarian and human rights experts, the Elders sought to "express concern about the future of the [[two-state solution]] and highlight the effect of [[Israeli settlement|settlement]] expansion and other changes in the city of [[Jerusalem]] as a major impediment to peace between Israelis and Palestinians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/|title=Business Day|website=www.businesslive.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Jimmy Carter and Gro Harlem Brundtland visited Israel and Palestine and ended their visit to Israel and Palestine with a call for meaningful steps to stop the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and reconcile the different Palestinian factions. They held talks with President Mahmoud Abbas and senior political figures from both Israel and Palestine, civil society groups and ordinary citizens to hear their perspectives and convey The Elders' commitment to a fair and enduring resolution to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://shmuley.com/2016/01/25/whats-richard-bransons-problem-with-israel/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201011327/https://shmuley.com/2016/01/25/whats-richard-bransons-problem-with-israel/ |archive-date=1 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elders supported the diplomatic efforts led by the French Government to keep the two-state solution alive through high-level conferences in Paris in June 2016 and in January 2017. They also welcomed the UN Security Council Resolution in December 2016 that called on Israel to immediately halt all settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-welcome-paris-mideast-peace-conference-urge-all-p5-states-show-leadership|title=The Elders welcome Paris Mideast peace conference, urge all P5 states to show leadership|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They fully support the [[Arab Peace Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/qa-arab-peace-initiative|title=Q&amp;amp;A: the Arab Peace Initiative|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; which calls for normal, peaceful and secure relations between Israel and the Arab world, in return for Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.

In 2017 the Elder's condemned Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel stating this, 'greatly harms peace processes.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theelders.org/article/elders-condemn-us-recognition-jerusalem-israeli-capital-grave-risk-peace|title=The Elders condemn US recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital as grave risk to peace|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Myanmar====
A delegation of Elders visited [[Myanmar]] for the first time as a group in September 2013. In their meetings with senior officials in the government, political leaders, religious leaders and civil society groups, Martti Ahtisaari, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Jimmy Carter explored how best they could support peace and inclusive development in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-encourage-all-parties-myanmar-advance-national-reforms-support-peace-accords|title=The Elders encourage all parties in Myanmar to advance national reforms, support peace accords|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/myanmars-grassroots-should-have-role-national-reforms-peace-talks|title=Myanmar’s grassroots should have a role in national reforms, peace talks|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elders returned to Myanmar in March and December 2014. In the first trip, they travelled to Nay Pyi Taw and Myitkyina, Kachin State, in Myanmar and to Mae Sot and Chiang Mai in Thailand and deepened their relations key interlocutors and focused particularly on representatives of the country's ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-call-immediate-end-conflict-myanmar-and-urge-parties-engage-talks|title=The Elders call for immediate end to conflict in Myanmar and urge parties to engage in talks|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second one, they visited Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar and Chiang Mai in Thailand, and they reaffirmed their efforts to encourage sustained progress in Myanmar's transition process and called for an immediate end to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cyprus-talks-carter-idUKTRE48P20D20080926 |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427095826/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cyprus-talks-carter-idUKTRE48P20D20080926 |archive-date=27 April 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
		
The Elders welcomed the elections in Myanmar in November 2015 and the victory of [[Aung San Suu Kyi|Aung San Suu Kyi']]s [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) in forming a civilian-led government.

In August 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi invited Kofi Annan to chair an independent Commission to assess the situation in [[Rakhine State]], including the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] community. The Commission published its final report in August 2017 and put forward recommendations to surmount the political, socio-economic and humanitarian challenges that currently face Rakhine State.

On publishing the report, Kofi Annan said: ''"Unless concerted action – led by the government and aided by all sectors of the government and society – is taken soon, we risk the return of another cycle of violence and'' radicalisation'', which will further deepen the chronic poverty that afflicts Rakhine State."''

The Elders supported Kofi Annan in this role, which he undertook in his own capacity.

At their October 2017 board meeting, The Elders issued a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theelders.org/article/elders-call-myanmar-allow-return-displaced-rohingya|title=The Elders call on Myanmar to allow return of displaced Rohingya|website=The Elders|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressing their deep dismay and concern at the wave of violence and destruction that swept through Rakhine State from August 2017, displacing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims. They called on Myanmar's government and military leaders to allow displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh and other countries to return, and for their human rights and safety to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theelders.org/myanmar|title=Myanmar|website=The Elders|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zimbabwe====
[[Zimbabwe]] has been a key focus of concern for The Elders since the group was formed in 2007. Once one of Africa's strongest economies, Zimbabwe has suffered sustained political and economic crises over the last two decades and its leaders are failing in their responsibilities to the country's people.

In November 2008, three members of the Elders – Jimmy Carter, Graça Machel and Kofi Annan – planned to visit Zimbabwe to draw attention to the country's escalating humanitarian and economic crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-cancel-visit-zimbabwe-meetings-continue-south-africa|title=The Elders cancel visit to Zimbabwe: meetings to continue in South Africa|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day before their planned travel to [[Harare]], they were informed that they would be refused entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/22/zimbabwe|title=Jimmy Carter and Kofi Annan refused entry visas to Zimabwe|first=Associated|last=Press|date=22 November 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Carter said it was the first time he had been denied permission [link] to enter any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/world/africa/23zimbabwe.html|title=Carter Group Barred From Zimbabwe|first=Celia W.|last=Dugger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three Elders stayed in [[Johannesburg]] and were briefed by Zimbabwean political and business leaders, aid workers, donors, UN agencies and civil society representatives, many of whom travelled from Zimbabwe to see them. The Elders also held meetings with the leaders of South Africa and Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2008-11-24-elders-zim-crisis-beyond-what-we-could-have-imagined|title=Elders: Zim crisis 'beyond what we could have imagined'|first=Thembela|last=Khamango|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference after their meetings, they said the situation was "worse than they could have imagined" and called for greater regional and global effort to alleviate the suffering of Zimbabweans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/elders-zimbabwe-failing-its-people|title=The Elders: Zimbabwe is failing its people|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graça Machel said that "the state is no longer able to offer basic services. It can no longer feed, educate or care for its citizens. It is failing its people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/01/zimbabwe-coalition-deal|title=Nelson Mandela's 'elders' welcome Zimbabwe's coalition deal|first=Associated|last=Press|date=1 February 2009|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the resignation of President Robert Mugabe in November, 2017 The Elders urged all stakeholders in Zimbabwe and the region to work together for a genuine democratic transition. In 2018 and beyond they will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe, civil society and human rights defenders in holding the country's new leaders to account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theelders.org/zimbabwe|title=Zimbabwe|website=The Elders|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Past Work===

====Child Marriage====
The Elders are committed to ending the practice of child marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13681053|title=Ethiopian girls fight child marriages|first=Will|last=Ross|date=7 June 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Desmond Tutu, Gro Brundtland and Mary Robinson visited [[Amhara, Ethiopia]], to learn about child marriage in a region where half of all female children are married before the age of 15.[109]

Alongside their fellow Elder Ela Bhatt, Tutu, Brundtland and Robinson also travelled to [[Bihar]], [[India]] in February 2012. Together, they visited Jagriti, a youth-led project aimed at preventing child marriage, and encouraged the state government's efforts to tackle the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Elders-advice-Stop-child-marriages/articleshow/11801903.cms?referral=PM|title=Elders' advice: Stop child marriages - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensviewsonnews.org/2011/09/girls-not-brides-an-end-to-child-marriages/|title=Girls not brides: an end to child marriages - Women's Views on News|website=www.womensviewsonnews.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The Elders initiated [[Girls Not Brides]]: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage, which brings together civil society organisations from around the world that work to tackle child marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/girls-not-brides-new-global-partnership-end-child-marriage|title=Girls Not Brides – a new global partnership to end child marriage|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global partnership aims to support activists working for change at the grassroots and call on governments and global organisations to make ending child marriage an international priority. Girls Not Brides became a fully independent organization, spun off from The Elders, in 2013.

In July 2016, The Elders welcomed action taken by leaders in The [[Gambia]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]] to end child marriage, as part of the African Union's continent-wide campaign to eradicate the harmful practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-welcome-new-moves-africa-end-child-marriage|title=The Elders welcome new moves in Africa to end child marriage|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Côte d'Ivoire====
Following widespread violence after long-awaited presidential elections in November 2010, The Elders committed to support efforts by the Ivorian government and civil society to promote reconciliation and healing in the country. Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan and Mary Robinson visited [[Ivory Coast]] on 1–2 May 2011 during which, they not only "encouraged reconciliation and healing", but they also emphasised the importance of improving the country's security situation. Beside meeting the President [[Alassane Ouattara]], Prime Minister [[Guillaume Soro]] and former President [[Laurent Gbagbo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-visit-cote-divoire-encourage-healing-and-national-reconciliation|title=The Elders to visit Côte d&amp;amp;#039;Ivoire to encourage healing and national reconciliation|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; they also brought together civil society organisations, including women's groups seeking a role in the peace process, and encouraged them to work together towards national reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-encourage-plans-truth-and-reconciliation-process-cote-divoire|title=The Elders encourage plans for truth and reconciliation process in Côte d&amp;amp;#039;Ivoire|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also visited a camp for internally displaced people to hear directly from ordinary people affected by the conflict.

Kofi Annan returned to Ivory Coast in January 2012 and October 2013 to support the ongoing reconciliation process. During his visit, he noted the progress that had been made and encouraged all Ivorians to participate in "the task of reconciliation and healing." in order to build an inclusive future and prepare for peaceful elections in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/media-advisory-kofi-annan-visit-cote-divoire-9-10-october-2013|title=Media advisory: Kofi Annan to visit Côte d’Ivoire from 9-10 October 2013|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/world/asia/26korea.html|title=Carter and Other Former Leaders to Travel to North Korea|first=Mark|last=McDonald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyprus====
The Elders began working on [[Cyprus]] in September 2008, when the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities formally entered into peace negotiations. Since then, they have visited the island four times to support all efforts to build peace, enhance trust, and sharing their experiences with leaders and civil society in order to encourage dialogue.&lt;ref name="http://theelders.org/cyprus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/cyprus |title=Cyprus |publisher=The Elders |date= |accessdate=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, they worked with the [http://www.cmp-cyprus.org/ Committee on Missing Persons] in Cyprus and the [http://cyprusfriendship.org/ Cyprus Friendship Programme] to film the documentary "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGh_rbPLfV4&amp;list=UUWJWr0Cs6UVNEyquN9dEItA Digging the Past in Search of the Future]" with the hope that this could help Cypriots to reach a common understanding about their shared past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/cyprus-digging-past-search-future|title=Cyprus: Digging the Past in Search of the Future|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, the Elders visited the island to support the newly begun peace talks between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders. Desmond Tutu said that "These opportunities don't come around very often".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprusedirectory.com/articleview.aspx?ID=4375|title=Elders arrive to lend their moral support - Cyprus Internet Directory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elders Jimmy Carter, Lakhdar Brahimi and Desmond Tutu met political leaders, civil society representatives and young people from both communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-10-08-1893099243_x.htm|title=World peacemakers offer support for Cyprus talks - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the visit they made it clear that they were visiting the island to offer support and not to get formally involvement in the peace process.

Gro Harlem Brundtland and Lakhdar Brahimi visited Athens, Ankara and Cyprus in September 2009 to encourage efforts to reunify the island. In Ankara they met Turkish President [[Abdullah Gül]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/cyprus-peace-process-going-well-facing-challenges|title=Cyprus peace process going well, but facing challenges|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President [[George Papandreou]] in Athens. In [[Nicosia]] they met Turkish Cypriot leader [[Mehmet Ali Talat]] and Greek Cypriot leader [[Dimitris Christofias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprusedirectory.com/articleview.aspx?ID=14527|title=The Elders in Cyprus to help peace process - Cyprus Internet Directory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elders also met local media and leading women from politics, business and civil society on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprusedirectory.com/cyprusguide/cyprus.aspx?ID=14551|title=Elders: Cypriot media ‘scathing and pessimistic’ - Cyprus Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Desmond Tutu, Jimmy Carter and Lakhdar Brahimi returned to Cyprus. They convened a public meeting on how trust could be engendered between conflicting communities and together with the Committee on Missing Persons filmed the documentary, "[http://www.theelders.org/article/cyprus-digging-past-search-future Cyprus: Digging the Past in Search of the Future]". Such documentary follows the three Elders as they accompany four young Cypriots to learn about the search for the remains of thousands of missing people who were killed in the violence of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/cyprus/cna/2011/11-02-08_1.cna.html|title=Cyprus News Agency: News in English, 11-02-08|website=www.hri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in early 2011 with special screenings in Nicosia and at the Houses of Parliament in London.. In Cyprus, Desmond Tutu and Gro Brundtland also met the newly elected leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, [[Derviş Eroğlu]] and the leader of the Greek Cypriot community, [[Demetris Christofias]], and called for a renewed spirit of leadership in Cyprus. The Elders also met the Archbishop of the Church of Cyprus, Chrysostomos II, to discuss the role of religious leaders in peacebuilding.&lt;ref name="http://theelders.org/cyprus"/&gt;

====Korean Peninsula====
The Elders launched their [[Korean Peninsula]] initiative in April 2011, when a delegation led by Jimmy Carter made a six-day visit to the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea), the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2011/04/201142634658654793.html|title=Carter leads North Korea peace mission|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jimmy Carter, together with Martti Ahtisaari, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Mary Robinson, aimed to alleviate tensions on the Peninsula, particularly by encouraging dialogue and addressing security and humanitarian concerns such as reported food shortages in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/qa-elders-visit-korean-peninsula|title=Q&amp;amp;A: The Elders&amp;amp;#039; visit to the Korean Peninsula|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In all three countries they met senior government officials, diplomats, UN representatives, humanitarian agencies, researchers, think tanks and North Korean refugees who fled to South Korea. Throughout the visit they made it clear that they were acting independently and did not intend "to replace or intervene in any official process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/report-elders-visit-korean-peninsula-and-china-april-2011|title=Report: The Elders’ visit to the Korean Peninsula and China, April 2011|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report released following the Elders' visit, Jimmy Carter stated: "''On relations between North and South Korea, there are no quick fixes…and progress will require greater flexibility, sincerity and commitment from all parties''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/07/113_91703.html|title=The Elders hail talks with N. Korea|date=27 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martti Ahtisaari and Gro Harlem Brundtland later travelled to Brussels to brief senior European Union officials on their findings.

====Sudan and South Sudan====
Peace in Sudan became a top priority for The Elders as soon as the group was founded. Indeed, The Elders' first mission was to [[Sudan]], from 30 September to 4 October 2007. Desmond Tutu, Lakhdar Brahimi, Jimmy Carter and Graça Machel travelled to the country to learn more about the humanitarian situation in [[Darfur]] and to affirm the group's support for the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (CPA), which was negotiated between North and South Sudan in 2005 to end its 22-year [[civil war]]. The Elders published a report on their findings titled 'Bringing Hope, Forging Peace: The Elders' Mission to Sudan'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/sudan-south-sudan|title=Sudan &amp;amp; South Sudan|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Elders encouraged states to provide urgently needed helicopters for peacekeepers in Darfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/humanitarian-situation-will-deteriorate-sharply-sudan-after-expulsion-aid-workers|title=Humanitarian situation will deteriorate sharply in Sudan after expulsion of aid workers|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 the Elders called for aid agencies to be given access to Sudan following their expulsion by the Sudanese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/desmond-tutu/sudan-between-peril-and-h_b_423300.html|title=Sudan Between Peril and Hope|first1=Desmond|last1=Tutu|first2=Lakhdar|last2=Brahimi|date=18 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of [[South Sudan]]'s self-determination referendum in January 2011, The Elders warned of a risk of renewed violence in Sudan and urged 'swift and bold action' by the international community in support of the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/sudan-010311.html|title=Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Joseph Warioba, and John Hardman to Lead  Carter Center Delegation to Observe Referendum on  Self-Determination of Southern Sudan|website=www.cartercenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, Jimmy Carter and Kofi Annan led the Carter Center delegation to observe the [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|referendum on self-determination in South Sudan.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/elders-sudan-and-south-sudan-initiative-2012|title=The Elders’ Sudan and South Sudan initiative, 2012|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, prompted by the "worsening relations between Sudan and South Sudan, deteriorating economic conditions in both countries, and renewed conflict in the Sudanese states of [[Blue Nile]] and [[South Kordofan]]", The Elders decided to make a series of visits to Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudan-is-willing-to-withdraw-its,42725|title=Sudan is willing to withdraw its troops from Abyei, President Carter  - Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan|website=www.sudantribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They aimed to highlight the growing humanitarian crisis and encourage further peace talks between the governments of Sudan and South Sudan. In May 2012, Lakhdar Brahimi and Jimmy Carter met Sudanese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] in Khartoum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4ffb07349.html|title=The Elders visit Sudanese refugees on peace errand|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Martti Ahtisaari, Mary Robinson and Desmond Tutu travelled to South Sudan to meet President [[Salva Kiir]] and civil society representatives, and to visit Yusuf Batil refugee camp near the border with Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-congratulate-south-sudan-first-anniversary-independence|title=The Elders congratulate South Sudan on first anniversary of independence|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also travelled to Ethiopia, where they met [[Hailemariam Desalegn]] and members of the [[African Union]] High-Level Implementation Panel on Sudan (AUHIP), including [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Pierre Buyoya]]. At the conclusion of their visit, Ahtisaari, Tutu and Robinson urged presidents Bashir and Kiir to meet as soon as possible and recommit to peace. Desmond Tutu stated: "''Peace, peace, peace is what the people of Sudan and South Sudan need most. Recent months have seen increased hardship and suffering in both countries. It is a fragile time and I hope that the leaders will do what their people need, which is to recommit to working together to build two viable states.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/15/zimbabwe-united-nations-kofi-annan|title=Annan to lead team on humanitarian mission to Harare|first=Xan|last=Rice|date=15 November 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sri Lanka====
The Elders have closely followed developments in [[Sri Lanka]] and spoken out on several occasions since the end of the decades-long conflict in 2009. Particularly, The Elders have persistently emphasised the importance of achieving reconciliation and accountability for violations committed during the conflict.

In November 2009, the Elders wrote to Sri Lankan [[President Rajapaksa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-call-sri-lankan-government-protect-rights-civilians-displaced-conflict|title=The Elders call on Sri Lankan government to protect rights of civilians displaced by conflict|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as major donors, calling on the government to protect the rights of displaced civilians following years of war. Desmond Tutu said the government had "an obligation to serve all Sri Lanka's citizens – including the Tamil and other minority communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-10851163|title=Elders group criticises Sri Lanka|first=Saroj|last=Pathirana|date=3 August 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, The Elders expressed disappointment at the Sri Lankan government's clampdown on domestic critics and "disdain for human rights". The Elders added that meaningful progress on reconciliation on the island was still "desperately needed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/26/our-duty-sri-lanka-human-rights|title=Our duty to Sri Lanka, and human rights - Desmond Tutu and Mary Robinson|first1=Desmond|last1=Tutu|first2=Mary|last2=Robinson|date=26 February 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Mary Robinson and Desmond Tutu wrote an op-ed in [[The Guardian]], urging the member states of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] "to support a resolution that seeks accountability for the terrible violations of international law that have taken place, and establishes mechanisms to monitor progress on the steps the government is taking on accountability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/world/asia/rights-body-passes-measure-on-sri-lanka.html|title=U.N. Rights Council Passes Sri Lanka Resolution|first=Nick|last=Cumming-Bruce|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S.-backed resolution on 'Promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka' was adopted by the Council on 22 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/sri-lanka-needs-know-world-watching|title=Sri Lanka needs to know the world is watching|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and Tutu wrote a further op-ed published in [[The Times]], [[The Times of India]] and the [[Tribune de Genève]] in March 2013, calling on the Council and the Commonwealth to exert pressure on Sri Lanka's government to implement the recommendations of the [[Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission]] (LLRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/bringing-hope-forging-peace-elders-mission-sudan|title=Bringing hope, forging peace - The Elders' mission to Sudan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Activities===
The organisation has also issued statements on a range of topics including those relating to [[Tibet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/pakistan-floods-elders-urge-world-respond-more-quickly-and-generously|title=PAKISTAN FLOODS: The Elders urge the world to respond more quickly and generously|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/elders-condemn-deadly-attacks-norway|title=The Elders condemn deadly attacks in Norway|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/ela-bhatt-urges-partnership-poor-opening-un-meeting-mdgs|title=Ela Bhatt urges ‘partnership with the poor’ at opening of UN meeting on MDGs|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Criminal Court]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-urge-all-states-commit-universal-impartial-international-criminal-court|title=The Elders urge all states to commit to universal, impartial International Criminal Court|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/world-influencers-elders-meet-moscow/6306|title=World Influencers "The Elders" Meet in Moscow|date=1 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
Widespread violence erupted in [[Kenya]] in December 2007, following disputes over the results of national elections. In January 2008, the African Union established a Panel of Eminent African Personalities to mediate a solution to the crisis, headed by Kofi Annan and including Graça Machel and former Tanzanian Prime Minister [[Benjamin Mkapa]]. Earlier, the Kenyan churches had launched an unsuccessful mediation attempt headed by South African Archbishop and Elders chair, Desmond Tutu. While three Elders were involved in efforts to resolve Kenya's crisis, this was not an initiative of The Elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/elders-peaceful-solutions-must-be-sought-kenya|title=The Elders: Peaceful solutions must be sought in Kenya|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elders issued a brief statement in January 2008 calling for an end to the violence.

====Middle East and North Africa====
Following [[Arab Spring|major demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa]] in 2011, The Elders stated that they stood in solidarity with "all those crying out for freedom and basic rights". In an interview with CNN, Desmond Tutu called on the international community to bring pressure to bear on [[Muammar Gaddafi]] to relinquish power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/elders-begin-two-day-visit-egypt|title=The Elders begin two-day visit to Egypt|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, a few weeks after elections to Tunisia's Constituent Assembly, Martti Ahtisaari, Mary Robinson and Lakhdar Brahimi travelled to Tunis to attend the annual gathering of the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]]. In an interview with the BBC following her meeting with Tunisian bloggers, Mary Robinson described the "sense of buoyant democracy" in the country.

Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson travelled to [[Cairo]] in October 2012. During their meetings with President [[Mohamed Morsi]], senior officials and diplomats, representatives of civil society organisations and young people, the Elders emphasised the importance of "an inclusive, democratic transition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theelders.org/article/egypt-transition-elders-visit-cairo|title=Egypt in transition: Elders visit Cairo|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cartercenter.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cartercenter.org/news/trip_reports/egypt-011712.html|title=Trip Report by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to Egypt, Jan. 8-14, 2012|website=www.cartercenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brundtland and Carter both visited [[Egypt]] earlier in 2012, where they met civil society organisations and spoke to students at the [[American University in Cairo]].&lt;ref name="cartercenter.org"/&gt; Carter also travelled to Egypt with [[The Carter Center]] to witness the country's [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|presidential]] and parliamentary elections in January&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cartercenter.org/news/trip_reports/egypt-0529.html|title=Trip Report by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to Egypt, May 21-28, 2012|website=www.cartercenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and May 2012.

Outside of their role as Elders, Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi have individually been involved in the international efforts to try to resolve the conflict in [[Syria]]. In February 2012, Annan was appointed Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and [[League of Arab States]] on the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42702#.WQDDGFPyvJO|title=UN, Arab League appoint veteran diplomat to take over Annan’s role on Syrian crisis|date=17 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded in the role by Brahimi, who was appointed Joint Special Representative in August 2012, a position he held until May 2014.

====Russia====
The Elders held a three-day visit to [[Moscow]] in April 2015. Kofi Annan, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Martti Ahtisaari, Lakhdar Brahimi, Jimmy Carter and Ernesto Zedillo held talks on geopolitical issues with Russian officials, including [[President Putin]], Foreign Minister [[Lavrov]] and former Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-conclude-three-day-visit-moscow|title=The Elders conclude three-day visit to Moscow|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaigns===

====#WalkTogether====
Together with civil society partners, The Elders marked their 10th anniversary by launching [https://www.walk-together.org/ #WalkTogether], a year-long global campaign to inspire hope and bridge the deepening global fault lines of division, hate and xenophobia. 
The campaign is intended to celebrate those communities whose work is a great demonstration of empathy, where their actions benefit 'the many', create a sense of unity, and address global and local challenges in a compassionate way. In other words, #WalkTogether aims to lift the voices of courageous moral leadership in communities around the world, who are working for the freedoms aligned to those to which Nelson Mandela dedicated his life. These [https://www.walk-together.org/freedoms/ Freedoms] include the broad themes of Peace, Health, Justice and Equality. 
The campaign ran for twelve months from 18 July 2017 – the tenth anniversary of the group's founding – to 18 July 2018, the centenary of Nelson Mandela's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/walk-together|title=Walk Together|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Every Human Has Rights====
The Every Human Has Rights (EHHR) campaign was launched on the 60th anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), 10 December 2007, in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. The Elders launched the initiative in partnership with a diverse group of global NGOs, civil society organisations and businesses to highlight UDHR principles, including the right to health, women's rights, and freedom of expression. Launch partners included ActionAid, [[Amnesty International]], the Center for Women's Global Leadership, [[International PEN]], [https://witness.org/ WITNESS], [http://www.who.int/workforcealliance/members_partners/member_list/realizingrights/en/ Realizing Rights], [[Save the Children]] and [[UNICEF]]. The EHHR campaign also included partners from civil society organisations in the developing world through networks like [[CIVICUS]]. The campaign aimed to "empower global citizens to protect and realize the first-ever comprehensive agreement on [[human rights]] among nations". Throughout the campaign, over one billion people signed the Universal Declaration, taking responsibility and pledging to speak to protect the freedom and the rights of others in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/elders-launch-every-human-has-rights-campaign|title=The Elders launch the Every Human Has Rights campaign|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, in December 2008, The Elders joined award-winning human rights journalists, leaders in civil society, and business and government leaders to celebrate the Every Human Has Rights campaign and participate in the EHHR Media Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theelders.org/article/every-human-has-rights-media-awards|title=Every Human Has Rights Media Awards|website=The Elders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''There is no such thing as a free lunch'''" (alternatively, "'''There ain't no such thing as a free lunch'''" or other variants) is a popular adage communicating the idea that it is impossible to get something for nothing.  The [[acronym]]s '''TANSTAAFL''', '''TINSTAAFL''', and '''TNSTAAFL''' are also used.  The phrase was in use by the 1930s, but its first appearance is unknown.&lt;ref name="safire" /&gt;  The "free lunch" in the saying refers to the nineteenth-century practice in American bars of offering a "[[free lunch]]" in order to entice drinking customers.

The phrase and the acronym are central to [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein's]] 1966 [[science fiction|science-fiction]] novel ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', which helped popularize it.&lt;ref name="verifier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keyes|first=Ralph|title=The Quote Verifier|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|year=2006|page=70|isbn=978-0-312-34004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2006 131"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Chrysti M.|title=Verbivore's Feast: Second Course|publisher=Farcountry Press|location=Helena, MT|year=2006|page=131|isbn=978-1-56037-404-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Free market|free-market]] economist [[Milton Friedman]] also popularized the phrase&lt;ref name="safire"&gt;Safire, William ''On Language; Words Left Out in the Cold"  New York Times, 2-14-1993 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DF1138F937A25751C0A965958260]&lt;/ref&gt; by using it as the title of a 1975 book,&lt;ref name="Friedman, Milton 1975"&gt;Friedman, Milton, ''There's No Such Thing as a Free Lunch'', Open Court Publishing Company, 1975. {{ISBN|087548297X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is used in [[economics]] literature to describe [[opportunity cost]].&lt;ref name="Gwartney 2005 8–9"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gwartney|first=James D.|author2=Richard Stroup |author3=Dwight R.

==History and usage==

==="Free lunch"===
The "free lunch" refers to the once-common tradition of [[Western saloon|saloon]]s in the [[United States]] providing a [[Free lunch|"free" lunch]] to patrons who had purchased at least one drink. Many foods on offer were high in salt (e.g., ham, cheese, and salted crackers), so those who ate them ended up buying a lot of beer. [[Rudyard Kipling]], writing in 1891, noted how he

&lt;blockquote&gt;...came upon a bar-room full of bad Salon pictures, in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter. It was the institution of the "free lunch" I had struck. You paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat. For something less than a rupee a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in San Francisco, even though he be a bankrupt. Remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rudyard |last=Kipling |author-link=Rudyard Kipling |title=American Notes |publisher=Brown and Company |location=Boston |year=1899 |page=18 |oclc=1063540 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glQTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Gutenberg|no=977|name=American Notes by Rudyard Kipling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

TANSTAAFL, on the other hand, indicates an acknowledgement that in reality a person or a society cannot get "something for nothing". Even if something appears to be free, there is always a cost to the person or to society as a whole, although that may be a [[hidden cost]] or an [[externality]]. For example, as Heinlein has one of his characters point out, a bar offering a free lunch will likely charge more for its drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heinlein |first=Robert A. |author-link=Robert A. Heinlein |title=[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]] |publisher=Tom Doherty Associates |location=New York |year=1997 |origyear=1966 |pages=8–9 |isbn=0-312-86355-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early uses===
[[File:Tanstaafl - dos utt - 1949.jpg|thumb|right|TANSTAAFL: a plan for a new economic world order. (Pierre Dos Utt, 1949)]]
According to [[Robert Caro]], [[Fiorello La Guardia]], on becoming mayor of [[New York City|New York]] in 1933, said "È finita la cuccagna!", meaning "[[Cockaigne]] is finished" or, more loosely, "No more free lunch"; in this context "free lunch" refers to graft and corruption.&lt;ref name="safire" /&gt; The earliest known occurrence of the full phrase (except for the "a"), in the form "There ain't no such thing as free lunch", appears as the punchline of a joke related in an article in the ''El Paso Herald-Post'' of June 27, 1938 (and other [[Scripps-Howard]] newspapers about the same time), entitled "Economics in Eight Words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Fred |last=Shapiro |authorlink=Fred R. Shapiro |title=Quotes Uncovered: The Punchline, Please |url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/quotes-uncovered-the-punchline-please/ |work=''[[The New York Times]]'' – [[Freakonomics#Publishing history and blog|Freakonomics blog]] |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Economics in Eight Words|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19580313&amp;id=jPoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EU4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7426,4042997|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=March 13, 1958 | quote = "...first published in Scripps-Howard newspapers 20 years ago."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch" appeared in the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', and "there is no free lunch" appeared in a 1942 article in the ''[[Oelwein]] Daily Register'' (in a quote attributed to economist Harley L. Lutz) and in a 1947 column by economist [[Merryle S. Rukeyser]].&lt;ref name="verifier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yale Book of Quotations|editor=Fred R. Shapiro|publisher=Yale Univ. Press|location=New Haven, CT|year=2006|page=478|isbn=978-0-300-10798-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the phrase appeared in an article by Walter Morrow in the ''San Francisco News'' (published on 1 June) and in Pierre Dos Utt's [[monograph]] ''TANSTAAFL: A Plan for a New Economic World Order'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dos Utt|first= Pierre|authorlink= |title= TANSTAAFL: A Plan for a New Economic World Order|year= 1949|publisher= Cairo Publications, Canton, OH |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes an [[oligarchic]] political system based on his conclusions from "no free lunch" principles.

The 1938 and 1949 sources use the phrase in relating a fable about a king ([[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] in Dos Utt's retelling) seeking advice from his economic advisors. Morrow's retelling, which claims to derive from an earlier editorial reported to be non-existent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/no_more_free_lunch_fiorello_la_guardia/ |title=The Big Apple: “No more free lunch!” (Fiorello La Guardia) |publisher=Barrypopik.com |date=2007-03-08 |accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but closely follows the story as related in the earlier article in the ''El Paso Herald-Post'', differs from Dos Utt's in that the ruler asks for ever-simplified advice following their original "eighty-seven volumes of six hundred pages" as opposed to a simple failure to agree on "any major remedy". The last surviving economist advises that "There ain't no such thing as free lunch."

In 1950, a ''New York Times'' columnist ascribed the phrase to economist (and army general) [[Leonard Porter Ayres|Leonard P. Ayres]] of the Cleveland Trust Company: "It seems that shortly before the General's death [in 1946]... a group of reporters approached the general with the request that perhaps he might give them one of several immutable economic truisms that he had gathered from his long years of economic study... 'It is an immutable economic fact,' said the general, 'that there is no such thing as a free lunch.'"&lt;ref&gt;Fetridge, Robert H, "Along the Highways and Byways of Finance," ''The New York Times'', Nov 12, 1950, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 8, 1961, issue of ''LIFE magazine'' has an editorial on page 4, "'TANSTAFL,' It's the Truth," that closes with an anecdotal farmer explaining this slight variant of TANSTAAFL.

===Popularization===
In 1966, author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] published his novel ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', in which TANSTAAFL was a central, [[libertarian]] theme, mentioned by name and explained. This increased its use in the mainstream.&lt;ref name="verifier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2006 131"/&gt;

Edwin G. Dolan used the phrase as the title of his 1971 book ''TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch) – A Libertarian Perspective on Environmental Policy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dolan|first= Edwin G.|authorlink= |title= TANSTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch) – A Libertarian Perspective on Environmental Policy|year= 1971}} updated and reissued in 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meanings===
;Science
In the sciences, TANSTAAFL means that the universe as a whole is ultimately a [[closed system]]. There is no source of matter, energy, or light that draws resources from something else which will not eventually be exhausted. Therefore, the TANSTAAFL argument may also be applied to natural physical processes in a closed system (either the universe as a whole, or any system that does not receive energy or matter from outside). (See [[Second law of thermodynamics]].) The bio-ecologist [[Barry Commoner]] used this concept as the last of his famous "[[Barry Commoner#Four laws of ecology|Four Laws of Ecology]]".

According to American theoretical physicist and cosmologist [[Alan Guth]] "the universe is the ultimate free lunch", given that in the early stage of its expansion the total amount of energy available to make particles was very large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hawking| first = Stephen| title = A brief history of time| publisher = Bantam books| year = 1988| page = 144| isbn = 0553175211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Economics
In economics, TANSTAAFL demonstrates [[opportunity cost]]. [[N. Gregory Mankiw|Greg Mankiw]] described the concept as follows: "To get one thing that we like, we usually have to give up another thing that we like. Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another."&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Economics'' (4th edition), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that there is no free lunch at the societal level applies only when all resources are being used completely and appropriately – i.e., when [[economic efficiency]] prevails. If not, a 'free lunch' can be had through a more efficient utilization of resources. Or, as [[Fred Brooks]] put it, "You can only get something for nothing if you have previously gotten nothing for something."  If one individual or group gets something at no cost, somebody else ends up paying for it. If there appears to be no direct cost to any single individual, there is a [[social cost]].  Similarly, someone can benefit for "free" from an [[externality]] or from a [[public good]], but someone has to pay the cost of producing these benefits. (See [[Free rider problem]] and [[Tragedy of the commons]]).

;Finance
In [[mathematical finance]], the term is also used as an informal synonym for the principle of no-[[arbitrage]]. This principle states that a combination of securities that has the same cash-flows as another security must have the same net price in equilibrium.

;Statistics
In [[statistics]], the term has been used to describe the tradeoffs of statistical learners (e.g., in [[machine learning]]). That is, any model that claims to offer superior flexibility in analyzing data patterns usually does so at the cost of introducing extra assumptions, or by sacrificing generalizability in important situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last1 = Simon | first1 = N. | last2 = Tibshirani | first2 = R. |eprint=1401.7645 |title=Comment on "Detecting Novel Associations In Large Data Sets" by Reshef Et Al, Science Dec 16, 2011 ||date=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Technology
TANSTAAFL is sometimes used as a response to claims of the virtues of [[free software]]. Supporters of free software often counter that the use of the term "free" in this context is primarily a reference to a lack of constraint ("libre") rather than a lack of cost ("[[Gratis versus libre|gratis]]"). [[Richard Stallman]] has described it as  "[[Gratis versus libre|'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer']]".

The prefix "TANSTAA-" (or "TINSTAA-") is used in numerous other contexts as well to denote some immutable property of the system being discussed. For example, "TANSTAANFS" is used by [[electrical engineering]] professors to stand for "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Noise-Free System".{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

;Sports
[[Baseball Prospectus]] coined the abbreviation "TINSTAAPP", for "There Is No Such Thing As A Pitching Prospect",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130411&amp;content_id=44526640&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb | title=Even top pitching prospects are no sure thing | work=MLB.com | date=12 April 2013 | accessdate=6 May 2013 | author=Leach, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many young pitchers hurt their arms before they can be effective at a [[Major League Baseball|major league]] level.

;Social policy
Hungarian prime minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] used this adage to justify his social reforms in the mid-2000s. As a post-socialist country, Hungary struggled with the illusion of the state as a caring and giving, independent entity, rather than being the embodiment of the community. The saying "there is no free lunch" represented that even if the state provides welfare or something else for the people in need, it is in fact bought or provided by other people of the same community through taxes. Therefore, the state cannot provide everything for everyone, and increased provisions given by the state can only be financed by economic growth or increased taxes.

;Exceptions
Some exceptions from the "no free lunch" tenet have been put forward, such as the [[Sun]] and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Friend"&gt;{{cite book | last = Friend| first = Tim| title = The Third Domain: The Untold Story of Archaea and the Future of Biotechnology| publisher = National Academies Press| year = 2007| page = 21| isbn = 0309102375}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued in particular that [[metabolism]] evolved to take advantage of the free lunch provided by the Sun, which also triggers production of vital oxygen in plants.&lt;ref name="Friend"/&gt;  However, these too fall short in that the viewpoint is an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]], the earth, with "free" inputs from the Sun.  When viewed from the larger system context, the Sun/Earth or Solar System, there is a net energy exchange, and still "no free lunch." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Is the earth a 'closed system' with the Sun providing the sole input?| url=https://www.quora.com/Is-the-earth-a-closed-system-with-the-Sun-providing-the-sole-input| date=11 December 2013 | accessdate=26 November 2016| author = Wilson, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
