[[File:Galaxies-AGN-Inner-Structure.svg|lang=en|thumb|upright=0.97|Inner structure of a galaxy with an active galactic nucleus]]
An '''active galactic nucleus''' ('''AGN''') is a compact region at the center of a [[galaxy]] that has a much higher than normal [[luminosity]] over at least some portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by [[star]]s. Such excess non-stellar emission has been observed in the [[radio waves|radio]], [[microwave]], [[infrared]], [[visible spectrum|optical]], [[ultra-violet]], [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] wavebands. A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an "active galaxy". The radiation from an AGN is believed to result from the [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of matter by a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of its host galaxy.

Active galactic nuclei are the most luminous persistent sources of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the universe, and as such can be used as a means of discovering distant objects; their evolution as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on [[cosmology|models of the cosmos]].

The observed characteristics of an AGN depend on several properties such as the mass of the central black hole, the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole, the orientation of the [[accretion disk]], the degree of [[Extinction (astronomy)|obscuration]] of the nucleus by [[Cosmic dust|dust]], and presence or absence of [[Astrophysical jet|jets]].

Numerous subclasses of AGN have been defined based on their observed characteristics; the most powerful AGN are classified as [[quasar]]s. A [[blazar]] is an AGN with a jet pointed toward the Earth, in which radiation from the jet is enhanced by [[relativistic beaming]].

==History==
Early photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of AGN emission, although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the AGN phenomenon. Some early observations included the first spectroscopic detection of [[Spectral line|emission lines]] from the nuclei of [[Messier 77|NGC 1068]] and [[Messier 81]] by Edward Fath (published in 1909),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fath|first1=E. A.|title=The spectra of some spiral nebulae and globular star clusters|journal=Lick Observatory Bulletin|date=1909|volume=5|page=71|doi=10.5479/ADS/bib/1909LicOB.5.71F|bibcode=1909LicOB...5...71F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the discovery of the [[Astrophysical jet|jet]] in [[Messier 87]] by [[Heber Curtis]] (published in 1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=H. D.|title=Descriptions of 762 Nebulae and Clusters Photographed with the Crossley Reflector|journal=Publications of Lick Observatory|date=1918|volume=13|page=9|bibcode=1918PLicO..13....9C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including [[Vesto Slipher]], [[Milton Humason]], and [[Nicholas Mayall]] noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slipher|first1=V.|title=The spectrum and velocity of the nebula N.G.C. 1068 (M 77)|journal=Lowell Observatory Bulletin|date=1917|volume=3|page=59|bibcode=1917LowOB...3...59S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humason|first1=M.

Active galaxies such as these are known as [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]] in honor of Seyfert's pioneering work.

The development of [[radio astronomy]] was a major catalyst to understanding AGN. Some of the earliest detected radio sources are nearby active [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]  such as [[Messier 87]] and [[Centaurus A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolton|first1=J. G.|last2=Stanley|first2=G. J.|last3=Slee|first3=O. B.|title=Positions of Three Discrete Sources of Galactic Radio-Frequency Radiation|journal=Nature|date=1949|volume=164|issue=4159|page=101|doi=10.1038/164101b0|accessdate=|bibcode=1949Natur.164..101B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another radio source, [[Cygnus A]], was identified by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Rudolph Minkowski]] as a tidally distorted galaxy with an unusual [[Spectral line|emission-line]] spectrum, having a [[recessional velocity]] of 16,700 kilometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baade|first1=W.|last2=Minkowski|first2=R.|title=Identification of the Radio Sources in Cassiopeia, Cygnus A, and Puppis A.|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1954|volume=119|page=206|doi=10.1086/145812|bibcode=1954ApJ...119..206B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources|3C radio survey]] led to further progress in discovery of new radio sources as well as identifying the [[Visible light|visible-light]] sources associated with the radio emission. In photographic images, some of these objects were nearly point-like or quasi-stellar in appearance, and were classified as [[Quasar|quasi-stellar radio sources]] (later abbreviated as "quasars").

A major breakthrough was the measurement of the [[redshift]] of the quasar [[3C 273]] by [[Maarten Schmidt]], published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=M.|title=3C 273 : A Star-Like Object with Large Red-Shift|journal=Nature|date=1963|volume=197|issue=4872|page=1040|doi=10.1038/1971040a0|accessdate=|bibcode=1963Natur.197.1040S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schmidt noted that if this object was [[Extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] (outside the [[Milky Way]], at a cosmological distance) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified. Shortly afterward, optical spectra were used to measured the redshifts of a growing number of quasars including [[3C 48]], even more distant at redshift 0.37.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenstein|first1=J. L.|last2=Matthews|first2=T. A.|title=Red-Shift of the Unusual Radio Source: 3C 48|journal=Nature|date=1963|volume=197|issue=4872|page=1041|doi=10.1038/1971041a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v197/n4872/abs/1971041a0.html|accessdate=22 March 2017|bibcode = 1963Natur.197.1041G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous luminosities of these quasars as well as their unusual spectral properties indicated that their power source could not be ordinary stars. Accretion of gas onto a [[supermassive black hole]] was suggested as the source of quasars' power in papers by [[Edwin Salpeter]] and [[Yakov Zel'Dovich]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=G.

Today, AGN are a major topic of astrophysical research, both [[Observational astronomy|observational]] and [[Theoretical astrophysics|theoretical]].  AGN research encompasses observational surveys to find AGN over broad ranges of luminosity and redshift, examination of the cosmic evolution and growth of black holes, studies of the physics of black hole accretion and the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]] from AGN, examination of the properties of jets and outflows of matter from AGN, and the impact of black hole accretion and quasar activity on [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy evolution]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; AGN are both compact and persistently extremely luminous. Accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation, and a massive black hole has a high [[Eddington luminosity]], and as a result, it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity. Supermassive black holes are now believed to exist in the centres of most if not all massive galaxies since the mass of the black hole correlates well with the [[velocity dispersion]] of the galactic bulge (the [[M-sigma relation]]) or with bulge luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Accretion disc===
In the standard model of AGN, cold material close to a black hole forms an [[accretion disc]]. Dissipative processes in the accretion disc transport matter inwards and angular momentum outwards, while causing the accretion disc to heat up. The expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband; in addition, a [[corona]] of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can [[Compton scattering|inverse-Compton scatter]] [[photon]]s up to X-ray energies. The radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular [[emission line]]s. A large fraction of the AGN's radiation may be obscured by [[interstellar gas]] and [[interstellar dust|dust]] close to the accretion disc, but (in a steady-state situation) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband, most likely the infrared.

===Relativistic jets===
{{Main|Relativistic jet}}

[[File:M87 jet.jpg|right|thumb| 200px| Image taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] of a 5000-[[light-year]]-long jet ejected from the active [[Messier 87|galaxy M87]]. The blue [[synchrotron radiation]] contrasts with the yellow starlight from the host galaxy.]]

Some accretion discs produce jets of twin, highly [[collimated]], and fast outflows that emerge in opposite directions from close to the disc. The direction of the jet ejection is determined either by the angular momentum axis of the accretion disc or the spin axis of the black hole. The jet production mechanism and indeed the jet composition on very small scales are not understood at present due to the resolution of astronomical instruments being too low. The jets have their most obvious observational effects in the radio waveband, where [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] can be used to study the synchrotron radiation they emit at resolutions of sub-[[parsec]] scales. However, they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the [[synchrotron]] and the [[Compton scattering|inverse-Compton scattering]] process, and so AGN jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation.

===Radiatively inefficient AGN===
There exists a class of 'radiatively inefficient' solutions to the equations that govern accretion. The most widely known of these is the [[Advection Dominated Accretion Flow]] (ADAF),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In this type of accretion, which is important for accretion rates well below the [[Eddington limit]], the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole. Radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong AGN-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters, where otherwise we might expect high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Particle acceleration==
AGN are a candidate source of high and ultra-high energy [[cosmic rays]] ''(see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]])''.

==Observational characteristics==
There is no single observational signature of an AGN. The list below covers some of the features that have allowed systems to be identified as AGN.

* Nuclear optical continuum emission. This is visible whenever there is a direct view of the accretion disc. Jets can also contribute to this component of the AGN emission. The optical emission has a roughly power-law dependence on wavelength.
* Nuclear infra-red emission. This is visible whenever the accretion disc and its environment are obscured by gas and dust close to the nucleus and then re-emitted ('reprocessing'). As it is thermal emission, it can be distinguished from any jet or disc-related emission.
* Broad optical emission lines. These come from cold material close to the central black hole. The lines are broad because the emitting material is revolving around the black hole with high speeds causing a range of Doppler shifts of the emitted photons.
* Narrow optical emission lines. These come from more distant cold material, and so are narrower than the broad lines.
* Radio continuum emission. This is always due to a jet. It shows a spectrum characteristic of synchrotron radiation.
* X-ray continuum emission. This can arise both from a jet and from the hot corona of the accretion disc via a scattering process: in both cases it shows a power-law spectrum. In some radio-quiet AGN there is an excess of soft X-ray emission in addition to the power-law component. The origin of the soft X-rays is not clear at present.
* X-ray line emission. This is a result of illumination of cold heavy elements by the X-ray continuum that causes [[fluorescence]] of X-ray emission lines, the best-known of which is the iron feature around 6.4 [[keV]]. This line may be narrow or broad: [[Broad iron K line|relativistically broadened iron lines]] can be used to study the dynamics of the accretion disc very close to the nucleus and therefore the nature of the central black hole.

==Types of active galaxy==
It is convenient to divide AGN into two classes, conventionally called radio-quiet and radio-loud. Radio-loud objects have emission contributions from both the jet(s) and the lobes that the jets inflate. These emission contributions dominate the luminosity of the AGN at radio wavelengths and possibly at some or all other wavelengths. Radio-quiet objects are simpler since jet and any jet-related emission can be neglected at all wavelengths.

AGN terminology is often confusing, since the distinctions between different types of AGN sometimes reflect historical differences in how the objects were discovered or initially classified, rather than real physical differences.

===Radio-quiet AGN===             
* [[Low-ionization nuclear emission-line region]]s (LINERs). As the name suggests, these systems show only weak nuclear emission-line regions, and no other signatures of AGN emission. It is debatable{{By whom|date=May 2015}} whether all such systems are true AGN (powered by accretion on to a supermassive black hole). If they are, they constitute the lowest-luminosity class of radio-quiet AGN. Some may be radio-quiet analogues of the low-excitation radio galaxies (see below).
* [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]]. Seyferts were the earliest distinct class of AGN to be identified. They show optical range nuclear continuum emission, narrow and occasionally broad emission lines, occasionally strong nuclear X-ray emission and sometimes a weak small-scale radio jet. Originally they were divided into two types known as Seyfert 1 and 2: Seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while Seyfert 2s do not, and Seyfert 1s are more likely to show strong low-energy X-ray emission. Various forms of elaboration on this scheme exist: for example, Seyfert 1s with relatively narrow broad lines are sometimes referred to as narrow-line Seyfert 1s. The host galaxies of Seyferts are usually spiral or irregular galaxies.
* Radio-quiet [[quasar]]s/QSOs. These are essentially more luminous versions of Seyfert 1s: the distinction is arbitrary and is usually expressed in terms of a limiting optical magnitude. Quasars were originally 'quasi-stellar' in optical images as they had optical luminosities that were greater than that of their host galaxy. They always show strong optical continuum emission, X-ray continuum emission, and broad and narrow optical emission lines. Some astronomers use the term QSO (Quasi-Stellar Object) for this class of AGN, reserving 'quasar' for radio-loud objects, while others talk about radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. The host galaxies of quasars can be spirals, irregulars or ellipticals. There is a correlation between the quasar's luminosity and the mass of its host galaxy, in that the most luminous quasars inhabit the most massive galaxies (ellipticals).
* 'Quasar 2s'. By analogy with Seyfert 2s, these are objects with quasar-like luminosities but without strong optical nuclear continuum emission or broad line emission. They are scarce in surveys, though a number of possible candidate quasar 2s have been identified.

===Radio-loud AGN===
See main article [[Radio galaxy]] for a discussion of the large-scale behaviour of the jets. Here, only the active nuclei are discussed.

* Radio-loud quasars behave exactly like radio-quiet quasars with the addition of emission from a jet. Thus they show strong optical continuum emission, broad and narrow emission lines, and strong X-ray emission, together with nuclear and often extended radio emission.
* â[[Blazar]]sâ ([[BL Lac object]]s and [[OVV quasar]]s) classes are distinguished by rapidly variable, polarized optical, radio and X-ray emission. BL Lac objects show no optical emission lines, broad or narrow, so that their redshifts can only be determined from features in the spectra of their host galaxies. The emission-line features may be intrinsically absent or simply swamped by the additional variable component. In the latter case, emission lines may become visible when the variable component is at a low level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; OVV quasars behave more like standard radio-loud quasars with the addition of a rapidly variable component. In both classes of source, the variable emission is believed to originate in a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight. Relativistic effects amplify both the luminosity of the jet and the amplitude of variability.
* Radio galaxies. These objects show nuclear and extended radio emission. Their other AGN properties are heterogeneous. They can broadly be divided into low-excitation and high-excitation classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Unification of AGN species==

Unified models propose that different observational classes of AGN are a single type of physical object observed under different conditions. The currently favoured unified models are 'orientation-based unified models' meaning that they propose that the apparent differences between different types of objects arise simply because of their different orientations to the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Radio-quiet unification===
At low luminosities, the objects to be unified are Seyfert galaxies. The unification models propose that in Seyfert 1s the observer has a direct view of the active nucleus. In Seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum, broad-line region or (soft) X-ray emission. The key insight of orientation-dependent accretion models is that the two types of object can be the same if only certain angles to the line of sight are observed. The standard picture is of a [[torus]] of obscuring material surrounding the accretion disc. It must be large enough to obscure the broad-line region but not large enough to obscure the narrow-line region, which is seen in both classes of object. Seyfert 2s are seen through the torus. Outside the torus there is material that can scatter some of the nuclear emission into our line of sight, allowing us to see some optical and X-ray continuum and, in some cases, broad emission linesâwhich are strongly polarized, showing that they have been scattered and proving that some Seyfert 2s really do contain hidden Seyfert 1s. Infrared observations of the nuclei of Seyfert 2s also support this picture.

At higher luminosities, quasars take the place of Seyfert 1s, but, as already mentioned, the corresponding 'quasar 2s' are elusive at present. If they do not have the scattering component of Seyfert 2s they would be hard to detect except through their luminous narrow-line and hard X-ray emission.

===Radio-loud unification===
Historically, work on radio-loud unification has concentrated on high-luminosity radio-loud quasars. These can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies in a manner directly analogous to the Seyfert 1/2 unification (but without the complication of much in the way of a reflection component: narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected X-ray component, although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission). The large-scale radio structures of these objects provide compelling evidence that the orientation-based unified models really are true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Criticism of the radio-quiet unification===
In the recent literature on AGN, being subject to an intense debate, an increasing set of observations appear to be in conflict with some of the key predictions of the Unified Model, e.g. that each Seyfert 2 has an obscured Seyfert 1 nucleus (a hidden broad-line region).

Therefore, one cannot know whether the gas in all Seyfert 2 galaxies is ionized due to photoionization from a single, non-stellar continuum source in the center or due to shock-ionization from e.g. intense, nuclear starbursts. Spectropolarimetric studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While studies of single AGN show important deviations from the expectations of the unified model, results from statistical tests have been contradictory.

While it still might be valid that an obscured Seyfert 1 can appear as a Seyfert 2, not all Seyfert 2s must host an obscured Seyfert 1. Understanding whether it is the same engine driving all Seyfert 2s, the connection to radio-loud AGN, the mechanisms of the variability of some AGN that vary between the two types at very short time scales, and the connection of the AGN type to small- and large-scale environment remain important issues to incorporate into any unified model of active galactic nuclei.

==Cosmological uses and evolution==
For a long time, active galaxies held all the records for the highest-[[redshift]] objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum, because of their high luminosity. They still have a role to play in studies of the early universe, but it is now recognised that an AGN gives a highly biased picture of the "typical" high-redshift galaxy.

Most luminous classes of AGN (radio-loud and radio-quiet) seem to have been much more numerous in the early universe. This suggests  that massive black holes formed early on and that the conditions for the formation of luminous AGN were more common in the early universe, such as a much higher availability of cold gas near the centre of galaxies than at present. It also implies that many objects that were once luminous quasars are now much less luminous, or entirely quiescent. The evolution of the low-luminosity AGN population is much less well understood due to the difficulty of observing these objects at high redshifts.

According to AfriForum CEO, [[:af:Kallie Kriel|Kallie Kriel]], AfriForum is a  [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] initiative to mobilise civil society and specifically minority communities, in order to take part in democratic debate. Kriel further stated that AfriForum would like to achieve balance in South Africa. âTrue democracy needs alternative voices in order to succeed.

The movement's [[youth wing]] is called ''AfriForum Youth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriforumyouth.co.za/who-are-we/beleid/|title=Home - AfriForum Jeug|work=AfriForum Jeug}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mgHETNslams"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2013-09-30-hten-slams-afriforums-student-race-request|title=HETN slams AfriForum's student race request|first=Bongani|last=Nkosi|publisher=Mail and Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
AfriForum was founded in 2006. AfriForum's Civil Rights Charter was officially adopted by the organization on 7 September 2006 during a discussion forum held in Pretoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriforum.co.za/about/project-100-000|title=AfriForum|work=AfriForum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}} Its leader, Kallie Kriel, was previously a member of the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]], and a leader of the [[Freedom Front Plus]] (FF+) youth wing, and a large number of its executive leadership were formerly associated with Freedom Front Plus.&lt;ref name="thlaff"/&gt;

The organisation recruited its 100 000th member in July 2014Â  and its 200 000th member in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afriforum.co.za/afriforum-enters-new-phase-200-000-active-members/|title=AfriForum enters new phase with 200 000 active members - AfriForum|date=2017-11-01|work=AfriForum|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

==Campaigns and policies==
[[File:AfriForum - Standerton-betoging.jpg|thumb|left|AfriForum protest outside the [[Pretoria High Court]]]]
The organisation's principal focus is inter alia on the following areas: civil, safety and security, community affairs, local government, environmental affairs, education as well as preserving the language, culture and heritage in South Africa.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In 2009, the group contested the presence of [[Robert Mugabe]] at the inauguration of [[Jacob Zuma]]'s presidency.&lt;ref name=gsd&gt;{{cite web|title=Great song and dance as Zuma is sworn in as president of South Africa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/07/south-africa-zuma-president-inauguration|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also involved in a bid to prevent the delivery of [[Alouette III]] Air Force helicopters to the [[Zimbabwe Army|Zimbabwean army]].&lt;ref name=zimheli&gt;{{cite web|title=AfriForum wins bid to halt Zim helicopter delivery|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-01-26-afriforum-wins-bid-to-halt-zim-helicopter-delivery|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum has opposed [[fracking]] in the [[Karoo]]&lt;ref name="tkag"&gt;{{cite web|title=TKAG, Afriforum become anti-fracking force |url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/73896-1021-53-TKAG_Afriforum_become_antifracking_force |publisher=The New Age Online |accessdate=14 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116072223/http://www.thenewage.co.za/73896-1021-53-TKAG_Afriforum_become_antifracking_force |archivedate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as poaching&lt;ref name="iol.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/fury-as-poaching-charges-dropped-1.1270893|title=Fury as poaching charges dropped|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also campaigned against [[e-toll (South Africa)|electronic road tolling in Gauteng]].&lt;ref name=etollsnao&gt;{{cite web|title=E-toll notification unlawful: AfriForum |url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=71296&amp;cat_id=1099 |publisher=The New Age Online |accessdate=14 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116072520/http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=71296&amp;cat_id=1099 |archivedate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum has been a vocal critic of the [[ANC]]'s response to the [[South African farm attacks|farm attack]] cases, claiming that the party bears a responsibility for "remain[ing] silent" about the violence,&lt;ref name=blamfm&gt;{{cite web|title=AfriForum blames ANC for farm murders|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/09/12/afriforum-blames-anc-for-farm-murders|publisher=Times LIVE|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lodging a complaint to the [[South African Human Rights Commission]] against the [[Department of Police (South Africa)|Police Minister]] for failing to do enough to protect farmers.&lt;ref name=farmiol&gt;{{cite web|title=Afriforum takes farm murders to SAHRC|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/afriforum-takes-farm-murders-to-sahrc-1.1524798|publisher=IOL.co.za|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum launched the book ''Kill the Boer''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.killtheboerbook.com/reviews/|title=Reviews - Kill the Boer Book|work=Kill the Boer Book|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Ernst Roets]], Deputy CEO of AfriForum, on 28 June 2018.&lt;ref name="Hlatshaneni"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hlatshaneni |first1=Simnikiwe |title=Outrage surrounds book claiming top ANC officials âkilled the boerâ |url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1964479/outrage-surrounds-book-claiming-top-anc-officials-killed-the-boer/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |publisher=The Citizen |date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime and corruption===
The organisation has often criticised government for its lack of willingness to address the problem of farm murders. AfriForum is of the opinion that farm murders should be declared a priority crime, and has raised widespread local awareness and increasing international awareness of the problem by means of several campaigns, including the âStop the Murdersâ campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=310483&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=71654|title=Make farm murders a priority crime (like rhino poaching) - AfriForum - PARTY - Politicsweb|work=politicsweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}  The organisation has also campaigned to address the overall problem of crime and corruption, especially with regard to municipal employees guilty of fraud.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

====Private prosecutions====
{{see|Gerrie Nel}}
The organisation formed a [[private prosecution]]s unit, headed by well-known former state prosecutor [[Gerrie Nel]], amid allegations that the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] (NPA) was selective in prosecutions, and politically biased.&lt;ref name="conversationHowPrivateProsecutionsWillWork"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-south-africas-first-private-prosecutions-unit-will-work-72389|title=Explainer: how South Africa's first private prosecutions unit will work|last=Feldhaus|first=Chantelle|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Nel undertook to assist the victim of an alleged assault by [[Grace Mugabe]], wife of [[Robert Mugabe]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thesouthafrican.com/gerrie-nel-takes-on-grace-mugabe-will-assist-alleged-assault-victim/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nehandaradio.com/2017/08/17/gerrie-nel-sets-sights-grace-mugabe/|title=Gerrie Nel sets sights on Grace Mugabe â Nehanda Radio|date=2017-08-17|work=Nehanda Radio|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thesouthafrican.com/as-gerrie-nel-targets-grace-mugabe-we-remember-the-bulldogs-biggest-cases/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, AfriForum undertook a private prosecution of EFF leader Julius Malema on charges of fraud and corruption, after the NPA failed to continue prosecuting the case.&lt;ref name="iolMalemaAfriForumExplainsCase"/&gt; AfriForum had initially laid the charges against Malema in 2011.&lt;ref name="iolMalemaAfriForumExplainsCase"&gt;

AfriForum committed to undertake a private prosecution of Duduzane Zuma, son of then-President [[Jacob Zuma]], for [[culpable homicide]], after a vehicle driven by Duduzane Zuma was involved in a 2014 motor vehicle crash that killed two black female [[minibus taxi]] commuters, and the National Prosecuting Authority declined to prosecute, despite an inquest finding that the crash was caused by Zuma's negligence.&lt;ref name="ewnBLfConfrontKriel"&gt;http://ewn.co.za/2018/07/12/blf-confront-afriforum-s-kriel-after-duduzane-zuma-court-appearance&lt;/ref&gt; Following AfriForum's move to privately prosecute Zuma, the National Prosecuting Authority decided to pursue a prosecution instead.&lt;ref name="ewnStrongCaseZuma"&gt;http://ewn.co.za/2018/07/12/gerrie-nel-afriforum-has-strong-case-against-duduzane-zuma&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation undertook a prosecution of the chairperson of the [[National Council of Provinces]], [[Thandi Modise]], after allegations of [[animal cruelty]] at her [[North West (South Africa)|North West]] farm, where, in 2014, the [[NSPCA]] found "scores" of animals starving to death from apparent neglect, and the NPA failed to prosecute her.&lt;ref name="encaScoresModise"&gt;http://www.enca.com/scores-dead-animals-found-thandi-modises-farm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news24ToProsecuteModise"&gt;https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/afriforum-to-privately-prosecute-thandi-modise-20180719&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ewnTakeOnCruelty"&gt;http://ewn.co.za/2018/07/19/afriforum-to-take-on-thandi-modise-for-animal-cruelty&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education, language and culture===
Two of the core objectives of AfriForum Youth have been the promotion of multilingualism&lt;ref name=tra&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trapido |first1=Michael |title=No country for Afrikaans then? |url=http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/traps/2008/07/16/petty-apartheid-revisited/|website=thoughtleader.co.za |publisher=Mail&amp;Guardian |date = July 16, 2008 |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mother tongue education in South Africa, and for youth in the country to be exempted from [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriforumyouth.co.za/?page_id=13|title=Home - AfriForum Jeug|work=AfriForum Jeug}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

AfriForum has strongly opposed the proposed renaming of South Africa's capital from [[Pretoria]] to Tshwane, as well as street renaming in Pretoria.&lt;ref&gt;SABC News, AfriForum takes Pretoria street name-changes to court, 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/81-against-Pretoria-name-change-20130414|title=81% against Pretoria name change|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A campaign against racial quotas in higher education saw AfriForum Youth members paint themselves black to protest the alleged discrimination against 30 learners who were turned away from the [[University of Pretoria]].&lt;ref name=dmblp&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis: AfriForum Youth's absurd black paint protest|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-01-30-analysis-afriforum-youths-absurd-black-paint-protest/#.UtVCefYfvMg|publisher=Daily Maverick|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another campaign protesting racial quotas involved charging students of different races different prices for a cup of coffee, with white students paying R5 a cup, coloured and Indians R3, and blacks R1.&lt;ref name=affcoffee&gt;{{cite web|title=Afriforum Youth to offer blacks cheaper coffee|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2013/04/25/afriforum-youth-to-offer-blacks-cheaper-coffee|publisher=Times LIVE|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 AfriForum attempted to suppress a report into a [[Nazism|Nazi]]-style initiation ceremony at the Potchefstroom Campus of [[North-West University]], claiming that the report discriminated against Afrikaners.&lt;ref name="2014CityPressNaziReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Nazi-report-AfriForum-Youth-threatens-varsity-council-with-Equality-Act-20150429|title=Nazi report: AfriForum Youth threatens varsity council with Equality Act|publisher=City Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum continues to drive campaigns to, amongst other things, promote mother tongue education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2018/01/17/afrikaans-schools-have-a-right-to-be-here-afriforum_a_23335475/|title='Afrikaans Schools Have A Right To Be Here' -- AfriForum|date=2018-01-17|work=HuffPost South Africa|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; keep religion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-06-28-mixed-reaction-to-courts-ruling-against-single-religion-schools/|title=Mixed reaction to courtâs ruling against single-religion schools|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in schools, and combat detrimental policies and regulations within the schooling system.

===Land===
{{see|Land reform in South Africa|South African farm attacks}}
The [[South African Institute of Race Relations]] (SAIRR) stated that land is a contentious issue in South Africa, and that the ruling ANC party is blaming whites for still owning 80% of the total land surface. In fact, the Governmentâs own land-ownership documentation shows that by the start of 2011 roughly 50% of all land was in the hands of Government and black communities.{{Original research inline|date=May 2018}}

As of March 2011, 31 million hectares or 25% of the 122 million hectares surface area of South Africa were in the hands of the State.  The remaining 91 million hectares or 75% of the surface area was privately owned.  The bulk of white-owned land is probably in the hands of commercial farmers, South Africa's food producers. Their numbers are dwindling rapidly. There are only an estimated 30 000 to 40 000 of these farmers left, down from 60 000 fifteen years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71639?oid=282525&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=71639.|title=How much of SA's land is really in black hands? - OPINION - Politicsweb|work=politicsweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South African President, [[Jacob Zuma]] called for a review of the land policy, echoing the contents of the Green Paper on Land Reform, but AfriForum claims that the presidentâs statement regarding the review of willing buyer, willing seller principle as stated in Section 25 of the South African Constitution, as a means to speed up the land restitution process was misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/06/27/afriforum-slams-zuma-land-comments|title=AfriForum slams Zuma land comments|author=Sapa|work=Times LIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AfriForum has in the past joined the South African Progressive Civic Organisation (Sapco), a Khoisan community, in a protest over the land rights of the indigenous group, with both minority groups feeling they have no representation in the current government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-02-22-afriforum-joins-khoisan-in-land-rights-fight|title=AfriForum joins Khoisan in land rights fight|work=dailymaverick.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2012, AfriForum's legal team represented the legitimate owners of land in the black community of Wallmansthal, North of Pretoria, in the North Gauteng High Court to take back their land from [[crime|illegal]] [[squatting|squatters]]. The court ruled in favour of AfriForum. The squatters, who occupied the land between December 2011 and February 2012, were removed from the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/mobi/Detail.aspx?NewsID=47994&amp;CatID=1009 |title=Eviction order for land invaders given go-ahead |work=thenewage.co.za |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821041728/http://www.thenewage.co.za/mobi/Detail.aspx?NewsID=47994&amp;CatID=1009 |archivedate=2014-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a submission on 6 September 2018 to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee charged with reviewing Section 25 of the Constitution, AfriForum argued that the ANC/EFF allianceâs{{dubious|date=September 2018}} initiative to carry through expropriation without compensation was nothing but an attempt to centralise as much power as possible in the State, and that the leaders of this policy had no respect for the pleas of poor South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/documents/you-are-drunk-on-the-ideology-of-the-ndr--ernst-ro|title=You are drunk on the ideology of the NDR - Ernst Roets - DOCUMENTS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-source-inline|date=September 2018}}

In his submission on behalf of AfriForum, Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum, argued that the campaign of the ANC and its alliance partner, the EFF, was built on a series of false arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2018-09-06-afriforum-bemoans-fallacy-that-whites-stole-the-land/|title=AfriForum bemoans âfallacy that whites stole the landâ|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum unleashed a media and public storm when they published a list of farms that are said to be targeted by the government for expropriation without compensation that the organisation received from an anonymous source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/documents/this-is-the-list-of-farms-targeted-for-ewc--afrifo|title=This is the list of farms targeted for EWC - AfriForum - DOCUMENTS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the organisation received a backlash from some organisations and political parties regarding the legitimacy of the list, the South African Institute for Race Relations confirmed and corroborated the legitimacy of the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/land-expropriation-list-released-by-afriforum-is-legitimate-irr-20180814|title='Land expropriation list released by AfriForum is legitimate' â IRR|work=News24|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shoot the Boer case and hate speech===
AfriForum Youth opened a civil case against former ANC Youth League President (ANCYL), Julius Malema, in the [[Equality Court]] after his repeated singing of the words âdubulâ ibhunuâ, which translate as âshoot the boerâ, at a number of ANC Youth League gatherings.&lt;ref name=shtbs&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC youth leader denies hatred in 'Shoot the boer' song|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/20/julius-malema-hate-speech-boer|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Colin Lamont ruled in the South Gauteng High Court that the song constituted [[hate speech]] and undermined the dignity of Afrikaners, and was discriminatory and harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-12-shoot-the-boer-its-hate-speech-says-judge|title='Shoot the boer': It's hate speech, says judge|author=Staff Reporter, Sapa-AFP|work=The M&amp;G Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stbban&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC Julius Malema's Shoot the Boer ruled 'hate speech'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14878102|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, AfriForum and the ANC reached a settlement before the appeal case was due to be argued in the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] (SCA) in [[Bloemfontein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Shoot-the-Boer-appeal-canned-20121031-2|title=Shoot the Boer appeal canned|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum has also brought charges of hate speech against individuals, among others Ronald Lamola, the then acting president of the ANC Youth League following a complaint regarding Lamola's remarks that the ANCYL could no longer guarantee the safety of the Van der Merwes and Van Tonders (traditional white Afrikaans family names) if white South Africans refused to voluntarily give up their land and mineral rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/hate-speech-charge-laid-against-lamola-20120709-2/ |title=Hate speech charge laid against Lamola |work=News24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211202232/http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/hate-speech-charge-laid-against-lamola-20120709-2/ |archivedate=2012-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013 AfriForum Youth brought a complaint of hate speech against Jason Mfusi, the leader of SASCO (The South African Students Congress) of the North-West University for his remark: "My grandfather says 'n goeie boer is 'n dooie boer", translated as âMy grandfather says a good farmer is a dead farmerâ which he posted on the social network, Facebook. The youth organisation reached an agreement with the SASCO leader by means of a mediation process, as requested by the Human Rights Commission (HRC) of the University. In terms of the agreement, Mfusi had to issue a written apology to the farming community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2013/02/07/nwu-student-in-trouble-over-facebook-posting|title=NWU student in trouble over Facebook posting|author=Tebogo Monama|work=Sowetan LIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum adopted a similar stance towards the word [[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]], stating that its use is a "gross human rights violation".&lt;ref name=sabckword&gt;{{cite web|title=AfriForum reaffirm stance on use of K-word amid racist saga|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/aa9441804fe8018d8628e60b5d39e4bb/AfriForum-reaffirm-stance-on-use-of-K-word-amid-racist-saga|publisher=SABC News|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Minority rights===
AfriForum regularly seeks international platforms to speak to the international community regarding the minority rights situation in South Africa. AfriForum has on several occasions attended the [[United Nations]]' [[Human Rights Council]]'s Forum on Minority Issues in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] regarding minority rights in South Africa. AfriForum has also been a delegate to a conference of the United Nationsâ (UN) Human Rights Council regarding the prevention of the incitement of hatred on the grounds of nationality, race or religion.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

AfriForum has on numerous occasions criticised the ruling ANC about the denial of minority rights in the country.{{fact|date=May 2018}} However, City Press journalist Adriaan Basson (now editor of the Afrikaans daily newspaper, Beeld) has accused the organisation of overreacting to the situation regarding minority rights in South Africa. Basson has mentioned in an open letter to AfriForum CEO, Kallie Kriel, that the premise of AfriForumâs campaigns is one of victimhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/White-first-African-second-20110926|title=White first.

=== Racism ===
{{Advert|section|date=September 2018}} 
On 11 September 2018, AfriForum founded a unit against racism and hate speech. Roleplayers who have committed themselves to act as advisors on this unit include: Dr Frans Cronje, CEO of the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), The civil rights activist Rhoda Kadalie, Adv. Mark Oppenheimer, expert in freedom of speech and hate speech and Dr Llewellyn Curlewis, criminal law expert, explained the legal remedies available to citizens to fight racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/afriforum-launches-anti-racism-unit-20170911|title=AfriForum launches anti-racism unit|work=News24|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum submitted criminal charges against two police officials and a former member of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in January 2018 after they used social media to incite farm attacks and/or romanticise violence against farmers and minorities. AfriForum says that these incidents can be considered a form of complicity by the South African government and that it urgently needs to be tackled by the police to ensure that those responsible are prosecuted. Mseleni Mogolwane Gwabeni, who is a member of the SAPS according to his Facebook profile, said on this social media platform âthen we must continue to kill more of their farmers at least to make up for what they did to us [sic]â. Chris Gumotso, who works at the SAPS youth crime prevention desk according to his Facebook profile, placed the following on Facebook: âAll white manâ¦deserve to dieâ¦in future..f*Â©k u..Mr white man.â He also placed photos of firearms on his police desk on his profile with this quote: âI predict th civil war.. in mzansiâ¦by 2019â¦take out ur gunsâ¦fighters coz Asijiki [sic].â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/afriforum-lays-criminal-charges-against-police-officials-2018-06-18|title=AfriForum lays criminal charges against police officials|work=Polity.org.za|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 AfriForum submitted criminal charges against a 100 social media users for incitement of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1554475/afriforum-to-lay-charges-against-these-100-social-media-users/|title=AfriForum to lay charges against these 100 social media users|last=reporter|first=Citizen|work=The Citizen|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum has been consistent in condemning both white on black and black on white racism. The organisation released media statements in which they address racist incidents involving amongst others Penny Sparrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/south-africans-have-double-standards-when-it-comes-to-racism-afriforum-20170216|title=South Africans have double standards when it comes to racism - AfriForum|work=News24|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darren Scott,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ewn.co.za/2011/09/08/AfriForum-welcomes-Darren-Scotts-apology|title=AfriForum welcomes Darren Scott's apology|last=News|first=Eyewitness|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Roodt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/AfriForum-condemns-racist-Dan-Roodt-20141113|title=AfriForum condemns 'racist' Dan Roodt|date=2014-11-13|access-date=2018-09-26|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Catzavelos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-08-22-afriforum-condemns-use-of-k-word-by-catzavelos-urges-consistency-in-condemnation-of-racism-from-all-sides/|title=AfriForum condemns use of k-word by Catzavelosâ urges consistency in condemnation of racism from all sides|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kommandokorps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Kommandokorps-denies-racism-20120227|title=Kommandokorps denies racism|work=News24|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation frequently condemns double standards in South Africa when it comes to dealing with racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/vicki-momberg-sentencing-confirms-double-standards|title=Vicki Momberg: Absurd double standards being applied â AfriForum - POLITICS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{primary-source-inline|date=September 2018}}

==Community affairs==

===Local government===
This department addresses municipal service delivery problems in over 125 towns and cities across South Africa.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In order to achieve this goal, AfriForum attempts to establish partnerships with municipalities.  The organisation allegedly submits wish lists to municipalities, and municipalities convert it into action plans to address issues. AfriForum says if municipalities do not cooperate in improving service delivery to residents, the organisation approaches courts to order municipalities to enforce service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/afriforum-statement-by-afriforum-minority-civil-organisation-brings-application-to-retain-electricity-supply-to-klerksdorp-and-jouberton-22022013-2013-02-22|title=AfriForum: Statement by  AfriForum, minority civil organisation, brings application to retain electricity supply to Klerksdorp and Jouberton (22/02/2013)|work=Polity.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

An example of intervention by AfriForum in this regard, was the urgent order awarded to the organisation against the Vhembe District Municipality by the [[High Court]] in [[Pretoria]], forcing the municipality to supply water to [[Makhado]] residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/afriforum-wins-fights-for-water-1.1394477|title=Afriforum wins fights for water|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar case in 2013, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria granted AfriForum an order stopping the Madibeng Municipality from cutting electricity supply to Hartbeespoort.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In 2010 a legal team for AfriForum representing farmers in [[Zimbabwe]] won a court bid to sue Zimbabwe's government over its âcruelâ and âvengefulâ [[expropriation]] of South African-owned farms. In 2008 the regional court SADC tribunal ruled that Zimbabwe's [[land reform]] was illegal and racist, and that those who had suffered discrimination by having their farms expropriated had the right to compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/afriforum-wins-first-round-in-zimbabwe-case-1.470355|title=Afriforum wins first round in Zimbabwe case|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AfriForum's local government interventions have been described positively, even by its critics.&lt;ref name="news24DuPreez2016Hijacking"/&gt;

===Community safety===
{{Advert section|date=May 2018}}
AfriForumâs Community Safety Department participates in endeavours which promote the safety of citizens within communities. A large emphasis is placed on assisting communities and neighbourhoods to establish safety structures. Some of these structures include neighbourhood watches, farm watches, radio networks and community forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/afriforum-statement-by-reg-crewe-afriforum-head-of-community-safety-vryburg-launches-community-patrols-05112012-2012-11-05|title=AfriForum: Statement by Reg Crewe, Afriforum Head of Community Safety, Vryburg launches community patrols (05/11/2012)|work=Polity.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

In 2011 AfriForum commissioned Professor Rudolph Zinn of UNISA to conduct research into successful community safety structures in South Africa. The research has led to the compilation of a community safety handbook that has been implemented in all AfriForum branches countrywide.
The department also focuses on the role of government and in particular that of law enforcement agencies, and acts as a pressure group so that citizens get the best safety and security possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afriforum.co.za/english/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/report-community-safety-networks.pdf|title=AfriForum|work=AfriForum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}

==Controversies==
In 2015 AfriForum asserted that allegations of racism{{clarify|date=May 2018}} against Curro Foundation School are themselves racist. In a statement by the organisation's chair it was said "To portray an Afrikaans class being transported as class group falsely as racial segregation, is beyond absurd". An investigation into the matter came to the conclusion that the class was in fact segregated racially as was alleged because white parents had pressured the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/School-racism-allegations-are-racist-Afriforum-Youth-20150618|title=School racism allegations are 'racist' - Afriforum Youth|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of AfriForum protestors were found by judge AJ Donen to have engaged in "assault, sexual violence, sexual aggression and intimidation" at Stellenbosch University,&lt;ref name="news24DuPreez2016Hijacking"/&gt; and the organisation initiated a boycott of Afrikaans newspapers that reported on Potchefstroom students that gave the [[Nazi salute]] during their initiation.&lt;ref name="news24DuPreez2016Hijacking"/&gt;

In 2016 AfriForum supporters protested in Pretoria together with the political party [[Freedom Front Plus]]'s members because Steve Hofmeyr's scheduled event at CafÃ© Dudok, a restaurant in the Netherlands, was cancelled when the organisers were alerted of his alleged white supremacy by a left-wing group in Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/hofmeyr-defended-in-dutch-caf-snub-2028898|title=Hofmeyr defended in Dutch cafÃ© snub|publisher=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 eight students affiliated with AfriForum youth wing were suspended from [[Stellenbosch University]] Student Representative Council (SRC) elections after allegations of campaign irregularities. Posters that they produced and hanged around the campus were removed after they were deemed controversial and harmful to other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/8-afriforum-students-suspended-from-stellenbosch-src-elections-20160802|title=8 AfriForum students suspended from Stellenbosch SRC elections|publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological motion perception''' is the act of perceiving the fluid unique motion of a biological agent.  The phenomenon was first documented by Swedish perceptual psychologist, Gunnar Johansson, in 1973.&lt;ref name=Johansson1973&gt;{{cite journal |title=Visual perception of biological motion and a model for its analysis|author=Johansson|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=1973|volume=14|pages=201â214|doi=10.3758/bf03212378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many [[brain]] areas involved in this process, some similar to those used to perceive [[face]]s. While humans complete this process with ease, from a [[computational neuroscience]] perspective there is still much to be learned as to how this complex perceptual problem is solved. One tool which many research studies in this area use is a display [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] called a point light walker. Point light walkers are coordinated moving dots that simulate biological motion in which each dot represents specific joints of a human performing an action.

Currently a large topic of research, many different models of biological motion/perception have been proposed. The following models have shown that both [[Visual appearance|form]] and [[motion (physics)|motion]] are important components of biological motion perception. However, to what extent each of the components play is contrasted upon the models.

==Neuroanatomy==

Research in this area seeks to identify the specific brain regions or circuits responsible for processing the information which the [[visual system]] perceives in the world. And in this case, specifically recognizing motion created by biological agents.

===Single Cell Recording===

The most precise research is done using [[single-unit recording|single-cell recordings]] in the primate brain. This research has yielded areas important to motion perception in primates such as area MT (middle [[temporal lobe|temporal]] [[visual cortex|visual]] area), also referred to as V5, and area MST ([[medial superior temporal area]]). These areas contain cells characterized as direction cells, expansion/contraction cells, and rotation cells, which react to certain classes of movement.&lt;ref name="Born R., Bradley D." &gt;{{cite journal |title=Structure and Function of Visual Area MT|author=Born, Bradley|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|year=2005|volume=28|pages=157â189|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.26.041002.131052|pmid=16022593}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanaka and Saito" &gt;{{cite journal |title=Analysis of Motion of the Visual Field by Direction, Expansion/Contraction, and Rotation Cells Clustered in the Dorsal Part of the Medial Superior Temporal Area of the Macaque Monkey

===Neuroimaging===

Additionally, research on human participants is being conducted as well. While single-cell recording is not conducted on humans, this research uses [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], [[positron emission tomography|PET]], [[electroencephalography|EEG]]/[[event-related potential|ERP]] to collect information on what brain areas become active when executing biological motion perception tasks, such as viewing point light walker stimuli. Areas uncovered from this type of research are the dorsal visual pathway, [[extrastriate body area]], [[fusiform gyrus]], [[superior temporal sulcus]], and [[premotor cortex]]. The [[two-streams hypothesis|dorsal visual pathway]] (sometimes referred to as the âwhereâ pathway), as contrasted with the [[two-streams hypothesis|ventral visual pathway]] (âwhatâ pathway), has been shown to play a significant role in the perception of motion cues. While the ventral pathway is more responsible for form cues.&lt;ref name="Grossman et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain Areas Involved in the Perception of Biological Motion|author=Grossman|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2000|volume=12|pages=711â720|doi=10.1162/089892900562417|pmid=11054914|issue=5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ptito et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Separate neural pathways for contour and biological-motion cues in motion-defined animal shapes|author=Ptito|journal=NeuroImage|year=2003|volume=19|pages=246â252|doi=10.1016/s1053-8119(03)00082-x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Downing et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Cortical Area Selective for Visual Processing of the Human Body|author=Downing|journal=Science|year=2001|volume=293|pages=2470â2473|doi=10.1126/science.1063414|pmid=11577239|issue=5539|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadjikhani and Gelder"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing Fearful Body Expressions activates the Fusiform Cortex and Amygdala|authors=Hadjikhani and Gelder|journal=Current Biology|year=2003|volume=13|pages=2201â2205|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2003.11.049|pmid=14680638|issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saygin&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saygin |first1=A.P. |editor-last=Johnson &amp; Shiffrar |editor-first=K. |title=Biological motion perception and the brain: Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies|publisher=Oxford Series in Visual Cognition |year=2012 |pages=371â389 |chapter=Chapter 21: Sensory and motor brain areas supporting biological motion perception: neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saygin et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Point-Light Biological Motion Perception Activates Human Premotor Cortex|author=Saygin|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|year=2004|volume=24|pages=6181â6188|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.0504-04.2004|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychological Damage===

Valuable information can also be learned from cases where a patient has suffered from some sort of [[neurology|neurological]] damage and consequently loses certain functionalities of neural processing. One patient with bilateral [[lesion]]s that included the human homologue of area MT, lost their ability to see biological motion when the stimulus was embedded in noise, a task which the average observer is able to complete. Another study on [[stroke]] patients sustaining lesions to their superior temporal and premotor [[frontal lobe|frontal]] areas showed deficits in their processing of biological motion stimuli, thereby implicating these areas as important to that perception process. A [[case study]] conducted on a patient with bilateral lesions involving the posterior [[visual cortex|visual pathways]] and effecting the lateral [[parietal-temporal-occipital]] cortex struggled with early motion tasks, and yet was able to perceive the biological motion of a point light walker, a higher-order task. This may be due to the fact that area V3B and area KO were still intact, suggesting their possible roles in biological motion perception.&lt;ref name="Vaina et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intact "biological motion" and "structure from motion" perception in a patient with impaired motion mechanisms|author=Vaina|journal=Visual Neuroscience|year=1990|volume=5|pages=353â369|doi=10.1017/s0952523800000444|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saygin2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Superior temporal and premotor brain areas necessary for biological motion perception|author=Saygin|journal=Brain|year=2007|volume=130|pages=2452â2461|doi=10.1093/brain/awm162|pmid=17660183|issue=Pt 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaina and Giese"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Biological motion: Why some motion impaired stroke patients "can" while others "canât" recognize it?

==Biological Motion Perception Models==

===Cognitive Model of Biological Motion Form (Lange &amp; Lappe, 2006)&lt;ref name="Lange and Lappe"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Model of Biological Motion Perception from Configural Form Cues
|authors=Lange and Lappe|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|year=2006|volume=26|pages=2894â2906|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4915-05.2006|pmid=16540566}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

====Background====
The relative roles of form cues compared to motion cues in the process of perceiving biological motion is unclear. Previous research has not untangled the circumstances under which local motion cues are needed or only additive. This model looks at how form-only cues can replicate psychophysical results of biological motion perception.

====Model====
''Template Creation''

Same as below. See 2.2.2 Template Generation

''Stage 1''

The first stage compares stimulus images to the assumed library of upright human walker templates in memory. Each dot in a given stimulus frame is compared to the nearest limb location on a template and these combined, weighted distances are outputted by the function:

::&lt;math&gt;F_{tc}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n e^  \left (\frac{(\mu_{tc}-p_i(t))^2}{2X\sigma}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; p_i&lt;/math&gt; gives the position of a particular stimulus dot and &lt;math&gt; \mu_{tc}&lt;/math&gt; represents the nearest limb position in the template. &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; represents the size of the receptor field to adjust for the size of the stimulus figure.

The best fitting template was then selected by a [[winner-take-all in action selection|winner-takes-all]] mechanism and entered into a [[leaky integrator]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\tau \frac{\delta u_{1,2}(t)}{\delta t} = -u_{1,2}+i_{1,2}+w_+f(u_{1,2}(t))- w_-f(u_{2,1}(t)) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_-&lt;/math&gt; are the weights for lateral excitation and inhibition, respectively, and the activities &lt;math&gt;u_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; provide the left/right decision for which direction the stimulus is facing.

''Stage 2''

The second stage attempts to use the [[temporality|temporal]] order of the stimulus frames to change the expectations of what frame would be coming next. The equation

::&lt;math&gt;\tau \frac{\delta v_{1,2}(t)}{\delta t} = -v_{1,2}(t) + w_{m,n}u(t) &lt;/math&gt;

takes into account [[top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] input from stage 1 &lt;math&gt;(u)&lt;/math&gt;, the activities in decision stage 2 for the possible responses &lt;math&gt;(v_{1,2})&lt;/math&gt;, and weights the difference between selected frame &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and previous frame &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

''Implications''

This model highlights the abilities of form-related cues to detect biological motion and orientation in a neurologically feasible model. The results of the Stage 1 model showed that all behavioral data could be replicated by using form information alone - global motion information was not necessary to detect figures and their orientation. This model shows the possibility of the use of form cues, but can be criticized for a lack of [[ecological validity]]. Humans do not detect biological figures in static environments and motion is an inherent aspect in upright figure recognition.

===Action Recognition by Motion Detection in Posture Space (Theusner, Lussanet, and Lappe, 2014)===

====Overview====
Old models of [[biological motion]] [[Motion perception|perception]] are concerned with [[Optical motion tracking|tracking]] joint and limb motion relative to one another over time.&lt;ref name="Johansson1973"/&gt; However, recent experiments in biological motion perception have suggested that motion information is unimportant for action recognition.&lt;ref name=Beintema&amp;Lappe2002&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perception of biological motion without local image motion|authors=Beintema and Lappe|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|year=2002|volume=99|pages=5661â5663|doi=10.1073/pnas.082483699|pmc=122827}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model shows how biological motion may be perceived from sequences of [[Posture (psychology)|posture]] recognition, rather than from the direct perception of motion information. An experiment was conducted to test the validity of this model, in which subjects are presented moving point-light and stick-figure walking [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Each frame of the walking stimulus is matched to a posture template, the progression of which is recorded on a 2D postureâtime [[Plot (graphics)|plot]] that implies motion recognition.

====Posture Model====
''Template Generation''

Posture templates for stimulus matching were constructed with motion tracking data from nine people walking.&lt;ref name=Beintema2006&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perception of biological motion from limited lifetime stimuli |vauthors=Beintema JA, Georg K, Lappe M |journal=Percept Psychophys |year=2006 |volume=68 |pages=613â624 |doi=10.3758/bf03208763}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian coordinate system|3D coordinates]] of the twelve major joints (feet, knees, hips, hands, elbows, and shoulders) were tracked and [[Interpolation|interpolated]] between to generate limb motion. Five sets of 2D projections were created: leftward, frontward, rightward, and the two 45Â° intermediate orientations. Finally, projections of the nine walkers were [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] for walking speed (1.39 seconds at 100 frames per cycle), height, and hip location in posture space. One of the nine walkers was chosen as the walking stimulus, and the remaining eight were kept as templates for matching.

''Template Matching''

Template matching is computed by simulating posture selective [[Artificial neuron|neurons]] as described by &lt;ref name=Lange&amp;Lappe2006&gt;{{cite journal |title=A model of biological motion perception from configural form cues |vauthors=Lange J, Lappe M |journal=J Neurosci |year=2006 |volume=26 |pages=2894â2906 |doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4915-05.2006 |pmid=16540566}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neuron is excited by similarity to a static frame of the walker stimulus. For this experiment, 4,000 neurons were generated (8 walkers times 100 frames per cycle times 5 2D projections). A neuron's similarity to a frame of the stimulus is calculated as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;R_\psi(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \exp \left( - \frac{\left | (x_i(t), y_i(t)) - (\Chi_i, _\psi, \Rho_i, _\psi) \right \vert ^2}{2 \sdot \sigma} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(x_i, y_i)&lt;/math&gt; describe a stimulus point and &lt;math&gt;(c_i, r_i)&lt;/math&gt; describe the limb location at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; describes the preferred posture; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; describes a neuron's response to a stimulus of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; points; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; describes limb width.

''Response Simulation''

The neuron most closely resembling the posture of the walking stimulus changes over time. The neural activation pattern can be graphed in a 2D plot, called a posture-time plot. Along the x axis, templates are sorted chronologically according to a forward walking pattern. Time progresses along the y axis with the beginning corresponding to the origin. The perception of forward walking motion is represented as a line with a positive [[slope]] from the origin, while backward walking is conversely represented as a line with a negative slope.

====Motion Model====
''Motion Detection in Posture Space''

''Posturo-Temporal Filters''

Neural responses are first normalized as described by &lt;ref name=Simoncelli&amp;Heeger1998&gt;{{cite journal |title=A model of neuronal responses in visual area MT |vauthors=Simoncelli EP, Heeger DJ |journal=Vision Res |year=1998 |volume=38 |pages=743â761 |doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00183-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\nu_\psi(t) = \frac{R_\psi(t) - \bar{R}}{\bar{R}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_y(t)&lt;/math&gt; describes the neural response; &lt;math&gt;_\psi&lt;/math&gt; describes the preferred posture at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\bar{R}&lt;/math&gt; describes the mean neural response over all neurons over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;n_y(t)&lt;/math&gt; describes the normalized response. The filters are defined for forward and backward walking (&lt;math&gt;g^f, g^b&lt;/math&gt; respectively). The response of the posturo-temporal filter is described

::&lt;math&gt;r_\psi(\tau) = \sum_{t=0ms}^\tau \sum_{p=1}^{100} g_{\tau, \psi} (t, p) \sdot \nu_\psi(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the response of the filter at time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; describes the posture dimension. The response of the filter is normalized by

::&lt;math&gt;N_\psi(\tau) = \max \left [ \left ( \frac{r_\psi(\tau)}{\sum_t \sum_p g_{\tau, \psi} (t, p)^2} \right ), 0 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; describes the response of the neuron selecting body motion. Finally, body motion is calculated by

::&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\psi(\tau) = N_\psi^F(\tau)^2 - N_\psi^B(\tau)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; describes body motion energy.

===Critical Features for the Recognition of Biological Motion (Casille and Giese, 2005)===

====Statistical Analysis and Psychophysical Experiments====
The following model suggests that biological motion recognition could be accomplished through the extraction of a single critical feature: dominant local [[Optical flow|optic flow]] motion. These following assumptions were brought about from results of both statistical analysis and [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] experiments.&lt;ref name=Casile2005&gt;{{cite journal |title=Critical features for the recognition of biological motion|authors=Casile, &amp; Giese |journal=Journal of Vision |year=2005 |volume=5 |pages=348â360 |doi=10.1167/5.4.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, [[Principal component analysis]] was done on full body [[2d computer graphics|2d]] walkers and point light walkers. The analysis found that dominant local optic flow features are very similar in both full body 2d stimuli and point light walkers (Figure 1).&lt;ref name="Casile2005"/&gt; Since subjects can recognize biological motion upon viewing a point light walker, then the similarities between these two stimuli may highlight critical features needed for biological motion recognition.

Through psychophysical experiments, it was found that [[Human subject research|subjects]] could recognize biological motion using a CFS [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] which  contained opponent motion in the horizontal direction but randomly moving dots in the horizontal direction (Figure 2).&lt;ref name="Casile2005"/&gt; Because of the movement of the dots, this stimulus could not be fit to a human [[skeleton]] model suggesting that biological motion recognition may not heavily rely on form as a critical feature. Also, the psychophysical experiments showed that subjects similarly recognize biological motion for both the CFS stimulus and SPS, a stimulus in which dots of the point light walker were reassigned to different positions within the human body shape for every nth frame thereby highlights the importance of form vs the motion (Fig.1.).&lt;ref name=Beintema2002&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perception of biological motion without local image motion|authors=Beintema, &amp; Lappe |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2002 |volume=99|issue =8|pages=5661â5663 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082483699|pmc=122827}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the following psychophysical experiments show that motion is a critical feature that could be used to recognize biological motion.

The following statistical analysis and psychophysical experiments highlight the importance of dominant local motion patterns in biological motion recognition.Furthermore, due to the ability of subjects to recognize biological motion given the CFS stimulus, it is postulated that [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] opponent motion and coarse positional information is important for recognition of biological motion.

====Model====
The following model contains detectors modeled from existing neurons that extracts motion features with increasing complexity. (Figure 4).&lt;ref name="Casile2005"/&gt;

''Detectors of Local Motion''

These detectors detect different motion directions and are modeled from neurons in monkey V1/2 and area [[Middle temporal gyrus|MT]]&lt;ref name=Snowden1994&gt;{{cite journal |title=Motion processing in the primate cerebral cortex|author=Snowden, R.J. |journal=Visual detection of motion |year=1994 |pages=51â84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The output of the local motion detectors are the following:
::&lt;math&gt;G_p(x) = H(v(x),v_1,v_2) \cdot  b(\theta,\theta_p) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the position with preferred direction &lt;math&gt;\theta_p,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;  is the velocity, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the direction, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the rectangular speed tuning function such that

::&lt;math&gt;H(v,v_1,v_2) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; v_1 &lt; v &lt; v_2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; H(v,v_1,v_2) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

The direction-tuning of motion energy detectors are given by

::&lt;math&gt; b(\theta,\theta_p)=\left\{ \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) \left [\ 1 + cos(\theta,\theta_p)\right]\ \right\}^q &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter that determines width of direction tuning function. (q=2 for simulation).

''Neural detectors for opponent motion selection''

The following neural detectors are used to detect horizontal and vertical opponent motion due by pooling together the output of previous local motion energy detectors into two adjacent subfields. Local motion detectors that have the same direction preference are combined into the same subfield. These detectors were modeled after neurons sensitive to opponent motion such as the ones in [[Middle temporal gyrus|MT]] and [[Superior temporal sulcus|medial superior temporal (MST)]].&lt;ref name=Born2000&gt;{{cite journal |title=Center-surround interactions in the middle temporal visual area of the owl monkey|author=Born, R.T. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |year=2000 |volume = 84|pages=2658â2669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka1989&gt;{{cite journal |title=Analysis of motion in the visual field by direction, expansion/contraction, and rotation cells clustered in the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area of the macaque monkey|author1=Tanaka, K.  |author2=Saito, H  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |year=2000 |volume = 62| issue = 3| pages=535â552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, KO/V3B has been associated with processing edges, moving objects, and opponent motion. Patients with damage to dorsal pathway areas but an intact KO/V3B, as seen in patient AF can still perceive biological motion.&lt;ref name=Vaina1990&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intact "biological motion" and "structure from motion" perception in a patient with impaired motion mechanisms: A case study |authors=Vaina, L. M., Lemay, M., Bienfang, D., Choi, A. &amp; Nakayama, K. |journal=Visual Neuroscience |year=1990 |volume = 5| pages=353â369 |doi=10.1017/s0952523800000444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The output for these detectors are the following:

::&lt;math&gt;o_l(x)=\sqrt{max(g_p(x_i))max(g_r(x_j))}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is the position the output is centered at, direction preferences &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt; signify spatial positions of two subfields.

The final output of opponent motion detector is given as

::&lt;math&gt;o_l(x)=max(o_l(x_k))&lt;/math&gt;

where output is the pooled responses of detectors of type &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; x_k &lt;/math&gt; different spatial positions.

''Detectors of optic flow patterns''

Each detector looks at one frame of a training stimulus and compute an instantaneous optic flow field for that particular frame. These detectors model neurons in [[Superior temporal sulcus]]&lt;ref name=Grossman2000&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain areas involved in perception of biological motion|authors=Grossman, E. Donnelly, M. Price, R., Pickens, D. Morgan, V., Neighbor, G. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |year=2000 |volume = 12|issue = 5| pages=711â720 |doi=10.1162/089892900562417 |pmid=11054914|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fusiform face area]]&lt;ref name=Grossman2002&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain areas active during visual perception of biological motion|author1=Grossman, E.  |author2=Blake, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Neuron |year=2002 |volume = 35|pages=1167â1175 |doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00897-8 |pmid=12354405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The input of these detectors is arranged from vector u and are comprised from the previous opponent motion detectorsâ responses. The output is the following:

::&lt;math&gt;G(u) = e^{(u-u_0)^T C(u-u_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; is the center of the [[radial basis function]] for each neuron and &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix which contains elements that have been set during training and correspond to vector u. These elements equal zero if the variance over training doesn't exceed a certain threshold. Otherwise, these elements equal the inverse of variance.

Since recognition of biological motion is dependent on the sequence of activity, the following model is sequence selective. The activity of the optic flow pattern neuron is modeled by the following equation of

::&lt;math&gt;\tau H_k^l(t) = -H_k^l(t) + \sum_m w(k-m)f(H_k^l(t)+G_k^l(t))&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a specific frame in the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-th training sequence, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time constant.&lt;math&gt;f(H)&lt;/math&gt; a threshold function, &lt;math&gt;w(m)&lt;/math&gt; is an asymmetric interaction kernel, and &lt;math&gt;G_k^l(t)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the previous section.

''Detectors of complete biological motion patterns''
The following detectors sum the output of the optic flow pattern detectors in order to selectively activate for whole movement patterns (e.g. walking right vs. walking left). These detectors model similar neurons that optic flow pattern detectors model:

[[Superior temporal sulcus]]&lt;ref name="Grossman2000"/&gt; and [[Fusiform face area]]&lt;ref name="Grossman2002"/&gt;

The input of these detectors are the activity of the optic flow motion detectors, &lt;math&gt;H_l^l(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The output of these detectors are the following:

::&lt;math&gt;\tau_s P^l (t) = -P^l(t) + \sum_k H_l^l(t)&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;P^l(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the activity of the complete biological motion pattern detector in response to pattern type &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt; (e.g. walking to the left), &lt;math&gt; \tau_s &lt;/math&gt; equals the time constant (used 150 ms in simulation), and &lt;math&gt;H_k^l(t)&lt;/math&gt; equals the activity of optic flow pattern detector at kth frame in sequence l.

====Testing the model====

Using correct determination of walking direction of both the CFS and SPS stimulus, the model was able to replicate similar results as the psychophysical experiments. (could determine walking direction of CFS and SPS stimuli and increasing correct with increasing number of dots). It is postulated that recognition of biological motion is made possible by the opponent horizontal motion information that is present in both the CFS and SPS stimuli.

{{main|Prospect theory}}
The '''certainty effect''' is the psychological effect resulting from the reduction of probability from certainty to probable {{harv|Tversky|Kahneman|1986}}. It is an idea introduced in [[prospect theory]]. 

Normally a reduction in the probability of winning a reward (e.g., a reduction from 80% to 20% in the chance of winning a reward) creates a psychological effect such as displeasure to individuals, which leads to the perception of loss from the original probability thus favoring a risk-averse decision. However, the same reduction results in a larger psychological effect when it is done from certainty than from uncertainty.

==Example==
{{harvtxt|Tversky|Kahneman|1986}} illustrated the certainty effect by the following examples.

First, consider this example:

Which of the following options do you prefer?
*A. a sure gain of $30
*B. 80% chance to win $45 and 20% chance to win nothing

In this case, 78% of participants chose option A while only 22% chose option B. This demonstrates the typical risk-aversion phenomenon in [[prospect theory]] and [[framing effect]] because the expected value of option B ($45x0.8=$36) exceeds that of A by 20%.

Now, consider this problem:

Which of the following options do you prefer?

*C. 25% chance to win $30 and 75% chance to win nothing
*D. 20% chance to win $45 and 80% chance to win nothing

In this case, 42% of participants chose option C while 58% chose option D. 

As before, the expected value of the first option ($30x0.25=$7.50) was 20% lower than that of option D ($45x0.2=9) however, when neither option was certain, risk-taking increased.

A '''disruptive physician''' is a [[physician]] whose obnoxious behaviour upsets patients or other staff.  The [[American Medical Association]] defines this in their code of [[medical ethics]] as "personal conduct, whether verbal or physical, that negatively affects or that potentially may affect patient care".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar9Wn_aeCwQC&amp;pg=PA133 |pages=131â152 |title=Professionalism in Psychiatry |chapter=The Disruptive Physician |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub. |year=2011 |isbn=9781585623372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion9045.page |title=AMA Code of Medical Ethics |chapter=Physicians with Disruptive Behavior |year=2000 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/code-medical-ethics/9045a.pdf |title=Physicians With Disruptive Behavior |author=Herbert Rakatansky |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are also noted as causing adverse effects such as morale, focus and concentration, team work, collaboration and communication. Starting in 2009, The [[Joint Commission]] which [[accreditation|accredits]] hospitals in the United States requires them to have a written [[code of conduct]] addressing this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/health/02rage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Arrogant, Abusive and Disruptive â and a Doctor |author=Laurie Tarkan |date=December 1, 2008 |journal=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This code of conduct defines acceptable, disruptive, and unacceptable behavior in the workplace. Along with these definitions of behaviors the Joint Commission also wrote ways to manage these behaviors in order to fix them.

In [[psychology]], '''dissociation''' is any of a wide array of experiences from mild [[Emotional detachment|detachment]] from immediate surroundings to more severe detachment from physical and emotional experiences. The major characteristic of all dissociative phenomena involves a detachment from [[reality]], rather than a loss of reality as in [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dell P.

More pathological dissociation involves [[dissociative disorder]]s, including [[dissociative fugue]] and [[depersonalization disorder]] with or without alterations in personal identity or sense of self. These alterations can include: a sense that self or the world is unreal ([[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]]); a loss of memory ([[amnesia]]); forgetting identity or assuming a new self (fugue); and separate streams of consciousness, identity and self ([[dissociative identity disorder]], formerly termed multiple personality disorder) and [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coons PM |title=Psychogenic or dissociative fugue: a clinical investigation of five cases |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=84 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=881â6 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10408212 |doi= 10.2466/PR0.84.3.881-886|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kritchevsky |first1= M |last2= Chang |first2= J |last3= Squire |first3= LR |title=Functional Amnesia: Clinical Description and Neuropsychological Profile of 10 Cases |journal=Learning and Memory |volume=11|issue= 2 |pages=213â26 |year=2004 |pmid=15054137 |pmc=379692 |doi=10.1101/lm.71404 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissociative disorders are sometimes triggered by trauma, but may be preceded only by stress, psychoactive substances, or no identifiable trigger at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Abugel |first1= J |last2= Simeon |first2= D |title=Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=2006 | page= [https://books.google.com/?id=M-Cgs_T7Cl8C&amp;pg=PA17 17] |isbn=0195170229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ICD-10]] classifies [[conversion disorder]] as a [[dissociative disorder]].&lt;ref name="Dell2009"/&gt;  The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] groups all dissociative disorders into a single category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = American Psychiatric Association | authorlink = American Psychiatric Association | title = [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (Text Revision)]] | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC&amp;pg=PA519 519â34] | date = June 2000 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. | location = Arlington, VA, USA | isbn = 978-0-89042-024-9 | doi = 10.1176/appi.books.9780890423349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some dissociative disruptions involve amnesia, other dissociative events do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The measurement of dissociation in normal and clinical populations: meta-analytic validation of the dissociative experiences scale (DES) | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | last1 = Van IJzendoorn |first1= MH |last2=Schuengel |first2= C | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 365â382 | doi = 10.1016/0272-7358(96)00006-2 | year = 1996 | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272735896000062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissociative disorders are typically experienced as startling, autonomous intrusions into the person's usual ways of responding or functioning. Due to their unexpected and largely inexplicable nature, they tend to be quite unsettling.

== History ==
[[French people|French]] philosopher and [[psychologist]] [[Pierre Janet]] (1859â1947) is considered to be the author of the concept of dissociation.&lt;ref name = Ellenberger&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellenberger | first = H. F. |title=The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry |publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York |year=1970 |pages= |isbn=0-465-01673-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to some conceptions of dissociation, Janet did not believe that dissociation was a psychological defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Janet | first = P | authorlink = Pierre Janet |origyear= 1893/1901 |year= 1977 | title = The Mental State of Hystericals: A Study of Mental Stigmata and Mental Accidents | location = Washington, DC | publisher = University Publications of America | url = https://books.google.com/?id=6OctAAAAIAAJ | isbn = 0-89093-166-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Janet | first= Pierre | authorlink = Pierre Janet | origyear = 1920/1929 |year= 1965 | title = The major symptoms of hysteria | url = https://books.google.com/?id=yyQ6AAAAMAAJ | location = New York | publisher = Hafner Publishing Company | isbn = 1-4325-0431-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological [[defense mechanism]]s belong to Freud's theory of [[psychoanalysis]], not to Janetian psychology.  Janet claimed that dissociation occurred only in persons who had a constitutional weakness of mental functioning that led to [[hysteria]] when they were [[Stress (biological)|stressed]]. Although it is true that many of Janet's [[Case study|case histories]] described traumatic experiences, he never considered dissociation to be a defense against those experiences. Quite the opposite: Janet insisted that dissociation was a mental or cognitive deficit. Accordingly, he considered trauma to be one of many stressors that could worsen the already-impaired "mental efficiency" of a hysteric, thereby generating a cascade of hysterical (in today's language, "dissociative") symptoms.&lt;ref name = Ellenberger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McDougall | first = W | year = 1926| title = Outline of abnormal psychology| url = https://books.google.com/?id=86pWAAAAMAAJ  | location = New York | publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = TW | year = 1921 | title = The Psychology of Medicine | location = London | publisher = Methuen | isbn = 0-8274-4240-8 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=k1cwAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = TW | origyear = 1923 |year= 2007 | title = Medical Psychology and Psychical Research | location = New York | publisher = [[E. P. Dutton]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pxsZIg6_yhMC| isbn = 1-4067-3500-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there was great interest in dissociation during the last two decades of the nineteenth century (especially in France and England), this interest rapidly waned with the coming of the new century.&lt;ref name=Ellenberger/&gt; Even Janet largely turned his attention to other matters.

On the other hand, there was a sharp peak in interest in dissociation in America from 1890 to 1910, especially in Boston as reflected in the work of [[William James]], [[Boris Sidis]], [[Morton Prince]], and [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]. Nevertheless, even in America, interest in dissociation rapidly succumbed to the surging academic interest in psychoanalysis and behaviorism.

For most of the twentieth century, there was little interest in dissociation. Despite this, a review of 76 previously published cases (from 1790âs â 1942),was published in 1944, describing clinical phenomena consistent with that seen by Janet and by therapists today&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=WS|last2=Martin|first2=Mabel F|date=1944|title=Multiple Personality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0063634|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=39(3)|pages=281-300|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1971 Bowers and her colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=MK|last2=Brecher-Marer|first2=Sylvia|last3=Newton|first3=Bernauer. W.|last4=Piotrowski|first4=Zygmunt|last5=Spyer|first5=Thea C.|last6=Taylor|first6=William S.|last7=Watkins|first7=John G|date=1971|title=Therapy of Multiple Personality|url=|journal=The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis|volume=14(2)|pages=57-65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a detailed, and still quite valid, treatment article. The authors of this article included leading thinkers of their time â [[John G. Watkins]] (who developed [[Ego-state therapy]]) and [[Zygmunt A. Piotrowski]] (famed for his work on the  [[Rorschach test|Rorschach]] test). Further interest in dissociation was evoked when [[Ernest Hilgard]] (1977) published his neodissociation theory in the 1970s. During the 1970's and 1980's an increasing number of clinicians and researchers wrote about dissociation, particularly multiple personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Hart, O &amp; Dorahy, M.J.  (2009). History of the concept of Dissociation. In Dell, P.F. &amp; O'Neil J.A. (Eds). ''Dissociation and the Dissociative Disorders: DSM V and beyond,'' Routledge, New York&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Carl Jung]] described pathological manifestations of dissociation as special or extreme cases of the normal operation of the psyche. This structural dissociation, opposing tension, and hierarchy of basic [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and functions in normal individual consciousness is the basis of Jung's ''[[Psychological Types]]''.&lt;ref name=Jung1991&gt;{{cite book |last = Jung |first= C.G. |authorlink= Carl Jung | year = 1991 | title = Psychological Types | publisher = Routledge London | isbn = 978-0-7100-6299-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that dissociation is a natural necessity for consciousness to operate in one faculty unhampered by the demands of its opposite.

Attention to dissociation as a clinical feature has been growing in recent years as knowledge of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] increased, due to interest in [[dissociative identity disorder]], and as [[neuroimaging]] research and population studies show its relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scaer | first = Robert C. | title = The Body Bears the Burden: Trauma, Dissociation, and Disease | publisher = Haworth Medical Press | year = 2001 | location = Binghamton, NY | pages = 97â126 | isbn = 0-7890-1246-4 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=C30EbO7GDMIC&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the psychopathological concept of dissociation has also another different root: the conceptualization of [[Eugen Bleuler]] that looks into dissociation related to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-first1= M |editor-last1= Di Fiorino |editor-first2= ML |editor-last2= Figueira |title= Dissociation.

== Diagnosis ==
{{Main|Dissociative disorder}}
Dissociation in community samples is most commonly measured by the [[Dissociative Experiences Scale]]. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' considers symptoms such as [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]] and [[psychogenic amnesia]] to be core features of [[dissociative disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="DissociativeDisorders"&gt;[[Dissociative disorder|Dissociative Disorders ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition )]]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the normal population, dissociative experiences that are not clinically significant are highly prevalent with 60% to 65% of the respondents indicating that they have had some dissociative experiences.&lt;ref name=OccrRef04102007&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Waller |first1= NG |last2= Putnam |first2= FW |last3= Carlson |first3= EB | year = 1996 | title = Types of dissociation and dissociative types: A taxometric analysis of dissociative experiences | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 1 |issue= 3 | pages = 300â21 | url = http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-01-31 | doi = 10.1037/1082-989X.1.3.300 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080829105150/http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV#SCID-D|SCID-D]] is a structured interview used to assess and diagnose dissociation.

== Relation to trauma and abuse ==
Dissociation has been described as one of a constellation of symptoms experienced by some victims of multiple forms of childhood [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], including [[physical abuse|physical]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=salter&gt;{{cite book|title=Transforming Trauma: A Guide to Understanding and Treating Adult Survivors |first=Anna C. |last=Salter |first2=Hilary |last2= Eldridge |page=220 | year=1995 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn= 0-8039-5509-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |title=The APSAC Handbook on Child Maltreatment |edition= 2nd |first=John E.B. |last=Myers |page=63 |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2002 |isbn= 0-7619-1992-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by studies which suggest that dissociation is correlated with a history of trauma.&lt;ref name="pmid8659645"&gt;{{cite journal | author = van der Kolk, BA| title = Dissociation, somatization, and affect dysregulation: The complexity of adaptation of trauma | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 153 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 83â93 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8659645 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.153.7.83 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8659645 | accessdate = 2008-05-13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissociation appears to have a high [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] and a low [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] to having a self-reported history of trauma, which means that dissociation is much more common among those who are traumatized, yet at the same time there are many people who have suffered from trauma but who do not show dissociative symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Briere |first=J |title=Dissociative symptoms and trauma exposure: Specificity, affect dysregulation, and posttraumatic stress |journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders |volume=194 |issue=2 |pages=78â82 |year=2006 |pmid=16477184 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000198139.47371.54 |url=http://www.johnbriere.com/JNMD%2006%20paper.html |access-date=2008-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820094201/http://www.johnbriere.com/JNMD%2006%20paper.html |archive-date=2008-08-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult dissociation when combined with a history of [[child abuse]] and otherwise interpersonal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) has been shown to contribute to disturbances in parenting behavior, such as exposure of young children to violent media. Such behavior may contribute to cycles of familial violence and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Schechter |first1= DS |last2= Gross |first2= A |last3= Willheim |first3= E |last4= McCaw |first4= J |last5= Turner |first5= JB |last6= Myers |first6= MM |last7= Zeanah |first7= CH |last8= Gleason |first8= MM |authorlink1= Daniel Schechter |displayauthors= 4 |title= Is maternal PTSD associated with greater exposure of very young children to violent media? |journal= Journal of Traumatic Stress |year= 2009 |pages= 658â62 |pmid= 19924819 |pmc= 2798921 |doi= 10.1002/jts.20472 |volume=22|issue= 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of dissociation resulting from trauma may include [[depersonalization]], [[psychological numbing]], [[Apathy|disengagement]], or amnesia regarding the events of the abuse. It has been hypothesized that dissociation may provide a temporarily effective defense mechanism in cases of severe trauma; however, in the long term, dissociation is associated with decreased psychological functioning and adjustment.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;

Other symptoms sometimes found along with dissociation in victims of traumatic abuse (often referred to as "sequelae to abuse") include anxiety, PTSD, low [[self-esteem]], somatization, depression, chronic pain, interpersonal dysfunction, substance abuse, self-harm and suicidal ideation or actions.&lt;ref name=salter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;ref name=briere1992&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.johnbriere.com/methodological%20csa%20jccp%201992.pdf |title=Methodological issues in the study of sexual abuse effects |last=Briere |first=J |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |year=1992 |pages=196â203 |volume=60 |pmid=1592948 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.60.2.196 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911152635/http://www.johnbriere.com/methodological%20csa%20jccp%201992.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These symptoms may lead the victim to present the symptoms as the source of the problem.&lt;ref name=salter/&gt;

'''Drafting''' is the preliminary stage of a written work in which the author begins to develop a more cohesive product. A '''draft document''' is the product the writer creates in the initial stages of the [[writing process]].

In the drafting stage, the author:
* develops a more cohesive text
* organizes thoughts
* explains examples/ideas
* uncovers transitions
* discovers a central argument/point
* elaborates on key ideas

In a book that became popular in the 1950s, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', famed authors Strunk and White describe the first draft as being a less edited version of the final draft.  In their book, Strunk and White say, âthe first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.&lt;ref&gt;The Elements of Style Fiftieth Anniversary Edition (2009), p. 15, {{ISBN|978-0-205-63264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;â This shape is the draft that eventually becomes the finished work.

More recently, [[Peter Elbow]], in his book ''Writing Without Teachers'', presents a very different view of the drafting stage in the [[writing process]]. He describes his stance on the writing process, saying âWriting is a way to end up thinking something you couldnât have started out thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.15&lt;/ref&gt;â According to Elbow, the best way to accomplish this is a series of drafts which come together to produce an emerging âcenter of gravityâ that then translates into the main focus on the work. This process should be a holistic process, not a linear process. Elbowâs reasoning behind this concept of multiple drafts follows the idea that, âif he learns to maximize the interaction among his own ideas or points of view, he can produce new ones that didnât seem available to him.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;â

Whether being used as the creation of a less-edited final product (Strunk and White) or as a tool during the prewriting stage (Elbow), drafting is a necessary stage for the writer in the writing process.  Having created a draft, the author is then able to move onto the revision.

'''Ecology''' (from {{lang-el|Î¿á¼¶ÎºÎ¿Ï}}, "house", or "environment"; -Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±, "study of"){{Cref2|A}} is the branch of [[biology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ecology|title=the definition of ecology|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221095929/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ecology|archivedate=21 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which studies the interactions among organisms and their environment. Objects of study include interactions of [[organism]]s with each other and with [[abiotic component]]s of their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest include the [[biodiversity]], distribution, [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and [[population]]s of organisms, as well as cooperation and competition within and between [[species]]. [[Ecosystems]] are dynamically interacting systems of [[organisms]], the [[Community (ecology)|communities]] they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as [[primary production]], [[pedogenesis]], [[nutrient cycling]], and [[niche construction]], regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits. Biodiversity means the varieties of [[species]], [[gene]]s, and [[ecosystem]]s, enhances certain [[ecosystem services]].

Ecology is not synonymous with [[environmentalism]], natural history, or [[environmental science]]. It overlaps with the closely related sciences of [[evolutionary biology]], [[genetics]], and [[ethology]]. An important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. Ecologists seek to explain:

* Life processes, interactions, and [[adaptations]]
* The movement of materials and [[energy]] through living communities
* The [[ecological succession|successional]] development of ecosystems
* The [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and distribution of organisms and biodiversity in the context of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

Ecology has practical applications in [[conservation biology]], wetland management, [[natural resource management]] ([[agroecology]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[agroforestry]], [[fisheries]]), city planning ([[urban ecology]]), [[community health]], [[Ecological economics|economics]], [[basic science|basic]] and [[applied science]], and human social interaction ([[human ecology]]). For example, the ''[[Circles of Sustainability]]'' approach treats ecology as more than the environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms (including humans) and [[Resource (biology)|resources]] compose [[ecosystem]]s which, in turn, maintain [[Biophysics|biophysical]] feedback mechanisms that moderate processes  acting on living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[abiotic]]) components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and produce [[natural capital]] like  [[Biomass |biomass production]] (food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of [[climate]], global [[biogeochemical cycles]], [[water filtration]], [[soil formation]], erosion control, flood protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.

The word "ecology" ("Ãkologie") was coined in [[1866]] by the German scientist [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics.&lt;ref name="LaferriÃ¨reStoett2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric LaferriÃ¨re|author2=Peter J. Stoett|title=International Relations Theory and Ecological Thought: Towards a Synthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWtncHw7ErIC&amp;pg=PA25|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-71068-3|pages=25â|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624045150/https://books.google.com/books?id=HWtncHw7ErIC&amp;pg=PA25|archivedate=24 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] laid the foundations of ecology in their studies on [[natural history]]. Modern ecology became a much more rigorous [[natural sciences|science]] in the late 19th century. [[Evolution]]ary concepts relating to adaptation and [[natural selection]] became the cornerstones of modern [[Theoretical ecology|ecological theory]].

== Levels, scope, and scale of organization ==

The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., [[cell (biology)|cells]]) to a planetary scale (e.g., [[Earth's spheres|biosphere]]) [[phenomena]]. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic [[Resource (biology)|resources]] and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into [[population]]s which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain [[ecological succession|successional stages]] of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it.&lt;ref name="Stadler98"/&gt; Several generations of an [[aphid]] population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse [[bacteria]]l communities.&lt;ref name="Humphreys97"/&gt; The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole.&lt;ref name=Liere2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liere|first=Heidi|author2=Jackson, Doug|author3=Vandermeer, John|author4=Wilby, Andrew|title=Ecological Complexity in a Coffee Agroecosystem: Spatial Heterogeneity, Population Persistence and Biological Control|journal=PLoS ONE | date=20 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9 | pages=e45508 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045508|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...745508L |pmid=23029061|pmc=3447771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;

The main subdisciplines of ecology, [[population ecology|population]] (or [[community ecology|community]]) ecology and [[ecosystem ecology]], exhibit a difference not only of scale, but also of two contrasting paradigms in the field. The former focus on organisms distribution and abundance, while the later focus on materials and energy fluxes.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, S. T. A.; Kolasa, J.; Jones, C. G. (1994).

=== Hierarchy ===
{{See also|Biological organisation|Biological classification}}

{{quote box
| quote = System behaviors must first be arrayed into different levels of organization. Behaviors corresponding to higher levels occur at slow rates. Conversely, lower organizational levels exhibit rapid rates. For example, individual tree leaves respond rapidly to momentary changes in light intensity, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, and the like. The growth of the tree responds more slowly and integrates these short-term changes.| source = O'Neill et al. (1986)&lt;ref name="O'Neill86" /&gt;{{Rp|76}}| width = 25%| align = right}}

The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating on a single tree, while at the same time remain open with regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify [[ecosystems]] hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, [[landscape]], and chronological scales.

To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the biological world is organized into a [[Biological organisation|nested hierarchy]], ranging in scale from [[gene]]s, to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, to [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], to [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], to [[organism]]s, to [[species]], to [[population ecology|population]]s, to [[Community (ecology)|communities]], to [[ecosystem]]s, to [[biome]]s, and up to the level of the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name="Nachtomy01"/&gt; This framework forms a [[panarchy]]&lt;ref name="Holling01"/&gt; and exhibits [[non-linear]] behaviors; this means that "effect and cause are disproportionate, so that small changes to critical variables, such as the number of [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixers]], can lead to disproportionate, perhaps irreversible, changes in the system properties."&lt;ref name="Levin99"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== Biodiversity ===
{{main|Biodiversity}}
{{quote box
| quote = Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes. It includes the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, the communities and ecosystems in which they occur, and the ecological and [[evolution]]ary processes that keep them functioning, yet ever changing and adapting.| source= Noss &amp; Carpenter (1994)&lt;ref name="Noss94"/&gt;{{Rp|5}}| width = 25%| align = right}}

Biodiversity (an abbreviation of "biological diversity") describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, and there are many ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization.&lt;ref name="Noss90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholes08"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cardinale2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cardinale|first=Bradley J.|author2=Duffy, J.

=== Habitat ===
{{Main|Habitat}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Biodiversity of a [[coral reef]]. [[Coral]]s adapt to and modify their environment by forming [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons. This provides growing conditions for future generations and forms a habitat for many other species.&lt;ref name="Kiessling09" /&gt;]]
[[File:Long-tailed Broadbill (Psarisomus dalhousiae).jpg|thumb|[[Long-tailed broadbill]] building its [[Bird nest|nest]]]]
The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73"/&gt; More specifically, "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal."&lt;ref name="Beyer10"/&gt;{{Rp|745}} For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a [[Montane ecosystem|montane]] or [[alpine tundra|alpine]] ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population of a species of tropical lizards (''Tropidurus hispidus'') has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental [[life history theory|life history]] of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. [[Biotope]] and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schoener75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vitt97"/&gt;

=== Niche ===
{{Main|Ecological niche}}

[[File:Termite mound-Tanzania.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Termite]] mounds with varied heights of chimneys regulate gas exchange, temperature and other environmental parameters that are needed to sustain the internal physiology of the entire colony.&lt;ref name="Laland99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes08"/&gt;]]

Definitions of the niche date back to 1917,&lt;ref name="Wiens05"/&gt; but [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] made conceptual advances in 1957&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57b"/&gt; by introducing a widely adopted definition:  "the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes."&lt;ref name="Wiens05" /&gt;{{Rp|519}} The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the ''fundamental'' and the ''realized'' niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists.&lt;ref name="Wiens05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson57b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Begon05"/&gt; The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a "[[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[N-dimensional space|hyperspace]] whose ''dimensions'' are defined as environmental variables and whose ''size'' is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has ''positive fitness''."&lt;ref name="Hardesty75"/&gt;{{rp|71}}

[[Biogeography|Biogeographical]] patterns and [[Range (biology)|range]] distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species' [[trait (biology)|traits]] and niche requirements.&lt;ref name="Pearman08"/&gt; Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, [[phenotype]], or [[Phenotypic trait|characteristic]] of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt; Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The [[competitive exclusion principle]] states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting [[Resource (biology)|resource]]; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements.&lt;ref name="Hardin60"/&gt; Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities.&lt;ref name="Scheffer06"/&gt; The habitat plus the niche is called the [[ecotope]], which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.&lt;ref name="Whittaker73" /&gt;

===Niche construction===
{{Main|Niche construction}}
{{See also|Ecosystem engineering}}

Organisms are subject to environmental pressures, but they also modify their habitats. The [[negative feedback|regulatory feedback]] between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local (e.g., a [[beaver]] [[pond]]) to global scales, over time and even after death, such as decaying logs or [[silica]] skeleton deposits from marine organisms.&lt;ref name="Hastings07"/&gt; The process and concept of [[ecosystem engineering]] is related to [[niche construction]], but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as: "organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats."&lt;ref name="Jones94"/&gt;{{Rp|373}}

The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term "niche construction" is more often used in reference to the under-appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche.&lt;ref name="Laland99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Write06"/&gt; An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of [[social insects]], including ants, bees, wasps, and termites. There is an emergent [[homeostasis]] or [[homeorhesis]] in the structure of the nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes08"/&gt;

=== Biome ===
{{main|Biome}}

Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation.&lt;ref name="Palmer94"/&gt; There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include [[tropical rainforest]], [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]], [[temperate deciduous forest]], [[taiga]], [[tundra]], [[hot desert]], and [[polar desert]].&lt;ref name="Prentice92"/&gt; Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic [[microbiome]]s. To a [[microorganism|microbe]], the human body is a habitat and a landscape.&lt;ref name="Turnbaugh07"/&gt; Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in [[molecular genetics]], which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays a significant role in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.&lt;ref name="DeLong09"/&gt;

=== Biosphere ===
{{main|Biosphere}}
{{See also|Earth's spheres}}
The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. [[Ecological relationship]]s regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals.&lt;ref name="igamberdiev06"/&gt; Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the [[Gaia hypothesis]] is an example of [[holism]] applied in ecological theory.&lt;ref name="Lovelock73"/&gt; The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent [[feedback loop]] generated by the [[metabolic theory of ecology|metabolism]] of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.&lt;ref name="Lovelock03"/&gt;

=== Population ecology ===
{{Main|Population ecology}}
{{See also|Lists of organisms by population}}

Population ecology studies the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; A population consists of individuals of the same species that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.&lt;ref name="Waples06"/&gt;

A primary law of population ecology is the [[Malthusian growth model]]&lt;ref name="Turchin01"/&gt; which states, "a population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant."&lt;ref name="Turchin01" /&gt;{{Rp|18}} Simplified population [[Scientific modelling|models]] usually start with four variables: death, birth, [[immigration]], and [[emigration]].

An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population, such as on an island, where immigration and emigration does not take place. Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that [[random]] processes create the observed data. In these island models, the rate of population change is described by:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}N}{\operatorname{d}T} = bN - dN = (b - d)N = rN, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the population, ''b'' and ''d'' are the per capita rates of birth and death respectively, and ''r'' is the per capita rate of population change.&lt;ref name="Turchin01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandermeer03"/&gt;

Using these modelling techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was later transformed into a model known as the [[Law of population growth|logistic equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dT} = aN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of individuals measured as [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] density, ''a'' is the maximum per-capita rate of change, and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the population. The formula states that the rate of change in population size (''dN/dT'') is equal to growth (''aN'') that is limited by carrying capacity (1&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''N''/''K'').

Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data include [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[fecundity]], and survivorship, and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]]. The information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas.&lt;ref name="Vandermeer03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berryman92"/&gt; In cases where basic models are insufficient, ecologists may adopt different kinds of statistical methods, such as the [[Akaike information criterion]],&lt;ref name="Anderson00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Anderson | first1=D.

=== Metapopulations and migration ===
{{Main|Metapopulation}}
{{See also|Animal migration}}
The concept of metapopulations was defined in 1969&lt;ref name="Levins69"/&gt; as "a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize".&lt;ref name="Levins70"/&gt;{{Rp|105}} Metapopulation ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in [[conservation biology|conservation research]].&lt;ref name="Smith05"/&gt; Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality,&lt;ref name="Hanski98"/&gt; and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat.&lt;ref name="Nebel10"/&gt; Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration; because, it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.&lt;ref name="Clark98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dingle96"/&gt;

In metapopulation terminology, migrating individuals are classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of [[Juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and [[field study|field studies]] to explain metapopulation structure.&lt;ref name="Hanski04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKenzie06"/&gt;

=== Community ecology ===

Community ecology is the study of the interactions among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure [[species diversity]] in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.

[[File:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA) is an example of [[ecosystem ecology]]]]

Ecosystems may be habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes. Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials (e.g. carbon, phosphorus) between different pools (e.g., tree biomass, soil organic material). Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine the underlying causes of these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure [[primary production]] (g C/m^2) in a [[wetland]] in relation to decomposition and consumption rates (g C/m^2/y). This requires an understanding of the community connections between plants (i.e., primary producers) and the decomposers (e.g., [[fungi]] and bacteria),&lt;ref name="Brinson81"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Brinson| first1 = M.

The underlying concept of ecosystem can be traced back to 1864 in the published work of [[George Perkins Marsh]] ("Man and Nature").&lt;ref name="Marsh64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Neil01"/&gt; Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted.&lt;ref name="Tansley35"/&gt; Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space.&lt;ref name="Levin98"/&gt; Ecosystems are broadly categorized as [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]], [[Freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]], atmospheric, or [[Marine ecosystem|marine]]. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are [[technoecosystems]], which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;

=== Food webs ===
{{Main|Food web}}
{{See also|Food chain}}

[[File:Chesapeake Waterbird Food Web.jpg|thumb|right|Generalized food web of waterbirds from [[Chesapeake Bay]]]]

A food web is the archetypal [[ecological network]]. Plants capture [[solar energy]] and use it to synthesize [[simple sugars]] during [[photosynthesis]]. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing [[herbivores]], and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal [[trophic species]] to a top consumer is called the [[food chain]]. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of [[concept map]] or a [[heuristic]] device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.&lt;ref name="O'Neill86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimm02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimm91"/&gt;

Food webs are often limited relative to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web [[Microcosm (experimental ecosystem)|microcosm]] studies are extrapolated to larger systems.&lt;ref name="Worm03"/&gt; Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult to decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web.&lt;ref name="McCann07"/&gt; Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Wilbur97"/&gt;

Food webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., [[omnivores]]) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., [[predator|primary predators]]). Theoretical and empirical studies identify [[Random#In biology|non-random]] emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time.&lt;ref name="Emmerson"/&gt; Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability.&lt;ref name="Kraus03"/&gt; Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.&lt;ref name="Pimm91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Egerton07b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shurin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards83"/&gt;

=== Trophic levels ===
{{Main|Trophic level}}

[[File:TrophicWeb.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.05|A trophic pyramid (a) and a food-web (b) illustrating [[ecological relationship]]s among creatures that are typical of a northern [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] terrestrial ecosystem. The trophic pyramid roughly represents the biomass (usually measured as total dry-weight) at each level. Plants generally have the greatest biomass. Names of trophic categories are shown to the right of the pyramid. Some ecosystems, such as many wetlands, do not organize as a strict pyramid, because aquatic plants are not as productive as long-lived terrestrial plants such as trees. Ecological trophic pyramids are typically one of three kinds: 1) pyramid of numbers, 2) pyramid of biomass, or 3) pyramid of energy.&lt;ref name="Odum05"/&gt;{{rp|598}}]]

A trophic level (from Greek ''troph'', ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ®, trophÄ, meaning "food" or "feeding") is "a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the lower adjacent level (according to [[ecological pyramid]]s) nearer the abiotic source."&lt;ref name="Hariston93"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or [[trophism]] among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids, in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators, and the horizontal dimension represents the [[Relative species abundance|abundance]] or biomass at each level.&lt;ref name="Duffy07"/&gt; When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level, they naturally sort into a 'pyramid of numbers'.&lt;ref name="Elton27" /&gt;

Species are broadly categorized as [[autotrophs]] (or [[primary producers]]), [[heterotrophs]] (or [[consumer]]s), and [[Detritivore]]s (or [[decomposers]]). Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or [[chemosynthesis]]. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production).&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including [[primary consumers]] (strict herbivores), [[Trophic dynamics|secondary consumers]] ([[carnivorous]] predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators).&lt;ref name="David03"/&gt; Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.&lt;ref name="Oksanen91"/&gt;

Trophic levels are part of the [[holistic]] or [[complex systems]] view of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Loehle88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulanowicz79"/&gt; Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic view of the system.&lt;ref name="Li00"/&gt; While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to "reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete, homogeneous trophic levels is fiction."&lt;ref name="Polis96"/&gt;{{rp|815}} Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist, but "above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores."&lt;ref name="Thompson07"/&gt;{{rp|612}}

=== Keystone species ===
{{main|Keystone species}}
[[File:Sea otters holding hands, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Sea otter]]s, an example of a keystone species]]
A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the [[food-web]]. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.&lt;ref name="Fisher06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Libralato06"/&gt;

[[Sea otter]]s (''Enhydra lutris'') are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of [[sea urchins]] that feed on [[kelp]]. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure.&lt;ref name="Mills93"/&gt; Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'').&lt;ref name="Anderson95"/&gt; While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a [[Conservation biology|conservation]] tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.&lt;ref name="Mills93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polis00"/&gt;

== Ecological complexity ==
{{Main|Complexity}}
{{See also|Emergence}}

Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This [[biocomplexity]] stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as transitional areas or [[ecotones]] spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy, and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. "What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one."&lt;ref name="Novikoff45"/&gt;{{rp|209}} Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena, otherwise captured in the expression (coined by Aristotle) 'the sum is greater than the parts'.&lt;ref name="Schneider01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Molnar04"/&gt;{{Cref2|E}}

"Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric."&lt;ref name="Loehle04"/&gt;{{rp|3}} From these principles, ecologists have identified [[emergence|emergent]] and [[Self-organization#Self-organization in biology|self-organizing]] phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence, ranging from molecular to planetary, and these require different explanations at each integrative level.&lt;ref name="Lovelock03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum1977"/&gt; Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random fluctuations of history.&lt;ref name="Holling01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter01"/&gt; Long-term ecological studies provide important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales. These studies are managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network (LTER).&lt;ref name="urlWelcome to ILTER â ILTER"/&gt; The longest experiment in existence is the [[Park Grass Experiment]], which was initiated in 1856.&lt;ref name="Siverton06"/&gt; Another example is the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest|Hubbard Brook study]], which has been in operation since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbardbrook.org/ |title=Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study Front Page |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324131250/http://www.hubbardbrook.org/ |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holism ===
{{Main|Holism}}

Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies. Holism addresses the [[Biological organisation|biological organization]] of life that [[Systems biology|self-organizes]] into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non-reducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system, such as an [[ecosystem]], cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts.&lt;ref name="Liu09"/&gt; "New properties emerge because the components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is changed."&lt;ref name="Odum05"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to [[reductionistic]].&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikkelson10"/&gt; Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system, which leads to 3) a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from [[mysticism]] that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the [[biomolecular]] properties of the exterior shells.&lt;ref name="Wilson88"/&gt;

== Relation to evolution ==
{{main|Evolutionary ecology}}

Ecology and evolutionary biology are considered sister disciplines of the life sciences. [[Natural selection]], [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[Developmental biology|development]], [[adaptation]], [[populations]], and [[heredity|inheritance]] are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as [[phylogenetics]] or the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system of taxonomy]].&lt;ref name="Miles93"/&gt; The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal ''[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="TREE"&gt;{{cite web | editor-last=Craze | editor-first=P. | title=Trends in Ecology and Evolution | publisher=Cell Press, Elsevier, Inc | url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/home | date=2 August 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724103422/http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/home | archivedate=24 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock03" /&gt; While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes,&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt; and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Yoshida | first=T | title=Rapid evolution drives ecological dynamics in a predatorâprey system | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6946/abs/nature01767.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015001148/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6946/abs/nature01767.html | archivedate=15 October 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioural ecology ===
{{Main|Behavioural ecology}}

[[File:Chameleon spectra.jpg|left|upright=1.45|thumb|Social display and colour variation in differently adapted species of [[chameleons]] (''Bradypodion'' spp.). Chameleons change their skin colour to match their background as a behavioural defence mechanism and also use colour to communicate with other members of their species, such as dominant (left) versus submissive (right) patterns shown in the three species (A-C) above.&lt;ref name="Stuart-Fox08"/&gt;]]

All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, including memory and communication.&lt;ref name="Karban08"/&gt; Behavioural ecology is the study of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile [[sperm]] of plants, mobile [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]] swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by [[weevils]], the mating dance of a [[salamander]], or social gatherings of [[amoeba]].&lt;ref name="Tinbergen63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamner85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strassmann00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakurai85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson61"/&gt;

Predator-prey interactions are an introductory concept into food-web studies as well as behavioural ecology.&lt;ref name="Ives04"/&gt; Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency.&lt;ref name="Begon05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krebs93"/&gt; For example, "[t]he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk"&lt;ref name="Webb10"/&gt; or "[t]he optimal [[Escape distance|flight initiation distance]] occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk."&lt;ref name="Cooper10"/&gt;

Elaborate sexual [[display (zoology)|displays]] and posturing are encountered in the behavioural ecology of animals. The [[birds-of-paradise]], for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during [[courtship]]. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays are driven by [[sexual selection]] as an advertisement of quality of traits among [[suitors]].&lt;ref name="Kodric-Brown84"/&gt;

=== Cognitive ecology ===

Cognitive ecology integrates theory and observations from [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[neurobiology]], primarily [[cognitive science]], in order to understand the effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive systems and how those systems restrict behavior within an ecological and evolutionary framework.&lt;ref name=Palacios&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biology Research |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=95â99 |year=2003 |title=An "enactive" approach to integrative and comparative biology: Thoughts on the table |author=Adrian G Palacios, Francisco Bozinovic |url=http://www.bio.puc.cl/caseb/casebpdf/P,%20y%20Bozinovic1.pdf |doi=10.4067/S0716-97602003000100008 |pmid=12795209 |last2=Bozinovic |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623182048/http://www.bio.puc.cl/caseb/casebpdf/P,%20y%20Bozinovic1.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Until recently, however, cognitive scientists have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive traits evolved under particular natural settings.

&lt;/ref&gt; As a study involving the 'coupling' or interactions between organism and environment, cognitive ecology is closely related to [[enactivism]],&lt;ref name=Palacios/&gt; a field based upon the view that "...we must see the organism and environment as bound together in reciprocal specification and selection...".&lt;ref name=Varela&gt;

=== Social ecology ===
{{main|Social ecology (academic field)}}

Social ecological behaviours are notable in the [[social insects]], [[slime moulds]], [[social spider]]s, [[human society]], and [[naked mole-rat]]s where [[eusocialism]] has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates&lt;ref name="Strassmann00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman95"/&gt; and evolve from kin and group selection. [[Kin selection]] explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s are most famously studied for this type of relationship because the male drones are [[Cloning|clones]] that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; In contrast, [[group selection]]ists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members survive better than groups with predominantly selfish members.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson07"/&gt;

=== Coevolution ===
{{main|Coevolution}}
[[File:Bombus 6867.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bumblebee]]s and the [[flower]]s they [[pollination|pollinate]] have coevolved so that both have become dependent on each other for survival.]]
[[File:Parasitismus.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Parasitism:''' A harvestman [[arachnid]] being parasitized by [[mite]]s. The harvestman is being consumed, while the mites benefit from traveling on and feeding off of their host.]]

Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a [[host (biology)|host]] and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate.&lt;ref name="Page91"/&gt; Relationships [[Interspecific interaction|within a species]] that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called [[mutualisms]]. Examples of mutualism include [[fungus-growing ants]] employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the [[fig wasp]] and [[yucca moth]] pollination complex, [[lichen]]s with fungi and photosynthetic [[algae]], and [[coral]]s with photosynthetic algae.&lt;ref name="Herre99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert90"/&gt; If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called [[symbiosis]]. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with [[arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for [[nutrients|mineral nutrients]].&lt;ref name="Kiers06"/&gt;

Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example, trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called [[commensalism]]; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain | first1=B. R.|year=1985|title=Physiological and ecological controls on carbon sequestering in terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=219â232|doi=10.1007/BF02187200}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called [[parasitism]]. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or [[propagule]]s, denying the services of a beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast.&lt;ref name="Bronstein01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irwin10"/&gt; Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The [[Red Queen Hypothesis]], for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.&lt;ref name="Boucher82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="King09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=King | first1=K.

=== Biogeography ===
{{Main|Biogeography}}

Biogeography (an amalgamation of ''biology'' and ''geography'') is the comparative study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time.&lt;ref name="Parenti90"/&gt; The ''[[Journal of Biogeography]]'' was established in 1974.&lt;ref name="JBiog"&gt;{{cite web | title = Journal of Biogeography - Overview | publisher = Wiley | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2699/homepage/ProductInformation.html | accessdate = 16 March 2018 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130209095040/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2699/homepage/ProductInformation.html | archivedate = 9 February 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, [[Island biogeography|the theory of island biogeography]], published by the Robert MacArthur and [[Edward O. Wilson]] in 1967&lt;ref name="MacArthur67" /&gt; is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory.&lt;ref name="Wiens04"/&gt;

Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies.&lt;ref name="Parenti90" /&gt; Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as [[Animal migration|migration]] and [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]].&lt;ref name="Wiens04" /&gt; and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called [[Allopatric speciation|vicariance biogeography]] and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography.&lt;ref name="Morrone95"/&gt; There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Svennin08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LandhÃ¤usser09"/&gt;

==== r/K selection theory ====
{{Main|r/K selection theory}}

A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory,{{Cref2|D}} one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain [[Life history theory|life-history evolution]]. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to [[population densities|population density]]. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for rapid population growth. These early phases of [[population growth]] experience ''density-independent'' forces of natural selection, which is called ''r''-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called ''K''-selection.&lt;ref name="Reznick02"/&gt;

In the ''r/K''-selection model, the first variable ''r'' is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable ''K'' is the carrying capacity of a population.&lt;ref name="Begon05" /&gt; Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An ''r''-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of [[fecundity]] in ''r''-selected species. Many kinds of insects and [[invasive species]] exhibit ''r''-selected [[Phenotypic trait|characteristics]]. In contrast, a ''K''-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting ''K''-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.&lt;ref name="MacArthur67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pianka72"/&gt;

=== Molecular ecology ===
{{Main|Molecular ecology}}

The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]]. The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication ''[[Molecular Ecology]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref name="MolEcol"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Molecular Ecology | editor-last=Rieseberg | editor-first= L. | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/(ISSN)1365-294X | journal = Molecular Ecology }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molecular ecology]] uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, [[John Avise]] also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, ''Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution''.&lt;ref name="Avise94"/&gt; Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and [[nematode]]s. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology.&lt;ref name="Avise94"/&gt; For example, molecular ecology revealed [[promiscuous]] sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in [[tree swallow]]s previously thought to be socially [[monogamous]].&lt;ref name="Obryan07"/&gt; In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called [[phylogeography]].&lt;ref name="Avise00"/&gt;

Ecology is as much a biological science as it is a human science.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Human ecology is an [[interdisciplinary]] investigation into the ecology of our species. "Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three."&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross04"/&gt;

The ecological complexities human beings are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the [[Anthropocene]]. The unique set of circumstances has generated the need for a new unifying science called [[coupled human and natural systems]] that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology.&lt;ref name="Liu09" /&gt; Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in [[social capital|social]]-[[natural capital]], which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from [[ecosystem services|ecosystem goods and services]]. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.&lt;ref name="Liu09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MEA05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="de Groot02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aguirre09"/&gt;

Ecology is an employed science of restoration, repairing disturbed sites through human intervention, in natural resource management, and in [[environmental impact assessment]]s. Edward O. Wilson predicted in 1992 that the 21st century "will be the era of restoration in ecology".&lt;ref name="Wilson92"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Wilson | first1=E.

== Relation to the environment ==
{{main|Natural environment}}

The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes. It is dynamically interlinked, and contains [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason57"/&gt; Like ecology, the term environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of nature. Environment "includes the physical world, the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation."&lt;ref name="Kleese01"/&gt;{{Rp|62}} The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation, including [[abiotic]] factors such as temperature, radiation, light, chemistry, [[climate]] and geology. The biotic environment includes genes, cells, organisms, members of the same species ([[conspecific]]s) and other species that share a habitat.&lt;ref name="Campbell06"/&gt;

The distinction between external and internal environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life. The laws of [[thermodynamics]], for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated [[materialism|material]] parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or ''holocoenotic'' system as it was once called. This is known as the [[dialectical]] approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or [[umwelt]]). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Levins80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

=== Disturbance and resilience ===
{{Main|Resilience (ecology)}}

Ecosystems are regularly confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances over time and geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation.&lt;ref name="Hughes10"/&gt; Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods,&lt;ref name="Levin92"/&gt; and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity.&lt;ref name="Hughes10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling73" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Folke04"/&gt; Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting as a kind of regenerative insurance.&lt;ref name="Folke04"/&gt;

=== Metabolism and the early atmosphere ===

{{quote box
| quote = Metabolism â the rate at which energy and material resources are taken up from the environment, transformed within an organism, and allocated to maintenance, growth and reproduction â is a fundamental physiological trait.

}}

The Earth was formed approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="AllÃ¨gre95"/&gt; As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by [[hydrogen]] to one composed mostly of [[methane]] and [[ammonia]]. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture of [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of [[Redox|reducing and oxidizing]] gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.&lt;ref name="Wills01"/&gt;

[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|left|thumb|The [[leaf]] is the primary site of [[photosynthesis]] in most plants.]]

Throughout history, the Earth's atmosphere and [[biogeochemical cycles]] have been in a [[dynamic equilibrium]] with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability.&lt;ref name="Goldblatt06"/&gt; The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic [[methanogen]] microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; â CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). [[Anoxygenic photosynthesis]] reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting [[hydrogen sulfide]] into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + h''v'' â CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S). Early forms of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the ''[[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation]]'') did not begin until approximately 2.4â2.3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1&amp;nbsp;billion years prior.&lt;ref name="Goldblatt06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Catling05"/&gt;

=== Radiation: heat, temperature and light ===
{{Anchor|Sunlight}}&lt;!-- E.g. in [[Neritic zone]] --&gt;
The biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures. Heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and [[primary production]]. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of [[solar radiation]]. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of [[temperature]] greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of [[biodiversity]] and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. [[Poikilotherms]], for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, [[homeotherms]] regulate their internal body temperature by expending [[food energy|metabolic energy]].&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

There is a relationship between light, primary production, and ecological [[energy budget]]s. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of [[electromagnetic energy]] of different [[wavelength]]s. [[Radiant energy]] from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts as a catalyst for [[genetic mutation]].&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt; Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through [[photosynthesis]]. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] are [[autotrophs]]. Autotrophs â responsible for primary production â assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as [[potential energy]] in the form of biochemical [[Enthalpy|enthalpic]] bonds.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt;

Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] (an environment with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration below 2&amp;nbsp;mg/liter) and eventually completely [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] where [[anaerobic bacteria]] thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral composition]] of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles.&lt;ref name="Cronk01"/&gt; Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces ([[aerenchyma]]) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants ([[halophytes]]) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and [[osmoregulation|osmoregulating]] their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in [[Estuary|estuarine]], [[brackish]], or [[ocean]]ic environments. Anaerobic soil [[microorganism]]s in aquatic environments use [[nitrate]], [[Manganese|manganese ions]], [[ferric|ferric ions]], [[sulfate]], [[carbon dioxide]], and some [[organic compounds]]; other microorganisms are [[facultative anaerobes]] and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the [[Reduction potential|oxidation-reduction]] potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) by methanogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name="Cronk01"/&gt; The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form [[electrochemical gradient]]s that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.&lt;ref name="Evans99"/&gt;

==== Gravity ====

The shape and energy of the land is significantly affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of [[tectonic plates]] as well as influencing [[geomorphic]] processes such as [[orogeny]] and [[erosion]]. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth ([[gravitropism]]), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the [[biomechanics]] and size of animals.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves.&lt;ref name="Swenson08"/&gt; The [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular systems]] of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).&lt;ref name="Garnter10"/&gt;

==== Pressure ====

Climatic and [[osmotic pressure]] places [[physiological]] constraints on organisms, especially those that fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths.&lt;ref name="Neri" /&gt; These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen08"/&gt; [[Xylem|Water transportation]] by plants is another important [[ecophysiology|ecophysiological]] process affected by osmotic pressure gradients.&lt;ref name="Strook08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pockman95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmermann02"/&gt; [[Fluid pressure|Water pressure]] in the depths of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as [[whale]]s, [[dolphin|dolphins,]] and [[seal (animal)|seals]] are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences.&lt;ref name="Kastak98"/&gt; Differences between [[hagfish]] species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.&lt;ref name="Nishiguchi10"/&gt;

==== Wind and turbulence ====

[[File:Grassflowers.jpg|thumb|The architecture of the [[inflorescence]] in grasses is subject to the physical pressures of wind and shaped by the forces of natural selection facilitating wind-pollination ([[anemophily]]).&lt;ref name="Friedman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harder09"/&gt;]]

[[Turbulent forces]] in air and water affect the environment and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global [[trade winds]]. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt; For example, wind running over the surface of a lake creates turbulence, mixing the [[water column]] and influencing the environmental profile to create [[thermally layered zones]], affecting how fish, algae, and other parts of the [[aquatic ecosystem]] are structured.&lt;ref name="Shimeta95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Etemad01"/&gt; Wind speed and turbulence also influence [[evapotranspiration rates]] and energy budgets in plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Cronk01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf96"/&gt; Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the [[westerlies]] come into contact with the [[coastal]] and interior mountains of western North America to produce a [[rain shadow]] on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called [[orographic lift]] and can cause precipitation.{{clarify|this sounds as if the rain would fall on the leeward side of the mountains, which can't be right|date=August 2012}} This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the [[xeric]] ecosystems (e.g., of the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]] in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.&lt;ref name="Daubenmire75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele05"/&gt;

Plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere. By approximately 350 million years ago (the end of the [[Devonian period]]), photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17%, which allowed combustion to occur.&lt;ref name="Lenton00"/&gt; Fire releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression.&lt;ref name="Lobert93"/&gt; While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time,&lt;ref name="Garren43"/&gt; [[Charles F. Cooper (ecologist)|Charles Cooper]] brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Cooper60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper61"/&gt;

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native North Americans]] were among the first to influence fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials.&lt;ref name="Wagtendonk07"/&gt; Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment.&lt;ref name="Boerner82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goubitz03"/&gt; Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'') cannot [[germination|germinate]] until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called [[serotiny]].&lt;ref name="Neeman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flematti04"/&gt; Fire plays a major role in the persistence and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Holling73"/&gt;

==== Soils ====
{{main|Soil ecology}}

Soil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the surface of the planet. It is the chief organizing centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The [[decomposition]] of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing [[minerals]] and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the [[pedosphere]] where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the [[detritivore]]s that regulate soil formation.&lt;ref name="Coleman04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson09"/&gt; Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called [[bioturbation]]. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil [[microorganisms]] are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils.&lt;ref name="Phillips09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Phillips | first1=J.

Other events, such as the [[Tree#Evolutionary history|evolution of trees]] and the [[Evolutionary history of life#Colonization of land|colonization of land]] in the Devonian period played a significant role in the early development of ecological trophism in soils.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davic04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasiotis03"/&gt;

==== Biogeochemistry and climate ====
{{Main|Biogeochemistry}}
{{See also|Nutrient cycle|Climate}}

Ecologists study and measure nutrient budgets to understand how these materials are regulated, flow, and [[recycling (ecological)|recycled]] through the environment.&lt;ref name="Allee49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricklefs96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormondy95"/&gt; This research has led to an understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements ([[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[sulfur]], and [[phosphorus]]; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.&lt;ref name="Falkowoski08"/&gt;

The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year.&lt;ref name="Grace04"/&gt; There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic [[outgassing]], the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref name="Pearson00"/&gt;

In the [[Oligocene]], from twenty-five to thirty-two million years ago, there was another significant restructuring of the global [[carbon cycle]] as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations below 550 ppm.&lt;ref name="Pagani05"/&gt; The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, [[biodiversity loss]], agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of [[permafrost]] are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the context of the global carbon cycle, because methane is a [[greenhouse gas]] that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a 100-year time scale.&lt;ref name="Zhuan07"/&gt; Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref name="Liu09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Erwin09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Erwin | first1=D.

Ecology has a complex origin, due in large part to its interdisciplinary nature.&lt;ref name="Egerton01"/&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] were among the first to record observations on natural history. However, they viewed life in terms of [[essentialism]], where species were conceptualized as static unchanging things while varieties were seen as aberrations of an [[Idealism|idealized type]]. This contrasts against the modern understanding of [[Theoretical ecology|ecological theory]] where varieties are viewed as the real phenomena of interest and having a role in the origins of adaptations by means of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benson00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sober80"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sober | first1=E. | title=Evolution, population thinking, and essentialism | journal=Philosophy of Science | volume=47 | issue=3 | pages=350â383 | jstor=186950 | doi=10.1086/288942| year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early conceptions of ecology, such as a balance and regulation in nature can be traced to [[Herodotus]] (died ''c''. 425 BC), who described one of the earliest accounts of [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] in his observation of "natural dentistry". Basking [[Nile crocodile]]s, he noted, would open their mouths to give [[sandpiper]]s safe access to pluck [[leech]]es out, giving nutrition to the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the crocodile.&lt;ref name="Egerton01" /&gt; Aristotle was an early influence on the philosophical development of ecology. He and his student [[Theophrastus]] made extensive observations on plant and animal migrations, biogeography, physiology, and on their behaviour, giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an ecological niche.&lt;ref name="Hughes85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes75"/&gt;

Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and productivity were first developed in the 1700s, through the published works of microscopist [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632â1723) and botanist [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] (1688?â1732).&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; Biogeographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769â1859) was an early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize ecological gradients, where species are replaced or altered in form along [[environmental gradient]]s, such as a [[cline (biology)|cline]] forming along a rise in elevation. Humboldt drew inspiration from [[Isaac Newton]] as he developed a form of "terrestrial physics". In Newtonian fashion, he brought a scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the foundation of a modern ecological law on species-to-area relationships.&lt;ref name="Kingsland04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkins01"/&gt;  Natural historians, such as Humboldt, [[James Hutton]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (among others) laid the foundations of the modern ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="McIntosh85"&gt;{{cite book | last1=McIntosh | first1=R.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] indepedently introduced the term a year later, in his book ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'' (1866). Haeckel was a zoologist, artist, writer, and later in life a professor of comparative anatomy.&lt;ref name="Stauffer57"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friederichs58"/&gt;

Opinions differ on who was the founder of modern ecological theory. Some mark Haeckel's definition as the beginning;&lt;ref name="Hinchman07"/&gt; others say it was [[Eugenius Warming]] with the writing of [[Plantesamfund|Oecology of Plants: An Introduction to the Study of Plant Communities]] (1895),&lt;ref name="Goodland75"/&gt; or [[Carl Linnaeus]]' principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="Egerton07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kormandy78"/&gt; Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature.&lt;ref name="Egerton07"/&gt; His works influenced Charles Darwin, who adopted Linnaeus' phrase on the ''economy or polity of nature'' in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Stauffer57" /&gt; Linnaeus was the first to frame the [[balance of nature]] as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel, who admired Darwin's work, defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature, which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous.&lt;ref name="Kormandy78" /&gt;

[[File:Darwin EcoExperiment.JPG|thumb|The layout of the first ecological experiment, carried out in a grass garden at [[Woburn Abbey]] in 1816, was noted by Charles Darwin in ''The Origin of Species''. The experiment studied the performance of different mixtures of species planted in different kinds of soils.&lt;ref name="Hector02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinclair26" /&gt;]]

From Aristotle until Darwin, the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging. Prior to ''The Origin of Species'', there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment.&lt;ref name="Benson00"/&gt; An exception is the 1789 publication ''Natural History of Selborne'' by [[Gilbert White]] (1720â1793), considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology.&lt;ref name="May99"/&gt; While [[Charles Darwin]] is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution,&lt;ref name=Darwin/&gt; he was one of the founders of [[soil ecology]],&lt;ref name="Meysman06"/&gt; and he made note of the first ecological experiment in ''The Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name="Hector02"/&gt; Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="Acot97"/&gt;

=== Since 1900 ===
Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end of the 19th century (around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest). The scientist [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] may have first introduced the term "[[oekology]]" (which eventually morphed into [[home economics]]) in the U.S. as early 1892.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Caroline Louisa | title = The life of Ellen H. Richards | publisher = [[Whitcomb &amp; Barrows]] | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1912 | isbn = | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofellenhrich00huntrich }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, ecology transitioned from a more [[metaphysics|descriptive form]] of [[natural history]] to a more [[scientific method|analytical form]] of ''scientific natural history''.&lt;ref name="Kingsland04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McIntosh85" /&gt; [[Frederic Clements]] published the first American ecology book in 1905,&lt;ref name="Clements05"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Clements | first1=F.

This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of [[seral development]] that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by [[Henry Gleason]],&lt;ref name="Simberloff80"/&gt; who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community associations.&lt;ref name="Gleason26"/&gt;

The Clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an [[idealism|idealistic form]] of holism.&lt;ref name="Levins80"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levins |first1=R. |last2=Lewontin |first2=R. |title=Dialectics and reductionism in ecology |journal=Synthese |volume=43 |pages=47â78 |year=1980 |url=http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/comunidades/pdf/pdf%20curso%20posgrado%20Elena/Tema%201/LevinsLewontinSynthese1980.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf00413856 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510183920/http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/comunidades/pdf/pdf%20curso%20posgrado%20Elena/Tema%201/LevinsLewontinSynthese1980.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson88" /&gt; The term "holism" was coined in 1926 by [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]], a South African general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by Clements' superorganism concept.&lt;ref name="Foster08"/&gt;{{Cref2|C}} Around the same time, [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book ''Animal Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Elton27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elton|first=C.

Lotka]] brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.

In 1942, [[Raymond Lindeman]] wrote a landmark paper on the  [[Trophic dynamics#Trophic dynamics|trophic dynamics]] of ecology, which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical emphasis.

Ecology surged in popular and scientific interest during the 1960â1970s [[environmental movement]]. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection.&lt;ref name="McIntosh85" /&gt; The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating the protection of wild places by notable ecologists in the history of [[conservation biology]], such as [[Aldo Leopold]] and [[Arthur Tansley]], have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located.&lt;ref name="McIntosh85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palamar08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Palamar | first1=C.

Women such as [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] and [[Julia Lathrop]], among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.

In 1962, marine biologist and ecologist [[Rachel Carson]]'s book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' helped to mobilize the environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic [[pesticide]]s, such as [[DDT]], [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulating]] in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and [[ecosystem health]]. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge their understanding of the degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.&lt;ref name="Hammond09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McIntosh85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palamar08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krebs99"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krebs |first1=J.

In the case of all things which have several parts and in which the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something beside the parts, there is a cause; for even in bodies contact is the cause of unity in some cases, and in others viscosity or some other such quality."''}}

The expulsion of the Jews from [[Sicily]] began in 1493 when the [[Spanish Inquisition]] reached the island of [[Sicily]] and its population of more than 30,000 Jews.

==History of the Jews of Sicily and the Spanish Inquisition==
===History of the Sicilian Jews===
{{main|History of the Jews in Sicily}}
At the time of expulsion from Sicily, the Jewish community in Sicily dated back to early [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, and they were relatively untroubled on the island until the acceptance of the [[Crown of Aragon]] in Sicily in 1412. A great number of Jews had reached Sicily after [[Pompey]]'s 63 BC sacking of [[Jerusalem]].

After the enslavement under Roman rule, Jews in Sicily eventually assimilated into society, working in professions such as philosophy, medicine, artisanal pursuits, and farming.

The exact number of Jews in Sicily at the time of expulsion is not certain, However, some have put the number of Jewish refugees at 36,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulnbla.tripod.com/main.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, in 1492, it is known the Jewish populations of [[Palermo]], [[Messina]], and several other cities were considerable, and that there were ''[[La Giudecca|Giudeccas]]'', or Jewish settlements, in over 50 places in Sicily, ranging in anywhere population from 350 to 5,000. At their height, Jewish Sicilians probably constituted from five to eight percent of the island's population.[http://www.bestofsicily.com/religion.htm]

===History of the Spanish Inquisition and Jewish Expulsion===
[[Image:Aragonese Empire.PNG|thumb|left|250px|The maximum extent of the Crown of Aragon, including Sicily.]]
Muslims had ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula since the first invasion in 711. By the late Middle Ages, Christian kings had begun to wage war on the Moors and recapture some of the peninsula. After the marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] to Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], the Moors were finally forced out of Granada in 1492, completing the so-called [[Reconquista]] of the Iberian Peninsula.

In 1479 Sicily and [[Malta]] came under [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]ese rule. In 1492, as part of an attempt to maintain Catholic orthodoxy and purify their kingdom of Moorish influence, [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] ordered the forced [[Alhambra decree|expulsion]] or conversion of all Jews on pain of death. The date of the expulsion was extended from 18 September 1492 to 12 January 1493, in order to allow the extortion of opportunist tax levies. 

Many Sicilian Jews fled to the neighboring mainland of [[Calabria]], where the [[Spanish Inquisition]]&lt;sup&gt;It wasn't the Inquisition.&lt;/sup&gt; caught up with them again fifty years later.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Not all of the Sicilian Jews departed. A small number of Sicily's Jewish community converted to Catholicism and remained on the island. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.michaelfreund.org/10311/jewish-sicily&lt;/ref&gt;

The great part of the Sicilian Jewish community fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially to what is since the twentieth century [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]] and Turkey. They were well received there. The settlements of these Jews were in Greece and Turkey were large enough great to build their own congregations and to print books.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronika" Vol. 57, Periodical of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece, Athens March 1983, Greek transl. from Goldschmidt, D. In "Sefunot" Vol. 13, Jerusalem, Ben Zvi Institute 1971-1978 (Hebrew) âPrayerbooks of the Jews of Greeceâ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nosek, B. Italian and Sicilian Piyyut in contemporary Context and its unique Contribution to further poetical Output BedÅich Nosek, CSc. Mgr. Sylva OndrejiÄkovÃ¡ Praha, 2011 (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews have never returned en masse to Sicily. However, in 2005, for the first time since the Expulsion, a [[Passover seder]] was conducted in Sicily (in Palermo), held by the [[Milan]]ese progressive [[Rabbi]].

{{About|the sociological phenomena||The Folk Devils}}
'''Folk devil''' is a person or group of people who are portrayed in [[folklore]] or the [[mass media|media]] as outsiders and [[deviant]], and who are blamed for [[crime]]s or other sorts of social problems; see also: ''[[scapegoat]]''.

The pursuit of folk devils frequently intensifies into a mass movement that is called a [[moral panic]].  When a moral panic is in full swing, the folk devils are the subject of loosely organized but pervasive campaigns of hostility through gossip and the spreading of [[urban legend]]s. The mass media sometimes get in on the act or attempt to create new folk devils in an effort to promote controversy. Sometimes the campaign against the folk devil influences a nation's politics and [[legislation]].

== Concept ==
The concept of the folk devil was introduced by [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] in  1972, in his study ''[[Folk Devils and Moral Panics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, S. (1973). Folk Devils and Moral Panics. St Albans: Paladin&lt;/ref&gt; which analysed media controversies concerning [[Mods and Rockers]] in the [[United Kingdom]] of the 1960s.

Cohenâs research was based on the media storm over a violent clash between two youth subcultures, the mods and the rockers, on a bank holiday on a beach in England, 1964. Though the incident only resulted in some property damage without any serious physical injury to any of the individuals involved, several newspapers published sensationalist articles surrounding the event. 
Cohen examined articles written about the topic and noted a pattern of distorted facts and misrepresentation, as well as a distinct, simplistic depiction of the respective images of both groups involved in the disturbance.  He articulated three stages in the media's reporting on folk devils:

# Symbolisation: the folk devil is portrayed in one singular narrative, their appearance and overall identify oversimplified to be easily recognizable.
# Exaggeration: the facts of the controversy surrounding the folk devil are distorted, or fabricated all together, fueling the âmoral crusadeâ.
# Prediction: further immoral actions on the part of the folk devil are anticipated.

In the case of the mods and rockers, increased police presence the following year on the bank holiday led to another occurrence of violence. Cohen noted that the depiction of mods and rockers as violent, unruly troublemakers actually led in itself to a rise in âdeviant behaviourâ by the subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Labelling Theory and the Media: Moral Panics." North Wales 14-19 Network. N.p., 6 Oct. 2012. Web. 13 Nov. 2014. &lt;http://www.14-19nw.org.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=8805&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic and modern cases ==
The basic pattern of agitations against folk devils can be seen in the history of [[witchhunt]]s and similar manias of persecution; the histories of predominately [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] European countries present examples of adherents of the rival Western Christian faith as folk devils; [[minorities]] and [[immigrants]] have often been seen as folk devils; in the long history of [[anti-Semitism]], which frequently targets [[Jew]]s with allegations of dark, murderous practices, such as [[blood libel]]; or the Roman [[persecution of Christians]] that blamed the military reverses suffered by the [[Roman Empire]] on the Christians' abandonment of [[paganism]].

In modern times, political and religious leaders in many nations have sought to present atheists and secularists as deviant outsiders who threaten the social and moral order.&lt;ref name=Duke&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Barry|title=Christians, Muslims and Jews urged to unite in a war against atheists|url=http://freethinker.co.uk/2010/10/30/christians-muslims-and-jews-urged-to-unite-in-a-war-against-atheists/|accessdate=10 June 2012|newspaper=The Freethinker|date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of folk devils may reflect the efforts of powerful institutions to displace social anxieties.

Another example of [[Religious discrimination|religious]] and [[ethnic discrimination]] associated with Cohen's folk devil theory would be [[Islamophobia]], the discrimination of [[Muslim]]s and those perceived as being [[Middle Eastern]] in origin. Post-[[9/11]] reactions by Western countries stereotyped Muslims as violent, hateful, and of possessing fanatical [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] ideology. The group was depicted as posing a threat to social peace and safety in the Western world, and was subject to much hostility politically, from the media and from society.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Natour, Ryan J. "Folk Devils and the Proposed Islamic School in Camden." Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies 24.4 (2010): 573-85. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Columbine as a case study ==

In a 2014 study,{{cn|date=January 2017}} the media reaction to the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine massacre]] was applied to Cohenâs folk devil theory.

On April 20, 1999, [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], two students from [[Columbine High School]] in [[Columbine, Colorado]], went on a [[Spree killer|shooting spree]] which resulted in the deaths of 15 people. News reports in the weeks following the tragedy labelled the shooters as being âobsessedâ with gothic subculture, and suggested a link between Harris and Kleboldâs alleged identification with gothic subculture and their acts of violence.

In their attempt to make sense of the Columbine shootings, journalists and other media commentators linked [[Goth subculture|goths]] to terrorism, [[Charles Manson|Charles]] and [[Marilyn Manson]], [[self-mutilation]], hostage-taking, gang culture, the [[Branch Davidians|Waco cult]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], [[Satanism]], mass murder, [[War crimes in the Kosovo War#Ethnic cleansing|ethnic cleansing]] in [[Kosovo]], suicide, the Internet, [[video games]], [[skinhead music]], white extremism, and [[Adolf Hitler]].

The ABC news program [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]] aired a special entitled âThe Goth Phenomenonâ in which it reinforced claims that the shooters were heavily submerged in goth culture, and suggested that individuals of gothic subculture were to blame for homicidal activity in the past. 
The hostility and hysteria over the perceived âevilâ goth culture amplified in the years following the shooting. Goths were stereotyped in the media as being perpetuators or supporters of violence donned in black trench coats. Several high schools across the United States banned black trench coats and other apparel perceived as being linked to goth culture. Some police departments in the United States labelled gothic subculture as being âgang-basedâ, and as something that should be subjected to âincreased police surveillanceâ. From the time of the Columbine shooting until 2003, there were reports of individuals sporting what was seen as gothic dress being interrogated, ticketed and arrested. In 2002, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Sam Graves]] caused [[Blue Springs, Missouri]] to be granted US$273,000 to combat the ânew gothic threatâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/black-hole/Content?oid=2173559|title=Black Hole|work=[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]|date=June 3, 2004|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/9322#.VchJUUseSRU|title=The Cure for bad behaviour?|work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|date=April 29, 2002|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/politics/92029/under-cut|title=Under-Cut|author=Michael Crowley|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=February 24, 2002|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The backlash against goth subculture after the Columbine shooting draws many parallels to Stanley Cohenâs research on the mods and rockers, two other youth [[subculture]]s cast as folk devils by society. In both instances the groups were portrayed in one distinct, dumbed-down image, ostracized, stripped of any redeeming qualities, and blamed for wrongdoings in society.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Richard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">There is a criticism of the [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]].  The criticism stems from the fact that this measurement of [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] does not account for [[environmental degradation]] and [[resource depletion]].  A new approach to the situation of allocating these omitted environmental features in the [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] has been the advent of the '''green national product'''.

== Criticism of gross national product ==

The [[gross national product]] (GNP) measures the [[Welfare economics|welfare]] of a nation's economy through the aggregate of products and services produced in that nation.  Although GNP is a proficient measurement of the magnitude of the economy, many economists, environmentalists and citizens have been arguing the validity of the GNP in respect to measuring [[Welfare economics|welfare]].  [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizeâwinning economist]], states that this standard measurement for any [[national economy]] has become deficient as a measure of long-term economic health in our recently resource-driven and [[Globalization|globalizing]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/02/8387507/index.htm?postversion=2006092508 | title=Good Numbers Gone Bad | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2008-04-02 | date=2006-10-02 | first=Joseph | last=Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics suggest that GNP often includes the environment on the wrong side of the balance sheet because if someone first pollutes and then another person cleans the pollution, both activities add to GNP making environmental degradation frequently look good for the economy.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | title=Green Accounting | publisher=[[Gernot Wagner]] | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223603/http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | archive-date=2008-03-07 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of [[mainstream economics]] complain that GNP compiles spending that makes us worse off, spending that allows us to stay in the same place, and spending that makes us better off all in a single measure, giving a nation no clue if they are making progress or not.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", [[University Press of America]], c1994. p.2 "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manfred Max-Neef]], Chilean economist, explains that politicians feel that it is irrelevant whether the spending is productive, unproductive, or destructive.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"/&gt;  In this sense, it is common to see political policies that call to depredate a natural resource in order to increase the GNP.  To take into account the environmental depredation and resource depletion, there is a call to shift away from the traditional GNP and construct an assessment of national product that takes into account environmental effects.

== History ==

=== Measure of economic welfare ===

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, scientists and economists have warned of an [[inflection point]] for the United States economy where expansion is inevitably limited by the steadily decreasing availability of natural resources.  In 1973, [[William D. Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]], [[Yale University|Yale]] economists, were the first to question the GNP in "is growth obsolete?"  Nordhaus and Tobin developed a [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW) and stated that welfare must be sustainable, in the sense that nations that devour their stock of capital are not as "well" as the national income would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p03b/p0398a.pdf |format = pdf |  title=Is Growth Obsolete? | publisher=Milton Moss | year=1973 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Index of sustainable economic welfare ===

However, in "The Green National Product", Clifford Cobb and John Cobb argue that the Measure of Economic Welfare failed to encompass the depletion of [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.10-11 "How to Measure Welfare: Some Options"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, [[Herman Daly]], John Cobb, and Clifford Cobb created what is known as the [[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]] (ISEW).  This new measurement of welfare was created in the hopes that it would replace the flawed GNP.  Herman Daly stated that the key flaw of the traditional GNP was that it ignored core accounting principles of business where all revenues and expenses are allocated to income.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | publisher=National Public Radio | date=April 9, 2004 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233502/http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archive-date=2008-04-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ISEW called for ecological and economic sustainability to coincide since the economy is ultimately dependent on the natural resources that the earth provides.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than the original GNP, ISEW takes into account costs that are naturally unsustainable.  By creating ISEW, they wanted to expand the current national product so that individuals, businesses, and governments could take actions that will generally enhance welfare, rather than merely enhancing the traditional GNP.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280-281 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genuine progress indicator ===

In 1995, Redefining Progress created the [[genuine progress indicator]] (GPI) as an alternative to the traditional GNP.  This new measurement of national income would allow policymakers to gauge how well citizens are, economically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redifining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike welfare adjustments in the past like MEW and ISEW, GPI adjusts not only for environmental depredation, but also for income distribution, housework, volunteering, crime, changes in leisure time, and life-span of consumer durables and public infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redefining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the first alternatives to the traditional GNP to be used by the scientific community and governmental organizations globally.

=== In the United States ===

In 1992, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] initiated intensive work to create an environmental accounting system.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rcted.ncu.edu.tw/speech/On%20Green%20NP%202007%201117[1].pdf |format = pdf |  title=On "Green National Product": Theories and a Comparison Among Difference Approaches | publisher=Eolss Publishers | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA began by creating satellite accounts with easily measurable commodities such as petroleum and coal.  The first BEA publication was the U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts (IEESA) in 1994.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;  The initial results were quite significant, and showed how GNP was overestimating the impact of mining industries in respect to the nations economic wealth.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"/&gt;  Mining companies didn't care for the initial publications, for obvious reasons, and soon [[Alan Mollohan]], a Democratic House Representative from [[West Virginia]]'s coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 [[Appropriation Bill]].  In response, Congress directed the BEA to suspend further work in [[Sustainability measurement|environmental accounting]], and to obtain an external review on their findings.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;

== Need ==

Many people are calling for a green national product that would indicate if activities benefit or harm the economy and well-being.  This green national product would revolve around the social and economic issues on which many green movements have focused: care for the earth and all that sustain it.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"/&gt;  This new national product would differ from the traditional GNP by addressing both the sustainability and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"/&gt;  It is essential that this system takes into account natural capital, which is currently hidden from our traditional measurement.

'''Gualdrada''' was a member of the nobility in 12th century [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  She was a daughter of Bellincion Berti, &lt;ref&gt;mention made of Bellincion Berti in [[s:The Divine Comedy/Paradiso/Canto XV|The Divine Comedy/Paradiso/Canto XV - Wikisource]]. Ubertino Donato was the son-in-law to Bellincion Berti - [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Divine-Comedy-of-Dante--Paradisex30614.html see notes] in the Divine Comedy, by Alighieri Dante: ''Paradise Canto XVI.''&lt;/ref&gt; being a descendent of the Ravignani family,  a branch of the Adimari family. 

==Biography==
[[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''On Famous Women (De mulieribus claris)'' biography 103 tells her twelfth century story. During a festival in a [[Florence|Florentine]] Church of Saint John the Baptist, the [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV]] came to the city and entered the church with his entourage.  From his seat he spotted Gualdrada and was impressed with her beauty.  He admired her innocence in youth, the way she dressed, and her personality. He asked an elderly gentleman that was near him, &lt;blockquote&gt;''Who, pray tell, is that girl there facing us with the beautiful face that in my opinion surpasses all the others in dignity?''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The emperor did not know that he was asking her father. Bellincion answered the emperor, saying, &lt;blockquote&gt; ''Your Majesty, whoever she may be, she will kiss you at my bidding if you desire.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gualdrada overheard this and was embarrassed and wished that her father would not be so bold with his offers. She immediately replied,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Father, please stop. Speak no more. For by Heaven, unless force is used, absolutely no one except the man to whom you will give me in lawful and holy matrimony shall receive what you are offering so freely.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Emperor was both stunned and impressed by this response from Gualdrada. Learning that he was speaking to her father, he praised her in an eloquent speech to everyone of her virtue. As he was leaving the festival he summoned one of his barons, called Guido, and promoted him to a count. He then presented to Gualdrada a large dowry consisting of [[Casentino]] and a part of the territory of [[Romagna]]. Gualdrada was then given to Guido in marriage. 

From the marriage of Gualdrada and Guido came two sons, Guglielmo and Ruggieri. Ruggieri was the father of Guidoguerra, a leader of a group of four hundred Florentines of the [[Guelf]] party. They were contributory to the victory in 1265 of [[Charles of Anjou]] at [[Benevento]] over [[Manfred of Sicily]].  In 1266 Charles became [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]].

In [[statistics]], '''Halton sequences'''&lt;!-- Who's Halton? --&gt; are  [[sequence]]s used to generate points in space for numerical methods such as [[Monte Carlo simulations]].  Although these sequences are [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], they are of [[Low-discrepancy sequence|low discrepancy]], that is, appear to be [[random]] for many purposes. They were first introduced in 1960 and are an example of a [[quasi-random number]] sequence.  They generalise the one-dimensional [[van der Corput sequence]]s.

== Example of Halton sequence used to generate points in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) &amp;times; (0,&amp;nbsp;1) in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ==
[[File:Halton_sequence_2_3.svg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the first 8 points of the 2,3 Halton sequence]]
The Halton sequence is constructed according to a deterministic method that uses [[coprime integers|coprime numbers]] as its bases. As a simple example, let's take one dimension of the Halton sequence to be based on 2 and the other  on 3.  To generate the sequence for 2, we start by dividing the interval (0,1) in half, then in fourths, eighths, etc., which generates

: {{frac|2}}, {{frac|4}}, {{frac|3|4}}, {{frac|8}}, {{frac|5|8}}, {{frac|3|8}}, {{frac|7|8}}, {{frac|16}}, {{frac|9|16}},...

Equivalently, the nth number of this sequence is the number n written in binary representation, inverted, and written after the decimal point. This is true for any base. As an example, to find the sixth element of the above sequence, we'd write 6 = 1*2{{sup|2}} + 1*2{{sup|1}} + 0*2{{sup|0}} = 110{{sub|2}}, which can be inverted and placed after the decimal point to give 0.011{{sub|2}} = 0*2{{sup|-1}} + 1*2{{sup|-2}} + 1*2{{sup|-3}} = {{frac|3|8}}. So the sequence above is the same as

: 0.1{{sub|2}}, 0.01{{sub|2}}, 0.11{{sub|2}}, 0.001{{sub|2}}, 0.101{{sub|2}}, 0.011{{sub|2}}, 0.111{{sub|2}}, 0.0001{{sub|2}}, 0.1001{{sub|2}},...

To generate the sequence for 3, we divide the interval (0,1) in thirds, then ninths, twenty-sevenths, etc., which generates

: {{frac|3}}, {{frac|2|3}}, {{frac|9}}, {{frac|4|9}}, {{frac|7|9}}, {{frac|2|9}}, {{frac|5|9}}, {{frac|8|9}}, {{frac|27}},...

When we pair them up, we get a sequence of points in a unit square:

Even though standard Halton sequences perform very well in low dimensions, correlation problems have been noted between sequences generated from higher primes.  For example, if we started with the primes 17 and 19, the first 16 pairs of points: ({{frac|17}}, {{frac|19}}), ({{frac|2|17}}, {{frac|2|19}}), ({{frac|3|17}}, {{frac|3|19}}) ... ({{frac|16|17}}, {{frac|16|19}}) would have perfect [[linear correlation]]. To avoid this, it is common to drop the first 20 entries, or some other predetermined quantity depending on the primes chosen. Several other methods have also been proposed. One of the most prominent solutions is the scrambled Halton sequence, which uses permutations of the coefficients used in the construction of the standard sequence. Another solution is the leaped Halton, which skips points in the standard sequence. Using, eg, only each 409th point (also other prime numbers not used in the Halton core sequence are possible), can achieve significant improvements.&lt;ref name="Kc1997"&gt;Kocis and Whiten, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''center of the Universe''' is a concept that lacks a coherent definition in modern [[astronomy]]; according to standard [[cosmology|cosmological]] theories on the [[shape of the universe]], it has no center.

Historically, the center of the Universe had been believed to be a number of locations. Many mythological cosmologies included an ''[[axis mundi]]'', the central axis of a flat Earth that connects the Earth, heavens, and other realms together. In the 4th century BCE Greece, the [[geocentric model]] was developed based on astronomical observation, proposing that the center of the Universe lies at the center of a spherical, stationary Earth, around which the sun, moon, planets, and stars rotate. With the development of the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in the 16th century, the sun was believed to be the center of the Universe, with the planets (including Earth) and stars orbiting it.

In the early 20th century, the discovery of other [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and the development of the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] led to the development of cosmological models of a [[Cosmological principle|homogeneous, isotropic Universe]] (which lacks a central point) that is [[Metric expansion of space|expanding at all points]].

{{Nature timeline}}
In religion or mythology, the ''[[axis mundi]]'' (also cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, columna cerului, center of the world) is a point described as the center of the world, the connection between it and Heaven, or both.
[[File:Mt. Hermon from Manara(GllSprng 319PAN).jpg|thumb|left|Mount Hermon in Lebanon was regarded in some cultures as the ''axis mundi''.]]
[[Mount Hermon]] was regarded as the axis mundi in [[Caananite]] tradition, from where the [[sons of God]] are introduced descending in [[1 Enoch]] (1En6:6).&lt;ref name="Bautch2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelley Coblentz Bautch|title=A Study of the Geography of 1 Enoch 17-19: "no One Has Seen what I Have Seen"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FPNFEtWNrQC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=25 September 2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131033|pages=62â}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] regarded several sites as places of earth's ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel) stone, notably the oracle at [[Delphi]], while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic [[world tree]] and in [[Mount Olympus]] as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]] and [[Mount Sinai]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has [[Mecca]], said to be the place on earth that was created first, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]). In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.  In addition to the [[Kun Lun Mountains]], where it is believed the [[Peaches of Immortality|peach tree of immortality]] is located, the [[Chinese folk religion]] recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.
[[File:1581 Bunting clover leaf map.jpg|thumb|left|A 1581 map depicting Jerusalem as the center of the world.]]
Sacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. "Every temple or palace--and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence--is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stupa]] of [[Hinduism]], and later [[Buddhism]], reflects [[Mount Meru]]. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a [[cross]], with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. [[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the [[maypole]], derived from the [[Saxons]]' [[Irminsul]], and the [[totem pole]] among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] also represent world axes. The [[calumet (pipe)|calumet]], or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Symbols.'' Editions Robert Lafont S. A. et Editions Jupiter: Paris, 1982. Penguin Books: London, 1996. pp.148-149&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mandala]] creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times some Christians thought of [[Jerusalem]] as the center of the world (Latin: ''umbilicus mundi'', Greek: ''Omphalos''), and was so represented in the so-called [[T and O map]]s. Byzantine hymns speak of the Cross being "planted in the center of the earth."

==Center of a flat Earth==
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Flammarion engraving]] (1888) depicts a traveller who arrives at the edge of a Flat Earth and sticks his head through the [[firmament]].]]
The [[Flat Earth]] model is a belief that the [[Earth]]'s shape is a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] or [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] covered by a [[firmament]] containing heavenly bodies. Most pre-scientific cultures have had conceptions of a Flat Earth, including [[ancient Greece|Greece]] until the [[Classical Greece|classical period]], the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] civilizations of the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] until the [[Hellenistic period]], [[Iron Age India|India]] until the [[Gupta period]] (early centuries AD) and [[China]] until the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} It was also typically held in the aboriginal cultures of the [[Americas]], and a flat Earth domed by the [[firmament]] in the shape of an inverted bowl is common in pre-scientific societies.&lt;ref&gt;"Their cosmography as far as we know anything about it was practically of one type up til the time of the white man's arrival upon the scene. That of the Borneo Dayaks may furnish us with some idea of it. 'They consider the Earth to be a flat surface, whilst the heavens are a dome, a kind of glass shade which covers the Earth and comes in contact with it at the horizon.'"
Lucien Levy-Bruhl, ''Primitive Mentality'' (repr. Boston: Beacon, 1966) 353;
"The usual primitive conception of the world's form ... [is] flat and round below and surmounted above by a solid firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl." H. B. Alexander, ''[[The Mythology of All Races]]'' 10: North American (repr. New York: Cooper Square, 1964) 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Center" is well-defined in a Flat Earth model.  A flat earth would have a definite geographic center.  There would also be a unique point at the exact center of a spherical [[firmament]] (or a firmament that was a half-sphere).

==Earth as the center of the Universe==
{{main article|Geocentric model}}
The Flat Earth model gave way to an understanding of a [[Spherical Earth]]. [[Aristotle]] (384&amp;ndash;322&amp;nbsp;BCE)  provided observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth, namely that different stars are visible in different locations, travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon, and the shadow of Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is round, and spheres cast circular shadows while discs generally do not.

This understanding was accompanied by models of the Universe that depicted the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[star]]s, and [[naked eye planets]] circling the spherical Earth, including the noteworthy models of [[Aristotle]] (see [[Aristotelian physics]]) and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Copernican heliocentrism diagram-2.jpg|thumb|left|The heliocentric model from Nicolaus Copernicus' ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'']]
Heliocentrism, or heliocentricism,&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science'' (National Academy of Sciences, 1998), p.27; also, Don O' Leary, ''Roman Catholicism and Modern Science: A History'' (Continuum Books, 2006), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Copernican heliocenterism held that the Sun itself was the center of the entire Universe.   As it is modernly understood, Heliocenterism refers to the much narrower concept that the sun is the center of the Solar System, not the center of the entire Universe.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[astronomy|astronomical]] model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary Sun at the center of our [[Solar System]]. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ({{lang|el|[[wikt:á¼¥Î»Î¹Î¿Ï|á¼¥Î»Î¹Î¿Ï]]}} ''[[helios]]'' "sun" and {{lang|el|[[wikt:ÎºÎ­Î½ÏÏÎ¿Î½|ÎºÎ­Î½ÏÏÎ¿Î½]]}} ''kentron'' "center").

The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BCE by  [[Aristarchus of Samos]],&lt;ref name="Dreyer1906"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dreyer |first=J.L.E. |date=1906 |title=History of the planetary systems from Thales to Kepler |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/n148/mode/2up |pages=135â48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linton2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Linton |first=C.M. |date=2004 |title=From Eudoxus to Einstein: A History of Mathematical Astronomy |series=E-Libro |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139453790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJuwFLGWKF8C&amp;pg=PA205 |page=38,205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The work of Aristarchus's in which he proposed his heliocentric system has not survived.  We only know of it now from a brief passage in [[Archimedes]]'s ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but had received no support from most other ancient astronomers.

[[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' major theory of a heliocentric model was published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''), in 1543, the year of his death, though he had formulated the theory several decades earlier. Copernicus' ideas were not immediately accepted, but they did begin a paradigm shift away from the Ptolemaic geocentric model to a heliocentric model. The [[Copernican revolution]], as this paradigm shift would come to be called, would last until [[Isaac Newton]]âs work over a century later.

[[Johannes Kepler]] published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of [[Tycho Brahe]].&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite book

On 7 January 1610 Galileo used his telescope, with optics superior to what had been available {{cn|date=March 2018}}  before. He described "three fixed stars, totally invisible&lt;ref name=invisible&gt;''i.e.'', invisible to the naked eye.&lt;/ref&gt; by their smallness", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.&lt;ref name="Drake1978"&gt;{{cite book |title=Galileo at Work: His Scientific Biography |first=Stillman |last=Drake |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=1978 |pages=146, 152, 157â163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these "stars" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days he concluded that they were [[orbit]]ing Jupiter:&lt;ref name=moonconclusion&gt;In ''Sidereus Nuncius'',[http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=3&amp;VOLPAG=81 1892, 3:81] {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo stated that he had reached this conclusion on 11 January.&lt;ref name="Drake1978"/&gt; He had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest [[natural satellite|satellites]] (moons). He discovered the fourth on 13 January.

His observations of the satellites of Jupiter created a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian Cosmology]], which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth,&lt;ref name="Drake1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Linton2004p38"&gt;{{cite book |last=Linton |first=C.M. |date=2004 |title=From Eudoxus to Einstein: A History of Mathematical Astronomy |series=E-Libro |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139453790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJuwFLGWKF8C&amp;pg=PA38 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing.&lt;ref name="Drake1978"/&gt;{{clarify|a bit of an overstatement here.

Newton made clear his [[heliocentric]] view of the solar system&amp;nbsp;â developed in a somewhat modern way, because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pages 233â274 in R Taton &amp; C Wilson (eds) (1989) ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume, 2A', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA233 at page 233].&lt;/ref&gt; For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line" (Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).&lt;ref&gt;Text quotations are from 1729 translation of Newton's ''Principia'', Book 3 (1729 vol.2) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA233 at pages 232â233].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Milky Way's galactic center as center of the Universe==

Before the 1920s, it was generally believed that there were no galaxies other than our own (see for example [[Great Debate (astronomy)|The Great Debate]]). Thus, to astronomers of previous centuries, there was no distinction between a hypothetical center of the galaxy and a hypothetical center of the universe.

[[Image:Pic iroberts1.jpg|thumb|Great Andromeda Nebula by [[Isaac Roberts]] ''(1899)'']]
In 1750 [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]], in his work ''An original theory or new hypothesis of the Universe'', correctly speculated that the [[Milky Way]] might be a body of a huge number of stars held together by [[gravitation|gravitational forces]] rotating about a [[Galactic Center]], akin to the solar system but on a much larger scale. The resulting disk of stars can be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk.&lt;ref name="our_galaxy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=J. C.|title=Our Galaxy|url=http://physics.gmu.edu/~jevans/astr103/CourseNotes/ECText/ch20_txt.htm|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a treatise in 1755, [[Immanuel Kant]] elaborated on Wright's idea about the structure of the Milky Way.

The 19th century astronomer [[Johann Heinrich von MÃ¤dler]] proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which the stars of the universe revolved around a point in the [[Pleiades]].

==The nonexistence of a center of the Universe==
In 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis]] observed a nova within what then was called the "[[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]] Nebula". Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that novas in Andromeda were drastically fainter than novas in the Milky Way.  Based on this, Curtis was able to estimate that Andromeda was 500,000 [[light-years]] away. As a result, Curtis became a proponent of the so-called "island Universes" hypothesis, which held that objects previously believed to be [[spiral galaxy|spiral nebulae]] within the Milky Way were actually independent galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 | volume=100 | page=6
 | bibcode=1988PASP..100....6C
 | doi=10.1086/132128
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Great Debate (astronomy)|the Great Debate]] between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Curtis took place, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula (M31) was an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in our own Galaxy, as well as the significant [[Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[Ernst Ãpik]] presented a very elegant and simple astrophysical method to estimate the distance of M31. His result put the Andromeda Nebula far outside our Galaxy at a distance of about 450,000 [[parsec]], which is about 1,500,000 [[lightyear|ly]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate about whether other galaxies exist in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of M31. These were made using the 2.5&amp;nbsp;metre (100&amp;nbsp;in) [[Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our Galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from our own. This proved the existence of other galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;

===Expanding Universe===
Hubble also demonstrated that the [[redshift]] of other galaxies is approximately proportional to their distance from the Earth ([[Hubble's law]]). This raised the appearance of our galaxy being in the center of an expanding Universe, however, Hubble rejected the findings philosophically:

{{quote|...if we see the nebulae all receding from our position in space, then every other observer, no matter where he may be located, will see the nebulae all receding from his position. However, the assumption is adopted. There must be no favoured location in the Universe, no centre, no boundary; all must see the Universe alike. And, in order to ensure this situation, the cosmologist, postulates spatial isotropy and spatial homogeneity, which is his way of stating that the Universe must be pretty much alike everywhere and in all directions."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last=Hubble | first=E. P.
 | date=1937
 | title=The observational approach to cosmology
 | publisher=Oxford University Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The redshift observations of Hubble, in which galaxies appear to be moving away from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us, are now understood to be a result of the [[metric expansion of space]]. This is the increase of the distance between two distant parts of the Universe with time, and is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. As Hubble theorized, all observers anywhere in the Universe will observe a similar effect.

===Copernican and cosmological principles===
The [[Copernican principle]], named after Nicolaus Copernicus, states that the Earth is not in a central, specially favored position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = H. Bondi | authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1952 | page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the geocentric [[Ptolemaic system]].

The [[cosmological principle]] is an extension of the Copernican principle which states that the Universe is homogeneous (the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the Universe) and isotropic (the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the Universe). A homogeneous, isotropic Universe does not have a center.&lt;ref name="livio"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Accelerating Universe: Infinite Expansion, the Cosmological Constant, and the Beauty of the Cosmos|last= Livio|first= Mario|authorlink= Mario Livio|date= 2001|publisher= John Wiley and Sons|page= 53|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4EidS6_VVNYC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=cosmological+principle+%22center+of+the+universe%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Eyt3T5HFGuzy2gXsm_C1Bg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBjgU|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32349">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hodge star operator''' or '''Hodge star''' is a [[linear map]] introduced by [[W. V. D. Hodge]].  It is defined on the [[exterior algebra]] of a finite-dimensional [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[vector space]] endowed with a [[Degenerate bilinear form|nondegenerate]] [[symmetric bilinear form]].  The result when applied to an element of the algebra is called the element's '''Hodge dual'''.

For example, in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, every oriented plane has an unique [[normal vector]], and every vector can be used to define a plane perpendicular to that vector. The Hodge star can be thought of as generalizing this relationship: in general, for an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional vector space, the Hodge star maps {{mvar|k}}-vectors to {{nowrap|({{mvar|n}} â {{mvar|k}})}}-vectors and vice versa.

==Dimensions and algebra==
Suppose that {{mvar|n}} is the dimension of the oriented inner product space and {{mvar|k}} is an integer such that {{math|0 â¤ ''k'' â¤ ''n''}}, then the Hodge star operator establishes a one-to-one mapping from the space of [[p-vector|{{mvar|k}}-vectors]] to the space of {{math|(''n'' â ''k'')}}-vectors.  The image of a {{mvar|k}}-vector under this mapping is called its ''Hodge dual''. The former space, of {{mvar|k}}-vectors, has dimension &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k} &lt;/math&gt;, while the latter has dimension &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{n - k}&lt;/math&gt;, which are equal by the symmetry of the [[binomial coefficient]]s. Equal-dimensional [[vector space]]s are always [[isomorphic]], but not necessarily in a natural or canonical way. In this case, however, Hodge duality exploits the nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form, hereafter referred to as the ''inner product'' (though it might not be positive definite), and a choice of orientation to single out a unique isomorphism, which parallels the combinatorial symmetry of binomial coefficients. This in turn induces an inner product on the space of {{mvar|k}}-vectors. The naturalness of this definition means the duality can play a role in differential geometry.

The first interesting case is on three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] {{mvar|V}}. In this context the relevant row of [[Pascal's triangle]] reads

:{{math|1, 3, 3, 1}}

and the Hodge star sets up an isomorphism between the two three-dimensional spaces, which are {{mvar|V}} and the image space of the [[exterior product]] acting on pairs of vectors in {{mvar|V}}. See ''{{section link||Examples}}'' for details. In this case the Hodge star allows the definition of the [[cross product]] of traditional [[vector calculus]] in terms of the exterior product. While the properties of the cross product are special to three dimensions, the Hodge star applies to an arbitrary number of dimensions.

==Extensions==
Since the space of alternating linear forms in {{mvar|k}} arguments on a vector space is naturally isomorphic to the dual of the space of {{mvar|k}}-vectors over that vector space, the Hodge star can be defined for these spaces as well.  As with most constructions from linear algebra, the Hodge star can then be extended to a [[vector bundle]].  Thus a context in which the Hodge star is very often seen is the exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle, the space of differential forms on a manifold, where it can be used to construct the [[#Codifferential|codifferential]] from the [[exterior derivative]], and thus the [[Laplaceâde Rham operator]], which leads to the [[Hodge decomposition]] of [[differential forms]] in the case of [[Compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]]s.

==Formal definition for {{math|''k''}}-vectors==
The '''Hodge star operator''' on a [[vector space]] {{math|''V''}} with an inner product is a linear operator on the [[exterior algebra]] of {{math|''V''}}, mapping {{mvar|k}}-vectors to {{math|(''n'' â ''k'')}}-vectors where {{math|''n'' {{=}} dim ''V''}}, for {{math|0 â¤ ''k'' â¤ ''n''}}. It has the following property, which defines it completely: given two {{math|''k''}}-vectors {{math|''Î±'', ''Î²''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge (\star \beta) = \langle \alpha,\beta \rangle \,\omega&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Exterior algebra#Inner product|inner product on {{mvar|k}}-vectors]] and {{mvar|Ï}} is the preferred unit {{mvar|n}}-vector.

The inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle&lt;/math&gt; on {{mvar|k}}-vectors is extended from that on {{mvar|V}} by requiring that for any decomposable {{mvar|k}}-vectors &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \alpha_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta = \beta_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \beta_k&lt;/math&gt; it equals the [[Gram determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \alpha,\beta \rangle = \det \left[ \left\langle \alpha_i,\beta_j \right\rangle \right] .&lt;/math&gt;

The unit {{mvar|n}}-vector {{mvar|Ï}} is unique up to a sign. The preferred choice of {{mvar|Ï}} defines an [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]] on {{mvar|V}}.

==Explanation==
Let {{mvar|W}} be a vector space, with an inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle_W&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Riesz representation theorem]] states that for every continuous (even in the infinite-dimensional case) [[linear functional]] &lt;math&gt;f \in W^*&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique vector {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|W}} such that &lt;math&gt;f(w) = \langle w, v \rangle_W&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|w}} in {{mvar|W}}. The map &lt;math&gt;W^* \to W&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;f \mapsto v&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism. (If {{mvar|W}} is complex, the map is ''conjugate linear'' as opposed to complex linear.) This holds for ''all'' vector spaces with an inner product, and can be used to explain the Hodge star.

Let {{mvar|V}} be an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional vector space with basis &lt;math&gt;\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. For {{math|0 â¤ ''k'' â¤ ''n''}}, consider the exterior power spaces &lt;math&gt;{\textstyle\bigwedge}^k V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V&lt;/math&gt;. For

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^k V, \quad \theta \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V,&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda \wedge \theta \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^n V.&lt;/math&gt;

There is, up to a scalar, only one {{mvar|n}}-vector (an {{mvar|n}}-form), namely &lt;math&gt;e_1\wedge\ldots\wedge e_n&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\lambda \wedge \theta&lt;/math&gt; must be a scalar multiple of &lt;math&gt;e_1\wedge\ldots\wedge e_n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^k V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider a ''fixed'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^k V&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a unique linear function

:&lt;math&gt;f_{\lambda} \in \left({\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V\right)^{\! *}&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \theta \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V: \qquad \lambda \wedge \theta = f_{\lambda}(\theta) \, (e_1\wedge\ldots\wedge e_n).&lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;f_{\lambda}(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar multiple mentioned in the previous paragraph. If &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Exterior algebra#Inner product|inner product on {{math|(''n'' â ''k'')}}-vectors]], then there exists a unique {{math|(''n'' â ''k'')}}-vector, say

:&lt;math&gt;\star \lambda \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V,&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \theta \in {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V: \qquad f_{\lambda}(\theta) = \langle \theta, \star \lambda\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

This {{math|(''n'' â ''k'')}}-vector {{math|â''Î»''}} is the Hodge dual of {{mvar|Î»}}, and is the image of the &lt;math&gt;f_{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; under the isomorphism induced by the inner product,

:&lt;math&gt;\left({\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V\right)^{\! *} \cong {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt; \star : {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{k} V \to {\textstyle\bigwedge}^{n-k} V.&lt;/math&gt;

==Computation of the Hodge star==
Given an orthonormal basis &lt;math&gt;(e_1,\cdots,e_n)&lt;/math&gt; ordered such that &lt;math&gt;\omega = e_1\wedge \cdots \wedge e_n&lt;/math&gt;, for a positive-definite metric, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;\star (e_{i_1} \wedge e_{i_2}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_k})= e_{i_{k+1}} \wedge e_{i_{k+2}} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_n},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(i_1, i_2, \cdots, i_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an even permutation of {{math|{1, 2, ..., ''n''}.}}

Of these &lt;math&gt;n! \over 2&lt;/math&gt; relations, only &lt;math&gt;n \choose k&lt;/math&gt; are independent. The first one in the usual [[lexicographical order]] reads

:&lt;math&gt;\star (e_1\wedge e_2\wedge \cdots \wedge e_k)= e_{k+1}\wedge e_{k+2}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Expression in index notation==
Using [[tensor index notation]], the Hodge dual of an arbitrary wedge product of one-forms is given by the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\star(dx^{i_1} \wedge \dots \wedge dx^{i_k}) = \frac{\sqrt{|\det g|}}{(n-k)!} g^{i_1 j_1} \dots g^{i_k j_k} \varepsilon_{j_1 \dots j_n} dx^{j_{k+1}} \wedge \dots \wedge dx^{j_n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{j_1 \dots j_n}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]] defined so that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{1 \dots n} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse metric. Note that the factorial &lt;math&gt;(n-k)!&lt;/math&gt; had to be inserted to account for double counting, and cancels out if one orders the summation indices so that &lt;math&gt;j_{k+1} &lt; \dots &lt; j_n&lt;/math&gt;.  The absolute value of the determinant is necessary since it may be negative, e.g. for tangent spaces to [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold#Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian manifold]]s.

An arbitrary differential form can be expanded into its components as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha = \frac{1}{k!}\alpha_{i_1, \dots, i_k} dx^{i_1}\wedge \dots \wedge dx^{i_k} = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \dots &lt; i_k} \alpha_{i_1, \dots, i_k} dx^{i_1}\wedge \dots \wedge dx^{i_k}
&lt;/math&gt;

The factorial &lt;math&gt;k!&lt;/math&gt; is again included to account for double counting. We would like to define the dual of the component &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1, \dots, i_k}&lt;/math&gt; so that the Hodge dual of the form is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;
(\star\alpha) = \frac{1}{(n-k)!}(\star \alpha)_{i_{k+1}, \dots, i_n} dx^{i_{k+1}} \wedge \dots \wedge dx^{i_n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus using the expression for the Hodge dual of &lt;math&gt;dx^{i_1} \wedge \dots \wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; given at the beginning of this section we find&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Geometry of Physics |edition=3rd |first=T. |last=Frankel |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-107-60260-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
(\star \alpha)_{i_{k+1}, \dots, i_n} = \frac{\sqrt{|\det g|}}{k!} \alpha^{i_1, \dots, i_k}\, \,\varepsilon_{i_1, \dots, i_n}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is understood that [[raising and lowering indices|indices are raised and lowered]] using the same inner product &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; as in the definition of the Levi-Civita tensor. Although one can apply this expression to any tensor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the result is antisymmetric, since contraction with the completely anti-symmetric Levi-Civita symbol cancels all but the totally antisymmetric part of the tensor.  It is thus equivalent to antisymmetrization followed by applying the Hodge star.

==Examples==

===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions with the normalized Euclidean metric and orientation given by the ordering {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}, the Hodge star on {{math|''k''}}-forms is given by

:&lt;math&gt; {\star} \, 1 = dx \wedge dy &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\star} \, dx = dy &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\star} \, dy = -dx &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\star} ( dx \wedge dy ) = 1 .&lt;/math&gt;

The complex plane has the remarkable property that it is invariant under [[holomorphic]] changes of coordinate.
If {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''x'' + ''iy''}} is a holomorphic function of {{math|''w'' {{=}} ''u'' + ''iv''}}, then by the [[CauchyâRiemann equations]] {{math|{{sfrac|â''x''|â''u''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|â''y''|â''v''}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|â''y''|â''u''}} {{=}} â{{sfrac|â''x''|â''v''}}}}. In the new coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = p \,dx + q \,dy = \left( p \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} + q \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \right) \,du + \left( p \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} + q \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} \right) \,dv = p_1 du + q_1 \, dv ,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  {\star}\alpha = -q_1 \,du + p_1 \,dv &amp;= - \left( p \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} + q \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} \right) du + \left(p \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} + q \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \right) dv \\[4pt]
                       &amp;= -q \left( \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} du + \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} dv \right) + p \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} du + \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} dv \right) \\[4pt]
&amp; = -q\,dx + p\, dy,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

proving the claimed invariance.

===Three dimensions===
A common example of the star operator is the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} 3}}, when it can be taken as the correspondence between the vectors and the [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric matrices]] of that size. This is used implicitly in [[vector calculus]], for example to create the [[cross product]] vector from the [[Exterior_algebra|wedge product]]  of two vectors. Specifically, for [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, one easily finds that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \star \,dx &amp;= dy \wedge dz \\
  \star \,dy &amp;= dz \wedge dx \\
  \star \,dz &amp;= dx \wedge dy
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''dx''}}, {{math|''dy''}} and {{math|''dz''}} are the standard orthonormal differential [[one-form]]s on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The Hodge star in this case clearly relates the cross-product to the wedge product in three dimensions. A detailed presentation not restricted to differential geometry is provided next.

Applied to three dimensions, the Hodge star provides an [[isomorphism]] between [[axial vector]]s and [[bivector]]s, so each axial vector '''a''' is associated with a bivector {{math|'''A'''}} and vice versa, that is:&lt;ref name=Lounesto&gt;{{cite book |title=Clifford Algebras and Spinors, ''Volume 286 of London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series'' |author=Pertti Lounesto |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_xvJuA4M7QC&amp;pg=PA39 |page=39 |chapter=Â§3.6 The Hodge dual |isbn=0-521-00551-5 |year=2001 |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \star \mathbf{a}\qquad\mathbf{a} = \star \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|â}} is the Hodge star. These dual relations can be implemented using multiplication by the [[Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)#Unit pseudoscalar|unit pseudoscalar]] in [[Clifford algebra#Examples: real and complex Clifford algebras|Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')]],&lt;ref name=Datta&gt;{{cite book |title=Geometric algebra and applications to physics |chapter=The pseudoscalar and imaginary unit | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXTQXnws8E8C&amp;pg=PA53 |page=53 ''ff'' |author=Venzo De Sabbata, Bidyut Kumar Datta |isbn=1-58488-772-9 | publisher=CRC Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''i'' {{=}} '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the vectors {{math|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;â&lt;/sub&gt;} }} are an orthonormal basis in three dimensional Euclidean space) according to the relations:&lt;ref name=Baylis&gt;{{cite book |title=Lectures on Clifford (geometric) algebras and applications |editor=Rafal Ablamowicz, Garret Sobczyk |page=100 ''ff'' |chapter=Chapter 4: Applications of Clifford algebras in physics |author=William E Baylis  |isbn=0-8176-3257-3 |year=2004 | publisher=BirkhÃ¤user | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaoLbMS3ErwC&amp;pg=PA100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{a}i\,,\quad\mathbf{a} = - \mathbf{A} i. &lt;/math&gt;

The dual of a vector is obtained by multiplication by {{mvar|i}}, as established using the properties of the [[Geometric product#The geometric product|geometric product]] of the algebra as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a}i &amp;= \left(a_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + a_3 \mathbf{e}_3\right) \mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \\
              &amp;= a_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3 (\mathbf{e}_1)^2 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \mathbf{e}_1(\mathbf{e}_2)^2 + a_3  \mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2(\mathbf{e}_3)^2 \\
              &amp;= a_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \mathbf{e}_1 + a_3 \mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \\
              &amp;= (\star \mathbf{a})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and also, in the dual space spanned by {{math|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;â&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}:}}

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{A} i &amp;= \left(A_1 \mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3 + A_2 \mathbf{e}_3\mathbf{e}_1 + A_3 \mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\right) \mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3 \\
               &amp;= A_1 \mathbf{e}_1 (\mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_3)^2 + A_2 \mathbf{e}_2 (\mathbf{e}_3 \mathbf{e}_1)^2 + A_3 \mathbf{e}_3(\mathbf{e}_1 \mathbf{e}_2)^2 \\
               &amp;= -\left( A_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + A_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + A_3  \mathbf{e}_3 \right) \\
               &amp;= -(\star \mathbf{A})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In establishing these results, the identities are used:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2)^2 = \mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2= -\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_1 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

and:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{i}^2 = (\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3)^2 = \mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3 = \mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3\mathbf{e}_3\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2 = \mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2 = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

These relations between the dual {{math|â}} and {{mvar|i}} apply to any vectors. Here they are applied to relate the axial vector created as the [[cross product]] {{math|1='''a''' = '''u''' Ã '''v'''}} to the bivector-valued [[exterior product]] {{math|1='''A''' = '''u''' â§ '''v'''}} of two [[polar vectors|polar]] (that is, not axial) vectors {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}; the two products can be written as [[determinant]]s expressed in the same way:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \mathbf{e}_3\\u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3\\v_1 &amp; v_2 &amp; v_3 \end{vmatrix}\,,\quad\mathbf A =  \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_{23} &amp; \mathbf{e}_{31} &amp; \mathbf{e}_{12}\\u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3\\v_1 &amp; v_2 &amp; v_3 \end{vmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

using the notation {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;â''m''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;â&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. These expressions show these two types of vector are Hodge duals:&lt;ref name=Lounesto/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\star (\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{u \times v}\,,\quad\star (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf {v}) = \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v},&lt;/math&gt;

as a result of the relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\star \mathbf{e}_\ell = \mathbf{e}_\ell \mathit{i} = \mathbf{e}_\ell \mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3 = \mathbf{e}_m \mathbf{e}_n \,, &lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|â, ''m'', ''n''}} cyclic,

and:

:&lt;math&gt;\star ( \mathbf{e}_\ell \mathbf{e}_m ) = -( \mathbf{e}_\ell \mathbf{e}_m ) \mathit{i} = -\left( \mathbf{e}_\ell \mathbf{e}_m \right)\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3 = \mathbf{e}_n &lt;/math&gt;

also with {{math|''â'', ''m'', ''n''}} cyclic.

Using the implementation of {{math|â}} based upon {{mvar|i}}, the commonly used relations are:&lt;ref name=Hestenes&gt;{{cite book |title=New foundations for classical mechanics: Fundamental Theories of Physics  |isbn=0-7923-5302-1 |edition=2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Springer |chapter=The vector cross product |authorlink = David Hestenes|author=David Hestenes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlvTCEzSI5wC&amp;pg=PA60 |page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u \times v} = -(\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}) i  \,,\quad  \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} = (\mathbf{u \times v} )  i \ . &lt;/math&gt;

===Four dimensions===
In case {{math|1=''n'' = 4}}, the Hodge star acts as an [[endomorphism]] of the second exterior power (i.e. it maps two-forms to two-forms, since {{math|1=4 â 2 = 2}}). It is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], {{Inconsistent|date=October 2017|reason=It's not the case in the example for 2 forms below}} so it splits it into ''self-dual'' and ''anti-self-dual'' subspaces, on which it acts respectively as {{math|+1}} and {{math|â1}}.

Another useful example is {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}} Minkowski spacetime with metric signature {{math|(+ â â â)}} and coordinates {{math|(''t'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} where (using &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{0123} = 1&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \star dt &amp;=  dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
  \star dx &amp;=  dt \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
  \star dy &amp;= -dt \wedge dx \wedge dz \\
  \star dz &amp;=  dt \wedge dx \wedge dy
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for [[one-form]]s while

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \star (dt \wedge dx) &amp;= - dy \wedge dz \\
  \star (dt \wedge dy) &amp;=   dx \wedge dz \\
  \star (dt \wedge dz) &amp;= - dx \wedge dy \\
  \star (dx \wedge dy) &amp;=   dt \wedge dz \\
  \star (dx \wedge dz) &amp;= - dt \wedge dy \\
  \star (dy \wedge dz) &amp;=   dt \wedge dx
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for [[two-form]]s. Because their determinants are the same in both {{math|(+ â â â)}} and {{math|(â + + +)}}, the signs of the Minkowski space two-form duals depend only on the chosen orientation.{{verify source|date=October 2017}}

An easy rule to remember for the above Hodge operations is that given a form &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, its Hodge dual &lt;math&gt;{\star}\alpha&lt;/math&gt; may be obtained by writing the components not involved in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in an order such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge (\star \alpha) = dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \wedge dt&lt;/math&gt;.{{Inconsistent|date=October 2017|reason=This orientation choice appears to be non-canonical, and not to match the earlier choice}} An extra minus sign will enter only if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; does not contain &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt;. (The latter convention stems from the choice {{math|(+ â â â)}} for the metric signature. For {{math|(â + + +)}}, one puts a minus sign only if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; involves &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt;.)

==Inner product of {{math|''k''}}-vectors==
The Hodge star induces an inner product on the space of {{mvar|k}}-vectors, that is, on the [[exterior algebra]] of {{mvar|V}}.  Given two {{mvar|k}}-vectors {{mvar|Î·}} and {{mvar|Î¶}}, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta\wedge \star \eta = \langle\zeta, \eta \rangle\,\omega ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Ï}} is the normalised {{mvar|n}}-form (i.e. {{math|''Ï'' â§ â''Ï'' {{=}} ''Ï''}}). In the calculus of exterior [[differential form]]s on a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] of dimension {{mvar|n}}, the normalised {{mvar|n}}-form is called the [[volume form]] and can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{ \left| \det [g_{ij}] \right| }\;dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^n ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \left[ g_{ij} \right] &lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of components of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold in the [[coordinate basis]].

If an inner product is given on &lt;math&gt; {\textstyle\bigwedge}^k(V) &lt;/math&gt;, then this equation can be regarded as an alternative definition of the Hodge star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Darling| first = R. W. R. | title = Differential forms and connections| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordered wedge products of k distinct orthonormal basis vectors of {{mvar|V}} form an ''orthonormal'' basis on each subspace &lt;math&gt;{\textstyle\bigwedge}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; of the exterior algebra of {{mvar|V}}.

==Duality==
Applying the Hodge star twice leaves a {{math|''k''}}-vector unchanged, up to sign. Given a {{mvar|k}}-vector {{math|''Î·''}} in {{math|â&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} in an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional space {{mvar|V}}, one has

:&lt;math&gt;{\star} {\star} \eta = (-1)^{k(n-k)} s \eta ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|s}} is related to the [[metric signature|signature]] of the inner product on {{mvar|V}}.  Specifically, {{mvar|s}} is the sign of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the inner product tensor with respect to any basis. Thus, for example, if {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}} and the signature of the inner product is either {{math|(+ â â â)}} or {{math|(â + + +)}} then {{math|''s'' {{=}} â1}}. For Riemannian manifolds (including Euclidean spaces), the signature is always positive, and so {{math|''s'' {{=}} 1}}.

Note that the above identity implies that the inverse of {{math|â}} can be given as

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} {\star}^{-1}: ~&amp; \Lambda^k \to \Lambda^{n-k} \\ &amp; \eta \mapsto (-1)^{k(n-k)} s {\star} \eta \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if {{mvar|n}} is odd then {{math|''k''(''n'' â ''k'')}} is even for any {{mvar|k}}, whereas if {{mvar|n}} is even then {{math|''k''(''n'' â ''k'')}} has the parity of {{mvar|k}}. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;{\star}^{-1} = \begin{cases} s {\star} &amp; n \text{ is odd} \\ (-1)^k s {\star} &amp; n \text{ is even} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|k}} is the degree of the element operated on.

==On manifolds==
Applying the construction above to each [[cotangent space]] of an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional oriented [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], we can obtain an object known as the '''Hodge dual''' of a [[differential form|{{mvar|k}}-form]].  To be explicit â

For any {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''Î¶''}} we define {{math|â''Î¶''}} as the unique {{math|(''n'' â ''k'')}}-form satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\eta\wedge {\star} \zeta = \langle \eta, \zeta \rangle \; \omega &lt;/math&gt;

for every {{math|''k''}}-form {{mvar|Î·}} (here the inner product on forms and the volume form {{math|''Ï''}} are induced by the Riemannian metric tensor in the usual way; greater understanding of these objects can be found by learning about the [[Exterior algebra#Inner product|inner product on {{mvar|k}}-forms]] and the [[Volume form#Riemannian volume form|volume form]]).

The Hodge star is thus related to the {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} inner product on {{math|''k''}}-forms by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;(\eta,\zeta)=\int_M \eta\wedge {\star} \zeta.&lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''k''}}-forms  {{mvar|Î·}} and {{mvar|Î¶}}. (Note that we can also see this as an inner product on  [[fibre bundle|sections]]  of &lt;math&gt;{\textstyle\bigwedge}^k(\text{T}^*M)&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of sections is frequently denoted as &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(M) = \Gamma\left({\textstyle\bigwedge}^k\left(\text{T}^*M\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Each element of &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; is a {{math|''k''}}-form.)

More generally, in the non-oriented case, one can define the Hodge star of a {{mvar|k}}-form as a {{math|(''n'' â ''k'')}}-[[pseudotensor|pseudo differential form]]; that is, a differential form with values in the [[Canonical bundle|canonical line bundle]].

===Codifferential&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Differential form]] --&gt;===
The most important application of the Hodge star on manifolds is to define the '''codifferential''' {{mvar|Î´}} on {{mvar|k}}-forms.  Let

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = (-1)^{n(k-1) + 1} s\ {\star} d {\star} = (-1)^{k}\, {\star}^{-1} d {\star} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''d''}} is the [[exterior derivative]] or differential, and {{math|''s'' {{=}} 1}} for Riemannian manifolds.

:&lt;math&gt;d:\Omega^k(M)\to \Omega^{k+1}(M)&lt;/math&gt;

while

:&lt;math&gt;\delta:\Omega^k(M)\to \Omega^{k-1}(M).&lt;/math&gt;

The codifferential is not an [[antiderivation]] on the exterior algebra, in contrast to the exterior derivative.

The codifferential is the adjoint of the exterior derivative, in that

:&lt;math&gt; (\eta,\delta \zeta) = (d\eta,\zeta). &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Î¶}} is a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form and {{mvar|Î·}} a {{mvar|k}}-form. This identity follows from Stokes' theorem for smooth forms, when

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d (\eta \wedge {\star} \zeta) = 0 = \int_M (d \eta \wedge {\star} \zeta - \eta \wedge {\star} (-1)^{k+1}\,{\star}^{-1} d {\star} \zeta)
=(d\eta,\zeta) -(\eta,\delta\zeta)&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. when {{mvar|M}} has empty boundary or when {{mvar|Î·}} or {{math|â''Î¶''}} has zero boundary values (of course, true adjointness follows after continuous continuation to the appropriate topological vector spaces as closures of the spaces of smooth forms).

Notice that since the differential satisfies {{math|''d''{{i sup|2}} {{=}} 0}}, the codifferential has the corresponding property

:&lt;math&gt;\delta^2 = s^2 {\star} d {\star} {\star} d {\star} = (-1)^{k(n-k)} s^3 {\star} d^2 {\star} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[LaplaceâBeltrami operator|LaplaceâdeRham]] operator is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=(\delta+d)^2 = \delta d + d\delta&lt;/math&gt;

and lies at the heart of [[Hodge theory]]. It is symmetric:

:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta \zeta,\eta) = (\zeta,\Delta \eta)&lt;/math&gt;

and non-negative:

:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta\eta,\eta) \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The Hodge star sends harmonic forms to harmonic forms. As a consequence of the [[Hodge theory]], the [[de Rham cohomology]] is naturally isomorphic to the space of harmonic {{mvar|k}}-forms, and so the Hodge star induces an isomorphism of cohomology groups

:&lt;math&gt;{\star} : H^k_\Delta (M) \to H^{n-k}_\Delta(M),&lt;/math&gt;

which in turn gives canonical identifications via [[PoincarÃ© duality]] of {{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;âk&lt;/sup&gt;''(''M'')}} with its [[dual space]].

==Derivatives in three dimensions==
The combination of the {{math|â}} operator and the [[exterior derivative]] {{math|''d''}} generates the classical operators [[gradient|{{math|grad}}]], [[Curl (mathematics)|{{math|curl}}]], and [[divergence|{{math|div}}]], in three-dimensional Euclidean space. This works out as follows: {{math|''d''}} can take a 0-form (function) to a 1-form, a 1-form to a 2-form, and a 2-form to a 3-form (applied to a 3-form it just gives zero). For a 0-form, &lt;math&gt;\omega=f(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;, the first case written out in components is identifiable as the grad operator:

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \, dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \, dy + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \, dz.&lt;/math&gt;

The second case followed by {{math|â}} is an operator on 1-forms (&lt;math&gt;\eta=A\,dx+B\,dy+C\,dz&lt;/math&gt;) that in components is the curl operator:

:&lt;math&gt;d\eta=\left({\partial C \over \partial y} - {\partial B \over \partial z}\right)dy\wedge dz  + \left({\partial C \over \partial x} - {\partial A \over \partial z}\right)dx\wedge dz+\left({\partial B \over \partial x} - {\partial A \over \partial y}\right)dx\wedge dy.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the Hodge star gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\star d\eta=\left({\partial C \over \partial y} - {\partial B \over \partial z} \right) \, dx  - \left({\partial C \over \partial x} - {\partial A \over \partial z} \right) \, dy+\left({\partial B \over \partial x} - {\partial A \over \partial y}\right) \, dz.&lt;/math&gt;

The final case prefaced and followed by {{math|â}}, takes a 1-form (&lt;math&gt;\eta=A\,dx+B\,dy+C\,dz&lt;/math&gt;) to a 0-form (function); written out in components it is the divergence operator:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\star\eta &amp;= A\,dy\wedge dz-B\,dx\wedge dz+C\,dx\wedge dy \\
d{\star\eta} &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial B}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}\right)dx\wedge dy\wedge dz \\
\star d{\star\eta} &amp;= \frac{\partial A}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial B}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

One advantage of this expression is that the identity {{math|''d''{{i sup|2}} {{=}} 0}}, which is true in all cases, sums up two others, namely that {{math|curl grad ''f'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|div curl '''F''' {{=}} 0}}. In particular, [[Maxwell's equations]] take on a particularly simple and elegant form, when expressed in terms of the exterior derivative and the Hodge star.

One can also obtain the [[Laplacian]]. Using the information above and the fact that {{math|Îâ''f''â{{=}} divâgradâ''f''}} then for a 0-form, &lt;math&gt;\omega=f(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega =\star d{\star d\omega}= \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

{{Buddhism and China}}
The '''Huayan''' or '''Flower Garland''' school of [[Buddhism]] ({{cjkv|t=è¯å´|p=HuÃ¡yÃ¡n}}, from {{lang-sa|script=Latn|Avataá¹saka}}) is a tradition of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist philosophy]] that first flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang dynasty]]. The Huayen worldview is based primarily on the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' ({{zh|t=è¯å´ç¶|p=HuÃ¡yÃ¡n jÄ«ng}}). The name ''Flower Garland'' is meant to suggest the crowning glory of a Buddha's profound understanding of ultimate reality.

The Huayan School is known as [[Hwaeom]] in [[Korea]] and [[Kegon]] in [[Japan]]. This tradition also had a strong influence on [[Chan Buddhism]].

==Origins and development==
[[Image:Datong Huayan Si 2013.08.29 09-37-05.jpg|thumb|220px|Aerial view of Huayan temple, [[Datong]]]]

===Origins===
The earliest texts associated with the Avatamsaka sutra are the ''Dousha jing'' (Taisho 280), produced by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] in the latter part of the second century CE and the ''Pusa benye jing'' (T. 281), translated by Zhi Qian in the early to mid third century. There is evidence that these small Buddhavatamsaka sutras circulated on their own as individual scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The translation of the large Avatamsaka sutra is often dated to the [[Northern and Southern dynasties|Southern Dynasties]] (420-589) when a translation team led by Gandharan master, Buddhabhadra worked on the sutra. There is also evidence of this sutra tradition in the [[Northern and Southern dynasties|Northern Dynasties]] (386-581) where a certain  Xuangao (402-444) taught the ''Huayan samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 169.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Patriarchs===
The founding of the school is traditionally attributed to a series of five "patriarchs" who were instrumental in developing the schools' doctrines. These five are:{{sfn|Cook|1977|p=24}}{{sfn|Imre|2007|p=5}}
#[[Dushun]] ({{zh|t=æé |w=Tu-Shun}}), responsible for the establishment of Huayan studies as a distinct field;
#[[Zhiyan]] ({{zh|t=æºå¼|w=Chih-yen}}), considered to have established the basic doctrines of the sect;
#[[Fazang]] ({{zh|t=æ³è|w=Fa-tsang}}), considered to have rationalized the doctrine for greater acceptance by society;
#[[Chengguan (monk)|Chengguan]] ({{zh|t=æ¾è§|w=Ch'eng-kuan}}), together with Zongmi, are understood to have further developed and transformed the teachings
#[[Guifeng Zongmi]] ({{zh|t=å­å³°å®å¯|w=Kuei-feng Tsung-mi}}), who is simultaneous a patriarch of the [[Chinese ChÃ¡n]] tradition and who also incorporated Taoist and Confucian teachings.

The five monks later honored as Huayan patriarchs were erudite scholar-practitioners who connected Buddhism with Chinese traditional culture closely, creating a Buddhist historical trend in developing multiple facets while the traditionâs essence remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Guo Cheen |last=Chengguan |title=Translating Totality in Parts: Chengguan's commentaries and subcommentaries to the Avatamska Sutra |date=2014 |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-0761863090 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;id=M8M0AwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=Chengguan+huayan&amp;ots=aQzCrGBkJF&amp;sig=Z4PXaQhAC0a5yBKRp3ZwGqEToKs#v=onepage&amp;q=Chengguan%20huayan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their writings, exegeses, and oral teachings, these men each played a significant and distinct role in the development of the school, although there are certain aspects of this patriarchal scheme which are clearly contrived. For example, Chengguan was born 26 years after Fazang's death. According to Robert Gimello's dissertation on Chih-Yen (1976), "most if not all of the major themes of Huayen thought" can be found in the works of the second patriarch Chih-yen, particularly the classification of scriptures and theories on the Dharmadhatu. Thus he names the patriarch Chih-yen (602-668) as the crucial figure in the foundation of Huayan.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition reached the height of its influence under Fazang, who was the Buddhist teacher of the [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu Zetian]] (684â705).{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=15}}

Another important figure in the development and popularization of Huayan thought was the lay scholar [[Li Tongxuan]] ({{zh|t=æéç}}, 635?-730), the author of the ''HuÃ¡yÃ¡n lÃ¹n'' ({{zh|t=è¯å´è«}}), a popular and lengthy commentary on the Avatamsaka sutra. Fazang's disciple Huiyuan (673-743) also wrote a commentary on the Avatamsaka.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page XV.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some accounts of the school also like to extend its patriarch-ship earlier to {{IAST|[[AÅvaghoá¹£a]]}} and [[Nagarjuna|NÄgÄrjuna]].

===Stagnation===
After the time of Zongmi and Li Tongxuan the Chinese school of Huayan generally stagnated in terms of new development, and then eventually began to decline. The school, which had been dependent upon the support it received from the government, suffered severely during the Buddhist purge of 841-845, initiated by [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]], never to recover its former strength. Nonetheless, its profound metaphysics, such as that of the [[Four DharmadhÄtu]] ({{zh|t=åæ³ç}}) of interpenetration, had a deep impact on surviving East Asian schools.

==Texts==
[[Image:Goryeo-Avatamsaka Sutra.vo.12-mid.14c.Leeum.Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|Avatamsaka Sutra, vol. 12, frontispiece in gold and silver text on indigo blue paper, mid 14th century]]
===''Avataá¹saka SÅ«tra''===
The Huayan school's worldview was based primarily on the content of what it considered to be the supreme Buddhist revelation, the ''[[Avataá¹saka SÅ«tra]]''. The ''Avataá¹saka SÅ«tra'' is a compilation of sutras of various length. The earliest of these texts, the ''[[Ten Stages Sutra]]'', maybe dates from the first century CE.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=46}} The DaÅabhÅ«mika SÅ«tra describes the ten stages on the [[Bodhisattva]]-path. The various sutras were probably joined together shortly before its translation into Chinese, at the beginning of the 5th century CE.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=46}}

The ''Avataá¹saka SÅ«tra'' integrates the teachings on [[ÅÅ«nyatÄ]] and Yogacara thinking.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=46}}

The basic idea of the ''Avataá¹saka SÅ«tra'' is the unity of the absolute and the relative:
{{quote|All in One, One in All. The All melts into a single whole. There are no divisions in the totality of reality [...] [I]t views the cosmos as holy, as "one bright pearl," the universal reality of the Buddha. The [[DharmakÄya|universal Buddhahood]] of all reality is the religious message of the Avatamsaka-sutra.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=46-47}}}}

Each part of the world reflects the totality of the cosmos:
{{quote|In each dust-mote of these worlds&lt;br&gt;
Are countless worlds and Buddhas...&lt;br&gt;
From the tip of each hair of Buddha's body&lt;br&gt;
Are revealed the indescribable Pure Lands...&lt;br&gt;
The indescribable infinite Lands&lt;br&gt;
All ensemble in a hair's tip [of Buddha].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=47}}}}
All levels of reality are related and interpenetrated. This is depicted in the image of [[Indra's net]]. This "unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an [[Buddha-nature|inherent nature]] to anything".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=47}}

===Other texts===
Other Mahayana texts such as the ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]'' (''Dasheng Qixin Lun'' å¤§ä¹èµ·ä¿¡è«),  which was a condensation of Chinese thought on awakening and ultimate reality, influenced Huayan masters like Fazang and Zongmi, who both wrote commentaries on the text.{{sfn|Lai|2003}} The [[Lotus sutra]] was also seen as an important text in this school, though not as important as the Avatamsaka. The [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]] was particularly important for Zongmi.

The Huayen patriarchs wrote numerous commentaries and original treatises on the Mahayana sutras and Huayen philosophy. Fazang for example, wrote commentaries on the Avatamsaka, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] and the Awakening of Faith.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 199.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the key Huayen treatises is ''On the Meditation of the DharmadhÄtu'' attributed to the first patriarch [[Dushun]].{{sfn|Chang|1992|p=207}}

Another is [[Fazang]]âs ''Treatise on the Golden Lion'' which is said to have been written to explain Huayen's view of interpenetration to [[Empress Wu]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and practice==
[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 3D rendering of Indra's net.]]

Huayan thought is mainly focused on explaining the nature of the [[Dharmadhatu]], the world as it is ultimately, from the point of view of a fully awakened being. It is often said to be the philosophical articulation of Chan meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 139.&lt;/ref&gt; It it influenced by the Avatamsaka and Buddha nature literature as well as by the Chinese Yogacara and Madhyamaka schools. Patriarchs of the school such as Zongmi were also influenced by Chinese philosophy, particularly the classics of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Fox, Alan. The Practice of Huayan Buddhism, http://www.fgu.edu.tw/~cbs/pdf/2013%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E9%9B%86/q16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpenetration=== 
{{anchor|Interpenetration}} &lt;!-- Anchor for [[Interpenetration (Buddhism)]] from dab page: Interpenetration --&gt;
A key doctrine of Huayan is the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena (''dharmas'') or "perfect interfusion" (''yuanrong'', åè). This is associated with what the Huayan sees as its unique contribution, the "[[dharmadhatu]] [[pratityasamutpada]]". This is described by Wei Daoru as the idea that "countless dharmas (all phenomena in the world) are representations of the wisdom of Buddha without exception" and that "they exist in a state of mutual dependence, interfusion and balance without any contradiction or conflict. This thought essentially argues that there is no relationship of cause and result among phenomena and that things are not formed sequentially. Instead, they constitute the world by the mutual interfusion of complete equality."&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to this theory, any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality, its existence depends on the total network of all other things, which are all equally connected to each other and contained in each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Huayan patriarchs used various metaphors to express this, such as [[Indra's net]], a hall of mirrors and the world text. To illustrate the doctrine to [[Empress Wu]], the patriarch Fazang:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"called for a candle and placed it surrounded by mirrors on every side. When lit, the candle was reflected in each mirror, and each of the reflections in every other mirror so that in any one mirror were the images of all the others."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 140.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This Buddhist doctrine also includes the views that:&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 190-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Practicing one teaching is practicing all teachings" 
*Ending one mental defilement is ending all of them
* Truth (or reality) is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating falsehood (or illusion), and vice versa
* Good is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating evil
* Similarly, all mind-made distinctions are understood as "collapsing" in the [[ÅÅ«nyatÄ|enlightened understanding of emptiness]] (a [[Madhyamaka|tradition]] traced back to the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]])

===Li and Shi===
Another important distinction used by Huayan patriarchs is that of ''li'' and ''shi'', noumenon and phenomenon which was explained using the metaphor of gold and lions, or water and waves. According to Paul Williams:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, noumenon and phenomena mutually interpenetrate and are (in a sense) identical. There is no opposition between the two. The one does not cancel out the other. Second, Fazang explains elsewhere that since all things arise interdependently (following Madhyamika), and since the links of interdependence expand throughout the entire universe and at all time (past, present, and future depend upon each other, which is to say the total dharmadhatu arises simultaneously), so in the totality of interdependence, the dharmadhatu, all phenomena are mutually interpenetrating and identical.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 143.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fourfold Dharmadhatu and meditation===
The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu (''sifajie'', åæ³ç) is explained in the "Meditative Perspectives on the Huayan Dharmadhatu" (''Huayan Fajie Guanmen'', è¯å´æ³çè§é) and its commentaries.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is the central meditative framework for the Huayan tradition. Another key text is the  "Cessation and Contemplation in the Five Teachings of Huayan" (''Huayan wujiao zhiguan'' è¯å´äºææ­¢è§).&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharmadhatu is the goal of the bodhisattva's practice, the ultimate nature of reality which must be known or entered into (''ru'', å¥). According to Fox, the Fourfold Dharmadhatu is "four cognitive approaches to the world, four ways of apprehending reality".The four ways of seeing reality are:&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Garfield|2011|p=76}}

# All dharmas are seen as particular separate events or phenomena (shi äº). This is the mundane way of seeing.
# All events are an expression of ''li'' (ç, the absolute, principle or noumenon), which is associated with the concepts of [[shunyata]],  âOne Mindâ (''yi xin'' ä¸å¿) and [[Buddha nature]]
# Shi and Li interpenetrate (''lishi wuai'' çäºç¡ç¤)
# All events interpenetrate (''shishi wuai'' äºäºç¡ç¤), "all distinct phenomenal dharmas interfuse and penetrate in all ways" ([[Zongmi]]).

The three levels of Huayan meditation on the Dharmadhatu correspond to the last three views of the Dharmadhatu are:&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

#Meditation on âTrue Emptinessâ 
#Illuminating the non-obstruction of principle and phenomena.
#Meditation on âuniversal pervasion and complete accommodation.â

According to Fox, "these dharmadhatus are not separate worlds â they are actually increasingly more holographic perspectives on a single phenomenological manifold...they more properly represent four types or orders of perspectives on experience."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore for Huayan this practice is the solution to the problem of samsara which lies in the "fixation or attachment to a particular perspective. What we think are the essences of objects are really therefore nothing but mere names, mere functional designations, and none of these contextual definitions need necessarily interfere with any of the others."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other practices===
According to Paul Williams, the reading and recitation of the Avatamsaka sutra was also a central practice for the tradition, for monks and laity.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice which is highlighted in the Avatamsaka sutra is that of [[BuddhÄnusmá¹ti]] or ''nianfo''- mindfulness of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 224&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tradition also mentions two key [[samadhi]]s, the ocean-seal samadhi (Ch. ''haiyin sanmei'') and the huayan samadhi (''huayan sanmei'').&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 226-227&lt;/ref&gt; 

Layman Li Tongxuan developed a unique meditative practice based on the 9th chapter of the Avatamsaka sutra. The practice, named 'the contemplation of Buddhalight' (''joguang guan''), focused on tracing the universal light which is radiated by the Buddha in one's mind and expanding it further outwards.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Sudden enlightenment===
Huayan favored the teaching of sudden enlightenment. This is because the Buddha nature is already present in all sentient beings and also because their theory of interpenetration entails that Buddhahood is already present at the first stage of a Bodhisattva's path.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Li Tongxuan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he first access of faith in the mind of the practitioner is in itself the culmination of the entire path, the very realization of final Buddhahood.... âFaithâ or confidence in the possibility of enlightenment is nothing but enlightenment itself, in an ''anticipatory and causative modality''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 144-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhahood was seen as beyond language and stages of practice. Because practices cannot create something that is already not imminent, they were seen as simply revealing what was already there. The patriarch Zongmi formulated his own theory of awakening which was "immediate awakening followed by gradual cultivation" and the view that "immediate and gradual are not only not contradictory, but are actually complementary".&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradox===
Huayan makes extensive use of [[paradox]] in argument and literary imagery. All three types of paradox originate in the tension between [[two truths doctrine|conventional and absolute truth]]. Huayan uses three types of paradox:
1. Emphasizing the concept of ÅÅ«nyatÄ, first is asserted that a phenomenon X is empty, which implies that X is not X. An example from Fazang is the assertion:{{quote|[W]hen one understands that origination is without self-nature, then there is no origination.{{sfn|Wright|1982}}}}
2. Reversing the first paradox by asserting that any empty phenomenon is an expression of the absolute non-duality between emptiness and form, or the identity between conditioned, relative reality and the ultimate truth of [[tathatÄ]]. 
This paradox is derived from two doctrinal sources: 
* The Hua-yen concept of "true emptiness" 
* The Hua-yen interpretation of the dialectic of the One Mind in the ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]''.
Fazang's paradoxical assertion illustrates this second type:
{{quote|When the great wisdom of perfect clarity gazes upon a minute hair, the universal sea of nature, the true source, is clearly manifest.{{sfn|Wright|1982}}}}
3. The third variation of paradox is grounded in the Hua-yen doctrine of the "nonobstruction of all phenomena" (shih shih wu-ai(k)). Each phenomenon is perceived as interpenetrating with and containing all others. This paradoxical violation of the conventional order of time and space is exemplified by Fa-tsang's famous "Essay on the Golden Lion":{{quote|In each and every hair [of the lion] there is the golden lion. All of the lions contained in each and every hair simultaneously and suddenly penetrate into one hair. [Therefore], within each and every hair there are unlimited lions.{{sfn|Wright|1982}}}}

==Classification of Buddhist teachings==
Buddhism was introduced into China in bits and pieces. When the knowledge of Buddhism grew larger, various schools attempted to get a grip on the Buddhist tradition by developing classifications of teachings,{{sfn|Lai|2003}} such as the [[Tiantai#Five Periods and Eight Teachings|Five Periods and Eight Teachings]] of the [[Tiantai|Tiantai-school]].

The Hua-yen school developed a fivefold classification:{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=233}}
# The [[Hinayana|Hinayana-teachings]], especially the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]]
# The [[Mahayana|Mahayana-teachings]], including [[Yogacara]], [[Madhyamaka]]
# The "Final Teachings", based on the [[Tathagatagarbha|Tathagatagarbha-teachings]], especially the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Awakening of Faith]]
# The [[Subitism|Sudden Teaching]], "which 'revealed' (''hsien'') rather than verbalised the teaching"{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=233}}
# The Complete, or Perfect, Teachings of the Avatamsaka-sutra and the Hua-yen school.

Huayan and [[Zen|ChÃ¡n]] had doctrinal arguments regarding which would be the correct concept of sudden awakening. The teachings of the ChÃ¡n-school were regarded as inferior by the Hua-yen teachers. The ChÃ¡n-school polemitized against this classification, by devising its own rhetorics in defense.{{sfn|Buswell|1993}}

==Influence==
The doctrines of the Huayan school ended up having profound impact on the philosophical attitudes of [[East Asian Buddhism]]. According to Wei Daoru their theory of perfect interfusion was "gradually accepted by all Buddhist traditions and it eventually permeated all aspects of Chinese Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Chinese ChÃ¡n]] was profoundly influenced by it, though ChÃ¡n also defined itself by distinguishing itself from Huayan.{{sfn|Buswell|1993}} [[Guifeng Zongmi|Tsung-mi]], the Fifth Patriarch of the Hua-yen school, also occupies a prominent position in the history of ChÃ¡n. During the Song, the Hua-yen metaphysics were completely assimilated by the ChÃ¡n-school.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=48}}

In [[atomic physics]], '''Hund's rules''' refers to a set of rules that German physicist [[Friedrich Hund]] formulated around 1927, which are used to determine the [[term symbol]] that corresponds to the ground state of a multi-[[electron]] [[atom]]. The first rule is especially important in chemistry, where it is often referred to simply as [[Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity|Hund's Rule]].

The three rules are:&lt;ref&gt;G.L. Miessler and D.A. Tarr, Inorganic Chemistry (Prentice-Hall, 2nd edn 1999) {{ISBN|0138418918}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;358â360
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Engel and P. Reid, Physical Chemistry (Pearson Benjamin-Cummings, 2006) {{ISBN|080533842X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;477â479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Herzberg, Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure (Dover Publications, 1944) {{ISBN|0486601153}}, p.&amp;nbsp;135 (Although, Herzberg states these as being two rules rather than three.)&lt;/ref&gt;
# For a given [[electron configuration]], the [[Term symbol#Terms, levels, and states|term]] with maximum [[multiplicity (chemistry)|multiplicity]] has the lowest energy. The multiplicity is equal to &lt;math&gt; 2S + 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Spin quantum number#Total spin of an atom or molecule|total spin angular momentum]] for all electrons. Therefore, the term with lowest energy is also the term with maximum &lt;math&gt; S \, &lt;/math&gt;.
# For a given multiplicity, the term with the largest value of the total [[Azimuthal quantum number|orbital angular momentum quantum number]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; L \, &lt;/math&gt; has the lowest energy.
# For a given term, in an atom with outermost subshell half-filled or less, the level with the lowest value of the [[total angular momentum quantum number]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; J \, &lt;/math&gt; (for the operator &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}=\boldsymbol{L}+\boldsymbol{S}&lt;/math&gt;) lies lowest in energy. If the outermost shell is more than half-filled, the level with the highest value of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; J \, &lt;/math&gt; is lowest in energy.

These rules specify in a simple way how usual energy interactions determine which term includes the ground state. The rules assume that the repulsion between the outer electrons is much greater than the spinâorbit interaction, which is in turn stronger than any other remaining interactions.  This is referred to as the [[angular momentum coupling#LS coupling|LS coupling]] regime.

Full shells and subshells do not contribute to the quantum numbers for total&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|S}}, the total spin angular momentum and for&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}, the total orbital angular momentum. It can be shown that for full orbitals and suborbitals both the residual [[electrostatic energy]] (repulsion between electrons) and the spinâorbit interaction can only shift all the energy levels together.  Thus when determining the ordering of energy levels in general only the outer valence electrons must be considered.

==Rule 1==
{{Main article|Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity}}

Due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], two electrons cannot share the same set of quantum numbers within the same system;  therefore, there is room for only two electrons in each spatial orbital.  One of these electrons must have, (for some chosen direction&amp;nbsp;''z'') ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = Â½, and the other must have ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = âÂ½.  Hund's first rule states that the lowest energy atomic state is '''the one that maximizes the [[Spin quantum number#Total spin of an atom or molecule|total spin quantum number]] for the electrons in the open subshell'''. The orbitals of the subshell are each occupied singly with electrons of parallel spin before double occupation occurs. (This is occasionally called the "bus seat rule" since it is analogous to the behaviour of bus passengers who tend to occupy all double seats singly before double occupation occurs.)

Two different physical explanations have been given&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;I.N. Levine, Quantum Chemistry (Prentice-Hall, 4th edn 1991) {{ISBN|0205127703}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;303â304&lt;/ref&gt; for the increased stability of high multiplicity states. In the early days of [[quantum mechanics]], it was proposed that electrons in different orbitals are further apart, so that electronâelectron repulsion energy is reduced. However, accurate quantum-mechanical calculations (starting in the 1970s) have shown that the reason is that the electrons in singly occupied orbitals are less effectively screened or [[effective nuclear charge|shielded]] from the nucleus, so that such orbitals contract and electronânucleus attraction energy becomes greater in magnitude (or decreases algebraically).

===Example===
[[Image:Si Hund.png|thumb|250px|Hund's rules applied to Si.  The up arrows signify [[electron]]s with up-[[Spin-Â½|spin]].  The boxes represent different [[magnetic quantum number]]s ]]
As an example, consider the ground state of [[silicon]]. The electronic configuration of Si is {{math|1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (see [[spectroscopic notation]]).  We need to consider only the outer 3p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;electrons, for which it can be shown (see [[Term symbol#Term symbols for an electron configuration|term symbols]]) that the possible terms allowed by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] are &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&amp;nbsp;, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&amp;nbsp;, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''S''. Hund's first rule now states that the ground state term is &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''P'' [[triplet state|(triplet P)]], which has ''S'' = 1. The superscript&amp;nbsp;3 is the value of the multiplicity = 2''S'' + 1 = 3. The diagram shows the state of this term with ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.

==Rule 2==
This rule deals with reducing the repulsion between electrons.  It can be understood from the classical picture that if all electrons are orbiting in the same direction (higher orbital angular momentum) they meet less often than if some of them orbit in opposite directions. In the latter case the repulsive force increases, which separates electrons. This adds potential energy to them, so their energy level is higher.

===Example===
For silicon there is only one triplet term, so the second rule is not required. The lightest atom that requires the second rule to determine the ground state term is [[titanium]] (Ti, [[atomic number|{{mvar|Z}}]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;22) with electron configuration {{math|1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;  3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In this case the open shell is {{math|3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the allowed terms include three singlets (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G) and two triplets (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;F). (Here the symbols S, P, D, F, and G indicate that the total [[Angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum quantum number]] has values 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, analogous to the nomenclature for naming atomic orbitals.)

We deduce from Hund's first rule that the ground state term is one of the two triplets, and from Hund's second rule that this term is &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;F (with &lt;math&gt;L = 3&lt;/math&gt;) rather than &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P (with &lt;math&gt;L = 1&lt;/math&gt;). There is no &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;G&amp;nbsp;term since its &lt;math&gt;(M_L = 4, M_S = 1)&lt;/math&gt; state would require two electrons each with &lt;math&gt;(M_L = 2, M_S = +1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, in violation of the Pauli principle. (Here &lt;math&gt;M_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_S&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the total orbital angular momentum L and total spin S along the z-axis chosen as the direction of an external magnetic field.)

==Rule 3==
This rule considers the energy shifts due to [[spinâorbit coupling]]. In the case where the spinâorbit coupling is weak compared to the residual electrostatic interaction, &lt;math&gt; L \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S \, &lt;/math&gt; are still [[good quantum number]]s and the splitting is given by:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \Delta E &amp; =  \zeta (L,S) \{ \mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{S} \} \\ 
\ &amp; =  \ (1/2) \zeta (L,S) \{ J(J+1)-L(L+1)-S(S+1) \} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt; \zeta (L,S)\, &lt;/math&gt;  changes from plus to minus for shells greater than half full. This term gives the dependence of the ground state energy on the magnitude of &lt;math&gt; J \, &lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples===
The &lt;Math&gt; {}^3\!P \, &lt;/math&gt; lowest energy term of Si consists of three levels, &lt;math&gt; J = 2,1,0 \, &lt;/math&gt;.  With only two of six possible electrons in the shell, it is less than half-full and thus &lt;math&gt; {}^3\!P_0 \, &lt;/math&gt; is the ground state.

For [[sulfur]]&amp;nbsp;(S) the lowest energy term is again &lt;math&gt; {}^3\!P \, &lt;/math&gt; with spinâorbit levels &lt;math&gt; J = 2,1,0 \, &lt;/math&gt;, but now there are four of six possible electrons in the shell so the ground state is &lt;math&gt; {}^3\!P_2 \, &lt;/math&gt;.

If the shell is half-filled then &lt;math&gt; L = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;, and hence there is only one value of &lt;math&gt; J \, &lt;/math&gt; (equal to &lt;math&gt; S \, &lt;/math&gt;), which is the lowest energy state. For example, in [[phosphorus]] the lowest energy state has &lt;math&gt; S = 3/2,\  L = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for three unpaired electrons in three 3p&amp;nbsp;orbitals. Therefore, &lt;math&gt; J = S = 3/2 &lt;/math&gt; and the ground state is &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Excited states==

Hund's rules work best for the determination of the [[ground state]] of an atom or molecule.

They are also fairly reliable (with occasional failures) for the determination of the lowest state of a given [[electron configuration#Energy â ground state and excited states|excited electronic configuration]]. Thus, in the helium atom, Hund's first rule correctly predicts that the 1s2s [[triplet state]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S) is lower than the 1s2s singlet (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S). Similarly for organic molecules, the same rule predicts that the first triplet state (denoted by T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in [[photochemistry]]) is lower than the first excited singlet state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), which is generally correct.

However Hund's rules should not be used to order states other than the lowest for a given configuration.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; For example, the [[titanium]] atom ground state configuration is ...3d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for which a naÃ¯ve application of Hund's rules would suggest the ordering &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;F &lt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S. In reality, however, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D lies below &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">'''Industrial metabolism''' is a concept to describe the material and energy turnover of industrial systems. It was proposed by [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]] in analogy to the biological [[metabolism]] as "the whole integrated collection of physical processes that convert [[raw material]]s and [[energy]], plus [[Manual labour|labour]], into finished [[product (business)|product]]s and [[waste]]s..."&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U., 1994. Industrial metabolism: Theory and policy. In: Ayres, R.U., Simonis, U.K. (Eds.), [http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80841e/80841E00.htm Industrial Metabolism: Restructuring for Sustainable Development]. United Nations University Press, Tokyo, pp. 3â20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In analogy to the biological concept of metabolism, which is used to describe the whole of chemical reactions in, for example, a cell to maintain its functions and reproduce itself, the concept of industrial metabolism describes the chemical reactions, transport processes, and manufacturing activities in industry. Industrial metabolism presupposes a connection between different industrial activities by seeing them as part of a larger system, such as a material cycle or the supply chain of a commodity. System scientists, for example in [[industrial ecology]], use the concept as paradigm to study the [[material flow|flow of materials]] or energy through the industrial system in order to better understand [[supply chain|supply chains]], the sources and causes of [[pollutant|emissions]], and the linkages between the industrial and the wider [[socio-technological]] system.&lt;ref&gt;S. Anderberg (1998), "Industrial metabolism and linkages between economics, ethics, and the environment", ''Ecological Economics'', 24, pp 311-320&lt;/ref&gt; 

Industrial metabolism is a subsystem of the [[Anthropogenic metabolism|anthropogenic]] or socioeconomic metabolism, which also comprises non-industrial human activities in households or the public sector.

The '''International Day of the Disappeared''', on August 30 of each year, is a day created to draw attention to the fate of individuals imprisoned at places and under poor conditions unknown to their relatives and/or legal representatives. The impulse for the day came from the [[Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of Detained-Disappeared]] ''(FederaciÃ³n Latinoamericana de Asociaciones de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos,'' or FEDEFAM), a [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 1981 in [[Costa Rica]] as an association of local and regional groups actively working against [[arbitrary arrest and detention|secret imprisonment]], [[forced disappearance]]s and [[kidnapping|abduction]] in a number of [[Latin America|Latin-American countries]].

Work on secret imprisonment is an important part of the activities for a number of international bodies and organizations in the fields of human rights activism and humanitarian aid, including for example [[Amnesty International]] (AI), the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC). The International Day of the Disappeared is an opportunity to highlight these institutions' work, [[raising awareness|increase public awareness]], and to call for donations and volunteers.

Of those agencies, the ICRC has additional privileges due to its special status as a non-governmental sovereign entity and its strict policy of neutrality. In some cases, the ICRC is the only institution granted access to specific groups of prisoners, thereby enabling a minimum level of contact and inspection of their treatment. For affected families, messages transmitted by the ICRC are often the only hint about the fate of these prisoners.

Visiting those detained in relation to conflicts and enabling them to [[Restoring Family Links|restore and maintain contact with their families]], is a very important part of the ICRC's mandate. But the definition of the Missing or the Disappeared goes far beyond the victims of enforced disappearance.   It includes all those whose families have lost contact as the result of conflicts, natural disasters or other tragedies.  

These missing may be detained, stranded in foreign countries, hospitalized or dead.  Through its tracing services and working with the 189 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world, the ICRC seeks to obtain information about their fate on behalf of their families.   It reminds governments and other groups of their obligations to respect the families' right to know the fate of their loved ones.  It also works with families of the missing to help them address their particular psychological, social legal and financial needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2013/08-28-disappeared-missing.htm Families of missing people need better support]&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprisonment under secret or uncertain circumstances is a grave violation of some conceptions of [[human rights]] as well as, in the case of an armed conflict, of [[International Humanitarian Law]]. The [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] adopted a [[Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance]] as resolution 47/133 on December 18, 1992. It is estimated that secret imprisonment is practiced in about 30 countries. The OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has registered about 46,000 cases of people who disappeared under unknown circumstances.

On August 30, 2007, hundreds of [[Philippine]] relatives and supporters of desaparecidos, mostly activists, missing after being abducted or killed by Philippine security forces protested against the government to mark International Day of the Disappeared. Edita Burgos remembered her missing son, Jonas, a member of the Peasants' Movement of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/30/asia/AS-GEN-Philippines-Day-of-the-Disappeared.php  ITH, Hundreds protest in Philippines against abductions]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2008 the [[International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances]], which gathers family member organizations and human rights organizations from around the world, joined hands for a global campaign event to promote the ratification of the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]].

In [[psychoanalytic theory]], the '''Jocasta complex''' is the [[incest]]uous [[sexual desire]] of a mother towards her son.&lt;ref&gt;Jon E. Roeckelein. Elsevier's dictionary of psychological theories. Elsevier, 2006. {{ISBN|0-444-51750-2}}. Page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond de Saussure]] introduced the term in 1920 by way of analogy to its logical converse in psychoanalysis, the [[Oedipus complex]], and it may be used to cover different degrees of attachment,&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Campbell, ''Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary'' (2009)  p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; including domineering but asexual mother love â something perhaps particularly prevalent with an absent father.

==Origins==

The Jocasta complex is named for [[Jocasta]], a Greek queen who unwittingly married her son, [[Oedipus]]. The Jocasta complex is similar to the [[Oedipus complex]], in which a child has sexual desire towards their parent(s). The term is a bit of an extrapolation, since in the original story Oedipus and Jocasta were unaware that they were mother and son when they married. The usage in modern contexts involves a son with full knowledge of who his mother is.

==Analytic discussion==

[[Theodor Reik]] saw the "Jocasta mother", with an unfulfilled adult relationship of her own and an over-concern for her child instead, as a prime source of neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sutherland, ''Breakdown'' (Oxford 1998) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Devereux]] went further, arguing that the child's Oedipal complex was itself triggered by a pre-existing parental complex (Jocasta/[[Laius]]).&lt;ref&gt;George Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) pp. 209â10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] also explored the other (parental) side of the Oedipus complex, pointing to related family dramas such as "mother sleeping with daughter's boyfriend ... when mother has no son to play Jocasta with".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural analogues==
* [[Atossa]], in the Greek tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'', has been seen as struggling in her dreams with a Jocasta complex.&lt;ref&gt;George Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
* Indian folk-tales often feature figures, like Jocasta, expressing maternal desire for their sons.&lt;ref&gt;L. Edmunds/A. Dundes, ''Oedipus: A Folklore Casebook'' (1995) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3534">In [[point-set topology]], '''Kuratowski's closure-complement problem''' asks for the largest number of distinct sets obtainable by repeatedly applying the set operations of [[closure (topology)|closure]] and [[complement (set theory)|complement]] to a given starting subset of a [[topological space]].  The answer is 14.  This result was first published by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Proof==
Letting ''S'' denote an arbitrary subset of a topological space, write ''kS'' for the closure of ''S'', and ''cS'' for the complement of ''S''. The following three identities imply that no more than 14 distinct sets are obtainable:

(1) ''kkS'' = ''kS''. (The closure operation is [[idempotency|idempotent]].)

(2) ''ccS'' = ''S''. (The complement operation is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]].)

(3) ''kckckckcS'' = ''kckcS''. (Or equivalently ''kckckckS'' = ''kckckckccS'' = ''kckS''. Using identity (2).)

The first two are trivial.  The third follows from the identity ''kikiS'' = ''kiS'' where ''iS'' is the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''S'' which is equal to the complement of the closure of the complement of ''S'', ''iS'' = ''ckcS''. (The operation ''ki'' = ''kckc'' is idempotent.)

A subset realizing the maximum of 14 is called a '''14-set'''.  The space of [[real numbers]] under the usual topology contains 14-sets.  Here is one example:
:&lt;math&gt;(0,1)\cup(1,2)\cup\{3\}\cup\bigl([4,5]\cap\Q\bigr),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(1,2)&lt;/math&gt; denotes an [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|open interval]] and &lt;math&gt;[4,5]&lt;/math&gt; denotes a closed interval.

==Further results==
Despite its origin within the context of a topological space, Kuratowski's closure-complement problem is actually more [[algebra]]ic than topological.  A surprising abundance of closely related problems and results have appeared since 1960, many of which have little or nothing to do with point-set topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The closure-complement operations yield a [[monoid]] which can be used to classify topological spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/00927872.2016.1222401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, a '''lamination''' is a :
* "A [[topological space]] [[partition of a set|partitioned]] into subsets"&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|oldid=l120020|id=Lamination}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* decoration (a structure or property at a point) of a [[manifold]] in which some subset of the manifold is partitioned into sheets of some lower dimension, and the sheets are locally [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. 

A lamination of a surface is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a closed subset of the surface into smooth curves.

It may or may not be possible to fill the gaps in a lamination to make a [[foliation]].&lt;ref name="ornl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ortep/topology/defs.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713073050/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ortep/topology/defs.txt |archivedate=2009-07-13 |df= }} Oak Ridge National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''Marital rape''' or '''spousal rape''' is the act of [[sexual intercourse]] with one's spouse without the spouse's [[consent]]. The lack of consent is the essential element and need not involve violence. Marital rape is considered a form of [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual abuse]]. Although, historically, sexual intercourse within marriage was regarded as a right of spouses, engaging in the act without the spouse's consent is now widely recognized by law and society as a wrong and as a crime. It is recognized as [[rape]] by many societies around the world, repudiated by international conventions, and increasingly criminalized.

The issues of sexual and domestic violence within [[marriage]] and the [[family]] unit, and more specifically, the issue of [[violence against women]], have come to growing international attention from the second half of the 20th century. Still, in many countries, marital rape either remains outside the [[criminal law]], or is illegal but widely tolerated. Laws are rarely being enforced, due to factors ranging from reluctance of authorities to pursue the crime, to lack of public knowledge that sexual intercourse in marriage without consent is illegal.

Marital rape is more widely experienced by women, though not exclusively. Marital rape is often a chronic form of violence for the victim which takes place within [[domestic violence|abusive relations]]. It exists in a complex web of state governments, cultural practices, and societal ideologies which combine to influence each distinct instance and situation in varying ways. The reluctance to criminalize and prosecute marital rape has been attributed to traditional views of marriage, interpretations of religious doctrines, ideas about [[Male sexuality|male]] and [[female sexuality]], and to cultural expectations of subordination of a wife to her husbandâviews which continue to be common in many parts of the world. These views of marriage and sexuality started to be challenged in most [[Western countries]] from the 1960s and 70s especially by [[second-wave feminism]], leading to an acknowledgment of the woman's right to [[self-determination]] (i.e., control) of all matters relating to her body, and the withdrawal of the exemption or defense of marital rape.

Most countries criminalized marital rape from the late 20th century onwardâvery few legal systems allowed for the prosecution of rape within marriage before the 1970s. Criminalization has occurred through various ways, including removal of statutory exemptions from the definitions of rape, judicial decisions, explicit legislative reference in statutory law preventing the use of marriage as a defense, or creating of a specific offense of marital rape. In many countries, it is still unclear whether marital rape is covered by the ordinary rape laws, but in some it may be covered by general statutes prohibiting violence, such as [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] laws.

==History==
{{See|History of rape}}
One of the origins of the concept of a marital exemption from rape laws (a rule that a husband cannot be charged with the rape of his wife) is the idea that by marriage a woman gives irrevocable consent for her husband to have sex with her any time he demands it.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Herring. ''Family Law: A Very Short Introduction''. {{ISBN|9780199668526}}. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was described by [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (1609â1676) in ''[[History of the Pleas of the Crown]]'', published posthumously in 1736, where he wrote that "The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract". Also, American and [[English law]] subscribed until the 20th century to the system of [[coverture]], that is, a legal doctrine under which, upon marriage, a woman's legal rights were subsumed by those of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xBlack.htm |title=Extracts from William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England 1765-1769 |accessdate=2015-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032946/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/xblack.htm |archivedate=2008-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication was that once unified by marriage, a spouse could no longer be charged with raping one's spouse, anymore than be charged with raping oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Michelle J. "Marital Rape Laws Globally." Marital Rape: Consent, ''Marriage and Social Change in Global Context''. Ed. Kersti YllÃ¶, M.G. Torres. London: Oxford University Press, 2016. 178. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the wife's legal subordination to her husband was fully ended by the case of ''[[Kirchberg v. Feenstra]]'', {{Ussc|450|455|1981|el=no}}, a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held a [[Louisiana]] [[Head and Master law]], which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/455/|title=Kirchberg v. Feenstra :: 450 U.S. 455 (1981) :: Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center|work=Justia Law|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; English common law also had a great impact on many legal systems of the world through [[colonialism]]. (Bovarnik, 2007).

Marriage was traditionally understood as an institution where a husband had control over his wife's life; control over her sexuality was only a part of the greater control that he had in all other areas concerning her. A husband's control over his wife's body could also be seen in the way [[adultery]] between a wife and another man was constructed; for example in 1707, English Lord Chief Justice John Holt described the act of a man having sexual relations with another man's wife as "the highest invasion of property".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=0PLYXR2x0n0C }} |title=Judging Evil: Rethinking the Law of Murder and Manslaughter |isbn=978-0-8147-6680-4 |author1=Pillsbury |first1=Samuel H |date=2000-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, in many cultures there was a conflation between the crimes of rape and adultery, since both were seen and understood as a violation of the rights of the husband. Rape as a crime was constructed as a property crime against a father or husband not as a crime against the woman's right to self-determination.

The property to be withheld in a female was her virginity; this was the commodity (Bergen, 2016). Following this line of logic, a woman was (and still is in many cultures across the globe) first the property of her father, then, upon marriage, the property of her husband (Bergen, 2016). Therefore, a man could not be prosecuted for raping his own wife because she was his possession (Schelong, 1994). However, if another man raped someone's wife, this was essentially stealing property (a women's sexuality) (Bergen, 2016). In English customs, "bride capture" (a man claiming a woman through rape) was thought to be stealing a father's property by raping his daughter. Therefore, rape laws were created to "â¦protect the property interests men had in their women, not to protect women themselves" (Schelong, 1994). This concept of women as property permeates current marital rape ideology and laws throughout the globe.

In some cultures, marriage is [[arranged marriage|arranged]] for the purpose of creating access to procreation (YllÃ¶, 2016). In these situations, the parties do not necessarily consent to marriage (in the case of [[forced marriage]]) (YllÃ¶, 2016). Following this logic, if consent is not part of marriage, then it is not necessary for intercourse. The autonomy of the wife is also often compromised in cultures where [[bride price]] is paid. Under [[customary law]] in certain parts of Africa, forced sex in marriage was not prohibited, although some specific circumstances, such as during advanced pregnancy, immediately after childbirth, during menstruation, or during mourning for a deceased close relative, were recognized as giving the wife the right to refuse sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theequalityeffect.org/pdfs/ConsentPaperMalawi.pdf |format=PDF |title=THE TREATMENT OF CONSENT IN SEXUAL ASSAULT LAW IN MALAWI |website=Theequalityeffect.org |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape has been, until recent decades, understood as a crime against honor and reputation â not only in domestic legislation, but also in international law; for example according to the Article 27 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], "Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600032?OpenDocument |title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries â Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949 - - Section I : Provisions common to the territories of the parties to the conflict and to occupied territories |website=Icrc.org |date=1949-08-12 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1990s that the ICC statute recognized crimes of sexual violence as violent crimes against the person;&lt;ref name="byu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1294&amp;context=jpl |format=PDF |title=One Small Step for Women: Female-Friendly Provisions in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |author=Rana Lehr-Lehnardt |website=Digitalcommons.law.byu.edu |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Not until the last half century was rape understood to be an offense against the woman, against her dignity, instead of against her family's or her husband's honor".&lt;ref name="byu.edu" /&gt;

==Legal aspect==
Historically, many cultures have had a concept of spouses' [[Marriage#Rights and obligations|conjugal rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/29772 |title=Sex a conjugal right |accessdate=2004-09-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908233453/http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/29772 |archivedate=2004-09-08 |df= |date=2004-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[sexual intercourse]] with each other. This can be seen in English [[common law]], in force in [[North America]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], where the very concept of marital rape was treated as an impossibility. This was illustrated most vividly by [[Sir Matthew Hale]], (1609-1676), in his legal treatise ''[[Historia Placitorum CoronÃ¦]]'' or ''History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (posthumously, 1736) where he wrote that "The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract."

===Formalization of the marital rape exemption in law===

====Common law and the United Kingdom====
{{See also|Rape in English law}}

Sir Matthew Hale's statement in ''History of the Pleas of the Crown'' did not cite any legal [[precedent]] though it likely relied on earlier standards. In a case of [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Lord Audley's]] (1488â1544), for instance, his citation of the jurist [[Bracton]] (c. 1210 â c. 1268) supports this rule, said to have derived from laws of King [[Ãthelstan]] (r. 927â939) where upon the law holds that even "were the party of no chaste life, but a whore, yet there may be ravishment: but it is a good plea to say she was his concubine".&lt;ref&gt;Geis, Gilbert.  âRape in Marriage: Law and Law Reform in England, the United States, and Sweden,â  Adelaide Law Review, 1978; 6(2):285.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawfulness of the conjugal act itself was understood as a [[Entailment|logical consequence]] of a lawful marriage. Marriage created conjugal rights between spouses, and marriage could not be annulled except by a private Act of Parliamentâit therefore follows that a spouse could not revoke conjugal rights from the marriage, and therefore there could be no rape between spouses. The principle was repeated in East's ''Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown'' in 1803 and in Archbold's ''Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases'' in 1822.  The principle was framed as an exemption to the law of rape in an English courtroom in  ''R v Clarence'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarence'' (1888) 22 QBD 23&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not overturned until 1991 by the [[House of Lords]] in the case of ''R. v. R'' in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html|title=''R. v. R'' &amp;#91;1992&amp;#93; 1 AC 599.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where it was described as an anachronistic and offensive legal fiction.

===Feminist critique in the 19th century===
From the beginnings of the 19th century [[feminist movement]], activists challenged the presumed right of men to engage in forced or coerced sex with their wives. In the [[United States]], "the nineteenth-century woman's rights movement fought against a husband's right to control marital intercourse in a campaign that was remarkably developed, prolific, and insistent, given nineteenth-century taboos against the public mention of sex or sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | pages = 1373â1505 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suffragists]] including [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucy Stone]] "singled out a woman's right to control marital intercourse as the core component of equality."&lt;ref&gt;Stanton: "'Woman's degradation is in man's idea of his sexual rights,' Stanton wrote to Anthony. 'How this marriage question grows on me. It lies at the very foundation of all progress.'" Stone: "It is clear to me, that [the marriage] question underlies, this whole movement and all our little skirmishing for better laws, and the right to vote, will yet be swallowed up, in the real question, viz, has woman, as wife, a right to herself? It is very little to me to have the right to vote, to own property &amp;c. if I may not keep my body, and its uses, in my absolute right. Not one wife in a thousand can do that now, &amp; so long as she suffers this bondage, all other rights will not help her to her true position." {{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | pages = 1373â1505 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth century feminist demands centered on the right of women to control their bodies and fertility, positioned consent in marital sexual relations as an alternative to contraception and abortion (which many opposed), and also embraced [[eugenics|eugenic]] concerns about excessive procreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | pages = 1435â43 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[liberalism|liberal]] feminists [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Harriet Taylor Mill|Harriet Taylor]] attacked marital rape as a gross double-standard in law and as central to the subordination of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-86020-8 | id = . .  | editor1 = Nadia Urbinati  | last = Zakaras | first = Alex | author2 = Maria Morales | title = J.S.

Advocates of the [[Free love movement |Free Love Movement]], including early [[Anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminists]] such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Emma Goldman]], as well as [[Victoria Woodhull]], Thomas Low Nichols, and Mary S. Gove Nichols, joined a critique of marital rape to advocate women's autonomy and [[sexual pleasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | pages = 1444â51 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Harman]], a Kansas-based publisher and advocate for women's rights, was jailed twice under the [[Comstock laws]] for publishing articles (by a woman who was victimized and a doctor who treated marital rape survivors) decrying marital rape. [[De Cleyre]] defended Harman in a well-known article, "Sexual Slavery." She refused to draw any distinction between rape outside of and within marriage: "And that is rape, where a man forces himself sexually upon a woman whether he is licensed by the marriage law to do it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1040-0656 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 54â68 [60] | last = Palczewski | first = Catherine Helen | title = Voltairine de Cleyre: Sexual Slavery and Sexual Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century | journal = NWSA Journal | date = 1995-10-01 | jstor = 4316402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] (who was awarded the 1950 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) in his book ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929) deplored the situation of married women. He wrote "Marriage is for woman the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in [[prostitution]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notable-quotes.com/r/russell_bertrand.html |title=Bertrand Russell Quotes |publisher=Notable-quotes.com |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st century criminalization===
The marital rape exemption or defence became more widely viewed as inconsistent with the developing concepts of human rights and equality. Feminists worked systematically since the 1960s to overturn the marital rape exemption and criminalize marital rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 88 | last = Hasday | first = Jill Elaine | title = Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape | journal = California Law Review | year = 2000 | pages = 1482â1505 | doi = 10.2307/3481263 | issue = 5 | jstor = 3481263 | url = https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/occasional_papers/9 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing criminalization of spousal rape is part of a worldwide reclassification of sexual crimes "from offenses against morality, the family, good customs, honor, or chastity ... to offenses against liberty, self-determination, or physical integrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0003122410388493 | volume = 75 | issue = 6 | pages = 867â893 [871] | last = Frank | first = David John | author2 = Bayliss J.

This establishes marital rape as a [[human rights]] violation.

The importance of the right to self sexual determination of women is increasingly being recognized as crucial to [[women's rights]]. In 2012, High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |format=PDF |title=UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA - CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS : Helen Kanzira Lecture |website=Chr.up.ac.za |accessdate=2016-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313210726/http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Violations of women's human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. (...) In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception. (...) Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men. Personal issuesâsuch as when, how and with whom they choose to have sex, and when, how and with whom they choose to have childrenâare at the heart of living a life in dignity."

Despite these trends and international moves, criminalization has not occurred in all [[United Nations member states|UN member States]]. Determining the criminal status of marital rape may be challenging, because, while some countries ''explicitly criminalize'' the act (by stipulating in their rape laws that marriage is not a defense to a charge of rape; or by creating a specific crime of 'marital rape'; or, otherwise, by having statutory provisions that expressly state that a spouse can be charged with the rape of their other spouse) and other countries ''explicitly exempt'' spouses (by defining rape as forced sexual intercourse outside of marriage; or forced sexual intercourse with a woman not the perpetrator's wife; or by providing in their rape provisions that marriage is a defense to a charge of rape), in many countries the ordinary rape laws are silent on the issue (that is, they do not address the issue one way or another)âin such cases, in order to determine whether marital rape is covered by the ordinary rape laws it must be analyzed whether there are judicial decisions in this respect; and former definitions of the law are also important (for instance whether there was previously a statutory exemption that was removed by legislators for the purpose of implicitly including marital rape).

In 2006, the UN Secretary-General's in-depth study on all forms of violence against women stated that (page 113):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/publications/English%20Study.pdf |title=VAW/for printer/1/14/0|format=PDF |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 States. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offence in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted."

In 2011, the [[UN Women]] report Progress of the World's Women:In Pursuit of Justice stated that (page 17):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progress.unwomen.org/pdfs/EN-Report-Progress.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707122615/http://progress.unwomen.org/pdfs/EN-Report-Progress.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=Progress of the World's Women 2015-2016 |work=My Favorite News |accessdate=22 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"By April 2011, at least 52 States had explicitly outlawed marital rape in their criminal code".

Traditionally, rape was a criminal offense that could only be committed outside marriage, and courts did not apply the rape statutes to acts of forced sex between spouses. With changing social views, and international condemnation of sexual violence in marriage, courts have started to apply the rape laws in marriage. The current applicability in many countries of rape laws to spouses is currently unclear, since in many countries the laws have not been recently tested in court. In some countries, notably jurisdictions which have inherited the 1860 Indian Penal Code (such as [[Singapore]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]]) and some countries in the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] region, the laws explicitly exempt spouses from prosecution (for instance, under the 1860 Indian Penal Code, which has also been inherited by other countries in the region, the law on rape states that "Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife is not rape").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globaljusticecenter.net/index.php?option%3Dcom_mtree%26task%3Datt_download%26link_id%3D105%26cf_id%3D34 |title=Domestic Criminal Laws that Conflict with International Law - Burma's Abortion and Rape Laws: a Case Study |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109183807/http://globaljusticecenter.net/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=att_download&amp;link_id=105&amp;cf_id=34 |archivedate=2014-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a country where the rape law ''explicitly excludes'' a husband as a possible perpetrator is [[Ethiopia]]; its rape law states:&lt;ref name="sgdatabase.unwomen.org"/&gt; "Article 620 - Rape: Whoever compels a woman to submit to sexual intercourse ''outside wedlock'', whether by the use of violence or grave intimidation, or after having rendered her unconscious or incapable of resistance, is punishable with rigorous imprisonment from five years to fifteen years".

By 1986, in Europe, there was international pressure to criminalize marital rape: the ''European Parliament's Resolution on Violence Against Women of 1986'' called for its criminalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=VWttAAAAQBAJ |page=1 |title=The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reiterated by the Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=On The Protection Of Women Against Violence |url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805e2612 |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=30 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see para 35) This recommendation provided detailed guidelines on how legislation regarding domestic violence, rape, and other forms of violence against women should operate. It also provided a definition of violence against women, and gave a list of non-exhaustive examples, including marital rape (see section "Definition" para 1). Although the approach on the issue of violence against women has varied significantly among European countries, the traditional view that acts of violence against a woman are crimes against honor and morality, and not against the self-determination of the woman, was still prevalent in the 1990s in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/Honour%20Crimes_EN.pdf "There are many examples from different countries, mainly from the 1990s, but some even more recent than that, where judges handed down lenient sentences simply because the perpetrator claimed to have acted out of respect for his culture, tradition, religion or custom or to restore his so-called ''honour''" (explanations regarding the Istanbul Convention)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040314/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/Honour%20Crimes_EN.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The above recommendation stated that member states must "ensure that criminal law provides that any act of violence against a person, in particular physical or sexual violence, constitutes a violation of that person's physical, psychological and/or sexual freedom and integrity, and not solely a violation of morality, honour or decency" (para 34).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Committee of Ministers - on the protection of women against violence|author1=Council of Europe Committee of Ministers Plenary|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach regarding sexual and other forms of violence against women in specific European countries did not necessarily mirror women's rights in other areas of life (such as public or political life) in those countries: in fact some countries otherwise known for advanced women's rights, such as [[Finland]] and [[Denmark]], have received strong criticism for their policies in this area.

:"A large number of the offences established in accordance with this Convention are offences typically committed by family members, intimate partners or others in the immediate social environment of the victim. There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator."

[[Belgium]] was early to criminalize marital rape. In 1979, the Brussels Court of Appeal recognized marital rape and found that a husband who used serious violence to coerce his wife into having sex against her wishes was guilty of the criminal offense of rape. The logic of the court was that, although the husband did have a 'right' to sex with his wife, he could not use violence to claim it, as Belgian laws did not allow people to obtain their rights by violence.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/womenandjustice/Legal-and-Other-Resources/DisplayCountry.cfm?CountryID=7 |title=Country Details |publisher=Lawschool.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=TEqZlC3bNiYC }} |title=Corps de femmes: sexualitÃ© et contrÃ´le social |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 laws were amended, the definition of rape was broadened, and marital rape is treated the same as other forms of rape.&lt;ref name="coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/violence/EG%282009%29%203_Legislation_F.pdf |title=Legislation Dans Les Etats Membres du Conseil de L'Europe en Matiere de Violence A L'Egard des Femmes |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220015626/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/violence/EG%282009%29%203_Legislation_F.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italy]] the law on rape, ''violenza carnale'' ('carnal violence', as it was termed) did not contain a statutory exemption, but was, as elsewhere, understood as inapplicable in the context of marriage. Although Italy has a reputation of a male dominated traditional society, it was quite early to accept that the rape law covers forced sex in marriage too: in 1976 in ''Sentenza n. 12857 del 1976'', the Supreme Court ruled that "the spouse who compels the other spouse to carnal knowledge by violence or threats commits the crime of carnal violence" ("''commette il delitto di violenza carnale il coniuge che costringa con violenza o minaccia lâaltro coniuge a congiunzione carnale''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.scnu.edu.cn/ngw/ngw/xwbk/An%20overview%20of%20the%20legal%20and%20cultural%20issues%20for%20migrant%20Muslim%20women%20of%20the%20European%20union%20A%20focus%20on%20domestic%20violence%20and%20Italy.pdf |title=An overview of the legal and cultural issues for migrant Muslim women of the European union: A focus on domestic violence and Italy |accessdate=2015-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402085918/http://lib.scnu.edu.cn/ngw/ngw/xwbk/An%20overview%20of%20the%20legal%20and%20cultural%20issues%20for%20migrant%20Muslim%20women%20of%20the%20European%20union%20A%20focus%20on%20domestic%20violence%20and%20Italy.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quing.eu/files/results/cs_italy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Quality in Gender+ Equality Policies : European Commission Sixth Framework Programme Integrated Project |website=Quing.eu |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://womanjournal.wordpress.com/2011/12/08/sesso-matrimonio-e-legge/|title=Sesso, matrimonio e legge|work=WOMAN's JOURNAL|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main article| Marital rape (United States law)}}
The legal history of marital rape laws in the [[United States]] is a long and complex one, that spans over several decades. Traditional rape laws in the US defined rape as forced sexual intercourse by a male with a "female not his wife", making it clear that the statutes did not apply to married couples. The 1962 [[Model Penal Code]] stated that "''A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if: (...)''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/13023/13335893/downloadables/model_penal_code_sel_sec2.pdf |title=SELECTED MODEL PENAL CODE PROVISIONS |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205803/http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/13023/13335893/downloadables/model_penal_code_sel_sec2.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminalization of marital rape in the United States started in the mid-1970s and by 1993 marital rape was a crime in all 50 states, under at least one section of the sexual offense codes.&lt;ref name="ncvc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32701 |title=The National Center for Victims of Crime - Library/Document Viewer |publisher=Ncvc.org |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier laws of the 1970s often indicated that marital rape charges could only be brought about if the husband and wife were no longer living together. The case in the United States that first challenged this cohabitation clause was ''[[Oregon v. Rideout]]'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=License to Rape: Sexual Abuse of Wives|last=Finkelhor|first=David|last2=Yllo|first2=Kersti|publisher=The Free Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=172.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, most states differentiated between the way marital rape and non-marital rape were treated. These differences were visible through shorter penalties, taking into account whether or not violence was used, and allowing for shorter reporting periods. (Bergen, 1996; Russell, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Marital%20Rape.pdf |title=Marital Rape |accessdate=2013-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724221251/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Marital%20Rape.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The laws have continued to change and evolve, with most states reforming their legislation in the 21st century, in order to bring marital rape laws in line with non-marital rape, but even today there remain differences in some states. With the removal, in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=%20SB0556&amp;GA=104|title=Tennessee General Assembly Â» Legislation|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/|title=LexisNexisÂ® Custom Solution: Tennessee Code Research Tool|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the requirement of a higher level of violence from the law of [[Tennessee]], which now allows for marital rape in Tennessee to be treated like any other type of rape, [[South Carolina]] remains the only US state with a law requiring excessive force/violence (the force or violence used or threatened must be of a "high and aggravated nature").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c003.php|title=Code of Laws - Title 16 - Chapter 3 - Offenses Against The Person|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcsd.net/offender/offender-law.htm|title=RCSD Sex Offender Registry Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states the criminalization has occurred by the removal of the exemptions from the general rape law by the legislature; or by the courts striking down the exemptions as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;for example in New York, in 1984, in  ''People v. Liberta'' [http://faculty.law.miami.edu/zfenton/documents/Peoplev.Liberta.pdf ''People v. Liberta'' 64 N.Y.2d 152, 474 N.E.2d 567, 485 N.Y.S.2d 207(1984)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807002114/http://faculty.law.miami.edu/zfenton/documents/Peoplev.Liberta.pdf |title=New York, in 1984, in  ''People v. Liberta''|date=August 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, however, the legislature has created a distinct crime of spousal rape. This is, for example, the case in California, where there are two different criminal offenses: Rape (Article 261) and Spousal Rape (Article 262).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=261-269|title=CA Codes (pen:261-269)|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108112543/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=261-269|archivedate=8 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
=====Background=====
Although the issue of marital rape was highlighted by feminists in the 19th century, and was also deplored by thinkers such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] (see above section 'Feminist critique in the 19th century'), it was not until the 1970s that this issue was raised at a political level. The late 1970s also saw the enactment of [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 1976]], which provided the first statutory definition of rape (prior to this rape was an offense at common law). The [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] in their 1984 Report on Sexual Offences rejected the idea that the offense of rape should be extended to marital relations; writing the following:&lt;ref name="cambridge.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/law-general-interest/reconstructing-criminal-law-text-and-materials-3rd-edition|title=Lacey, Wells and Quick Reconstructing Criminal Law|author=Celia Wells, University of Bristol|date=28 June 2010|work=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 	
:"The majority of us ... believe that rape cannot be considered in the abstract as merely 'sexual intercourse without consent'. The circumstances of rape may be peculiarly grave. This feature is not present in the case of a husband and wife cohabiting with each other when an act of sexual intercourse occurs without the wife's consent. They may well have had sexual intercourse regularly before the act in question and, because a sexual relationship may involve a degree of compromise, she may sometimes have agreed only with some reluctance to such intercourse. Should he go further and force her to have sexual intercourse without her consent, this may evidence a failure of the marital relationship. But it is far from being the 'unique' and 'grave' offence described earlier. Where the husband goes so far as to cause injury, there are available a number of offences against the person with which he may be charged, but the gravamen of the husband's conduct is the injury he has caused not the sexual intercourse he has forced."
	  	
The Committee also expressed more general views on domestic violence arguing that "Violence occurs in some marriages but the wives do not always wish the marital tie to be severed" and reiterated the point that domestic incidents without physical injury would generally be outside the scope of the law: "Some of us consider that the criminal law should keep out of marital relationships between cohabiting partnersâespecially the marriage bedâexcept where injury arises, when there are other offences which can be charged."&lt;ref name="cambridge.org"/&gt;
	 	
Five years later, in [[Scotland]], the [[High Court of Justiciary]] took a different view, abolishing marital immunity, in ''S. v. H.M. Advocate'', 1989. The same would happen in England and Wales in 1991, in ''R v R'' (see below). Very soon after this, in Australia, at the end of 1991, in  ''R v L'', the [[High Court of Australia]] would rule the same, ruling that if the common law exemption had ever been part of the Australian law, it no longer was (by that time most Australian states and territories had already abolished their exemptions by statutory law).&lt;ref name="commonlii.org"&gt;http://www3.commonlii.org/au/journals/GriffLawRw/1993/3.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ending the exemption=====
{{Main|Rape in English law}}
The marital rape exemption was abolished in [[England and Wales]] in 1991 by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], in the case of ''[[R v R]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[1991] UKHL 12&lt;/nowiki&gt; |author= |website= |publisher=[[BAILII]] |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 1 AC 599, [1991] 3 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 767, [1991] 4 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 481, (1991) 135 SJLB 181,  [1992] 1 FZR 217, (1991) 155 JP 989, (1992) 94 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 216, [1992] Fam Law 108, [1992] ''[[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]]'' 207, (1991) 155 JPN 752, (1991) 141 NLJ 1481, [1991] UKHL 12, (1991) ''The Times'', 24 October 1991, (1991) ''The Independent'', 24 October 1991, (1991) ''The Guardian'', 30 October 1991, [[House of Lords|HL]], affirming [1991] 2 WLR 1065, [1991] 2 All ER 257, (1991) 135 ''[[Solicitors Journal|SJ]]'' 384, (1991) 93 Cr App R 1, (1991) 155 JP 373, [1991] Crim LR 475, (1991) 155 JPN 236, (1991) 141 NLJ 383, (1991) The Times, 15 March 1991, (1991) ''The Independent'', 15 March 1991, (1991) ''The Guardian'', 15 March 1991, [[Court of Appeal|CA]], affirming [1991] 1 All ER 747&lt;/ref&gt; It had been promulgated in 1736 in [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Haleâs]] ''History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (see above).
	 	
The first attempted [[prosecution]] of a husband for the rape of his wife was ''R v Clarke''.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Clarke'' [1949] 2 All ER 448&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than try to argue directly against Haleâs logic, the court held that consent in this instance had been revoked by an [[court order|order of the court]] for non-cohabitation. It was the first of a number of cases in which the courts found reasons not to apply the exemption, notably ''R v OâBrien''&lt;ref&gt;''R v OâBrien'' [1974] 3 All ER 663&lt;/ref&gt; (the obtaining of [[decree nisi]]), ''R v Steele''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Steele'' (1976) 65 Cr.App.R. 22&lt;/ref&gt; (an undertaking by the husband to the court not to molest the wife) and ''R v Roberts''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Roberts'' [1986] Crim LR 188&lt;/ref&gt; (the existence of a formal separation agreement).
	
There are at least four recorded instances of a husband successfully relying on the exemption in England and Wales. The first was ''R v Miller'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Miller'' [1954] 2 QB 282&lt;/ref&gt; where it was held that the wife had not legally revoked her consent despite having presented a divorce petition. ''R v Kowalski''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Kowalski'' (1988) 86 Cr. App. R. 339&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by ''R v Sharples'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Sharples'' [1990] Crim LR 198&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth occurred in 1991 in the case of ''R v J'', a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] made after the [[first instance]] decision of the [[Crown Court]] in ''R v R'' but before the decision of the House of Lords that was to abolish the exemption. In ''Miller'', ''Kowalski'' and ''R v J'' the husbands were instead convicted of [[assault]]. The ''R v Kowalski'' case involved, among other acts, an instance of non-consensual [[oral sex]]. For this, the husband was convicted of [[indecent assault]], as the court ruled that his wife's "implied consent" by virtue of marriage extended only to vaginal intercourse, not to other acts such as fellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php|title=Domestic Violence|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907012332/http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php|archivedate=7 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [At that time the offense of 'rape' dealt only with vaginal intercourse]

In ''R v Sharples'' in 1990, it was alleged that the husband had raped his wife in 1989. Despite the fact that the wife had obtained a Family Protection Order before the alleged rape, the judge refused to accept that rape could legally occur, concluding that the Family Protection Order had not removed the wife's implied consent, ruling that: "it cannot be inferred that by obtaining the order in these terms the wife had withdrawn her consent to sexual intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goforthelaw.com/index.php/browsearticles/loadarticleview/167.html|title=Goforthelaw.com - Legal Education and Awareness - Articles - Moot Court help - Directories - Law Web Journal - upcoming Major Central Actsâ¦|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
		
''[[R v R]]'' in 1991 was the first occasion where the marital rights exemption had been [[appeal]]ed as far as the House of Lords, and it followed the trio of cases since 1988 where the marital rights exemption was upheld. The leading judgment, unanimously approved, was given by [[Lord Keith of Kinkel]]. He stated that the contortions being performed in the lower courts in order to avoid applying the marital rights exemption were indicative of the absurdity of the rule, and held, agreeing with earlier judgments in [[Scotland]] and in the [[Court of Appeal]] in ''R v R'', that âthe fiction of [[implied consent]] has no useful purpose to serve today in the law of rapeâ and that the marital rights exemption was a âcommon law fictionâ which had never been a true rule of [[English law]]. Râs appeal was accordingly dismissed, and he was convicted of the rape of his wife.

=====Aftermath=====
By 1991, when the exemption was removed, the [[Law Commission]] in its ''Working Paper'' of 1990 was already supporting the abolition of the exemption, a view reiterated in their ''Final Report'' that was published in 1992; and international moves in this direction were by now common. Therefore, the result of the ''R v R'' case was welcomed. But, while the removal of the exemption itself was not controversial, the way through which this was done was; since the change was not made through usual statutory modification. The cases of ''SW v UK'' and ''CR v UK'' arose in response to ''R v R''; in which the applicants (convicted of rape and attempted rape of the wives) appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that their convictions were a retrospective application of the law in breach of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They claimed that at the time of the rape there was a common law exemption in force, therefore their convictions were ''post facto''. Their case was not successful, with their arguments being rejected by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that the criminalization of marital rape had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the criminal law in the light of the evolution of social norms; and that the Article 7 does not prohibit the gradual judicial evolution of the interpretation of an offense, provided the result is consistent with the essence of the offense and that it could be reasonably foreseen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettextbooks.tk/isbn/9781859419359|title=Cases and Materials on Criminal Law by Mike Molan, Michael T.

A new definition of the offense of 'rape' was created in 1994 by the section 142 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], providing a broader definition that included anal sex; and an even broader definition was created by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], including oral sex. The law on rape does notâand did not ever since the removal of the marital exemption in 1991âprovide for any different punishment based on the relation between parties. However, in 1993, in ''R v W 1993 14 Cr App R (S) 256'', the court ruled:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/s1_rape/|title=S1 Rape:Sexual offences: Sentencing Manual: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008094946/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/s1_rape/|archive-date=8 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It should not be thought a different and lower scale automatically attaches to the rape of a wife by her husband. All will depend upon the circumstances of the case. Where the parties are cohabiting and the husband insisted upon intercourse against his wife's will but without violence or threats this may reduce sentence. Where the conduct is gross and involves threats or violence the relationship will be of little significance."
	
At the time of ''R v R'', rape in [[Northern Ireland]] was a crime at common law. Northern Ireland common law is similar to that of England and Wales, and partially derives from the same sources; so any (alleged) exemption from its rape law was also removed by ''R v R''. In March 2000, a Belfast man was convicted for raping his wife, in the first case of its kind in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/669169.stm|title=BBC News - NORTHERN IRELAND - Husband jailed for raping wife|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Until 28 July 2003, rape in Northern Ireland remained solely an offense at common law that could only be committed by a man against a woman only as vaginal intercourse. Between 28 July 2003 and 2 February 2009 rape was defined by the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 as "any act of non-consensual intercourse by a man with a person", but the common law offense continued to exist, and oral sex remained excluded. On 2 February 2009 the [[Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008]] came into force, abolishing the common law offense of rape, and providing a definition of rape that is similar to that of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] of England and Wales. The [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland]] has the same policy for marital rape as for other forms of rape; it states in its ''Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Rape'' document that: "The Policy applies to all types of rape, including marital and relationship rape, acquaintance and stranger rape, both against male and female victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Rape |url=https://www.ppsni.gov.uk/SiteDocuments/PPS%20Press%20Office/PPSNI%20RAPE.pdf |publisher=Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
The criminalization of marital rape in [[Australia]] occurred in all states and territories, by both statutory and case law, from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.
In Australia, the offense of rape was based on the English common law offense of rape, being generally understood as "[[carnal knowledge]]", outside of marriage, of a female against her will. Some Australian states left rape to be defined at common law, but others had statutory definitions, with these definitions having marital exemptions. The definition of rape in [[Queensland]], for instance, was: "Any person who has carnal knowledge of a woman or girl, not his wife, without her consent, or with her consent, if the consent is obtained by force, or by means of threats or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of bodily harm, or by means of false and fraudulent representations as to the nature of the act, or, in the case of a married woman, by personating her husband, is guilty of a crime, which is called rape."&lt;ref name="qlrc.qld.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qlrc.qld.gov.au/reports/r21.pdf |title=Reform of the Law of Rape |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127114048/http://www.qlrc.qld.gov.au/reports/r21.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions of criminalization of marital rape were already taking place in the late 1970s in Queensland,&lt;ref name="qlrc.qld.gov.au"/&gt; but it was not until 1989 that it was criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/proceedings/20/moran.pdf |title=Patterns of rape : a preliminary Queensland perspective |format=PDF |website=Aic.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Australian state to deal with marital rape was [[South Australia]]. The changes came in 1976, but these were only partly removing the exemption. The ''Criminal Law Consolidation Act Amendment Act 1976'' read:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.flinders.edu.au/jspui/bitstream/2328/20981/1/1976083.pdf |format=PDF |title=An Act to amend the Criminal Law Consolidation Act, 1935-1975. |website=Dspace.flinders.edu.au |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No person shall, by reason only of the fact that he is married to some other person, be presumed to have consented to sexual intercourse with that other person". Nevertheless, the laws did not go as far as equating marital with non-marital rape; the law required violence, or other aggravating circumstances, in order for an act of marital intercourse to be rape; which remained law until 1992. The first Australian jurisdiction to completely remove the marital exemption was [[New South Wales]] in 1981. The same happened in [[Western Australia]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] in 1985; and [[Tasmania]] in 1987. In 1991, in  ''R v L'', the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that if the common law exemption had ever been part of the Australian law, it no longer was.&lt;ref name="seductionandrapre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.commonlii.org/au/journals/GriffLawRw/1993/3.pdf |format=PDF |title=ACTING LIKE A MAN: SEDUCTION AND RAPE IN THE LAW |author=Helen Pringle |website=Commonlii.org |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage after rape==
{{Main article|Marry-your-rapist law}}
In a variety of cultures, marriage after a rape of an unmarried woman has been treated historically as a "resolution" to the rape, that is, a "reparatory marriage". Although laws that exonerate the perpetrator if he marries his victim after the rape are often associated with the Middle East,&lt;ref name="selfscholar"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://selfscholar.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/the-middle-easts-rape-marriage-laws/ |title=The Middle East's "Rape-Marriage" Laws |work=Selfscholar |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such laws were very common around the world until the second half of the 20th century. For instance, as late as 1997, 14 [[Latin American]] countries had such laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/12/world/justice-in-peru-victim-gets-rapist-for-a-husband.html |title=Justice in Peru: Victim Gets Rapist for a Husband |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=12 March 1997 |accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most of these countries have now abolished them.

Whether women were forced to marry their rapist, or the marriage was concluded before the violence began, many victims remain in chronically violent relationships. While there are many reasons for which victims of marital rape remain in their marriages, one important reason is that divorce may be hard to obtain and/or is stigmatized (Kwiatowski, 70). Cross-culturally, one of the barriers that keep victims within their marriages is the shame and guilt they feel surrounding marital rape (Bergen, 2016), or general taboos around sexuality(Kwiatkowski, 2016) (Torres, 2016). Lastly, some victims do not categorize their abuse as marital rape in order to minimize the violence they endure. This is used as a defense mechanism so they can continue to endure their abuse (MenjÃ­var, 2016).

==Prevalence==
The earliest study in the [[Western World]] attempting to survey marital rape was an unpublished study by Joan Seites in the spring of 1975.  Seites sent questionnaires to 40 rape-crisis centers from a list compiled by the Center for Women Policy Studies (Washington, DC).  16 Centers completed questionnaire for a response rate of 40%.  Of the 3,709 reported calls dealing with rape and attempted rape received by the 16 centers, 12 calls dealt with marital rape (0.3%).  Because rape-crisis centers did not always record the relationships of the callers, whether the 12 reported calls fully represent the number of married relationships cannot be certainly known.&lt;ref&gt;Seites, J. Marital rape: Dispelling the myth. Unpublished manuscript, 1975.  Cited in Gelles, Richard J. âPower, Sex, and Violence, The Family Coordinator, National Council on Family Relations, 1977. p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Richard Giles conducted research through in-depth interviews on violence between husbands and wives in a series of three studies between 1974 and 1976. Although the questions asked in the course of the interviews did not specifically pertain to the subject of marital rape, a subsequent analysis of the transcriptions of the interviews identified 4 women who discussed sex-related violence which might be viewed as instances of either attempted or completed marital rape.  In all 4 cases, however, there was no instance a wife actually forced into having sex, although this may have been to avoid the possibility of force.  Although the four women did not view themselves as having been raped, Giles raised the question of whether engaging in the sex act, as an act itself, constitutes violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gelles, Richard J. âPower, Sex, and Violence: The Case of Marital Rape", ''The Family Coordinator'', National Council on Family Relations, 1977. p. 344-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 [[Diana E. H. Russell]], a feminist writer and activist, conducted the seminal study on marital rape.  Her study surveyed a total of 930 women from [[San Francisco]], California (50% non-response rate, non-English speaking Asian women were specifically excluded as non-reliable respondents), of whom 644 were married, divorced, or who self-identified as having a husband although not married. Six of these women (1%) self-assessed that they had been raped by their husbands, ex-husband, or de facto husbands. The survey interviewers, however, classified 74 (12%) of these women as having been raped. Of the 286 non-married women in the sample, 228 (80%) were classified by the survey interviewers as having been raped. Russell found that when repeated instances of rape as classified by the survey interviewers, by husbands or ex-husbands, over the entire course of the marriage are included, these account for 38% of all rape instances, in comparison to the remaining 62% occurring in non-marital instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Diana E. H. |title=Rape in Marriage |location= |publisher=Indiana University Press |edition=New |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-253-35055-8 |pages=57â58, 65â67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Finkelhor]] and Kersti Yllo published a study in 1985 on marital rape that drew on a scientifically-selected area probability sample from the metropolitan [[Boston]] area of 323 women who were either married or previously married who had a child living with them between the ages of six and fourteen.  The study found that of the women who were married the instance of sexual relations through physical force or the threat thereof was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkelhor |first=David |last2=YllÃ¶ |first2=Kersti |title=License to Rape |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-03-059474-8 |pages=204â205, Table Aâ2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Patricia Easteal, then Senior Criminologist at the Australian Institute of Criminology, published the results of survey on sexual assault in many settings. The respondents had all been victims of numerous forms of sexual assault. Of the victim sub-sample, 10.4% had been raped by husbands or ''de facto'' husbands, with a further 2.3% raped by estranged husbands/''de factos''. &lt;!-- irrelevant statistic: 5.5 percent were raped by non-cohabiting boyfriends. (Easteal, 1994) --&gt; &lt;!-- page number would be a help --&gt;

In 2002 Basile published research intended to address the lack of a nationally probability sample to-date that measured intimate sexual coercion faced by married women.  Data were collected in a 1997 national poll by a random telephone survey of 1,108 residents in the continental U.S. of persons 18 years old or older.  The survey had a 50% response rate. Of the 1,108 respondents, the 506 men were excluded from any inquiry into unwanted sexual experiences, leaving 602 (54%) women respondents for the study. 398 (66%) women indicated no unwanted sexual relations (their marital status is not given), and 204 (34%) women responded as having engaged in unwanted sex after being subject to some level of sexual coercion; types of sexual coercion included receiving âa giftâ, â a nice dinnerâ, âa back rubâ, âkissingâ, etc. through threatened harm and physical coercion.  Of this group, a sub-sample of 120 (59%) were married, of which 9% responded as having been subject to physical force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 0886-6708 | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 511â524 | last = Basile | first = Kathleen C. | title = Prevalence of Wife Rape and Other Intimate Partner Sexual Coercion in a Nationally Representative Sample of Women | journal = Violence and Victims | date = October 2002 | doi = 10.1891/vivi.17.5.511.33717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the six scientific studies specifically on marital rape by husbands in the Western world cited above, not one gives an estimation of a rate of marital rape.  The first study, by Giles, does attempt to calculate a rate, but acknowledges that the study was not so designed, and the result (0%) may not be valid.  The next study by Russell which is often cited as the seminal study, conflates ex-husbands and those whom, though unmarried, are counted as putative husbands or de facto âhusbands.â  While the data would allow estimation of a marital rape rate, it is not given.  Moreover, the study's design classifies 80% of non-married women as having been raped is vastly inconsistent with other studies.  The Yllo and Finkelhor 1985  study  is not a nationally representative sample, i.e., limited to Boston, of women who are divorced or married, and who also have a child living with them between the ages of six and fourteen. The study did not separately estimate rates for claims of rape and situations deemed rape-threatening.  In the Giles study, once threatening situations are distinguished, the findings differed significantly.  Easteal's study restricts estimation of prevalence to within only the sub-sample of victims, even though the estimation could similarly be applied to the population.  Basile study, which purportedly was to address the hitherto lack of a nationally probability sample regarding marital rape, omits the number of married women in the sample, thereby precluding the estimation of rape reports by married women in the sample population.  The lack of such estimations make inter-study comparisons difficult, and citation of national statistics subject to the qualification made in the studies.

The prevalence of marital rape is difficult to assess, especially outside the Western World. Discussing sexual matters in many cultures is taboo. One problem with studies on marital rape is that the Western concept of consent is not understood in many parts of the world. Because many societies operate on social norms which create a dual system of sexual moralityâone for sexual intercourse that is ''marital'' which is seen as an obligation that cannot be refused, and ''extra-marital'', which is seen as wrong (or illicit/illegal).  Issues of consent are poorly understood, especially by young wives (which are often young girls who do not have a proper understanding of sexual rights). For instance in an interview in a study for the World Health Organization, a woman from [[Bangladesh]] who described being hit by her husband and forced to have sex said that: "''I thought this is only natural. This is the way a husband behaves''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/summary_report/chapter2/en/index6.html|title=WHO - Gender, equity, human rights|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has, nevertheless, associated specific regions with a very high level of violence, including sexual violence, against women by husbands/partners. An example of such a place is [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/summary_report/chapter2/en/|title=WHO - Gender, equity, human rights|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/9/1/14|title=Reproductive Health - Full text - Intimate partner violence against women in western Ethiopia: a qualitative study on attitudes, woman's response, and suggested measures as perceived by community members|journal=Reproductive Health|volume=9|pages=14|accessdate=22 August 2015|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-9-14|pmid=22906066|pmc=3453497|year=2012|last1=Abeya|first1=Sileshi Garoma|last2=Afework|first2=Mesganaw Fantahun|last3=Yalew|first3=Alemayeh Worku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6040180.stm |title=Ethiopian women are most abused |work=BBC News |date=11 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of marital rape depends on the particularly legal, national, and cultural context. In 1999, the [[World Health Organization]] conducted a study on violence against women in [[Tajikistan]], surveying 900 women above the age of 14 in three districts of the country and found that 47% of married women reported having been forced to have sex by their husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/policy_forum/vand022001.shtml |title=Women, Violence, and Tajikistan |accessdate=2001-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010701180158/http://www.eurasianet.org/policy_forum/vand022001.shtml |archivedate=2001-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Turkey]] 35.6% of women have experienced marital rape sometimes and 16.3% often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousconsultation.org/Special_Features/Amnesty_International_violence_vs_women.htm |title=Amnesty International: Report on Violence Against Women |publisher=Religiousconsultation.org |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and psychological damage==
{{Main article|Effects and aftermath of rape}}

Rape by a spouse, partner or ex-partner is more often associated with physical violence. A nine-nation study within the European Union found that current or ex-partners were the perpetrators of around 25% of all sexual assaults, and that violence was more common in assaults by ex-partners (50% of the time) and partners (40%) than in assaults by strangers or recent acquaintances (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = [[Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit|Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit, London Metropolitan University]] | last = Burman | first = M. | author2 = J.

Attributing the effects of marital rape in research is problematic as it is nearly impossible to find a large enough sample of spouses to study who have experienced sexual violence but have not also been physically assaulted by their spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Bernice, et al., The Relative Effects of Intimate Partner Physical and Sexual Violence on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptomatology, Violence and Victims, 2003 February; 18 vol 1, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Marital rape can spread sexually transmitted diseases and [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], adversely affecting a victim's physical and psychological health. In sub-Saharan countries with very high prevalence rates of HIV, such as [[HIV/AIDS in Lesotho|Lesotho]], instances of multiple partnerships and marital rape exacerbate the spread of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Motalingoane-Khau, Mathabo. â'But He Is My Husband! How Can That Be Rape?': Exploring Silences around Date and Marital Rape in Lesotho.â ''Agenda: Empowering Women for Gender Equity'', no. 74, 2007, pp. 58â66. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/27739343. &lt;/ref&gt;

While rape by a stranger is highly [[psychological trauma|traumatic]], it is typically a one-time event and is clearly understood as rape. In the case of rape by a spouse or long term sexual partner, the history of the relationship affects the victim's reactions.  There is research showing that marital rape can be more emotionally and physically damaging than rape by a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marital Rape|url=http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape|publisher=RAIN|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marital rape may occur as part of an [[Domestic violence|abusive relationship]]. Trauma from the rape adds to the effect of other abusive acts or abusive and demeaning talk. Furthermore, marital rape is rarely a one-time event, but a repeated if not frequent occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/marital_rape.html |title=Marital Rape |publisher=Hiddenhurt.co.uk |date=2007-06-17 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it takes place once or is part of an established pattern of domestic violence, trauma from rape has serious long term consequences for victims regardless of whether the assault is prosecuted or not.

Unlike other forms of rape, where the victim can remove themselves from the company of the rapist and never interact with them again, in the case of marital rape the victim often has no choice but to continue living with their spouse: in many parts of the world divorce is very difficult to obtain and is also highly stigmatized. The researchers Finkelhor and YllÃ¶ remarked in their 1985 metropolitan Boston area study that:&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor, David; YllÃ¶, Kersti (1985). License to Rape. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

:"When a woman is raped by a stranger, she has to live with a frightening memory. When she is raped by her husband, she has to live with the rapist".

==In the context of forced and child marriage==
[[Forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]] are prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in parts of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/introduction_1.shtml|title=BBC - Ethics - Forced Marriages: Introduction|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a child marriage is a marriage where one or both parties are younger than 18.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/14/q-child-marriage-and-violations-girls-rights|title=Q &amp; A: Child Marriage and Violations of Girls' Rights|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of marriages are associated with a higher rate of domestic violence, including marital rape.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/|title=WHO - Child marriages: 39 000 every day|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml|title=I have a right to - BBC World Service|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plan-uk.org/early-and-forced-marriage/ |title=Early and forced marriage - facts, figures and what you can do |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312222100/http://www.plan-uk.org/early-and-forced-marriage |archivedate=2014-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of marriage are most common in traditional societies which have no laws against sexual violence in marriage, and where it is also very difficult to leave a marriage. Incidents taking place in some of these countries (such as [[Yemen]]) have received international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/15/world/meast/yemen-child-bride/|title=Yemen minister on child marriage: Enough is enough|author=Mohammed Jamjoom and Hakim Almasmari, CNN|date=15 September 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24083127|title=Yemeni minister seeks law to end child marriage|journal=BBC News|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization states, under the rubric "Customary forms of sexual violence", (pp.&amp;nbsp;156):&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf?ua=1 |format=PDF |title=World report on violence and health |website=Whqlibdoc.who.int |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of [[child marriage|marrying off young children]], particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice â legal in many countries â is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent. The majority of them know little or nothing about sex before they are married."

One type of forced marriages occurs in Guatemala (called robadas) and Mexico (called rapto). Robadas refers to "â¦abductions, in which women are âtakenâ during the period of courtship, sometimes semivoluntarily but other times by force, by a suitor who wants to start a marital relationship with them" (MenjÃ­var, 2016). Rapto refers to "â¦an abduction for sexual or erotic purposes or marriage" (Bovarnik, 2007). Following the abduction, marriage is often encouraged to maintain the family honor (Bovarnik, 2007).

In these types of forced marriages, the marital union begins with the man's intense sense of control over the woman, combined with the understanding that the wife is the possession of her husband (MenjÃ­var, 2016).  This foundation of marriage had direct implications for sexual violence within the marriage. In reference to the practice of robadas, Cecilia MenjÃ­var (2016) writes, "â¦unions that start out from the violent act of a robada can continue to breed violence, abuse, and mistreatment in the union." In addition, women victims of robadas often face embarrassment and blame, despite the act usually being initiated by male perpetrators (MenjÃ­var, 2016). Women are blamed for disobeying their parents or not resisting their abductor strong enough (MenjÃ­var, 2016). This notion of blaming the woman also occurs in reference to rapto in rural Mexico. Silvie Bovarnik (2007) writes, "In many cases, men and women alike look for the fault of responsibility in women's behavior due to traditional conceptualisations of women as âpillars of honour.â"  Abduction and rape compromises a woman's moral integrity, and therefore her honor (Bovarnik, 2007). Many of these women, who were given little choice in their marriage, are left to live with their abusers.

==Relation to other forms of marital violence==
The historical (and present day in jurisdictions where it still applies) immunity of husbands to have sexual relations with their wives without consent was not the only marital immunity in regard to abuse; immunity from the use of violence was (and still is in some countries) commonâin the form of a husband's right to use "moderate chastisement" against a 'disobedient' wife. In the US, many states, especially Southern ones, maintained this immunity until the mid-19th century. For instance, in 1824, in ''Calvin Bradley v. the State'', the [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] uphold this right of the husband; ruling as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/ms/unknown/court/bradley61gwl.txt |format=TXT |title=Source: Reports Of Cases Adjudged In The Supreme Court Of Mississippi : Written: 1834 : Recorded: 1818 : CALVIN BRADLEY vs. THE STATE |pages=156â157 |website=Files.usgwarchives.net |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Family broils and dissentions cannot be investigated before the tribunals of the country, without casting a shade over the character of those who are unfortunately engaged in the controversy. To screen from public reproach those who may be thus unhappily situated, ''let the husband be permitted to exercise the right of moderate chastisement, in cases of great emergency, and use salutary restraints in every case of misbehaviour, without being subjected to vexatious prosecutions, resulting in the mutual discredit and shame of all parties concerned''."

Although by the late 19th century courts were unanimously agreeing that husbands no longer had the right to inflict "chastisement" on their wives, the public policy was set at ignoring incidents deemed not 'serious enough' for legal intervention. In 1874, the [[Supreme Court of North Carolina]] ruled:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=STATE v. RICHARD OLIVER |url=http://sobek.colorado.edu/~mciverj/2481_70NC60.html |publisher=[[University of Colorado Boulder]] |accessdate=7 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130916014355/http://sobek.colorado.edu/~mciverj/2481_70NC60.html |archivedate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"We may assume that the old doctrine, that a husband had a right to whip his wife, provided he used a switch no larger than his thumb, is not law in North Carolina. Indeed, the Courts have advanced from that barbarism until they have reached the position, that the husband has no right to chastise his wife, under any circumstances.

:But from motives of public policy,--in order to preserve the sanctity of the domestic circle, the Courts will not listen to trivial complaints.

:If no permanent injury has been inflicted, nor malice, cruelty nor dangerous violence shown by the husband, it is better to draw the curtain, shut out the public gaze, and leave the parties to forget and forgive.

:No general rule can be applied, but each case must depend upon the circumstances surrounding it."

Today, husbands continue to be immune from prosecution in case of certain forms of physical abuse against their wives in some countries. For instance, in [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. Examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |title=THE PENAL-CODE WITH AMENDMENTS |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100954/http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/10/19/uae.court.ruling/index.html?_s=PM:WORLD|title=Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wife-on-husband violence==
{{See|Male rape}}
Although most research is focused on wives as victims of marital rape, husbands experience marital rape as well. Little research exists focusing on the specific situation of non-consensual wife-to-husband sexual relations, but evidence suggests that 13%-16% of men are victims of assault by marital or cohabitating partners in their lifetime (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000). Research conducted by Morse (1995), Straus (1977-1978), and Straus and Gelles (1985) suggest that men and women have nearly the same annual rates of victimization of violence by a marital or cohabitating partner (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000). One study that looked at lifetime experiences of marital and cohabitating partner violence found nearly equal rates of victimization among men and women (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000).  However, these statistics convey the larger topic of partner violence and do not reflect rates of marital rape.

==Same-sex couples==
{{See|Male rape}}
Given that same-sex marriage is a relatively new concept, and only minimally accepted globally, little research has explored marital rape in same-sex relationships. More research must be conducted to look at these relationships within the marital context.

==Sustaining factors==
===Legal===
Legally, governments have direct impact on the occurrence of marital rape. The state "â¦engages in the definition, monitoring, and sanctioning of appropriate behavior" (Torres, 2016). This can play out in criminalizing or not criminalizing marital rape and therefore deeming what is appropriate. [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that rape laws in male dominated societies exist to regulate access to women from a male perspective, not to protect women's right to freely decide whether to engage in sexual intercourse or not. Whatever the reason behind such laws, even when state laws have criminalized marital rape, state institutions perpetuate it. For example, although marital rape has been criminalized throughout the United States, the original laws of the 1980s and 1990s treated marital rape differently from non-marital rape, and in some states this continues to be the case even today (see [[Marital rape (United States law)]]). As these laws exemplify, marital rape is seen as somehow less reprehensible than rape outside of marriage (Bergen, 2016). Even when marital rape is prosecuted successfully, courts often pass shorter sentences - even if the law itself does not stipulate this - based on the view that sexual violation is less serious if it occurs within marriage. Following this same understanding, British courts often pass lower sentences to marital rape than to other cases of rape because it is believed that it causes less harm to the victim (Mandal, 2014).

Police departments are another state institution that treats domestic violence differently than other forms of violence. Police often label domestic abuse calls as low priority, respond slower, and focus on what provoked the abuse rather than the violent actions of the perpetrator (Schelong, 1994). Also, they often act as mediators in the situation because they may feel that domestic violence is a family matter and therefore not their business (Schelong, 1994).

While government institutional influences are vast, marital rape is often sustained by cultural ideologies. According to Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, the issue of sexual violence, including within marriage, has not been a political spectrum issue - that is a left wing ''vs''. right wing issue - but a general ubiquitous part of the culture, "The Left and the Right have consistently had different positions on rape; but neither has acknowledged rape from the point of view of the women who experienced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=hwlj |journal=Hastings Women's Law Journal |title=Surfacing Gender: Re-Engraving Crimes Against Women in Humanitarian Law |author=Rhonda Copleon  |volume=5 |date=1994 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culturally unrecognizable===
For many cultures, ideas of marital rape seem often foreign imposed and contradict the belief that such matters should be dealt with privately rather than by the government (Smith, 2016). In other instances, notably in the country of India, members of the government have spoken publicly that marital rape cannot be recognized in their culture. The Indian Minister of State for Home Affairs, [[Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary]], stated in April 2015, "The concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors, including levels of education, illiteracy, poverty myriad social customs and values, religious beliefs, [and] the mindset of the society to treat the marriage as sacrament" (Torres, 2016).
For many other countries, the concept of marital rape is itself an oxymoron (Smith, 2016). Women in these cultures largely "â¦share the cultural logic that marital rape is a contradiction in termsâ¦" while men simultaneously "â¦see women's sexual consent in marriage as taken for grantedâ¦" and therefore "â¦reject the very concept of marital rape" (Smith, 2016).

The act of imposing sexual intercourse against the will of the wife is often not identified as morally wrong, and so it is difficult to attempt to stop the practice, "Often, men who coerce a spouse into a sexual act believe their actions are legitimate because they are married to the woman." (WHO, pp.&amp;nbsp;149).&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; This idea that sexual intercourse in marriage is 'legitimate' and so it cannot be illegal even when forced, is in some parts of the world fueled by the custom of [[bride price]]: its paying is seen as earning the man the right to sexual and reproductive control of his wife. [[UN Women]] recommended the abolition of giving bride price, and stated that: "Legislation should [...] State that a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defense to a domestic violence charge. (pp. 25) "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf |format=PDF |title=Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women |website=Unwomen.oreg |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young women from various settings in [[South Asia]] explained in surveys that even if they felt discomfort and didn't want to have sex, they accepted their husbands' wishes and submitted, fearing that otherwise they would be beaten.&lt;ref name="popcouncil.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/popsyn/PopulationSynthesis1.pdf |title=FORCED SEXUAL RELATIONS among married young women in developing countries |accessdate=2010-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206071139/http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/popsyn/PopulationSynthesis1.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[developing countries]] it is believedâby both men and womenâthat a husband is entitled to sex any time he demands it, and that if his wife refuses him, he has the right to use force.&lt;ref name="popcouncil.org"/&gt; These women, most of them either [[illiterate]] or very poorly educated, are married at very young ages (in [[Bangladesh]], for example, according to statistics from 2005, 45% of women then aged between 25â29 had been married by the age of 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/presskit/factsheets/facts_child_marriage.htm |title=Child Marriage Factsheet: State of World Population 2005 |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and depend on their husbands for their entire life. This situation leaves women with very little sexual autonomy. The notion that women are sexually autonomous and therefore have the ability to give or retract consent is not universally understood. Gabriella Torres writes, "The degree to which women and men view themselves as unique social beings with a full ability to make choices and suffer consequences varies by culture" (Torres, 2016). As a result, in cultures where women are not considered autonomous, they are not in a position to refuse sex: they have to choose between unwanted sex and being subjected to violence; or between unwanted sex and being abandoned by their husbands and ending up living in abject poverty.

According to [[Sheila Jeffreys]], in Western countries, "[[sexual liberation]]" ideologies have aggravated the problem of male sexual entitlement, leading to women submitting to unwanted sex not only due to physical force or illegal threat, but due to societal pressure: "The force which has operated on them [women] all their lives and continues to operate on them within marriages and relationships remains largely invisible. [...]  Such forces include the massive industry of [[sexology]], [[sex therapy]], sex advice literature, all of which make women feel guilty and inadequate for any unwillingness to fulfill a man's sexual desires."&lt;ref&gt;''The Idea of Prostitution'', by Sheila Jeffreys, pp 261 -262&lt;/ref&gt;

The prohibition of rape serves other purposes, such as protection of the rights of male relatives or husband, enforcing of religious laws against sex outside of marriage, or preservation of a woman's respect and reputation in society. Under such ideologies it is difficult to accept the concept of marital rape. [[Richard A. Posner]] writes that, "Traditionally, rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable asset â his wife's chastity or his daughter's virginity".&lt;ref&gt;''Sex and Reason'', by Richard A. Posner, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries of the world, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan, the severity of the legal punishment for rape depends on whether the victim was a [[virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amnestytaunton.wordpress.com/tag/algeria/|title=Algeria - Amnesty International Taunton Local Group|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1720&amp;context=jiws |journal=Journal of International Women's Studies |title=Doctors and Sheikhs: "Truths" in Virginity Discourse in Jordanian Media |author=Ebtihal Mahadeen |volume=14 |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhonda Copleon writes that, "Where rape is treated as a crime against honor, the honor of women is called into question and virginity or chastity is often a precondition."

===The way marriages are arranged===
In many cultures, marriages are still [[arranged marriage|arranged]] for the purpose of procreation, property, and consolidation of [[extended family]] relations, often including a [[bride price]] or a [[dowry]]. In such situations, marriages are pre-arranged as an affair between families and clans. In some cultures, refusal of an arranged marriage is often a cause of an [[honor killing]], because the family which has prearranged the marriage risks disgrace if the marriage does not proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honor Violence FACTSHEET |url=http://www.honordiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HD-FactSheet-HonorViolenceEast.pdf |website=Honor Diaries |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml |title=Ethics: Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sev'er |first1=Aysan |last2=Yurdakul |first2=GÃ¶kÃ§e |title=Culture of Honor, Culture of Change - A Feminist Analysis of Honor Killings in Rural Turkey |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/17543/1/cultureofhonour.pdf |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=9 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since consent to marriage is irrelevant, it follows that consent to marital sex is also irrelevant. Similarly, a woman attempting to obtain a divorce or separation without the consent of the husband/extended family can also be a trigger for honor killings. In cultures where marriages are arranged and goods are often exchanged between families, a woman's desire to seek a divorce is often viewed as an insult to the men who negotiated the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html|title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"|publisher=|date=2002-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/|title=FAQ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fact that people in developing countries are increasingly selecting marriage partners by whether they are in love â a much more Western world view  â does not necessarily improve the situation. These types of marriages, especially in southeastern Nigeria, are putting women in more difficult positions: if one chooses to marry based on love against their family's wishes, admitting violence in the relationship is a disgrace because it means admitting that one made the wrong judgement (Smith, 2016).

===Religion===
====Judeo-Christian====
Most of the [[Western World]] has been strongly influenced by [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Bible]].  The paradisaical narrative of man and woman in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] establishes a foundation of marriage: {{quote|âSo God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.â  âTherefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 1:27, 2:24 (NKJV)))&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This doctrine is repeated in the [[Gospel]] by [[Jesus]], but with the added conclusion âso then they are no longer two, but one flesh".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 19:4-6 , Mark 10:6-8&lt;/ref&gt;  The same doctrine is continued in the [[Epistles]]  in the writings of the Apostle Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Ephesians 5:31 (NKJV&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is further explicated by the Apostle Paul, writing, 

{{quote|âThe wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again.&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:4-5a (NKJV)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the standing of each party to determine how this biblical principle--denial of conjugal relations--was to be effected was codified as an ecclesiastical canon in 280 A.D. by [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|St. Dionysian of Alexandria]]: "Persons who are self-sufficient and married ought to be judges of themselves." &lt;ref&gt;The commentary on this canon reads â... this course ought to be adopted by agreement between both partiesâthat is to say by both the husband and the wife agreeing thereto.â Cummings, D. The Rudder, url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/orthodox/The_Rudder.pdf, Orthodox Christian Educational Society, 1957. pp. 720-721.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laiou, Angelike E. (editor), Consent and Coercion to Sex and Marriage in Ancient and Medieval Societies, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1993, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;The canon was given ecumenical application by the Sixth Ecumenical Council in 691 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, D. The Rudder, url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/orthodox/The_Rudder.pdf, Orthodox Christian Educational Society, 1957. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecclesiastical canons continued to adjudicate marital issues well into the modern era until all but entirely superseded by the civil courts.    

The Christian religion teaches that [[pre-marital sex]] is [[fornication]], and sexual relations by a married person with someone other than his or her spouse is [[adultery]], both of which are [[sins]], while sex within marriage is a [[duty]]. This concept of 'conjugal sexual rights' has the purpose to prevent sin (in the form of adultery and temptation) as well as to enable procreation.

The above is interpreted by some religious figures as to render marital rape an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html |title=Valley paper criticized over pastor's column on spousal rape |work=Alaska Dispatch News |accessdate=22 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203959/http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crisiscentrebahamas.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/marital-rape-ban-tragically-wrong-says-the-christian-council/|title=Marital rape ban 'tragically wrong' says the Christian Council - Bahamas Crisis Centre|work=Bahamas Crisis Centre|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all religious figures hold this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/2009/08/07/priest-signs-online-petition-to-criminalize-marital-rape&amp;post_id=50768|title=priest signs online petition to criminalize marital rape - ucanews.com|work=ucanews.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Pentecostal Christianity prescribes gender expectations for married individuals that "â¦reestablish a patriarchal bargainâ¦" in which "â¦women acquiesce to men's authority in return for certain kinds of support" (Smith, 2016). Husbands are expected to provide for the family, and in return, wives are to submit to their husband's authority (Smith, 2016). Ultimately, this "â¦strengthens some of the gender dynamics that make intimate partner violence possible in the first place" (Smith, 2016).

By contrast, [[Pope Paul VI]] in his 1968 encyclical letter ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' wrote that "Men rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one's partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife."&lt;ref&gt;Paul VI, 1968, ''Humanae vitae'', Â§13.&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching, which has been reaffirmed more recently by [[Pope Francis]],&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis, 2016, ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'', Â§154.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been interpreted by [[Bertrand de Margerie]] to condemn "intra-marital rape", and the use of force in marriage more generally.&lt;ref&gt;de Margery, Bertrand. 'Humane vitae- To which less consideration has been given'. {{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/life-and-family/humanae-vitae/humanae-vitae-to-which-less-consideration-has-been-given/|title=Humanae Vitae - To which less consideration has been given}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other religions====
In other areas around the world, religion is intertwined with the state and directs how people are governed. In Pakistan, there is legal pluralism where the state's legal system intertwines secular and religious law of Islam (Bovarnik, 2007). The result is Shariâa law which represents the religious aspects of the Pakistani legal system. This religious aspect of Pakistani law has many implications for marital rape. For example, Shariâa law requires a female rape victim to provide four Muslim adult male witnesses on her behalf (Bovarnik, 2007). Silvie Bovarnik (2007) argues that "This law hence scrutinizes women's sexual behaviour by criminalising sex outside and decriminalising rape within the context of marriage, while failing to protect women from sexual violence in both contexts." In other words, there seems to be a preoccupation with a woman's sexual misconduct and a simultaneous lack of protection for victims of rape within their own marriage (Bovarnik, 2007). Religious ideologies emphasize a woman's honor, specifically, her virginity (Bovarnik, 2007). In general, "â¦women are traditionally conceptualized as the property of and a symbol of honour for her own family and later that of her husband." (Bovoarnik, 2007). In addition, Islamic norms have traditionally placed restrictions on women's behavior (Bovarnik, 2007). Women are to stay at home, please the men in one's family, raise the children, and to not become involved with the world outside the home (Bovarnik, 2007). As a result, having no connection with the world outside one's family may isolate women victims of marital rape.

Unlike Pakistan, the country of Sudan is ruled by Islamic law; there is no legal pluralism (Tonnesson, 2014). In Sudanese Islamic law, there is an understood exchange in marriage: A man is responsible for providing adequate support (food, shelter, etc.) and in return the woman is supposed to be obedient to her husband (Tonnesson, 2014). This follows the notion of [[qawama]] which states that male guardianship is ultimate and therefore a women's role is to obey her male guardianship (Tonnesson, 2014). In reference to marital rape, religious law in Sudan has implications for divorce. Under Sudanese Islamic law, disobedience from a wife is grounds for divorce, but a husband raping his wife is not (Tonnesson, 2014). 
Due to this understanding of a contractual exchange between husband and wife, forcing a wife to have sex without her consent is not considered rape (Tonnesson, 2014). However, activists with opposing views argue that consent is central to Islam (Tonnesson, 2014). Abdel Halim (2011) argues that without consent, "â¦a sexual act loses its legitimacy" (Tonnesson, 2014).

In India, classical Hindu law defines the state's understanding of marriage. Therefore, marriage is "not viewed as a contract but as a sacrament" (Mandal, 2014). This understanding is the basis for the lack of criminalization of marital rape. India's religious context defines marriages as "divinely ordained" and therefore the "â¦rights and obligations of spouses in conjugal relations [are] beyond the scope of regulation by criminal law" (Mandal, 2014). In other words, criminal law cannot touch that which is deemed sacred under the Hindu religion. As a result, marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance, and other family practices are governed by religious law of each community (Mandal, 2014). However, this statement is controversial because legally marriage any person who is a Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion is governed by [[The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]] in India, which has provisions to prohibit possession of multiple wives, and has a provision of divorce similar to other western marriage laws. These both provisions was not existing in classical Sanskrit law.  This law faced religious opposition but yet implemented the government at that time. The law is now widely acceptable, and implemented in present Indian society. Therefore, stating "In India, classical Hindu Law defines the states understanding of marriage" can be a misleading statement.

===Gender expectations===
{{See|Gender roles}}
Another sustaining factor is the obligatory roles placed on wives and what they come to understand as their "duty". For example, "Vietnamese women are expected to sacrifice for their families, especially for their children, which includes, for some, acceding to husbandsâ sexual demands" (Kwiatkowski, 2016). Their "duty" is to maintain family harmony and happiness (Kwiatkowski, 2016). In Guatemala, violence within marriage is so normalized that wives come to believe that this is âthe way things areâ and it is simply their role as a wife to endure the violence (MenjÃ­var, 2016). This "â¦normalization of violenceâ¦rests on a continuum of coercive power that makes possible the mistreatment of women not only in their homes but also in the community, neighborhood, and society at large" (MenjÃ­var, 2016). Further, because many of these women believe giving sex is their duty, they do not characterize their experience as marital rape (Bergen, 2016). However, "â¦women who have experienced forced sex in marriage understand this experience as an abuse or violation", they just may not characterize it as marital rape (Torres, 2016). Violence is so entrenched in many cultures it simply becomes a way of life, and wives are left to believe they must learn to endure it (MenjÃ­var, 2016).

On the other hand, husbands are influenced by the expectations of their masculinity. In Africa, these expectations include being a husband, father, and head of the household which requires men to provide food, shelter and protection (Smith, 2016). Along with this "â¦obligation of being the provider comes the privilege and authority of patriarchy" (Smith, 2016). As a result, it is often the man's perception that his wife has challenged his authority that leads to the violence (Smith, 2016).

In the United States, masculinity is understood as a fixed entity that exists despite the changes of everyday life (Connell, 45). It is understood as being in comparison to femininity, and more specifically, in opposition to femininity: Masculinity is to superiority as femininity is to subservience (Connell). Therefore, masculinity is correlated with aggression in such a way that scholars argue violence is a way for men to show their masculine identity (Umberson et al., 2003). Another expectation of masculinity is that men are not to show their emotion (Umberson et al., 2003). Instead, as Robert Connell argues, the "masculine prototype" is a strong and stoic man who appears to remain in control of the situation and his emotions (Umberson et al., 2003). This sense of control in Western masculinity has direct implications for domestic violence. Scholars argue that some men use violence to regain this sense of control when it is lost (Umberson et al., 2003).

However, not all men who subscribe to masculinity expectations are violent. In fact, most men, in general, are not violent (Umberson et al., 2003). For those who are violent, ideals of masculinity seem to play some causal role in their violence. Research shows that "violence is more likely among men who experience a disconnection between their personal circumstances and their emotions" (Umberson et al., 2003). Evidently, there seems to be some connection between the masculine expectation of suppressing or disconnecting from one's emotions, and one's tendency to be violent (Umberson et al., 2003).

Although marital rape is not always defined as such in different cultures, there is a universal understanding of the violation that comes with rape. YllÃ¶ &amp; Torres (2016) argue that "â¦marital rape is regularly constituted across cultures as a locally recognized social violationâone that is understood to impede women in those particular cultural contexts from aspiring to a good human life." An aspect of this violation is the notion that the victim has not given their consent, however, historically and presently, consent is not always connected to marital sex. (YllÃ¶ &amp;Torres, 2016). In the United States, a woman's personhood, and therefore her consent, only began with the suffragist movement that sought women's access to equal citizenship (YllÃ¶ &amp; Torres, 2016). Globally, many cultures do not require a woman's consent in marriage because procreation is at the root of such an alliance (YllÃ¶ &amp; Torres, 2016). Further, some women are forced into marriage where her consent is not considered or required (YllÃ¶ &amp; Torres, 2016). Despite this cultural variance, "women across many cultures do experience the violation of rape in marriageâeven if the way that such violations are experienced and understood differs from culture to culture" (YllÃ¶ &amp; Torres, 2016).

==Problems in prosecuting marital rape==
The criminalization of marital rape does not necessary mean that these laws are enforced in practice, with lack of public awareness, as well as reluctance or outright refusal of authorities to prosecute being common in many countries. For instance, in Ireland, where marital rape was made illegal in 1990, by 2016 there had been only two persons convicted of marital rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/marital-rape-remains-extremely-difficult-to-prosecute-1.2734172|title=Marital rape remains extremely difficult to prosecute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, gender norms that often place wives in subservient positions to their husbands, make it more difficult for women to recognize spousal rape or feel confident that it will be addressed by law enforcement. 

In many countries, most often, in practice, there will be no prosecution except in extreme cases that involve a very high level of violence. There have been many problems with prosecuting the perpetrators of spousal rape, chief amongst them has been the reluctance of the various legal systems to recognize it as a crime at all. However, criminalization has opened a new set of problems. To take an example in the [[United Kingdom]], such a category of rape was only recognized by a 1991 [[House of Lords]] decision known simply as ''R v R (1991 All ER 481)''. While most parties agreed with the House of Lords' motive in making the decision, there were many who were of the opinion that the decision involved ''post facto'' criminalization, since the House of Lords were imprisoning spouses for doing what was once, according to the law, their right.

Another problem results from prevailing social norms that exist in certain cultures. In order for any law to be successfully enforced, the acts which it prohibits must be perceived by society as abusive. As such, even if a jurisdiction enacts adequate laws against marital rape, in practice, these laws are ignored if the act is not socially considered a crime. For example, in many parts of the world, where women have few rights, it is considered unthinkable for a woman to refuse her husband's sexual demands; far from being seen as an act of abuse of a wife, marital rape is seen as an incident provoked by the wife who refused to perform her duty: for instance one survey found that 74% of women in [[Mali]] said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?rh04047 |title=Bioline International Official Site (site up-dated regularly) |publisher=Bioline.org.br |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other problems arise from the fact that, even in countries where marital rape is illegal, many people are not aware of the existing laws. Because in most parts of the world marital rape laws are very new, many people do not know of their existence. In many cultures, traditional ideas about marriage are deeply rooted in the conscience of the population, and few people know that forcing a spouse to have sex is illegal. For instance, a report by Amnesty International showed that although marital rape is illegal in [[Hungary]], in a public opinion poll of nearly 1,200 people in 2006, a total of 62% did not know
that marital rape was a crime: over 41% of men and nearly 56% of women
thought it was not punishable as a crime in Hungarian law, and nearly 12% did not know.&lt;ref name="cries unheard" /&gt; In [[Hong Kong]], in 2003, 16 months after the criminalization of marital rape, a survey showed that 40% of women did not know it was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19956971_ITM |title=Article: Publicity urged for law on marital rape. &amp;#124; AccessMyLibrary - Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=2003-11-23 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study in [[South Africa]] (where marital rape was made illegal in 1993) showed that only 55% of respondents agreed with the affirmation "I think it is possible for a woman to be raped by her husband".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alnap.org/pool/files/13452-begin-war-at-home.pdf|format=PDF|title=The War At Home : Gender Based Violence Indicators Project|website=Alnap.org|accessdate=2016-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191608/http://www.alnap.org/pool/files/13452-begin-war-at-home.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although in recent years some countries in Africa have enacted laws against marital rape, in most parts of the continent forced marital sex is not a criminal offense. A 2003 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that: "With few exceptions across Africa, marital rape is not recognized as a crime, and domestic violence is seen as a right of married men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - hivaids1203.doc |format=PDF |website=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptability of domestic violence in most African countries is very high: surveys showed that the percentage of women aged 15â49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea, 80% in Central African Republic, 79% in South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php |title=Unicef Statistics |publisher= |accessdate=22 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704112113/http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php |archivedate=4 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although more countries in Africa are now enacting laws against domestic violence, social norms make it difficult to enforce these laws; and many women are not aware of their rights: for instance in Ethiopia in a survey only 49% of women knew that wife-beating is illegal (it was made illegal under the 2004 Criminal Code).&lt;ref name="sgdatabase.unwomen.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Ethiopia%20-%20Revised%20Criminal%20Code%202004.pdf |title=THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA |accessdate=2013-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202126/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Ethiopia%20-%20Revised%20Criminal%20Code%202004.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/Ethiopia_FGM_Final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and UNICEF in Ethiopia : PROGRESS IN ABANDONING FEMALE GENITAL MULTILATION / CUTTING AND CHILD MARRIAGE IN SELF-DECLARED WOREDAS |website=Unicef.org |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of legal and social recognition of marital rape in Africa has been cited as making the fight against HIV harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/08/18/costs-marital-rape-southern-africa|title=The costs of marital rape in Southern Africa|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NaÃ¯ve set theory''' is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the [[foundations of mathematics]].
&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Miller writes that ''naÃ¯ve set theory'' (as opposed to axiomatic set theory) was used occasionally in the 1940s and became an established term in the 1950s. It appears in Hermann Weyl's review of P. A. Schilpp (Ed). (1946). âThe Philosophy of Bertrand Russellâ ''American Mathematical Monthly'', 53(4), p.&amp;nbsp;210 and in a review by Laszlo Kalmar. (1946). âThe Paradox of Kleene and Rosserâ. ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', 11(4), p.&amp;nbsp;136. (JSTOR). [http://jeff560.tripod.com/s.html] The term was later popularized in a book by [[Paul Halmos]] (1960). ''NaÃ¯ve Set Theory''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike [[Set theory#Axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]], which are defined using formal logic, naÃ¯ve set theory is defined informally, in natural language. It describes the aspects of [[mathematical set]]s familiar in [[discrete mathematics]] (for example [[Venn diagram]]s and symbolic reasoning about their [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

"The working mathematicians usually thought in terms of a naÃ¯ve set theory (probably one more or less equivalent to ZF) ... a practical requirement [of any new foundational system] could be that this system could be used "naÃ¯vely" by mathematicians not sophisticated in foundational research" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=TVi2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236 p.&amp;nbsp;236]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sets are of great importance in [[mathematics]]; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects ([[number]]s, [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], etc.) are defined in terms of sets. NaÃ¯ve set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments. 

==Method==
A '''naÃ¯ve theory''' in the sense of "naÃ¯ve set theory" is a non-formalized theory, that is, a theory that uses a [[natural language]] to describe sets and operations on sets. The words '''and''', '''or''', '''if ... then''', '''not''', '''for some''', '''for every''' are treated as in ordinary mathematics. As a matter of convenience, use of naÃ¯ve set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics &amp;ndash; including in more formal settings of set theory itself.

The first development of [[set theory]] was a naÃ¯ve set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century by [[Georg Cantor]] as part of his study of [[infinite set]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''.

NaÃ¯ve set theory may refer to several very distinct notions. It may refer to
* Informal presentation of an axiomatic set theory, e.g. as in ''[[Naive Set Theory (book)|NaÃ¯ve Set Theory]]'' by [[Paul Halmos]].
* Early or later versions of [[Georg Cantor]]'s theory and other informal systems.
* Decidedly inconsistent theories (whether axiomatic or not), such as a theory of [[Gottlob Frege]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frege|1893}} In Volume 2, Jena 1903. pp. 253-261 Frege discusses the antionomy in the afterword.&lt;/ref&gt; that yielded [[Russell's paradox]], and theories of [[Giuseppe Peano]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peano|1889}} Axiom 52. chap. IV produces antinomies.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Dedekind]].

===Paradoxes===
The assumption that any property may be used to form a set, without restriction, leads to [[paradox]]es.  One common example is [[Russell's paradox]]: there is no set consisting of "all sets that do not contain themselves". Thus consistent systems of naÃ¯ve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.

===Cantor's theory===
Some believe that [[Georg Cantor]]'s set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes (see FrÃ¡polli 1991). One difficulty in determining this with certainty is that Cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system. By 1899, Cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes following from unrestricted interpretation of his theory, for instance [[Cantor's paradox]]&lt;ref name=Letter_to_Hilbert&gt;Letter from Cantor to [[David Hilbert]] on September 26, 1897, {{harvnb|Meschkowski|Nilson|1991}} p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]],&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Cantor to [[Richard Dedekind]] on August 3, 1899, {{harvnb|Meschkowski|Nilson|1991}} p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; and did not believe that they discredited his theory.&lt;ref name=Letters_to_Dedekind&gt;Letters from Cantor to [[Richard Dedekind]] on August 3, 1899 and on August 30, 1899, {{harvnb|Zermelo|1932}} p. 448 (System aller denkbaren Klassen) and {{harvnb|Meschkowski|Nilson|1991}} p. 407. (There is no set of all sets.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor's paradox can actually be derived from the above (false) assumption{{what|date=April 2017}} using for {{math|''P''(''x'') "''x''}} is a [[cardinal number]]". Frege explicitly axiomatized a theory in which a formalized version of naÃ¯ve set theory can be interpreted, and it is ''this'' formal theory which [[Bertrand Russell]] actually addressed when he presented his paradox, not necessarily a theory Cantor, who, as mentioned, was aware of several paradoxes, presumably had in mind.

===Axiomatic theories===
Axiomatic set theory was developed in response to these early attempts to understand sets, with the goal of determining precisely what operations were allowed and when.

===Consistency===
A naÃ¯ve set theory is not ''necessarily'' inconsistent, if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered. This can be done by the means of definitions, which are implicit axioms. It is possible to state all the axioms explicitly, as in the case of Halmos' ''NaÃ¯ve Set Theory'', which is actually an informal presentation of the usual axiomatic [[ZermeloâFraenkel set theory]]. It is "naÃ¯ve" in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics, and in that it doesn't deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system.

Likewise, an axiomatic set theory is not necessarily consistent: not necessarily free of paradoxes. It follows from [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems]] that a sufficiently complicated [[first order logic]] system (which includes most common axiomatic set theories) cannot be proved consistent from within the theory itself &amp;ndash; even if it actually is consistent. However, the common axiomatic systems are generally believed to be consistent; by their axioms they do exclude ''some'' paradoxes, like [[Russell's paradox]]. Based on [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems|GÃ¶del's theorem]], it is just not known &amp;ndash; and never can be &amp;ndash; if there are ''no'' paradoxes at all in these theories or in any first-order set theory.

The term ''naÃ¯ve set theory'' is still today also used in some literature{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} to refer to the set theories studied by Frege and Cantor, rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory.

===Utility===
The choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches is largely a matter of convenience. In everyday mathematics the best choice may be informal use of axiomatic set theory.  References to particular axioms typically then occur only when demanded by tradition, e.g. the [[axiom of choice]] is often mentioned when used. Likewise, formal proofs occur only when warranted by exceptional circumstances. This informal usage of axiomatic set theory can have (depending on notation) precisely the ''appearance'' of naÃ¯ve set theory as outlined below. It is considerably easier to read and write (in the formulation of most statements, proofs, and lines of discussion) and is less error-prone than a strictly formal approach.

== Sets, membership and equality ==
In naÃ¯ve set theory, a '''set''' is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the '''elements''' or '''members''' of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc. For instance, 4 is a member of the set of all even [[integer]]s. Clearly, the set of even numbers is infinitely large; there is no requirement that a set be finite.

[[File:Passage with the set definition of Georg Cantor.png|thumb|Passage with the original set definition of Georg Cantor]]
The definition of sets goes back to [[Georg Cantor]]. He wrote 1915 in his article ''[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=pdf&amp;no_cache=1&amp;IDDOC=36218 BeitrÃ¤ge zur BegrÃ¼ndung der transfiniten Mengenlehre]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;âUnter einer 'Menge' verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung M von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die 'Elemente' von M genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen.â â Georg Cantor&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;âA set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thoughtâwhich are called elements of the set.â â Georg Cantor&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:First usage of the symbol â.png|thumb|right|First usage of the symbol Ïµ in the work ''[https://archive.org/details/arithmeticespri00peangoog Arithmetices principia nova methodo exposita]'' by [[Giuseppe Peano]].]]

=== Note on consistency ===
It does ''not'' follow from this definition ''how'' sets can be formed, and what operations on sets again will produce a set. The term "well-defined" in "well-defined collection of objects" cannot, by itself, guarantee the consistency and unambiguity of what exactly constitutes and what does not constitute a set. Attempting to achieve this would be the realm of axiomatic set theory or of axiomatic '''class theory'''.

The problem, in this context, with informally formulated set theories, not derived from (and implying) any particular axiomatic theory, is that there may be several widely differing formalized versions, that have both different sets and different rules for how new sets may be formed, that all conform to the original informal definition. For example, Cantor's verbatim definition allows for considerable freedom in what constitutes a set. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Cantor was particularly interested in sets containing cats and dogs, but rather only in sets containing purely mathematical objects. An example of such a class of sets could be the [[von Neumann universe]]. But even when fixing the class of sets under consideration, it is not always clear which rules for set formation are allowed without introducing paradoxes.

For the purpose of fixing the discussion below, the term "well-defined" should instead be interpreted as an ''intention'', with either implicit or explicit rules (axioms or definitions), to rule out inconsistencies. The purpose is to keep the often deep and difficult issues of consistency away from the, usually simpler, context at hand. An explicit ruling out of ''all'' conceivable inconsistencies (paradoxes) cannot be achieved for an axiomatic set theory anyway, due to GÃ¶del's second incompleteness theorem, so this does not at all hamper the utility of naÃ¯ve set theory as compared to axiomatic set theory in the simple contexts considered below. It merely simplifies the discussion. Consistency is henceforth taken for granted unless explicitly mentioned.

=== Membership ===
If ''x'' is a member of a set ''A'', then it is also said that ''x'' '''belongs to''' ''A'', or that ''x'' is in ''A''. This is denoted by ''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A''. The symbol â is a derivation from the lowercase Greek letter [[epsilon]], "Îµ", introduced by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1889 and shall be the first letter of the word [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AF á¼ÏÏÎ¯] (means "is"). The symbol â is often used to write ''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A'', meaning "x is not in A".

=== Equality ===
Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are defined to be '''[[Equality (mathematics)|equal]]''' when they have precisely the same elements, that is, if every element of ''A'' is an element of ''B'' and every element of ''B'' is an element of ''A''. (See [[axiom of extensionality]].) Thus a set is completely determined by its elements; the description is immaterial. For example, the set with elements 2, 3, and 5 is equal to the set of all [[prime number]]s less than 6.
If the sets ''A'' and ''B'' are equal, this is denoted symbolically as ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B'' (as usual).

=== Empty set ===
The [[empty set]], often denoted Ã and sometimes &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, is a set with no members at all. Because a set is determined completely by its elements, there can be only one empty set. (See [[axiom of empty set]].) Although the empty set has no members, it can be a member of other sets. Thus Ã â  {Ã}, because the former has no members and the latter has one member. In mathematics, the only sets with which one needs to be concerned can be built up from the empty set alone.({{harvtxt|Halmos|1974}})

== Specifying sets ==
The simplest way to describe a set is to list its elements between curly braces (known as defining a set ''extensionally''). Thus {{math|{1, 2}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} denotes the set whose only elements are {{math|1}} and {{math|2}}.
(See [[axiom of pairing]].)
Note the following points:
*The order of elements is immaterial; for example, {{math|{1, 2} {{=}} {2, 1}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}.
*Repetition ([[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]) of elements is irrelevant; for example, {{math|{1, 2, 2} {{=}} {1, 1, 1, 2} {{=}} {1, 2}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}.
(These are consequences of the definition of equality in the previous section.)

This notation can be informally abused by saying something like {{math|{dogs}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} to indicate the set of all dogs, but this example would usually be read by mathematicians as "the set containing the single element ''dogs''".

An extreme (but correct) example of this notation is {{math|{}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}, which denotes the empty set.

The notation {{math|{''x''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''P''(''x'')}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}, or sometimes {{math|{''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;''P''(''x'')}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}, is used to denote the set containing all objects for which the condition {{math|''P''}} holds (known as defining a set ''intensionally'').
For example, {{math|{''x''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;}} â '''R'''} denotes the set of [[real number]]s, {{math|{''x''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;has blonde hair}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} denotes the set of everything with blonde hair.

This notation is called [[set-builder notation]] (or "'''set comprehension'''", particularly in the context of [[Functional programming]]).
Some variants of set builder notation are:
*{{math|{''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;: ''P''(''x'')}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} denotes the set of all {{math|''x''}} that are already members of {{math|''A''}} such that the condition {{math|''P''}} holds for {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|'''Z'''}} is the set of [[integer]]s, then {{math|{''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;even}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} is the set of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] integers. (See [[axiom of specification]].)
*{{math|{''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} denotes the set of all objects obtained by putting members of the set {{math|''A''}} into the formula {{math|''F''}}. For example, {{math|{2''x''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} is again the set of all even integers. (See [[axiom of replacement]].)
*{{math|{''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;: ''P''(''x'')}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} is the most general form of set builder notation. For example, {{math|{''x'''s&amp;nbsp;owner&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;is a dog}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} is the set of all dog owners.

== Subsets ==
Given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', ''A'' is a '''[[subset]]''' of ''B'' if every element of ''A'' is also an element of ''B''.
In particular, each set ''B'' is a subset of itself; a subset of ''B'' that is not equal to ''B'' is called a '''proper subset'''.

If ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', then one can also say that ''B'' is a '''superset''' of ''A'', that ''A'' is '''contained in''' ''B'', or that ''B'' '''contains''' ''A''. In symbols, ''A''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B'' means that ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', and ''B''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A'' means that ''B'' is a superset of ''A''.
Some authors use the symbols â and â for subsets, and others use these symbols only for ''proper'' subsets. For clarity, one can explicitly use the symbols â and â to indicate non-equality.

As an illustration, let '''R''' be the set of real numbers, let '''Z''' be the set of integers, let ''O'' be the set of odd integers, and let ''P'' be the set of current or former [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]].
Then ''O'' is a subset of '''Z''', '''Z''' is a subset of '''R''', and (hence) ''O'' is a subset of '''R''', where in all cases ''subset'' may even be read as ''proper subset''.
Note that not all sets are comparable in this way. For example, it is not the case either that '''R''' is a subset of ''P'' nor that ''P'' is a subset of '''R'''.

It follows immediately from the definition of equality of sets above that, given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B'' if and only if ''A''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B'' and ''B''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A''. In fact this is often given as the definition of equality. Usually when trying to [[mathematical proof|prove]] that two sets are equal, one aims to show these two inclusions. Note that the [[empty set]] is a subset of every set (the statement that all elements of the empty set are also members of any set ''A'' is [[vacuously true]]).

The set of all subsets of a given set ''A'' is called the '''[[power set]]''' of ''A'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;2^A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;; the "''P''" is sometimes in a [[Script (typefaces)|script]] font. If the set ''A'' has ''n'' elements, then &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; will have &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; elements.

== Universal sets and absolute complements ==
In certain contexts, one may consider all sets under consideration as being subsets of some given [[universe (mathematics)|universal set]].
For instance, when investigating properties of the [[real number]]s '''R''' (and subsets of '''R'''), '''R''' may be taken as the universal set. A true universal set is not included in standard set theory (see '''[[#Paradoxes|Paradoxes]]''' below), but is included in some non-standard set theories.

Given a universal set '''U''' and a subset ''A'' of '''U''', the '''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]''' of ''A'' (in '''U''') is defined as
:''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:= {''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;'''U'''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A''}.
In other words, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ("''A-complement''"; sometimes simply ''A''', "''A-prime''" ) is the set of all members of '''U''' which are not members of ''A''.
Thus with '''R''', '''Z''' and ''O'' defined as in the section on subsets, if '''Z''' is the universal set, then ''O&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the set of even integers, while if '''R''' is the universal set, then ''O&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the set of all real numbers that are either even integers or not integers at all.

== Unions, intersections, and relative complements ==
Given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', their '''[[union (set theory)|union]]''' is the set consisting of all objects which are elements of ''A'' or of ''B'' or of both (see [[axiom of union]]). It is denoted by ''A''&amp;nbsp;âª&amp;nbsp;''B''.

The '''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]''' of ''A'' and ''B'' is the set of all objects which are both in ''A'' and in ''B''. It is denoted by ''A''&amp;nbsp;â©&amp;nbsp;''B''.

Finally, the '''[[complement (set theory)|relative complement]]''' of ''B'' relative to ''A'', also known as the '''set theoretic difference''' of ''A'' and ''B'', is the set of all objects that belong to ''A'' but ''not'' to ''B''. It is written as ''A''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B'' or ''A''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B''.

Symbolically, these are respectively
:''A''&amp;nbsp;âª&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;:= {''x''&amp;nbsp;: (''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A'')&amp;nbsp;[[logical disjunction|or]] (''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B'')};
:''A''&amp;nbsp;â©&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;:= {''x''&amp;nbsp;: (''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A'')&amp;nbsp;[[logical conjunction|and]] (''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B'')}&amp;nbsp;= {''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B''}&amp;nbsp;= {''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A''};
:''A''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;:= {''x''&amp;nbsp;: (''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A'')&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[negation|not]] (''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B'') }&amp;nbsp;= {''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;: not (''x''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''B'')}.

Notice that ''A'' doesn't have to be a subset of ''B'' for ''B''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''A'' to make sense; this is the difference between the relative complement and the absolute complement (''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = ''U''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''A'') from the previous section.

To illustrate these ideas, let ''A'' be the set of left-handed people, and let ''B'' be the set of people with blond hair. Then ''A''&amp;nbsp;â©&amp;nbsp;''B'' is the set of all left-handed blond-haired people, while ''A''&amp;nbsp;âª&amp;nbsp;''B'' is the set of all people who are left-handed or blond-haired or both. ''A''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B'', on the other hand, is the set of all people that are left-handed but not blond-haired, while ''B''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''A'' is the set of all people who have blond hair but aren't left-handed.

Now let ''E'' be the set of all human beings, and let ''F'' be the set of all living things over 1000 years old. What is ''E''&amp;nbsp;â©&amp;nbsp;''F'' in this case? No living human being is [[Oldest people|over 1000 years old]], so ''E''&amp;nbsp;â©&amp;nbsp;''F'' must be the [[empty set]] {}.

For any set ''A'', the power set &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] under the operations of union and intersection.

== Ordered pairs and Cartesian products ==
Intuitively, an '''[[ordered pair]]''' is simply a collection of two objects such that one can be distinguished as the ''first element'' and the other as the ''second element'', and having the fundamental property that, two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their ''first elements'' are equal and their ''second elements'' are equal.

Formally, an ordered pair with '''first coordinate''' ''a'', and '''second coordinate''' ''b'', usually denoted by (''a'', ''b''), can be defined as the set &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a'', ''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

It follows that, two ordered pairs (''a'',''b'') and (''c'',''d'') are equal if and only if ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d''.

Alternatively, an ordered pair can be formally thought of as a set {a,b} with a [[total order]].

(The notation (''a'', ''b'') is also used to denote an [[open interval]] on the [[real number line]], but the context should make it clear which meaning is intended. Otherwise, the notation ]''a'', ''b''[ may be used to denote the open interval whereas (''a'', ''b'') is used for the ordered pair).

If ''A'' and ''B'' are sets, then the '''[[Cartesian product]]''' (or simply '''product''') is defined to be:
:''A''&amp;nbsp;Ã ''B''&amp;nbsp;= {(''a'',''b'')&amp;nbsp;: ''a'' is in ''A'' and ''b'' is in ''B''}.
That is, ''A''&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;''B'' is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of ''A'' and whose second coordinate is an element of ''B''.

This definition may be extended to a set ''A''&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;''C'' of ordered triples, and more generally to sets of ordered [[n-tuple]]s for any positive integer ''n''.
It is even possible to define infinite [[Cartesian product]]s, but this requires a more recondite definition of the product.

Cartesian products were first developed by [[RenÃ© Descartes]] in the context of [[analytic geometry]]. If '''R''' denotes the set of all [[real number]]s, then '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;'''R''' represents the [[Euclidean plane]] and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;'''R''' represents three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

== Some important sets ==
There are some ubiquitous sets that for which the notation is almost universal. Some of these are listed below. In the list, ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' refer [[natural number]]s, and ''r'' and ''s'' are [[real number]]s.
# [[Natural number]]s are used for counting. A [[blackboard bold]] capital '''N''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set.
# [[Integer]]s appear as solutions for ''x'' in equations like ''x'' + ''a'' = ''b''. A blackboard bold capital '''Z''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set (from the German ''Zahlen'', meaning ''numbers'').
# [[Rational number]]s appear as solutions to equations like ''a'' + ''bx'' = ''c''. A blackboard bold capital '''Q''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set (for ''[[quotient]]'', because R is used for the set of real numbers).
# [[Algebraic number]]s appear as solutions to [[polynomial]] equations (with integer coefficients) and may involve [[Nth root|radicals]] (including &lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1\,}&lt;/math&gt;) and certain other [[irrational number]]s. A '''Q''' with an overline (&lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set. The overline denotes the operation of [[algebraic closure]].
# [[Real number]]s represent the "real line" and include all numbers that can be approximated by rationals. These numbers may be rational or algebraic but may also be [[transcendental number]]s, which cannot appear as solutions to polynomial equations with rational coefficients. A blackboard bold capital '''R''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set.
# [[Complex number]]s are sums of a real and an imaginary number: &lt;math&gt;r+s\,i&lt;/math&gt;. Here either &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; (or both) can be zero; thus, the set of real numbers and the set of strictly imaginary numbers are subsets of the set of complex numbers, which form an [[algebraic closure]] for the set of real numbers, meaning that every polynomial with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; has at least one [[Root of a function|root]] in this set. A blackboard bold capital '''C''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set. Note that since a number &lt;math&gt;r+s\,i&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with a point &lt;math&gt;(r,s)&lt;/math&gt; in the plane, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is basically "the same" as the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;Ã&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; ("the same" meaning that any point in one determines a unique point in the other and for the result of calculations, it doesn't matter which one is used for the calculation, as long as multiplication rule is appropriate for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;).

== Paradoxes in early set theory ==
{{main|Paradox}}
The unrestricted formation principle of sets referred to as the [[Axiom schema of specification#Unrestricted comprehension|axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension]],
:''If'' {{math|''P''}} ''is a property, then there exists a set'' {{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : ''P''(''x'')}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} ('''false'''),&lt;ref name=Jech&gt;{{harvnb|Jech|2002}} p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
is the source of several early appearing paradoxes:
*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : ''x'' is an ordinal}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} leads 1897 to the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], the first published [[antinomy]].
*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : ''x'' is a cardinal}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} produced [[Cantor's paradox]] in 1897.&lt;ref name=Letter_to_Hilbert/&gt;
*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : {} {{=}} {}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} yielded '''Cantor's second antinomy''' in the year 1899.&lt;ref name=Letters_to_Dedekind/&gt; Here the property {{math|''P''}} is true for all {{math|''x''}}, whatever {{math|''x''}} may be, so {{math|''Y''}} would be a [[universal set]], containing everything.
*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : ''x'' â ''x''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}, i.e. the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as elements gave [[Russell's paradox]] 1902.

If the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is weakened to the [[axiom schema of specification]] or '''axiom schema of separation''',
:''If'' {{math|''P''}} ''is a property, then for any set'' {{math|''X''}} ''there exists a set'' {{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' â ''X'' : ''P''(''x'')}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}},&lt;ref name=Jech/&gt;
then all the above paradoxes disappear.&lt;ref name=Jech/&gt; There is a corollary. With the axiom schema of separation as an axiom of the theory, it follows, as a theorem of the theory:
:''The set of all sets does not exist''.
Or, more spectacularly (Halmos' phrasing&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Halmos|year=1974|title=NaÃ¯ve Set Theory|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;): There is no [[Domain of discourse|universe]]. ''Proof'': Suppose that it exists and call it {{math|''U''}}. Now apply the axiom schema of separation with {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''U''}} and for {{math|''P''(''x'')}} use {{math|''x'' â ''x''}}. This leads to Russell's paradox again. Hence {{math|''U''}} can't exist in this theory.&lt;ref name=Jech/&gt;

Related to the above constructions is formation of the set
*{{math|''Y'' {{=}} {''x'' : (''x'' â ''x'') â {} â  {}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}, where the statement following the implication certainly is false. It follows, from the definition of {{math|''Y''}}, using the usual inference rules (and some afterthought when reading the proof in the linked article below) both that {{math|''Y'' â ''Y'' â {} â  {}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} and {{math|''Y'' â ''Y''}} holds, hence {{math|{} â  {}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}. This is [[Curry's paradox#Naive set theory|Curry's paradox]].

It is (perhaps surprisingly) not the possibility of {{math|''x'' â ''x''}} that is problematic. It is again the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension allowing {{math|(''x'' â ''x'') â {} â  {}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} for {{math|''P''(''x'')}}. With the axiom schema of specification instead of unrestricted comprehension, the conclusion {{math|''Y'' â ''Y''}} doesn't hold and, hence {{math|{} â  {}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} is not a logical consequence.

Nonetheless, the possibility of {{math|''x'' â ''x''}} is often removed explicitly&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Halmos|year=1974|title=NaÃ¯ve Set Theory}} See discussion around Russell's paradox.&lt;/ref&gt; or, e.g. in ZFC, implicitly,&lt;ref name="Jech 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Jech|2002}} Section 1.6.&lt;/ref&gt; by demanding the [[axiom of regularity]] to hold.&lt;ref name="Jech 2002"/&gt; One consequence of it is
:''There is no set'' {{math|''X''}} ''for which'' {{math|''X'' â ''X''}},
or, in other words, no set is an element of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jech|2002}} p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The axiom schema of separation is simply too weak (while unrestricted comprehension is a very strong axiom&amp;mdash;too strong for set theory) to develop set theory with its usual operations and constructions outlined above.&lt;ref name=Jech/&gt; The axiom of regularity is of a restrictive nature as well. Therefore, one is led to the formulation of other axioms to guarantee the existence of enough sets to form a set theory. Some of these have been described informally above and many others are possible. Not all conceivable axioms can be combined freely into consistent theories. For example, the [[axiom of choice]] of ZFC is incompatible with the conceivable '''every set of reals is [[Lebesgue measurable]]'''. The former implies the latter is false.

'''''Natura naturata''''' is a [[Latin]] term coined in the Middle Ages, mainly used later by [[Baruch Spinoza]] meaning "Nature natured", or "Nature already created".  The term adds the suffix for the Latin feminine [[past participle]] (''-ata'') to the verb ''naturo'', to create "natur'''ed'''".  The term describes a passive God, or more specifically, the passivity of God (substance) when it is predicated into modes, and is contrasted with the second part of Spinoza's dichotomy, ''[[natura naturans]]'', meaning "nature naturing", or "nature in the active sense". 

The distinction is expressed in Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[B]y ''Natura naturans'' we must understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''or'' such attributes of substance as express an eternal and infinite essence, that is â¦ God, insofar as he is considered as a free cause. &lt;br&gt; But by ''Natura naturata'' I understand whatever follows from the necessity of God's nature, ''or'' from God's attributes, that is, all the modes of God's attributes insofar as they are considered as things which are in God, and can neither be nor be conceived without God.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Prop. 29, Scholium. Trans: Edwin Curley.  London: Penguin, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15894">'''Newton's law of cooling''' states that ''the rate of [[heat]] loss of a body is directly proportional to the difference in the [[temperature]]s between the body and its surroundings provided the temperature difference is small and the nature of radiating surface remains same.'' As such, it is equivalent to a statement that the [[heat transfer coefficient]], which mediates between heat losses and temperature differences, is a constant. This condition is generally true in [[thermal conduction]] (where it is guaranteed by [[Thermal conduction#Fourier.27s law|Fourier's law]]), but it is often only approximately true in conditions of [[convective heat transfer]], where a number of physical processes make effective heat transfer coefficients somewhat dependent on temperature differences. Finally, in the case of heat transfer by [[thermal radiation]], Newton's law of cooling is not true.

[[Sir Isaac Newton]] did not originally state his law in the above form in 1701, when it was originally formulated. Rather, using today's terms, Newton noted after some mathematical manipulation that ''the rate of temperature change'' of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings. This final simplest version of the law given by Newton himself, was partly due to confusion in Newton's time between the concepts of heat and temperature, which would not be fully disentangled until much later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paginas.fisica.uson.mx/laura.yeomans/tc/Sci-Edu-Springer-2010.pdf History of Newton's cooling law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614122639/http://paginas.fisica.uson.mx/laura.yeomans/tc/Sci-Edu-Springer-2010.pdf |date=2015-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When stated in terms of temperature differences, Newton's law (with several further simplifying assumptions, such as a low [[Biot number]] and temperature-independent heat capacity) results in a simple differential equation for temperature-difference as a function of time. This equation has a solution that specifies a simple negative exponential rate of temperature-difference decrease, over time. This characteristic time function for temperature-difference behavior, is also associated with Newton's law of cooling.

== Relationship to mechanism of cooling==
Convection-cooling is sometimes called "Newton's law of cooling." This use is based on a work by Isaac Newton published anonymously as "Scala graduum Caloris. Calorum Descriptiones &amp; signa." in ''Philosophical Transactions'', 1701.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x8NeAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA824#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 824]&amp;ndash;829; 
ed. Joannes Nichols, ''Isaaci Newtoni Opera quae exstant omnia'', vol. 4 (1782), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2FzJqaJMUC&amp;pg=PA403 403]&amp;ndash;407.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where the [[heat transfer coefficient]] is independent, or relatively independent, of the temperature difference between object and environment, Newton's law is followed. This independence is sometimes the case, but is not guaranteed to be so. The heat transfer coefficient is often relatively independent of temperature in purely conduction-type cooling, but becomes a function of the temperature in classical natural convective heat transfer. In this case, Newton's law only approximates the result when the temperature changes are relatively small. Newton himself realized this limitation.

A correction to Newton's law concerning larger temperature differentials was made in 1817 by [[Pierre Louis Dulong|Dulong]] and [[Alexis ThÃ©rÃ¨se Petit|Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Inductive Sciences from the Earliest to the Present Times|last=Whewell|first=William|year=1866}}&lt;/ref&gt; (These men are better-known for their formulation of the [[DulongâPetit law]] concerning the molar specific heat capacity of a crystal.)

Another situation with temperature-dependent transfer coefficient is [[Thermal radiation|radiative heat transfer]], which also does not obey Newton's law.

== Heat transfer version of the law ==

The heat-transfer version of Newton's law, which (as noted) requires a constant heat transfer coefficient, states that ''the rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings.''

The rate of heat transfer in such circumstances is derived below:&lt;ref&gt;Louis C. Burmeister, (1993) âConvective Heat Transferâ, 2nd ed. Publisher Wiley-Interscience, p 107 {{ISBN|0-471-57709-X}}, 9780471577096&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's cooling law in convection is a restatement of the differential equation given by [[Fourier's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;{ \frac{d Q}{d t} = h \cdot A \cdot (  T(t)-T_{\text{env}}) = h \cdot A \Delta T(t)\quad }&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal energy (SI unit: [[joule]])
:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[heat transfer coefficient]] (assumed independent of T here) (SI unit: W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; K))
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the heat transfer surface area (SI unit: m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the object's surface and interior (since these are the same in this approximation) (SI unit: K)
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\text{env}}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the environment; i.e. the temperature suitably far from the surface (SI unit: K)
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T(t)= T(t) - T_{\text{env}} &lt;/math&gt; is the time-dependent thermal gradient between environment and object (SI unit: K)

The heat transfer coefficient '''h''' depends upon physical properties of the fluid and the physical situation in which convection occurs. Therefore, a single usable heat transfer coefficient (one that does not vary significantly across the temperature-difference ranges covered during cooling and heating) must be derived or found experimentally for every system that can be analyzed using the presumption that Newton's law will hold.

Formulas and correlations are available in many references to calculate heat transfer coefficients for typical configurations and fluids.  For laminar flows, the heat transfer coefficient is rather low compared to [[Turbulence|turbulent flows]]; this is due to turbulent flows having a thinner stagnant fluid film layer on the heat transfer surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineersedge.com/heat_transfer/convection.htm  Engineers Edge, 2009, âConvection Heat Transferâ,Accessed 20/03/09&lt;/ref&gt; However, note that Newton's law breaks down if the flows should transition between laminar or turbulent flow, since this will change the heat transfer coefficient '''h''' which is assumed constant in solving the equation.

=== The Biot number ===
{{main|Biot number}}
The Biot number, a dimensionless quantity, is defined for a body as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Bi} = \frac{h L_C}{\ k_b}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*h = film coefficient or [[heat transfer coefficient]] or convective heat transfer coefficient
*L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = [[characteristic length]], which is commonly defined as the volume of the body divided by the surface area of the body, such that &lt;math&gt;
\mathit{L_C} = \frac{V_{\rm body}}{A_{\rm surface}}
&lt;/math&gt;
*k&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Thermal conductivity]] of the body

The physical significance of Biot number can be understood by imagining the heat flow from a hot metal sphere suddenly immersed in a pool, to the surrounding fluid. The heat flow experiences two resistances: the first at the surface of the sphere, and the second within the solid metal (which is influenced by both the size and composition of the sphere). The ratio of these resistances is the dimensionless Biot number.

If the thermal resistance of the fluid/sphere interface exceeds that thermal resistance offered by the interior of the metal sphere, the Biot number will be less than one. For systems where it is much less than one, the interior of the sphere may be presumed always to have the same temperature, although this temperature may be changing, as heat passes into the sphere from the surface. The equation to describe this change in (relatively uniform) temperature inside the object, is the simple exponential one described in Newton's law of cooling expressed in terms of temperature difference (see below).

In contrast, the metal sphere may be large, causing the characteristic length to increase to the point that the Biot number is larger than one. In this case, thermal gradients within the sphere become important, even though the sphere material is a good conductor. Equivalently, if the sphere is made of a thermally insulating (poorly conductive) material, such as wood or styrofoam, the interior resistance to heat flow will exceed that of the fluid/sphere boundary, even with a much smaller sphere. In this case, again, the Biot number will be greater than one.

Values of the Biot number smaller than 0.1 imply that the heat conduction inside the body is much faster than the heat convection away from its surface, and temperature [[gradient]]s are negligible inside of it.  This can indicate the applicability (or inapplicability) of certain methods of solving transient heat transfer problems.  For example, a Biot number less than 0.1 typically indicates less than 5% error will be present when assuming a [[lumped-capacitance model]] of transient heat transfer (also called lumped system analysis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This leads to a simple first-order differential equation which describes [[heat transfer]] in these systems.

Having a Biot number smaller than 0.1 labels a substance as "thermally thin," and temperature can be assumed to be constant throughout the material's volume. The opposite is also true: A Biot number greater than 0.1 (a "thermally thick" substance) indicates that one cannot make this assumption, and more complicated heat transfer equations for "transient heat conduction" will be required to describe the time-varying and non-spatially-uniform temperature field within the material body. Analytic methods for handling these problems, which may exist for simple geometric shapes and uniform material [[thermal conductivity]], are described in the article on the [[heat equation]].

== Rate-of-change of temperature-difference version of the law ==

As noted in the section above, accurate formulation for temperatures may require analysis based on changing heat transfer coefficients at different temperatures, a situation frequently found in free-convection situations, and which precludes accurate use of Newton's law.

As noted above, Newton's law behavior when stated in terms of ''temperature change'' in the body, also requires that internal heat conduction within the object be large in comparison to the loss/gain of heat by surface transfer (conduction and/or convection), which is the condition where the Biot number is less than about 0.1. This allows the presumption of a single "temperature" inside the body (as a function of time) to make sense, as otherwise the body would have many different temperatures inside it, at any one time. This single temperature will generally change exponentially, as time progresses (see below).

Assumption of rapid internal conduction also allows use of the so-called [[lumped capacitance model]]. In this model, the amount of thermal energy in the body is calculated by assuming a constant [[heat capacity]] and thus thermal energy in the body is assumed to be a linear function of the body's temperature.

=== Temperature function-of-time solution in terms of object heat capacity ===

Given that the body is treated as a lumped capacitance thermal energy reservoir with a &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (total thermal energy content) which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; (simple total [[heat capacity]]) and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (the temperature of the body), then &lt;math&gt;Q = C T&lt;/math&gt;.  It is expected that the system will experience [[exponential decay]] in the temperature difference of body and surroundings as a function of time. This is proven in the following sections:

From the definition of heat capacity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; comes the relation &lt;math&gt;\textstyle C = \frac{dQ}{dT}&lt;/math&gt;. Differentiating this equation with regard to time gives the identity (valid so long as temperatures in the object are uniform at any given time):  

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ}{dt}  = C \, \frac{dT}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. 

This expression may be used to replace &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dQ}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; in the first equation which begins this section, above. Then, if &lt;math&gt;T(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of such a body at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm env}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the environment around the body:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = - r (T(t) - T_{\mathrm{env}}) = - r \Delta T(t)\quad &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r = \frac{hA}{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant characteristic of the system, which must be in units of &lt;math&gt;\text{time}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and is therefore sometimes expressed in terms of a characteristic [[time constant]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; given by: 

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{1}{\tau} = - \frac{dT(t)}{dt}\frac{1}{\Delta T}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus, in thermal systems, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \tau = \frac{C}{hA}&lt;/math&gt;. (The total [[heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of a system may be further represented by its mass-[[specific heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;c_P&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by its mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, so that the time constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is also given by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{m\, c_P}{hA}&lt;/math&gt;).

The solution of this differential equation, by standard methods of integration and substitution of boundary conditions, gives:

: &lt;math&gt; T(t) = T_{\mathrm{env}} + (T(0) - T_{\mathrm{env}}) \ e^{-r t}. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt; T(t) - T_{\mathrm{env}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(0)\quad &lt;/math&gt; is the initial temperature difference at time 0, then the Newtonian solution is written as:

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(t) = \Delta T(0) \ e^{-r t} = \Delta T(0) \ e^{-t/\tau}. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

This same solution is more immediately apparent if the initial differential equation is written in terms of &lt;math&gt;\Delta T(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as a single function of time to be found, or "solved for."

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \frac{d\Delta T(t)}{dt} = - \frac{1}{\tau} \Delta T(t)\quad &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Noah Walter Parden''' (c. 1868{{spaced ndash}}February 23, 1944) was an American attorney and politician who was active in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], and [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] between 1891 and 1940.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Noah Waldo [sic] Parden, Negro Lawyer, Dies|last = |first = |date = March 3, 1944|work = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date = |via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1906 he became one of the first African-American attorneys to serve as lead counsel in a case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], and he was among the first to make an [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|oral argument]] before the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court: The Turn-of-the-Century Lynching that Launched a Hundred Years of Federalism|last = Curriden|first = Mark, and Leroy Phillips, Jr.|publisher = Faber and Faber|year = 1999|isbn = 978-0571199525|location = New York|pages = 348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he became the first African American to be appointed to the position of Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, a public office, in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = N.W.

== Education and personal life ==
Noah Parden was born near [[Rome, Georgia]], probably in 1868.  His mother was a former slave who worked as a housekeeper and cook.  His father was a white man.  When he was about seven years old he was sent to an orphanage after the death of his mother, who had raised him as a single parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/roman-changed-face-of-u-s-justice/article_70c2d025-f9f7-575b-83a4-5e973bcdef7.html|title = Roman Changed Face of U.S. Justice|last = Ragland|first = Mike|date = August 21, 2010|work = Rome News-Tribune|access-date = February 21, 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 he left Rome for Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he supported himself by working as a barber and at other odd jobs while he spent five years attending [[Howard High School (Tennessee)|Howard High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Black America Series: Chattanooga|last = Chattanooga African American Museum|first = |publisher = Arcadia Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0738518435|location = Charleston, SC|pages = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Directory of Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1889|last = |first = |publisher = Connelly and Fais|year = 1889|isbn = |location = Chattanooga, TN|pages = 261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Directory of Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1890|last = |first = |publisher = Connelly and Fais|year = 1890|isbn = |location = Chattanooga, TN|pages = 293, 521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated in May 1890, presenting the class oration on "The Duty of a Citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tennessee School Report 1890: Annual Report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Scholastic Year ending June 30, 1890.  Submitted to the Governor.|last = Smith|first = Frank M.|publisher = Marshall &amp; Bruce|year = 1891|isbn = |location = Nashville, TN|pages = 75â76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then enrolled as a senior in the law department at [[Walden University (Tennessee)|Central Tennessee College]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], graduating in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Quarto-Centennial Catalogue and Announcement of the Central Tennessee College, Nashville, Tennessee, 1890-91|last = |first = |publisher = Marshall &amp; Bruce|year = 1891|isbn = |location = Nashville, TN|pages = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 he married Mattie S. Broyles (March 29, 1870 â July 15, 1934), a native of [[Dalton, Georgia]] whom he had met in Nashville, and they settled in Chattanooga where they remained until 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two children, Frank B. Parden, who died August 22, 1925, and Lillian Parden Bracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Body Washes Ashore|last = |first = |date = August 25, 1920|work = Asbury Park (NJ) Press|access-date = |via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Chattanooga, Parden and his family moved briefly to [[Pueblo, Colorado]] and then settled in East St. Louis, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Illinois Honors Unsung Lawyer from the '20s|last = Parish|first = Norm|date = March 7, 2003|work = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date = |via = Infotrak Newsstand}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922 the Pardens moved to neighboring St. Louis, Missouri, although Noah Parden continued to maintain a law office in East St. Louis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Israel|first=Benjamin|date=2008|title=How an African American Killed a White Cop and was Acquitted: A Startling Tale of Law Enforcement in Black St. Louis|url=https://cenhum.artsci.wustl.edu/file/jan-may-2008|journal=Belles Lettres: A Literary Review|issue=vol. 8, no. 2|page=34|doi=|pmid=|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mattie Parden's death in 1934, Noah Parden married Elizabeth Polk, a divorcee from East St. Louis.  Her former husband Tranne Polk, an East St. Louis detective and politician, had been acquitted on charges of assaulting Parden in 1933.  During the trial, Polk testified that Parden had interfered in his personal affairs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Honors Sought for Pioneering Black Lawyer; Noah Parden Broke Barriers, Overcame Obstacles; Wharton Wants Legislative Action|last = Parish|first = Norm|date = January 2, 2003|work = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date = |via = Infotrak Newsstand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parden was able to speak several languages, played the violin, and was knowledgeable about art, music and literature.  He also remained connected to his rural roots.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/effort-under-way-to-honor-pioneering-black-lawyer/article_08ccaaad-a6c2-544b-bca9-20e0f5a2ebe3.html|title=Effort under way to honor pioneering black lawyer|last=|first=|date=January 5, 2003|work=Northwest Indiana Times|access-date=May 6, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 1920s he had acquired a 400-acre cotton plantation near [[Hickory, Mississippi]], where he vacationed and to which he would briefly retire before returning to live in St. Louis until the end of his life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Jury Deadlocked in Murder Trial|last=|first=|date=December 11, 1929|work=Edwardsville (IL) Intelligencer|access-date=|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the farm, he did agricultural work to relax; he also knew how to sew, knit and make his own clothing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Parden died on February 23, 1944, and was buried at Booker Washington Cemetery in Centreville Station, Illinois.  He was survived by his wife Elizabeth, his daughter, and a stepdaughter, Gertrude Polk.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legal and political career ==
Noah Parden practiced law from 1891 to 1940, a career which spanned 49 years.  At the end of 1929 he claimed to have defended 236 people accused of murder, of whom one had been legally executed and another lynched.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In addition to his private legal practice he also worked as a prosecutor, serving for nine years (1908-1917) as an assistant state's attorney in [[St. Clair County, Illinois]], and for five years (1935-1940) as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He intermittently engaged in writing, editing and public speaking, and was involved in local politics in East St. Louis and St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contempt of Court|last=Curriden and Phillips|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=(no title)|last=|first=|date=October 29, 1928|work=Centralia (IL) Evening Sentinel|access-date=|via=newspaperarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities in Chattanooga, 1891-1906 ===
After receiving his law degree in 1891 Noah Parden began his career as an attorney in Chattanooga.  in 1892, he briefly established a partnership with another black attorney, James P. Easley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Directory of Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1892|last = |first = |publisher = Connelly and Fais|year = 1892|isbn = |location = Chattanooga, TN|pages = 557}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1895 Parden and Easley also published a newspaper, the ''Chattanooga'' ''Herald'', although Parden soon sold his share in the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = The Fourth Estate|last = |first = |date = August 22, 1895|work = |access-date = |via = |page = 11|edition = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = City Directory of Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1895|last = |first = |publisher = Connelly and Fais|year = 1895|isbn = |location = |pages = 477}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He gained a reputation as an effective defense attorney who was able to obtain victories for his African-American clients in jury trials despite the [[all-white jury|all-white juries]] employed in local courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The [[Lynching of Ed Johnson|Ed Johnson case]] and [[United States v. Shipp|United States v. Shipp (203 U.S. 563 [1906])]] ====
In 1906 Parden was asked to represent Ed Johnson, a black Chattanooga man who had been convicted of the rape of Nevada Taylor, a white woman, and sentenced to death.  Together with [[Styles L. Hutchins, Jr]]., an African-American attorney and former Tennessee state legislator, and [[Lewis Shepherd]], a white attorney and former judge, Parden began working to overturn Johnson's conviction.  No concrete evidence linked Johnson to the crime, and, as Parden argued, the trial had been replete with errors including open demonstrations of bias against Johnson by a member of the jury, exclusion of blacks from the jury pool, and a so-called mob mentality in the courtroom during the trial.  Nevertheless, the Chattanooga court refused to reopen the case and the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] refused to authorize a stay of execution that would have allowed for a new trial, on the grounds that there had been no specific error in the trial to warrant it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 141â149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parden then filed a petition for a [[Habeas corpus|writ of habeas corpus]] with the U.S. Federal Court in Knoxville, citing the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1867|Habeas Corpus Act]] of 1867, which allowed defendants in state court cases to seek relief from federal courts if they believed their Constitutional rights had been violated.  He argued that the state courts had violated Johnson's rights by excluding blacks from juries, a form of discrimination which the United States Supreme Court had determined to be illegal.  Although the court rejected this argument, Judge C.D. Clark did stay Johnson's execution to allow Parden and his colleagues to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, which had the power to rule in favor of federal intervention in a state court case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 150â155, 167â168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 1906, Parden presented his petition before [[John Marshall Harlan II|Justice John Marshall Harlan]], arguing that the Johnson trial had included flagrant violations of the defendant's Constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day the Court accepted the case, staying Johnson's sentence and ordering both sides to prepare for oral arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the night of March 18, however, a mob in Chattanooga broke into the jail, kidnapped Johnson, and [[Lynching|lynched]] him, hanging him from the [[Walnut Street Bridge (Tennessee)|Walnut Street bridge]] over the Tennessee River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2015/jan/18/cook-what-justice-ed-johnson/283290/|title = Why some Chattanoogans won't walk across Walnut Street Bridge|last = Cook|first = David|date = January 18, 2015|work = Chattanooga Times-Free Press|access-date = February 21, 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government responded to the lynching as a violation of federal law, as Johnson had been under the protection of a Supreme Court order when it occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Federal Power After Slayers of Ed. Johnson|last = Ohl|first = Jos.|date = March 23, 1906|work = The Atlanta Constitution|via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, seven of his deputies, and a group of men thought to have belonged to the lynch mob were charged with [[Contempt of court|criminal contempt]] of the United States Supreme Court, the mob members for their role in Johnson's murder and the law enforcement officers for willfully neglecting to protect him despite the likelihood of mob violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 252â254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Attachments in Shipp Case|last = |first = |date = May 25, 1909|work = Nashville American|access-date = |via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1909 Shipp and five others were found guilty of contempt after the only criminal trial ever conducted by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Sheriff Shipp in Contempt|last = |first = |date = May 25, 1909|work = New York Sun|access-date = |via = newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noah Parden and Styles Hutchins worked with the Justice Department in gathering information and identifying witnesses for the case; however, both attorneys ended their involvement before the case went to trial, and neither returned to Chattanooga, where supporters of Shipp and the lynch mob had threatened and intimidated those they considered their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contempt of Court|last = Curriden and Phillips|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 259, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities in East St. Louis and St. Louis, 1907-1940 ===
Noah Parden spent the remainder of his professional life in the [[twin cities]] of East St. Louis, Illinois, where he settled in late 1906 or early 1907,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and St. Louis, Missouri, where he relocated with his family in 1922.  His practice included white as well as black clients,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Pogrom: The East St. Louis Race Riot and Black Politics|last=Lumpkins|first=Charles L.|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0821418031|location=Athens, OH|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he held elective office by serving on the St. Clair County Board of Supervisors, to which he was elected in 1907 and where he chaired the judiciary committee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Pogrom|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this phase of his career also reflected the segregated character of the two cities' legal and political institutions.

==== Work as a prosecutor ====
Parden served as a prosecutor in both cities.  He was appointed to multiple two-year terms as an Assistant State's Attorney in East St. Louis, serving from 1908 to 1917, and became the first black attorney to be appointed an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney in St. Louis, a position he held from 1935 until his retirement in 1940.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In both jurisdictions he was assigned the task of trying African Americans brought before the court.  In East St. Louis his work included prosecution of black suspects accused of carrying concealed weapons, an arrangement which, according to historian Charles Lumpkins, provided black people with "access to legal redress" that would not otherwise have been available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Pogrom|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In St. Louis, his job was to prosecute black men accused of abandoning their families.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Career of Negro Lawyer Chosen Prosecutor's Assistant|last=|first=|date=January 8, 1935|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date=|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Involvement with East St. Louis reform and machine politics ====
Parden quickly became politically active in East St. Louis.  In 1910 he ran for the position of Assistant State's Attorney on the ticket of the Progressive Citizens' Party, a reform group which had coalesced in opposition to the Administration (Democratic regular) party allied with the [[political machine]] led by [[Political boss|boss]] [[Locke Tarleton]].  His Administration opponent, dentist and activist Dr. [[Leroy bundy|Leroy Bundy]], was also an African American, and black East St. Louisians anticipated that this support by white political leaders for black candidates would lead to greater black access to local government.  However, the Progressive Citizens Party ran on an anti-corruption platform and did not extend patronage or access to African Americans, while the machine was perceived as stingy with its money and patronage.  Both Parden and Bundy became part of a group of black professional men who responded by forming an all-black Republican organization, the St. Clair County Republican League, in 1916.  This independent group sought to navigate between East St. Louis's white political factions and gain more benefits for black residents; sociologist Elliot Rudwick has argued that "Bundy and his followers were demanding political equality" via access to the same pool of money and city jobs that was available to white voters.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/paper/7005/2302%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C5%BD|title=Black East St. Louis: Politics and Economy in a Border City, 1860-1945|last=Lumpkins|first=Charles L.|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2006|isbn=|location=Ph.D. dissertation|pages=107â108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Riot at East St. Louis, July 2, 1917|last=Rudwick|first=Elliot M.|publisher=Meridian Books|year=1966|isbn=978-0252009518|location=Cleveland, OH|pages=186â187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so they became involved in political corruption themselves.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Malcolm|date=2008|title=Ghetto Formation and Armed Resistance in East St. Louis, Illinois|url=|journal=Journal of American Studies|issue=vol. 41, no. 2|page=448|doi=10.1017/Soo2187580703544|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 Parden worked for the Republican Party with the expectation of reappointment as Assistant State's Attorney after the election.  In the lead-up to the 1917 mayoral election, incumbent Fred Mollman and his allies exerted pressure on black voters.  Mollman promised to hire more black policemen and build a firehouse in a black neighborhood as incentives for their support, while Parden's boss, State's Attorney Hubert Schaumleffel, threatened them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Riot|last=Rudwick|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=187â188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parden was enlisted to convey to African-American saloon owners and participants in the gambling and prostitution businesses that if Mollman won the election, a crackdown on their establishments which had taken effect early in 1917 would be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Never Been a Time: The 1917 Race Riot that Sparked the Civil Rights Movement|last=Barnes|first=Harper|publisher=Walker Books|year=2008|isbn=978-0802715753|location=New York|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Mollman's victory Parden, along with hundreds of other politically-involved African Americans, participated in a post-election banquet attended by the mayor and his allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black East St. Louis|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The [[1917 race riot|1917 Race Riot]] and its aftermath ====
On July 2, 1917, East St. Louis was engulfed by a bloody race riot, characterized by violent attacks by white mobs on blacks to whom little protection was provided by law enforcement.  Hundreds of black residents were killed and thousands left homeless by the riots.  Although Noah Parden encouraged his client and one-time political rival Leroy Bundy to leave the city during the tense days before the riot, he himself remained at his home in East St. Louis, later testifying that on the night of July 1 he had responded to the arrival of a carload of white men cruising past his house in a [[Ford Model T|Model T Ford]] and shooting from the car, by running to his own front door with a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ghetto Formation and Armed Resistance|last=McLaughlin|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parden family survived the riot unharmed, but its aftermath was professionally damaging to Parden.  He had lost his post as Assistant State's Attorney after an initial outbreak of white-on-black violence in May 1917, when the Board of Supervisors abolished the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black East St. Louis|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=162â163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the July riots he was arrested along with other black leaders, based on the assumption that they must have been promoting discontent among the black populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Riot|last=Rudwick|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parden was among those charged with organizing a black militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black East St. Louis|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=211â212}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was not convicted (and there was no evidence that a black militia had in fact been organized), and he was able to testify on Bundy's behalf when Bundy was tried for participating in a conspiracy to provoke the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Riot|last=Rudwick|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other black East St. Louisians were convicted on riot-related charges and sent to prison.  In 1924 Parden and other black Republicans supported the re-election campaign of Illinois governor [[Len Small]], who not only appointed African Americans to public positions but had granted clemency to some of those convicted for their alleged roles in the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Pogrom|last=Lumpkins|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legal practice in St. Louis ====
After relocating to St. Louis, Parden practiced law in both Illinois and Missouri.  His successes as a defense attorney included the 1923 St. Louis case of Joseph Kyle, a black man who was found not guilty of murdering a white police officer by reason of self-defense, the officer and his partner having shot first at Kyle in the dark and without identifying themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How an African American Killed a White Cop|last=Israel|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also remained involved in local politics, becoming active as a Democrat in St. Louis's Twenty-third Ward.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  He spent the final five years of his career working as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney and was recognized as the first black attorney to be appointed to the position.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Appearance before the United States Supreme Court ==
Noah Parden was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] of the United States Supreme Court in 1906 on the recommendation of [[Emanuel D. Molyneaux Hewlett]], an African American attorney and member of the Supreme Court bar who acted as a co-counsel in many cases involving black southerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defying Disenfranchisement: Black Voting Rights Activism in the Jim Crow South, 1890-1908|last=Riser|first=R.

=== Argument before the Supreme Court ===
Parden's argument before Justice Harlan marked the first time that the Supreme Court involved itself in a lynching case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trial and Triumph: Essays in Tennessee's African American History|last=Webb|first=Michael|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1572332041|editor-last=West|editor-first=Carroll Van|location=Knoxville, TN|pages=282|chapter=God Bless You All--I Am Innocent: Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, Chattanooga, and the Lynching of Ed Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his presentation, Parden argued that Johnson's trial had violated his Constitutional rights under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]].  Legal analyst Mark Curriden and attorney Leroy Phillips note that all of the issues of Constitutional interpretation raised by Parden were later accepted by the Supreme Court.  In terms of the Johnson case, Parden's most important argument was that the right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment applied to state as well as federal courts.  Prior to Parden's appearance before Harlan, the Court had been reluctant to claim federal jurisdiction over state courts, but the evidence of flagrant denial of Johnson's rights that Parden presented led them to do so, in what Curriden and Phillips describe as a "precedent-setting" intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contempt of Court|last=Curriden and Phillips|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=13â15, 193â94, 343â44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Status as an African-American pioneer ===
Parden was among a small number of African-American attorneys to present cases before the Supreme Court during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  In their 1999 study ''Contempt of Court'', Curriden and Phillips asserted that he was the first black attorney to reach two milestones: presentation of an oral argument before a member of the Court (rather than being part of a team of attorneys in which another, white lawyer made the oral arguments), and recognition as lead attorney on a case accepted by the full Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contempt of Court|last=Curriden and Phillips|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other black attorneys preceded Parden in one or both of these categories.  In 1890 [[Everett J. Waring]], a black lawyer and educator from Columbus, Ohio, argued the case of [[Navassa Island|Jones v. United States (137 U.S. 202 [1890])]] before the Court; law professor J. Clay Smith and others describe Waring as the first African American to present an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer, 1844-1944|last=Smith|first=J.

== Recognition and honors ==
Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, Parden's career and accomplishments have begun to receive public recognition.  In 2003, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] adopted a resolution honoring Parden "for his dedication and commitment to the causes of justice and equality," and recognizing "his contributions to the citizens of Illinois and the country."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Old Russian Law''' or '''Russian Law''' is a legal system in [[Kievan Rus']] (since the 9th century), in later [[Rus' (region)|Old Rus' states]] (knyazhestva, or [[Principality|princedoms]] in the period of [[feudal fragmentation]]), in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and in Moscow Rus' (see: [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and [[Tsardom of Russia]]).

==History==

===Ryad===

According to Old Russian chronicles, in 862, [[East Slavs|Slavs]] and [[Baltic Finns|Finns]] invited Varangians under the leadership of prince [[Rurik]] to rule in their land:

{{quote|They said to themselves, "Let us seek a prince ''who may rule over us and judge us according to the Law''." They accordingly went overseas to the [[Rus' people|Varangian Russes]]: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called Swedes, and others Normans, English, and Gotlanders, for they were thus named. The [[Chud]]s, the Slavs, the [[Krivichs|Krivichians]], and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. ''Come to rule and reign over us''."|''The Laurentian Text of [[Primary Chronicle]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|author=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor1=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor2=Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor|title=The Russian Primary chronicle: Laurentian text|url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf|year=1953|publisher=[[Medieval Academy of America]]|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early Russian state settled on the oral treaty, or "'''ryad'''" (Old Russian: ÑÑÐ´Ñ) between the prince ([[knyaz]]) with his armed force ([[druzhina]]) on the one hand, and tribal "nobility" and formally all people on the other hand. The prince and his druzhina defended people, decide lawsuits, provided trade and built towns. And people paid [[tribute]] and took part in [[irregular military]]. During the ensuing centuries the ''ryad'' was playing an important role in Old Russian princedoms: the prince and his administration (druzhina) found their relationship with people ("all land", "all townsmen" in Old Russian chronicles) on the treaty. A breach of the treaty could result in exile of the prince ([[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav Yaroslavich]] and [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod Yaroslavich]]) or even in murder of the prince ([[Igor of Kiev|Igor Rurikovich]] and [[Igor II of Kiev|Igor Olgovich]]).&lt;ref&gt;Melnikova, Elena.

One of the result of [[Rus'âByzantine War (disambiguation)|Rus'âByzantine War]]s was conclusion of [[Rus'âByzantine Treaty (disambiguation)|Treaties with Byzantine]] in the 10th century, where, apart from Byzantine legal rules, also Zakon Russkiy (Law of Rus') - rules of Old Russian oral [[Custom (law)|customary law]] reflected.

[[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s Pravda of the beginning of the 11th century was the first written law in Rus'. This short [[Code (law)|code]] regulated the relationship between the princely druzhina ("rusins") and the people ("slovenins") concerning [[criminal law]]. After Yaroslav's death, his sons [[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav]], [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod]], [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] and their druzhina got together and promulgated a code concerning the violation of property rights in princely lands (Pravda of Yaroslav's sons) in the middle of the 11th century. Yaroslav's Pravda and Pravda of Yaroslav's sons became a basis for the Short edition of Russkaya Pravda.

In the period of [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]]'s reign at the beginning of the 12th century, the Vast edition of Russkaya Pravda was given, which contained rules of criminal, [[Procedural law|procedural]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] law, including trade, [[Family law|family]] law and rules of the bond of obligation.

Later written secular law also included statutory charters, trade treaties, statutes of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], big codes of Moscow Rus' - Sudebniks (see below), and other texts.

===[[Byzantine law]] and church law===
Translations of Byzantine legal codes, including [[Nomocanon]], were widely spread in Old Rus' (see: [[Kormchaia]], [[Merilo Pravednoye]]),&lt;ref&gt;Schapov, Yaroslav. ''Byzantine and [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] Legal Heritage in Rus' at 11-13th centuries'' / ed. by Lev Cherepnin. - Moscow: [[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]], 1978. â 290 p. ({{lang-ru|Ð©Ð°Ð¿Ð¾Ð² Ð¯.Ð.

The Church in Old Rus' did not have wide influence and depended on the power of the state. Thus, church law mainly dealt with family law and sanctions against moral violation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Zhivov|Zhivov, Viktor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7137">'''Oxygen''' '''evolution''' is the process of generating molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by a [[chemical reaction]], usually from water. Oxygen evolution from [[water]] is effected by oxygenic [[photosynthesis]], [[electrolysis]] of water, and thermal decomposition of various oxides.  The biological process supports aerobic life.  When relatively pure oxygen is required industrially, it is isolated by distillation of liquified air.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt;

==Oxygen evolution in nature==
{{main|Oxygen evolving complex}}
Photosynthetic oxygen evolution is the fundamental process by which oxygen is generated in earth's [[biosphere]]. The reaction is part of the [[light-dependent reaction]]s of photosynthesis in [[cyanobacteria]] and the [[chloroplast]]s of [[green algae]] and [[plant]]s. It utilizes the energy of [[light]] to split a water molecule into its [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s for photosynthesis. Free oxygen, generated as a by-product of this reaction, is released into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Water oxidation is catalyzed by a [[manganese]]-containing [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] contained in [[photosystem II]] known as the [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) or water-splitting complex. Manganese is an important [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], and [[calcium]] and [[chloride]] are also required for the reaction to occur.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;The stoichiometry this reaction follows:
: 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O â¶ 4e&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The protons are released into the [[thylakoid lumen]], thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient is the driving force for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis via [[photophosphorylation]] and coupling the absorption of light energy and oxidation of water to the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Raval"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raval M, Biswal B, Biswal U |title=The mystery of oxygen evolution: analysis of structure and function of photosystem II, the water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase |journal=Photosynthesis Research |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=267â93 |year=2005 |pmid=16170631| doi=10.1007/s11120-005-8163-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of discovery===
It was not until the end of the 18th century that [[Joseph Priestley]] discovered by accident the ability of plants to "restore" air that had been "injured" by the burning of a candle. He followed up on the experiment by showing that air "restored" by [[vegetation]] was ''"not at all inconvenient to a [[mouse]]."'' He was later awarded a medal for his discoveries that: ''"...no vegetable grows in vain... but cleanses and purifies our atmosphere."'' Priestley's experiments were followed up by [[Jan Ingenhousz]], a Dutch physician, who showed that "restoration" of air only worked in the presence of light and green plant parts.&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Raven | first = Peter H. |author2=Ray F. Evert |author3=Susan E. Eichhorn  | title = Biology of Plants, 7th Edition | publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company Publishers | date = 2005 | location = New York | pages = 115â127  | isbn = 0-7167-1007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingenhousz suggested in 1796 that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[carbon dioxide]]) is split during photosynthesis to release oxygen, while the [[carbon]] combined with water to form [[carbohydrate]]s. While this hypothesis was attractive and reasonable and thus widely accepted for a long time, it was later proven incorrect. Graduate student [[C.B. Van Niel]] at [[Stanford University]] found that [[purple sulfur bacteria]] reduce carbon to carbohydrates, but accumulate [[sulfur]] instead of releasing oxygen. He boldly proposed that, in analogy to the sulfur bacteria's forming elemental sulfur from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ([[hydrogen sulfide]]), plants would form oxygen from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water). In 1937, this hypothesis was corroborated by the discovery that plants are capable of producing oxygen in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This discovery was made by [[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robin Hill]], and subsequently the light-driven release of oxygen in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was called the ''Hill reaction''. Our current knowledge of the mechanism of oxygen evolution during photosynthesis was further established in experiments tracing [[isotopes of oxygen]] from water to oxygen gas.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt;

==Water electrolysis==
Together with [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), oxygen is evolved by [[electrolysis of water]]. 
[[File:Electrolysis of Water.png|thumb|300px|Diagram showing the overall [[chemical equation]].]]

Electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;) are transferred from the cathode to protons to form hydrogen gas. The [[half reaction]], balanced with acid, is:
:2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;   â  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

At the positively charged anode, an [[redox|oxidation]] reaction occurs, generating oxygen gas and releasing electrons to the anode to complete the circuit:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  â   O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  4e&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;

Combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:

:Overall reaction: 
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   â   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Chemical oxygen generation==
[[Chemical oxygen generator]]s consist of chemical compounds that release O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon some stimulation, usually heat. They are used in submarines and commercial aircraft, providing emergency oxygen.  Oxygen is generated by high-temperature decomposition of sodium chlorate:&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 NaClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  â  2 NaCl  +  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Potassium permanganate also releases oxygen upon heating, but the yield is modest.
:2 KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  â  MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In [[United States constitutional law]], the '''penumbra''' includes a group of rights derived, by implication, from other rights explicitly protected in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Merriam-Webster, Dictionary}}, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/penumbra Penumbra: Definition]; see also Brannon P. Denning &amp; Glenn Harlan Reynolds, ''Comfortably Penumbral'', 77 {{smallcaps|B.U. L.

Reynolds, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3696&amp;context=penn_law_review ''Penumbral Reasoning on the Right''], 140 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L.

ALWD 155, 155â56 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Although researchers have traced the origin of the term to the nineteenth century, the term first gained significant popular attention in 1965, when [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[William O. Douglas]]'s majority opinion in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' identified a [[right to privacy]] in the penumbra of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', {{ussc|volume=381|page=479|pin=484|year=1965}} ; Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 83â84 (1987) (discussing origins of the term).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
Commentators disagree about the precise origin of the use of the term ''penumbra'' in American legal scholarship, but most believe it was first used in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [https://lawreview.richmond.edu/files/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 478â81 (2011) and Henry T. Greely, ''A Footnote to "Penumbra" in Griswold v. Connecticut'', 6 {{smallcaps|Const. Comment.}} 251 (1989) with Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Burr Henly, for example, traces the first use of the word to an 1873 law review article written by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], in which he argued that it is better for new law to grow "in the penumbra between darkness and light, than to remain in uncertainty".&lt;ref&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 Hastings Const. L. Q. 81, 83â84 (1987) (quoting Holmes, ''The Theory of Torts'', 7 {{smallcaps|Am. L. Rev.}} 652, 654 (1873), ''reprinted in'' 44 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev.}} 773, 775 (1931)).&lt;/ref&gt; Luis Sirico and Henry T. Greely, on the other hand, trace the term to Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field]]'s 1871 circuit court opinion in ''Montgomery v. Bevans'', where Justice Field used the term to describe a period of time in which it was uncertain whether an individual could legally be considered deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 478â79 (2011) (citing ''Montgomery v. Bevans'', 17 F. Cas. 628, 632 (C.C.D. Cal. 1871) (No. 9735)); Henry T. Greely, ''A Footnote to "Penumbra" in Griswold v. Connecticut'', 6 {{smallcaps|Const. Comment.}} 251, 252-53 (1989) (noting "its first use in 1871").&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators, including Glenn H. Reynolds and Brannon P. Denning, note that elements of penumbral reasoning can be found in much older cases that precede the first use of the term ''penumbra''; they trace the origins of penumbral reasoning to United States Supreme Court cases from the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn H. Reynolds, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3696&amp;context=penn_law_review ''Penumbral Reasoning on the Right''], 140 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L. Rev.}} 1333, 1343â45 (1992) (citing ''[[Crandall v. Nevada]]'', 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 35 (1868); ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819)).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Reynolds and Denning describe [[Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]]'s opinion in ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' as "the quintessential example of penumbral reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;Brannon P. Denning &amp; Glenn Harlan Reynolds, ''Comfortably Penumbral'', 77 {{smallcaps|B.U. L. Rev.}} 1089, 1092â93 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:Area light source soft shadow.png|thumb|right|220px|The primary scientific definition of the word "penumbra" refers to the area of partial illumination "between the perfect shadow on all sides and the full light",&lt;ref name = Henly83&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 84 (1987) (internal quotations omitted) (citing {{smallcaps|Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary}} 871 (9th ed. 1985)).&lt;/ref&gt; represented here as the area of soft shadow.]]
Although the meaning of the term has varied over time,&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 481 (2011) (discussing evolution in the term's definition prior to ''Griswold v. Connecticut'').&lt;/ref&gt; scholars now generally agree that the term refers to a group of rights that are not explicitly stated in the constitution, but can be inferred from other enumerated rights.&lt;ref&gt;Brannon P. Denning &amp; Glenn Harlan Reynolds, ''Comfortably Penumbral'', 77 {{smallcaps|B.U. L. Rev.}} 1089, 1092 (1997) (discussing contemporary understanding of the term).&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the term was originally derived from its primary scientific meaning, which is "a space of partial illumination (as in an eclipse) between the perfect shadow on all sides and the full light".&lt;ref name = Henly83/&gt; By analogy, rights that exist in the constitution's penumbra can be found in the "shadows" of other portions constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Alex Kozinski &amp; Eugene Volokh, ''A Penumbra Too Far'', 106 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev.}} 1639, 1657 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the process of identifying rights in constitutional penumbras is known as ''penumbral reasoning''.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Halloran McLaughlin, ''DOMA and the Constitutional Coming Out of Same-Sex Marriage, 24 {{smallcaps|Wis. J.L. Gender &amp; Soc'y}} 145 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Brannon P. Denning and Glenn H. Reynolds have described this interpretive framework as the process of "drawing logical inferences by looking at relevant parts of the Constitution as a whole and their relationship to one another."&lt;ref&gt;Brannon P. Denning &amp; Glenn Harlan Reynolds, ''Comfortably Penumbral'', 77 {{smallcaps|B.U. L. Rev.}} 1089, 1092 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn H. Reynolds has also characterized penumbral reasoning as a process of "reasoning-by-interpolation" where judges identify the full scope and extent of constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn H. Reynolds, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3696&amp;context=penn_law_review ''Penumbral Reasoning on the Right''], 140 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L. Rev.}} 1333, 1334â36 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions prior to ''Griswold v. Connecticut''===
The term ''penumbra'' first appeared in an opinion published by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;Sirico identifies ''Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf'', 240 U.S. 403, 426 (1916) (Holmes, J., concurring), as the first appearance of the term in an opinion published by the Supreme Court of the United States. See Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 479 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and the term appeared ten more times in published opinions between 1916 and 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480â81 (2011) (providing statistics between 1916 and 1941).&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1941 and the date of publication of ''Griswold v. Connecticut'', the term was used eight times by Justice William O. Douglas and four times by other Justices.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480â81 (2011) (providing statistics between 1941 and 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] Judge [[Learned Hand]] also used the term eleven times between 1915 and 1950, usually to place emphasis on words or concepts that were ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480 (2011). In these eleven opinions, Sirico also includes opinions written by Judge Hand in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Commissioner v. Ickelheimer'', Judge Hand wrote, "[t]he colloquial words of a statute have not the fixed and artificial content of scientific symbols; they have a penumbra, a dim fringe, a connotation, for they express an attitude of will, into which it is our duty to penetrate and which we must enforce ungrudgingly when we can ascertain it, regardless of imprecision in its expression".&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480 (2011) (citing ''Comm'r v. Ickelheimer'', 132 F.2d 660, 662 (2d Cir. 1943) (Hand, J., dissenting)).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before ''Griswold'', different Supreme Court Justices would often utilize different definitions of the term in different contexts, possibly because the Justices did not understand the meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 482 (2011) (discussing hypotheses for why different definitions emerged).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Schlesinger v. Wisconsin'', for example, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] used the term to describe rights derived by implication.&lt;ref&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 87 (1987) (describing Justice Holmes' references to "a protective penumbra created by certain provisions of the Bill of Rights").&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "the law allows a penumbra to be embraced that goes beyond the outline of its object in order that the object may be secured".&lt;ref&gt;''Schlesinger v. Wisconsin'', {{ussc|volume=270 |page=230|pin=241|year=1926}} (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'', Justice Holmes argued that evidence obtained through [[wire-tapping]] should not be admitted at trial, and that "the penumbra of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments covers the defendant".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'', {{ussc|volume=277|page=438|pin=469|year=1928}} (Holmes, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States|A.L.A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'', Justice [[Benjamin Cardozo]] used the term to describe an area of uncertainty in the law.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480 (2011) (noting that Justice Cardozo "used 'penumbra' to refer to an area of indeterminacy in the law"); see also Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 88 (1987) (describing Justice Cardozo's use of the term to refer to "an area of uncertainty").&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "[t]here is no penumbra of uncertainty obscuring judgment here. To find immediacy or directness here is to find it almost everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States|A.L.A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|volume=295|page=495|pin=554|year=1935}} (Cardozo, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'', Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] used the term in a manner that was more closely related to its traditional definition.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 481 (2011) (discussing Justice Frankfurter's use of the term).&lt;/ref&gt; When arguing that a group of legislators lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]], he wrote, "[n]o doubt the bounds of such legal interest have a penumbra which gives some freedom in judging fulfillment of our jurisdictional requirements".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'', {{ussc|volume=307|page=433|pin=465|year=1939}} (Frankfurter, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition after ''Griswold v. Connecticut''===
[[File:Justice William O Douglas.jpg|thumb|220px|right|upright|In ''Griswold'', Justice [[William O. Douglas]] (pictured) explained that "specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance".&lt;ref name = Griswold484&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 484.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
J. Christopher Rideout and Burr Henly note that the term achieved prominence after Justice Douglas' majority opinion in ''Griswold v. Connecticut'' held that a right to privacy existed in the penumbra of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;J. Christopher Rideout, [http://www.alwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pdf/jalwd-fall-2010-rideout.pdf ''Penumbral Thinking Revisited: Metaphor in Legal Argumentation''], 7 J. ALWD 155, 156 (2010); see also Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 83 (1987) ("Commentators sometimes discuss Douglas' ''Griswold'' penumbra as if the metaphor had never before appeared in American jurisprudence.").&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Griswold'', the Supreme Court ultimately held that a [[Connecticut]] law that criminalized the use of [[contraception]] was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name = Griswold482-83&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 482â83.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Douglas held that the Connecticut law violated a fundamental right to privacy.&lt;ref name = Griswold482-83/&gt; After reviewing a line of cases in which the Supreme Court identified rights not explicitly enumerated in the constitution, Justice Douglas declared that "[t]he foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance".&lt;ref name = Griswold484/&gt; Justice Douglas argued that the Court could infer a right to privacy by looking at "zones of privacy" protected by [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First]], [[Third Amendment of the United States Constitution|Third]], [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourth]], [[Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fifth]], and [[Ninth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Ninth]] Amendments:

{{quote|Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers "in any house" in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."&lt;ref name = Griswold484/&gt;}}

Consequently, Justice Douglas argued that the constitution included "penumbral rights of privacy and repose."&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 485 (internal quotations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Douglas also remarked that without "peripheral rights," the "specific rights" enumerated in the constitution would be "less secure".&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 479, 482, 484.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burr Henly, Justice Douglas' majority opinion did not use the term to identify the articulable boundaries of language and the law, as Justice Holmes had done, but rather to connect the text of the constitution to [[unenumerated rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 96 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly analysis of penumbral reasoning==
Helen Hershkoff has described penumbral reasoning as "an important feature of American constitutional practice in cases involving individual rights and government power",&lt;ref&gt;Helen Hershkoff, [http://www.buffalolawreview.org/past_issues/59_2/Hershkoff.pdf ''Horizontality and the "Spooky" Doctrines of American Law''], 59 {{smallcaps|Buffalo L. Rev.}} 455, 486â487 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and J. Christopher Rideout notes that many scholars have defended the "conceptual integrity" of penumbral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;J. Christopher Rideout, [http://www.alwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pdf/jalwd-fall-2010-rideout.pdf ''Penumbral Thinking Revisited: Metaphor in Legal Argumentation''], 7 J. ALWD 155, 184 (2010); see also David Luban, ''The Warren Court and the Concept of a Right'', 34 {{smallcaps|Harv. Civ. Rights-Civ. Liberties L. Rev.}} 7 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Burr Henly has described the penumbra as "the most important" metaphor in American constitutional jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 83 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, including Judge [[A. Raymond Randolph]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] and historian [[David J. Garrow]], also note that Justice Douglas' identification of the right to privacy in ''Griswold'' ultimately served as a doctrinal stepping-stone to ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', where the United States Supreme Court ruled that the right to privacy protects the right to [[abortion|terminate a pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Raymond Randolph, [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol29_No3_Randolph.pdf ''Before'' Roe v. Wade: ''Judge Friendly's Draft Abortion Opinion''], 29 {{smallcaps|Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y}} 1035, 1045 (2006); {{smallcaps|David J. Garrow, Liberty and Sexuality: The Right to Privacy and the Making of ''Roe v. Wade''}} 519, 525 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn H. Reynolds has also observed that courts routinely engage in penumbral reasoning, regardless of their location on the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Harlan Reynolds, ''Guns, Privacy, and Revolution'', 68 {{smallcaps|Tenn. L. Rev.}} 635, 643 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] and [[UCLA School of Law]] professor [[Eugene Volokh]] note that the use of penumbral reasoning by courts "cuts both ways" because it can be used to both expand individual liberties and to expand the powers of the government at the expense of individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Kozinski &amp; Eugene Volokh, ''A Penumbra Too Far'', 106 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev.}} 1639, 1657 (1993) (citing Justice Black's dissenting opinion in ''Griswold'').&lt;/ref&gt; Richard E. Levy also argued that penumbral reasoning, [[fundamental rights]] analyses, and [[political process theory|political-process theory]] can justify judicial intervention on behalf of individual liberty as well as judicial intervention to advance economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Levy, ''Escaping Lochner's Shadow: Toward a Coherent Jurisprudence of economic Rights'', 73 {{smallcaps|N.C. L. Rev.}} 329, 364 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the "pivotal" role that penumbral reasoning has played in American constitutional jurisprudence, the Supreme Court's use of penumbral reasoning has also generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;J. Christopher Rideout, [http://www.alwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pdf/jalwd-fall-2010-rideout.pdf ''Penumbral Thinking Revisited: Metaphor in Legal Argumentation''], 7 J. ALWD 155, 156â57 (2010) (discussing controversy associated with penumbral reasoning).&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|District of Columbia Circuit]] Judge [[Robert Bork]], for example, was a particularly vocal critic of Supreme Court rulings that identified rights that are not explicitly enumerated in the text of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn H. Reynolds, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3696&amp;context=penn_law_review ''Penumbral Reasoning on the Right''], 140 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L. Rev.}} 1333, 1333 (1992) (discussing Judge Bork's criticisms of penumbral reasoning).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in his dissenting opinion in ''Griswold'', Justice [[Hugo Black]] stated his concerns with finding a right to privacy in the penumbra of the constitution and that he disagreed with the majority's attempts to "stretch" the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 508 (Black, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Louis J. Sirico Jr. has described the term as "intellectually confusing",&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 488 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and William J. Watkins, Jr. wrote that the penumbra of the constitution is "a seemingly strange place to discover constitutional guarantees".&lt;ref&gt;William J. Watkins, Jr., ''The Driver's Privacy Protection Act: Congress Makes A Wrong Turn'', 49 {{smallcaps|S.C. L. Rev.}} 983, 996 n.124 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Pushaw Jr. also described penumbral reasoning as a "transparently fictional" process,&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Pushaw Jr., ''Partial-Birth Abortion and the Perils of Constitutional Common Law'', 31 {{smallcaps|Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y}} 519, 531 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and Jennifer Fahnestock has cautioned that "implicit constitutional rights" are vulnerable to being lost "due to their lack of permanency".&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Fahnestock, [http://lawreview.law.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/lawreview/article/view/165/165 ''Renegotiating the Social Contract: Healthcare as a natural Right''], 72 {{smallcaps|U.

In the United States, the '''putative father registry''' is a state level legal option for unmarried men to document through a notary public any woman they engage with in intercourse, for the purpose of retaining parental rights for any child they may father.&lt;ref name="usdhhs1"&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/putative.cfm | work=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | location=[http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/putative.pdf#Page=3&amp;view=Fit Paternity Registries] | title=The Rights of Unmarried Fathers | date=30 June 2010 | first=Information Gateway | last=Child Welfare }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= | work= | location= | title=Because registries apply to minors under the age of 18 the words "male / female" have been used instead of "men / women" which would imply only adults | date= | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==

In the United States, [[putative father]]s will be notified when actions to terminate their parental rights as part of [[Adoption in the United States|adoption]] proceedings are filed for a child they may have fathered and registered for.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S8JUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DzwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=putative-father-registry&amp;pg=2973%2C6304815 | work=The Rochester Sentinel | location=Indiana, USA | title=Public Notices, Legal Notice | date=28 December 2001 | first=Public | last=Notice }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Non marital fathers are not guaranteed notice of an adoption or any rights in contesting the decision by the mother, nor are they guaranteed the ability to adopt or gain [[child custody|custody]] of the child. Typically, the father is only guaranteed notification, and the right to appear in [[court]] to testify about their child's best interests where he has registered timely.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.limaohio.com/news/local_news/article_34caedec-10b9-11e2-a951-001a4bcf6878.html | work=The Lima News | location=Ohio, USA | title=Failure to name child costs father his case | date=7 October 2012 | first=Paul | last=E. Pfeifer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Registering timely with a stateâs putative father registry guarantees notice. Timely legal establishment of paternity typically guarantees notice and an opportunity to be heard and may confer rights to consent or withhold consent to adoption. Prenatal support of the mother and fetus assures recognition of parental rights in 34 states.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Mary (2017) Prenatal Abandonment: âHorton Hatches the Eggâ in the Supreme Court and Thirty Four States. 24 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 53, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no [[federal law]] in place regulating putative father registries.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Toward%20a%20national%20putative%20father%20registry%20database.-a089163072 | work=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy | location=The Free Library | title=Toward a national putative father registry database | date=22 June 2002 | first=Mary | last=Beck }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among all signatory countries only the United States refuses to ratify the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and registries are not regulated under the [[United Nations|U.N. Charter]]. Currently 33 states in the U.S. have putative father registries.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} The number of children adopted without consent or notice to the biological father under the registry program started in the 1970s is unknown.

State putative father registries are intended to protect the non marital father from fraud by providing him with legal notice of a planned adoption of a child, provided he registers within a limited time-frame, usually any time prior to the birth or from 1 to 31 days after a birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gBFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sh8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=putative-father-registry&amp;pg=5860%2C872458 | work=Star News | location=North Carolina, USA | title=Registry sets post-adoption trap for Dads | date=19 March 2006 | first=Tamar | last=Lewin }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lack of knowledge of the pregnancy or birth is not an acceptable reason for failure to file; fraud by the birth mother typically does extend the fatherâs time to register.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= | work=[http://www.azdhs.gov/vitalrcd/pdf/notice_of_claim_of_paternity.pdf Arizona Putative Father Registry Form] | location=Arizona.gov, USA | title=Section 2(F) page 4 | date=30 October 2008 | first=Arizona | last=DHS  }} RSMo Â§192.016; RSMo Â§453.061 &lt;/ref&gt;

Some states require a putative father to file with multiple states, i.e. with the state possible conception might have occurred, state of residence (if different) and possible states the female might visit,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/article-11795-some-call-it-kidnapping.html?current_page=all | work=City Weekly | location=Utah, United States | title=How Utah adoption laws take babies from the nation's unmarried fathers | date=28 July 2010 | first=Jesse | last=Fruhwirth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Reign of Terror''', or '''The Terror''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|la Terreur}}), is the label given by most historians to a period during the [[French Revolution]] after the [[First French Republic]] was established.

Several historians consider the "reign of terror" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September,&lt;ref name=EncBrit&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror |title=Reign of Terror |accessdate=19 April 2017| publisher= EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; June&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac/&gt; or March (birth of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 ([[September Massacres]]), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place),&lt;ref name=maudite&gt;The dates July 1789, September 1792, March 1793 as starting date for the Reign of Terror ({{lang-fr|link=no|la Terreur}}) are given in the French Wikipedia, referring to source: Jean-ClÃ©ment Martin, ''La Terreur, part maudite de la RÃ©volution'' ('The Terror, the cursed part of the Revolution'), coll. [[DÃ©couvertes Gallimard]] (nÂ° 566), Paris: Gallimard, 2010, p. 14â15.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a consensus that it ended with [[Fall of Robespierre|the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794]].&lt;ref name=EncBrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac/&gt;

Between June 1793 and the end of July 1794, there were 16,594 official death sentences in France, of which 2,639 were in Paris.&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac&gt;{{cite web|last=Linton|first=Marisa|title=The Terror in the French Revolution|url=http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload,20545,en.pdf|publisher=Kingston University|accessdate=2 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117152123/http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload%2C20545%2Cen.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History Today"/&gt;

There was a sense of emergency among leading politicians in France in the summer of 1793 between the widespread civil war and counter-revolution.

[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] in February 1794 in a speech explained the necessity of terror:
{{quote|sign=|source=|If the basis of popular government in peacetime is virtue, the basis of popular government during a revolution is both virtue and terror; virtue, without which terror is baneful; terror, without which virtue is powerless. Terror is nothing more than speedy, severe and inflexible justice; it is thus an emanation of virtue; it is less a principle in itself, than a consequence of the general principle of democracy, applied to the most pressing needs of the ''patrie'' &lt;small&gt;[homeland, fatherland]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1794robespierre.asp|title=Maximilien Robespierre: On the Principles of Political Morality, February 1794|last1=Halsall |first1=Paul|date=1997 |publisher=Fordham University |access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History Today"/&gt;}}

Some historians argue that such terror was a necessary reaction to the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathiez|first1=Albert|title=La RÃ©volution FranÃ§aise|publisher=Librairie Armand Colin|isbn=978-7-100-07058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest there were additional causes, including ideological&lt;ref&gt;Furet, Francois.

== Influences on the Terror ==
=== Enlightenment Thought ===

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought emphasized the importance of rational thinking and began challenging legal and moral foundations of society, providing the leaders of the Terror with new ideas about the role and structure of government.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Church, "Introduction", in ''The Influence of the Enlightenment on the French Revolution'', ed. William F. Church (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964), vii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|Social Contract]] argued that each person was born with rights, and they would come together to form a government that would then protect those rights. Under the social contract, the government was required to act for the [[General will|general will]], which represented the interests of everyone rather than a few factions.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, "Ideal Empires and Republics. Rousseau's ''Social Contract'', More's ''Utopia'', Bacon's ''New Atlantis'', Campanella's ''City of the Sun'' with an Introduction by Charles M. Andrews", (Washington: M. Walter Dunne, 1901), 92â94, Online Library of Liberty, http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/rousseau-ideal-empires-and-republics.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from the idea of a general will, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] felt that the [[French Revolution]] could result in a Republic built for the general will but only once those who fought this ideal were expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Peyre, "The Influence of Eighteenth Century Ideas on the French Revolution", in ''The Influence of the Enlightenment on the French Revolution'', ed. William F. Church (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964), 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Maximilien Robespierre, "Justification of the Use of Terror", July 28, 1794, ''Modern History Sourcebook'', Fordham University, accessed May 1, 2018, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-terror.asp. &lt;/ref&gt; Those who resisted the government were deemed "tyrants" fighting against the virtue and honor of the general will. The leaders felt their ideal version of government was threatened from the inside and outside of France, and terror was the only way to preserve the dignity of the Republic created from French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilien Robespierre, "Justification of the Use of Terror", July 28, 1794, ''Modern History Sourcebook'', Fordham University, accessed May 1, 2018, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-terror.asp. &lt;/ref&gt;

Robespierre's ideology was not strictly derived from Rousseau. The writings of another Enlightenment thinker of the time, [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], greatly influenced Robespierre. One of Montesquieuâs writings, ''The Spirit of the Laws'',  defines a core principle of a democratic government: virtue. He describes it as âthe love of laws and of our country.â&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu. "Modern History Sourcebook: Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws, 1748." Internet History Sourcebooks. https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/montesquieu-spirit.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Robespierreâs speech to the[[National_Convention| National Convention]] on February 5, 1794, ''On Political Morality'', he talks about virtue being the âfundamental principle of popular or democratic government."&lt;ref&gt;âRobespierre, "On Political Morality",â ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/413.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was, in fact, the same virtue defined by Montesquieu almost 50 years earlier. Robespierre believed that the virtue needed for any democratic government was extremely lacking in the French people. As a result, he decided to weed out those he believed could never possess this virtue. The result was a continual push towards Terror. The Convention used this as justification for the course of action to âcrush the enemies of the revolution, ... let the laws be executed, â¦ and let liberty be saved.â&lt;ref&gt;â"Terror Is the Order of the Day",â ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'', accessed October 26, 2018, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/416.&lt;/ref&gt;

These members of the Enlightenment movement greatly influenced revolutionary leaders; however, cautions from other Enlightenment thinkers were blatantly ignored.   [[Voltaire|Voltaireâs]] warnings were often overlooked, though some of his ideas were used for justification of the Revolution and the start of the Terror. He protested against Catholic Dogmas and the ways of Christianity stating, âof all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most toleration, but till now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.â&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire. "Voltaire, Selections from the Philosophical Dictionary." Omeka RSS. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/273/.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms were often used by Robespierre and other leaders as justification for their anti-religious reforms. Voltaire also laid down some warnings. In his [[Dictionnaire_philosophique|''Philosophical Dictionary'']], he states, âwe are all steeped in weakness and error; let us forgive each other our follies; that is the first law of natureâ and âevery individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of his opinion, is a monster."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of forgiveness and understanding the failings of the human conditions were obviously lost on Robespierre and other leaders as they pursued Terror.

===Threats of Foreign Invasion===

After the beginning of the French Revolution, the surrounding monarchies did not show great hostility towards the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution''. 6th ed. London: Routledge, 2016. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Though mostly ignored, [[Louis_XVI_of_France|Louis XVI]] was later able to find support in Leopold II of Austria (Marie Antionetteâs brother) and Frederick William II of Prussia. On August 27, 1791, these foreign leaders made the [[Declaration_of_Pillnitz|Pillnitz Declaration]] saying they would restore the French monarch if other European rulers joined.  In response to what they viewed to be the meddling of foreign powers, France declared war on April 20, 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther E. Rothenberg "The Origins, Causes, and Extension of the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon." ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 18, no. 4 (1988): 771-93. doi:10.2307/204824. https://www.jstor.org/stable/204824.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at this point, the war was only Prussia and Austria against France. France began this war with a large series of defeats which set a precedent of fear of invasion in the people that would last throughout the war. Massive reforms of military institutions, while very effective in the long run, presented the initial problems of inexperienced forces and leaders of questionable political loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the time it took for officers of merit to use their new freedoms to climb the chain of command, France suffered. Many of the early battles were definitive losses for the French.&lt;ref&gt;"Battle of Valmy, (20 September 1792)." Weapons and Warfare. April 09, 2018. Accessed October 30, 2018. https://weaponsandwarfare.com/2018/04/10/battle-of-valmy-20-september-1792/.&lt;/ref&gt; There was the constant threat of the Austro-Prussian forces which were advancing easily toward the capital, threatening to destroy Paris if the monarch was harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold II, and Frederick William. "The Declaration of Pillnitz (1791)." French Revolution. February 27, 2018. Accessed October 26, 2018. https://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/declaration-of-pillnitz-1791/.&lt;/ref&gt; This series of defeats, coupled with militant uprisings and protests within the borders of France pushed the government to resort to drastic measures to ensure the loyalty of every citizen to not only France but more importantly to the Revolution.

While this series of losses was eventually broken, the reality of what might have happened if they persisted hung over France. The tide would not turn from them until September of 1792 when the French won a critical victory at Valmy preventing the Austro-Prussian invasion.&lt;ref&gt; Jermemy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; While the French military had stabilized and was producing victories by the time the Reign of Terror officially began, the pressure to succeed in this international struggle acted as justification for the government to pursue its tyrannical actions. It was not until after the execution of Louis XVI and the annexation of the [[Rhineland#French_Revolution|Rhineland]] that the other monarchies began to feel threatened enough to form the [[War_of_the_First_Coalition|First Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Bloy. "The First Coalition 1793-1797." A Web of English History. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/montesquieu/.&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition, consisting of Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and Sardinia, began attacking France from all directions besieging and capturing ports and retaking ground lost to France.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; With so many similarities to the first days of the [[French_Revolutionary_Wars|Revolutionary Wars]], the French government with threats on all sides, unification of the country became a top priority.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war continued and the Reign of Terror began, leaders saw a correlation between using terror and achieving victory. Well phrased by [[Albert_Soboul|Albert Soboul]], âterror, at first an improvised response to defeat, once organized became an instrument of victory.â&lt;ref&gt;Soboul cited in Mona Ozouf. "War and Terror in French Revolutionary Discourse (1792-1794)." ''The Journal of Modern History'' 56, no. 4 (1984): 580-97. http://www.jstor.org.du.idm.oclc.org/stable/1880323.
&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of defeat and foreign invasion may have helped spur the origins of the terror, but the timely success of the Terror with French victories added justification to its growth and continuation.

=== Popular Pressure ===

During the Reign of Terror, the [[Sans-culottes|sans-culottes]] and the [[HÃ©bertists]] put pressure on the [[National Convention]] delegates and contributed to the overall instability of France. The National Convention was bitterly split between the [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]] and the [[Girondins]]. The Girondins were more conservative leaders of the National Convention, while the Montagnards supported radical violence and pressures of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, A Short History of the French Revolution, (London: Routledge, 2016), 64. &lt;/ref&gt; Once the Montagnards gained control of the National Convention, they began demanding radical measures. Moreover, the sans-culottes, the scrappy, urban workers of France, agitated leaders to inflict punishments on those who opposed the interests of the poor. The sans-culottesâ violent demonstrations pushing their demands, created constant pressure for the Montagnards to enact reform.&lt;ref&gt;"Terror, Vengeance, and Martyrdom in the French Revolution: THE CASE OF THE SHADES - Oxford Scholarship", 2014, accessed May 1, 2018, http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199959853.001.0001/acprof-9780199959853-chapter-8. 2014. &lt;/ref&gt; The sans-culottes fed the frenzy of instability and chaos by utilizing popular pressure during the Revolution. For example, the sans-culottes sent letters and petitions to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] urging them to protect their interests and rights with measures such as taxation of foodstuffs that favored workers over the rich. They advocated for arrests of those deemed to oppose reforms against those with privilege, and the more militant members would advocate pillage in order to achieve the desired equality.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''The Sans-culottes; the Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government, 1793â1794'', (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1972), 5â17.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting instability caused problems that made forming the new Republic and achieving full political support even more critical.

=== Religious Upheaval ===

The Reign of Terror was characterized by a dramatic rejection of long-held religious authority, its hierarchical structure, and the corrupt and intolerant influence of the aristocracy and clergy. Religious elements that long stood as symbols of stability for the French people, were replaced by reason and scientific thought.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Pressense, John Lacroix,  ''Religion and the reign of terror, or, The church during the French revolution'' (World constitutions illustrated), (New York : Cincinnati: Carlton &amp; Lanahan ; Hitchcock &amp; Walden, 1869).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (Yale University Press, 1989), 343. {{ISBN|9780300044263}}. &lt;/ref&gt; The radical revolutionaries and their supporters desired a cultural revolution that would rid the French state of all Christian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Hunt, ''Politics, Culture and Class in the French Revolution''; chp 3, "The Imagery of Radicalism", 1984, 87â119. &lt;/ref&gt; This process began with the fall of the [[Absolute monarchy in France|monarchy]], an event that effectively defrocked the State of its sanctification by the clergy via the [[Divine right of kings|doctrine of Divine Right]] and ushered in an era of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', (London: Routledge, 2016), 72â73. &lt;/ref&gt;

Many long-held rights and powers were stripped from the Church and given to the State. In 1789, church lands were expropriated and priests killed and forced to leave France.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Hunt, ''Politics, Culture and Class in the French Revolution''; chp 3, "The Imagery of Radicalism", 1984, 87â119. &lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cult of Reason|Festival of Reason]] was held in the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], which was renamed "The Temple of Reason", and the old traditional calendar was replaced with a new revolutionary one.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', (London: Routledge, 2016), 72â73.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the Terror tried to address the call for these radical, revolutionary aspirations, while at the same time trying to maintain tight control on the de-Christianization movement that was threatening to the clear majority of the still devoted Catholic population of France. The tension sparked by these conflicting objectives laid a foundation for the "justified" use of terror to achieve revolutionary ideals and rid France of the religiosity that revolutionaries believed was standing in the way.

[[File:Robespierre crop.jpg|thumb|[[Maximilien Robespierre]], member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]]]

On 10 March 1793 the National Convention created the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. Among those charged by the tribunal, about a half were acquitted (though the number dropped to about a quarter after the enactment of the [[Law of 22 Prairial]]). In March rebellion broke out in the [[VendÃ©e]] in response to mass conscription, which developed into a civil war that lasted until after the Terror.

On 6 April the [[Committee of Public Safety]] was created, which gradually became the de facto war-time government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link= Hilary Mantel |last= Mantel |first= Hilary |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n15/hilary-mantel/he-roared |title= He Roared |work= London Review of Books |date= 6 August 2009 |volume= 3 |issue= 15 |pages= 3â6 |accessdate= 16 January 2010 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June, the Parisian sans-culottes surrounded the National Convention, calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral [[suffrage|franchise]] to sans-culottes alone. With the backing of the [[National Guard (France)|national guard]], they persuaded the convention to arrest 29 Girondist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Peter. ''The French Revolution 1787â1804''. Pearson Education, 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to the imprisonment of the Girondin deputies, some thirteen departments started the [[Federalist revolts]] against the National Convention in Paris, which were ultimately crushed. 

On 24 June, the convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, the [[French Constitution of 1793]]. It was ratified by public [[referendum]], but never put into force.

On 13 July the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]] â a [[Jacobin]] leader and journalist â resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence. [[Georges Danton]], the leader of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|August 1792 uprising]] against the [[Louis XVI of France|king]], was removed from the committee. On July 27, 1793, Robespierre became part of the Committee of Public Safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maximilien-Robespierre|title=Maximilien Robespierre {{!}} Biography, Facts, &amp; Execution|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 August, the National Convention decreed the [[levÃ©e en masse]], "The young men shall fight; the married man shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn all lint into linen; the old men shall betake themselves to the public square in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic."

[[File:La fournÃ©e des Girondins 10-11-1793.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of the [[Girondins]]]]
On 9 September, the convention established paramilitary forces, the "revolutionary armies", to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government. On 17 September, the [[Law of Suspects]] was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined "suspects". This created a mass overflow in the prison systems. On 29 September, the convention extended [[price fixing]] from grain and bread to other essential goods, and also fixed wages.

On 10 October, the Convention decreed that "the provisional government shall be revolutionary until peace." On 24 October, the [[French Republican Calendar]] was enacted. The trial of the Girondins started on the same day and they were executed on 31 October.

Anti-clerical sentiments increased during 1793 and a campaign of dechristianization occurred. On 10 November (20 Brumaire Year II of the French Republican Calendar), the HÃ©bertists organized a [[Cult of Reason|Festival of Reason]].

[[File:Olympe gouges.jpg|thumb|upright|The execution of [[Olympe de Gouges]], feminist writer close to the Girondins]]
On 14 Frimaire (5 December 1793) was passed the [[Law of Frimaire]], which gave the central government more control over the actions of the representatives on mission.

On 16 PluviÃ´se (4 February 1794), the National Convention decreed that slavery be abolished in all of France and French colonies.

On 8 and 13 VentÃ´se (26 February and 3 March), [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] proposed decrees to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the revolution, known as the [[VentÃ´se Decrees]].

By the end of 1793, two major factions had emerged, both threatening the Revolutionary Government: the HÃ©bertists, who called for an intensification of the Terror and threatened insurrection, and the Dantonists, led by [[Georges Danton]], who demanded moderation and clemency. The Committee of Public Safety took actions against both. The major HÃ©bertists were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed on 24 March. The Dantonists were arrested on 30 March, tried on 3 to 5 April and executed on 5 April.

On 20 Prairial (8 June) was celebrated across the country the Festival of the Supreme Being, which was part of the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], a deist national religion. On 22 Prairial (10 June), the National Convention passed a law proposed by [[Georges Couthon]], known as the [[Law of 22 Prairial]], which simplified the judicial process and greatly accelerated the work of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. With the enactment of the law, the number of executions greatly increased, and the period from this time to the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] became known as "The Grand Terror".

On 8 Messidor (26 June), the French army won the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], which marked a turning point in France's military campaign and undermined the necessity of wartime measures and the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government.

== Thermidorian Reaction ==

[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|right|thumb|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]]]

The fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety (and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow) and the moderates who completely opposed the revolutionary government. They had, between them, made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him, so that, after his fall, to advocate terror would be seen as adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic, putting the advocate's own head at risk. Between his arrest and his execution, Robespierre may have tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, although the bullet wound he sustained, whatever its origin, only shattered his jaw. Alternatively, he may have been shot by the gendarme Merda. The great confusion that arose during the storming of the municipal Hall of Paris, where Robespierre and his friends had found refuge, makes it impossible to be sure of the wound's origin.
In any case, Robespierre was guillotined the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, John (2004). "Thermidor" (2nd ed.). ''A history of modern Europe: from the Renaissance to the present'', p 507. W.W. Norton &amp; Company Ltd. {{ISBN|0-393-92495-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of the standing Committee of Public Safety was ended. New members were appointed the day after Robespierre's execution, and limits on terms of office were fixed (a quarter of the committee retired every three months). The Committee's powers were gradually eroded.

'''Robert Keith Dibble''' (born January 24, 1964) is an American former [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[pitcher]] and television analyst. Between 1988 and 1995, Dibble played for the [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. He was a two-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] who recorded 89 [[Save (baseball)|saves]] during his career. Since retiring as a player, Dibble has held several roles in sports television broadcasting.

==Personal life==
Dibble was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. He attended St. Thomas School, a [[parochial school]], and is a graduate of [[Southington High School]] in [[Southington, Connecticut]].  Dibble's father, Walt Dibble, was a longtime radio news director at [[WDRC-FM|WDRC]] and later [[WTIC (AM)|WTIC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].

==Playing career==

===Cincinnati Reds===
Dibble was drafted by the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in the first round of the 1983 amateur draft, and he made his debut with the Reds on June 29, 1988.

On June 4, 1989, Dibble struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning of a 5â3 win over the [[San Diego Padres]]. Dibble is one of 41 pitchers in Major League history to accomplish the [[Pitchers who struck out three batters on nine pitches|nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning]], a feat known as an immaculate inning.

He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] in [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1990]] and [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1991]], and was the [[1990 National League Championship Series|1990 NLCS]] [[Most Valuable Player]] (along with fellow "[[Nasty Boys (Cincinnati Reds)|Nasty Boy]]" [[Randy Myers]]). In 1990, Dibble and the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the [[1990 World Series|World Series]] by beating the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in four consecutive games.

Dibble recorded his 500th career strikeout in fewer inningsâ368âthan any other pitcher in modern baseball history up to that point (a record that is currently held by [[Craig Kimbrel]]).

====Temper====
During his career Dibble was known for his temper. During a game in July 1989, he hit [[1989 New York Mets season|Mets]] second basemen [[Tim Teufel]] in the back with a pitch; Teufel then [[charging the mound|charged]] Dibble, causing a benches clearing brawl. After saving a game in April 1991 despite giving up two runs in relief, Dibble threw a baseball 400 feet into the center-field seats at Cincinnati, inadvertently striking a woman.&lt;ref name=4May1991port&gt;{{cite news|title=National League suspends Dibble for 4 games for firing ball into stands|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hkRGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P9EMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2876,369254|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=[[Portsmouth Daily Times]]|date=4 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt4May1991&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Suspension for Reds' Dibble|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/04/sports/baseball-a-new-suspension-for-reds-dibble.html|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=4 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truebaseballstories"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shannon|first=Mike|title=Tales from the Dugout: The Greatest True Baseball Stories Ever Told|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-8092-2950-1|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y17fnEHFIcsC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=rob+dibble+temper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jtWuseI7dN&amp;sig=FKTLECwOrf_nNGQC6vsZHQHIUv4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p0T4S7-TLoKdlgedntnECg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rob%20dibble%20temper&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved in a brawl in 1991 with [[1991 Houston Astros season|Astros]] shortstop [[Eric Yelding]].&lt;ref name=nyt4May1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name="spartanburg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dibble, Yielding suspended|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19910418&amp;id=OuoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NM4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5474,749743|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=April 18, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1991 season, he threw a baseball into the back of [[1991 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] outfielder [[Doug Dascenzo]] as he ran down the first base line and was subsequently ejected from the game.&lt;ref name="nytimes_july261991"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vescey|first=Peter|title=Sports of The Times; Rob Dibble: The Pitcher Most Likely|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-rob-dibble-the-pitcher-most-likely.html|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 26, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dibble also was involved in a brawl with manager [[Lou Piniella]] in the Reds clubhouse after a game in 1992.&lt;ref name="la_times1992"&gt;{{cite news|title=Piniella, Dibble Brawl in Clubhouse|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-18/sports/sp-723_1_major-league|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 18, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Dibble required surgery to his pitching arm in 1994, and missed the entire season as a result. Dibble signed with the [[1995 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] and also played with the [[1995 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. He signed with the [[1995 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] at the end of the 1995 season, but voluntarily retired from the team the following March after a rough spring. Weeks later, he opted to make a comeback, signing a minor league contract on April 14, 1996 with the [[1996 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]],&lt;ref name="sunsentinel_apr171996"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=David|title=Marlins Taking A Chance On Dibble|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-04-17/sports/9604160589_1_dibble-marlins-reliever-matt-mantei|accessdate=6 March 2018|newspaper=Sun-Sentinel|date=April 17, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Dibble would ultimately see no game action with the Marlins or their minor league affiliates.

==Broadcasting career==
[[File:Rob Dibble 2009.jpg|thumb|Dibble with the Nationals in 2009.]]
In 1998, Dibble joined [[ESPN]] as a [[baseball]] analyst, working mostly on [[Dan Patrick]]'s radio show. He worked on ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'' as a co-host until 2008, when he left to join FOX on their Saturday baseball program as an analyst. Dibble also spends time as a co-host/analyst of First Pitch on [[XM]] Channel 175/Sirius channel 210. He formerly hosted ''The Show'' (on the same channel) with [[Jody McDonald]]. Dibble served as co-analyst (with [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]]) for [[FOXSports.com]] on a weekly video segment entitled "Around the Bases." Dibble also is a co-host with former Major League player [[Denny Hocking]] on Fox Sports Radio Sunday night programming. In 2009, Dibble signed a three-year contract to replace [[Don Sutton]] as the color voice of the [[Washington Nationals]] on [[MASN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/06/on-masn-dibble-wont-be-so-nasty/ Dibble not so 'nasty'].

While broadcasting a game in August 2010, Dibble drew negative attention for focusing on a group of female spectators in the Nationals crowd, and questioning their focus on the game.&lt;ref name="washpostWomen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Dan|title=Rob Dibble amazed by women at baseball game |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dcsportsbog/2010/08/rob_dibble_amazed_by_women_at.html|work=D.C.

[[File:S1ABanimated.gif|thumb|An illustration of the selection principle S1(A,B)]]
In mathematics, a '''selection principle''' is a rule asserting
the possibility of obtaining mathematically significant objects by 
selecting elements from given sequences of sets. The theory of '''selection principles'''
studies these principles and their relations to other mathematical properties.
Selection principles mainly describe covering properties, 
measure- and category-theoretic properties, and local properties in 
topological spaces, especially function spaces. Often, the 
characterization of a mathematical property using a selection 
principle is a nontrivial task leading to new insights on the 
characterized property.

==The main selection principles==
In 1924, [[Karl Menger]]
&lt;ref name="Karl Menger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menger|first1=Karl|
title=Einige ÃberdeckungssÃ¤tze der punktmengenlehre|
journal=Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie|date=1924|volume=133|
pages=421â444|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-7091-6110-4_14|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-6110-4_14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following basis property for metric spaces: 
Every basis of the topology contains a sequence of sets with vanishing 
diameters that covers the space. Soon thereafter, 
[[Witold Hurewicz]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurewicz|first1=Witold|
title=Ãber eine verallgemeinerung des Borelschen Theorems|
journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|date=1926|volume=24.1|pages=401â421|
url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01216792|doi=10.1007/bf01216792}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
observed that Menger's basis property is equivalent to the 
following selective property: for every sequence of open covers of the space, 
one can select finitely many open sets from each cover in the sequence, such that the selected sets cover the space.
Topological spaces having this covering property are called '''Menger spaces'''.

Hurewicz's reformulation of Menger's property was the first important 
topological property described by a selection principle. 
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; be classes of mathematical objects.
In 1996, [[Marion Scheepers]]&lt;ref name=coc1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheepers|first1=Marion|
title=Combinatorics of open covers I: Ramsey theory|
journal=Topology and its Applications|date=1996|volume=69|pages=31â62|
url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864195000674|doi=10.1016/0166-8641(95)00067-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following selection hypotheses,
capturing a large number of classic mathematical properties:

* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are elements &lt;math&gt;U_1\in\mathcal{U}_1,U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{U_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case where the classes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; consist of covers of some ambient space, Scheepers also introduced the following selection principle.

* &lt;math&gt;\text{U}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, none containing a finite subcover, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\bigcup \mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup \mathcal{F}_2,\dotsc\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Later, [[Boaz Tsaban]] identified the prevalence of the following related principle:
*&lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{A}}{\mathbf{B}}&lt;/math&gt;: Every member of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; contains a member of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

The notions thus defined are ''selection principles''. An instantiation of a selection principle, by considering specific classes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, gives a ''selection (or: selective) property''. However, these terminologies are used interchangeably in the literature.

===Variations===

For a set &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt; and a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the '''star of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;''' is the set &lt;math&gt;\text{St}(A,\mathcal{F})=\bigcup\{F\in\mathcal{F}:A\cap F\neq\emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1999, [[Ljubisa D.R. Kocinac]] introduced the following ''star selection principles'':&lt;ref name=Kssp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kocinac|first1=Ljubisa D. R.|
title=Star selection principles: a survey|
journal=Khayyam Journal of Mathematics|date=2015|volume=1|pages=82â106|
url=http://emis.de/journals/KJM/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1^*(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are elements &lt;math&gt;U_1\in\mathcal{U}_1,U_2\in\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\text{St}(U_n,\mathcal{U}_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;''':''' For every sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{U}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of elements from the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, there are finite subsets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq\mathcal{U}_1,\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq\mathcal{U}_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{\text{St}(\bigcup \mathcal{F}_n,\mathcal{U}_n):n\in\mathbb{N}\}\in\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Covering properties==

Covering properties form the kernel of the theory of selection principles.  Selection properties that are not covering properties are often studied by using implications to and from selective covering properties of related spaces.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]].  An ''open cover'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a family of open sets whose union is the entire space &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;  For technical reasons, we also request that the entire space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not a member of the cover.  The class of open covers of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}&lt;/math&gt;. (Formally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, but usually the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is fixed in the background.) The above-mentioned property of Menger is, thus, &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;. In 1942, Fritz Rothberger considered Borel's strong measure zero sets, and introduced a topological variation later called [[Rothberger space]] (also known as ''C&lt;math&gt;''&lt;/math&gt; space''). In the notation of selections, Rothberger's property is the property &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{1}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is '''point-cofinite''' if it has infinitely many elements, and every point  &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;U\in\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. (This type of cover was considered by Gerlits and Nagy, in the third item of a certain list in their paper. The list was enumerated by Greek letters, and thus these covers are often called '''&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-covers'''.) The class of point-cofinite open covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space is a [[Hurewicz space]] if it satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\text{U}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma})&lt;/math&gt;.

An open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an '''&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-cover''' if every finite subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. The class of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-covers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space is a [[Î³-space]] if it satisfies  &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega}}{\mathbf{\Gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;.

By using star selection hypotheses one obtains properties such as '''star-Menger''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;), '''star-Rothberger''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt;) and '''star-Hurewicz''' (&lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}^*(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma})&lt;/math&gt;).

===The Scheepers Diagram===
There are 36 selection properties of the form &lt;math&gt; \Pi(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\Pi\in\{\text{S}_1, \text{S}_\text{fin},\text{U}_\text{fin}, \bigl(~~\bigr)\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\in\{\mathbf{O},\mathbf{\Gamma},\mathbf{\Omega}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Some of them are trivial (hold for all spaces, or fail for all spaces). Restricting attention to [[LindelÃ¶f space]]s, the diagram below, known as the ''Scheepers Diagram'',&lt;ref name=coc1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="coc2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Miller|first2=Arnold|last3=Scheepers|first3=Marion|last4=Szeptycki|first4=Paul|date=1996|title=Combinatorics of open covers II|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864196000752|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=73|pages=241â266|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2|last1=Just|first1=Winfried}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents nontrivial selection properties of the above form, and every nontrivial selection property is equivalent to one in the diagram.  Arrows denote implications.

==Local properties==

Selection principles also capture important non-covering properties.

Let &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, and &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.  The class of sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that have the point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in their closure is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega_y}&lt;/math&gt;.  The class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega^{\text{ctbl}}_y}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the ''countable'' elements of the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Omega_y}&lt;/math&gt;.  The class of sequences in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that converge to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Gamma_y}&lt;/math&gt;.

* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[FrÃ©chetâUrysohn space|FrÃ©chetâUrysohn]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega_y}}{\mathbf{\Gamma_y}}&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[FrÃ©chetâUrysohn space|strongly FrÃ©chetâUrysohn]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_1(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Gamma_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\binom{\mathbf{\Omega_y}}{\mathbf{\Omega^{\text{ctbl}}_y}}&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness|countable fan tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Omega_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has [[countable tightness|countable strong fan tightness]] if and only if it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{1}(\mathbf{\Omega_y},\mathbf{\Omega_y})&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Topological Games==

There are close connections between selection principles and [[topological game|Topological Games]].

===The Menger game===

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Menger game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game for two players, Alice and Bob.  It has an inning per each natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  At the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; inning, Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,
and Bob chooses a finite subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  
If the family &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then Bob wins the game. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A '''strategy''' for a player is a function determining the move of the player, given the earlier moves of both players. A strategy for a player is a '''winning strategy''' if each play where this player sticks to this strategy is won by this player.

* A topological space is &lt;math&gt;\text{S}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; if and only if Alice has no winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on this space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coc1" /&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric space. Bob has a winning strategy in the game &lt;math&gt;\text{G}_{\text{fin}}(\mathbf{O},\mathbf{O})&lt;/math&gt; played on the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Marion|date=1995-01-01|title=A direct proof of a theorem of TelgÃ¡rsky|url=http://www.ams.org/proc/1995-123-11/S0002-9939-1995-1273523-1/|journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|volume=123|issue=11|pages=3483â3485|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1995-1273523-1|issn=0002-9939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TelgÃ¡rsky|first=Rastislav|date=1984-06-01|title=On games of Topsoe.|url=http://www.mscand.dk/article/view/12050|journal=MATHEMATICA SCANDINAVICA|volume=54|issue=0|pages=170â176|doi=10.7146/math.scand.a-12050|issn=1903-1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar way, we define games for other selection principles from the given Scheepers Diagram. In all these cases a topological space has a property from the Scheepers Diagram if and only if Alice has no winning strategy in the corresponding game.&lt;ref name="pawlikowski"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=Janusz|title=Undetermined sets of point-open games|url=https://eudml.org/doc/212029|journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|volume=144|issue=3|issn=0016-2736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsets of the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (with the induced [[subspace topology]]) holding selection principle properties, most notably Menger and Hurewicz spaces, can be characterized by their continuous images in the [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Self-knowledge''' is a term used in [[psychology]] to describe the information that an individual draws upon when finding an answer to the question ''"What am I like?"''.

While seeking to develop the answer to this question, self-knowledge requires ongoing [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]] (which is not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). Young infants and chimpanzees display some of the traits of self-awareness&lt;ref&gt;Gallup, G. G., Jr. (1979). ''Self-recognition in chimpanzees and man: A developmental and comparative perspective''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[agency (philosophy)|agency]]/contingency,&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, N. W., &amp; Ramey, C. T. (1977). Learning to control the environment in infancy. ''Child Development, 48,''806-819.&lt;/ref&gt; yet they are not considered as also having self-consciousness. At some greater level of [[cognition]], however, a self-conscious component emerges in addition to an increased self-awareness component, and then it becomes possible to ask ''"What am I like?"'', and to answer with self-knowledge.

Self-knowledge is a component of the [[Self (psychology)|self]] or, more accurately, the [[self-concept]]. It is the knowledge of oneself and one's properties and the ''desire'' to seek such knowledge that guide the development of the self-concept. Self-knowledge informs us of our mental representations of ourselves, which contain attributes that we uniquely pair with ourselves, and theories on whether these attributes are stable or dynamic.

The self-concept is thought to have three primary aspects:
* The [https://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/the-cognitive-self-the-self-concept/ cognitive self]
* The [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a864/fbfd34426c98b2832a3c2aa9fbc7df8bb910.pdf affective self]
* The [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0010027715000256/1-s2.0-S0010027715000256-main.pdf?_tid=710543c7-e98f-4484-85e2-acf02e7076cc&amp;acdnat=1528121667_89562a04b60eba34b74c91685e1508c9 executive self]

The affective and executive selves are also known as the ''felt'' and ''active'' selves respectively, as they refer to the emotional and behavioral components of the self-concept.
Self-knowledge is linked to the cognitive self in that its motives guide our search to gain greater clarity and assurance that our own self-concept is an accurate representation of our ''true self'';{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} for this reason the cognitive self is also referred to as the ''known self''. The cognitive self is made up of everything we know (or ''think we know'' about ourselves). This implies physiological properties such as hair color, race, and height etc.; and psychological properties like beliefs, values, and dislikes to name but a few.

==Relationship with memory==
Self-knowledge and its structure affect how events we experience are [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], how they are selectively [[Recollection|retrieved/recalled]], and what conclusions we draw from how we interpret the [[memory]]. The analytical interpretation of our own memory can also be called ''[[meta memory]]'', and is an important factor of ''[[meta cognition]]''.

The connection between our memory and our self-knowledge has been recognized for many years by leading minds in both [[philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1731). ''An essay concerning human understanding.'' London: Edmund Parker. (Original work published 1690)&lt;/ref&gt; and psychology,&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890). ''The principles of psychology'' (Vol. 1). New York: Holt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kihlstrom, J. F., &amp; Klein, S. B. (1994). The self as a knowledgeable structure. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 35-36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt; yet the precise specification of the relation remains a point of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Kihlstrom, J. F., &amp; Klein, S. B. (1997). Self-knowledge and self-awareness. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 35-36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialized memory===
* Studies have shown there is a memory advantage for information encoded with reference to the self.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35''(9),677-688&lt;/ref&gt;
* Patients with [[Alzheimer's]] who have difficulty recognizing their own family have not shown evidence of self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S., Cosmides, L., &amp; Costabile, K. (2003). Preserved knowledge of self in a case of Alzheimer's dementia. ''Social Cognition, 21''(2), 157-165&lt;/ref&gt;

===The division of memory===
Self-theories have traditionally failed to distinguish between different source that inform self-knowledge, these are ''[[episodic memory]]'' and ''[[semantic memory]]''. Both episodic and semantic memory are facets of ''[[declarative memory]]'', which contains memory of facts. Declarative memory is the explicit counterpart to ''[[procedural memory]]'', which is implicit in that it applies to skills we have learnt; they are not ''facts'' that can be ''stated''.

[[File:Schematic memory.JPG|thumb|400px|A basic schematic representation of memory showing the 'locations' of semantic and episodic memory.]]

====Episodic memory====
{{Main article|Episodic memory}}
[[Episodic memory]] is the autobiographical memory that individuals possess which contains events, emotions, and knowledge associated with a given context.

====Semantic memory====
{{Main article|Semantic memory}}
[[Semantic memory]] does not refer to concept-based knowledge stored about a specific experience like episodic memory. Instead it includes the memory of meanings, understandings, general knowledge about the world, and factual information etc. This makes semantic knowledge independent of context and personal information. Semantic memory enables an individual to know information, including information about their selves, without having to consciously recall the experiences that taught them such knowledge.

=====Semantic self as the source=====
People are able to maintain a sense of self that is supported by semantic knowledge of personal facts in the absence of direct access to the memories that describe the episodes on which the knowledge is based.
* Individuals have been shown to maintain a sense of self despite catastrophic impairments in episodic recollection. For example, subject W.J., who suffered dense ''[[retrograde amnesia]]'' leaving her unable to recall any events that occurred prior to the development of amnesia. However, her memory for general facts about her life during the period of amnesia remained intact.
:*This suggests that a separate type of knowledge contributes to the self-concept, as W.J.'s knowledge could not have come from her episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Kihlstrom, J. F. (1996). Self-knowledge of an amnesia patient: Toward a neuropsychology of personality and social psychology. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 125,''250-160&lt;/ref&gt;
:**A similar dissociation occurred in K.C. who suffered a total loss of episodic memory, but still knew a variety of facts about himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E. (1989). Remembering and knowing the past. ''American Scientist, 77,''361-367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E., Schacter, D. L., McLachlan, D. R., &amp; Moscovitch, M. (1988). Priming of semantic autobiographical knowledge: A case study of retrograde amnesia. ''Brain and Cognition, 8,''3-20&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Evidence also exists that shows how patients with severe [[amnesia]] can have accurate and detailed semantic knowledge of what they are like as a person, for example which particular personality traits and characteristics they possess.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Loftus, J. (1993). The mental representation of trait and autobiographical knowledge about the self. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Chan, R. L., &amp; Loftus, J. (1999). Independence of episodic and semantic self-knowledge: The case from autism. ''Social Cognition, 17,''413-436&lt;/ref&gt;
This evidence for the dissociation between episodic and semantic self-knowledge has made several things clear:
# Episodic memory is not the only drawing point for self-knowledge, contrary to long-held beliefs. Self-knowledge must therefore be expanded to include the semantic component of memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cermack, L. S., &amp; O'Connor, M. (1983). The anteriograde retrieval ability of a patient with amnesia due to encephalitis. ''Neuropsychologia, 21,''213-234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., Wilson, B., Wraight, E. P., &amp; Hodges, J. R. (1993). Neuropsychological and SPECT scan findings during and after transient global amnesia: Evidence for the differential impairment of remote episodic memory. ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 56,''1227-1230&lt;/ref&gt;
# Self-knowledge about the traits one possesses can be accessed without the need for episodic retrieval. This is shown through study of individuals with neurological impairments that make it impossible to recollect trait-related experiences, yet who can still make reliable and accurate trait-ratings of themselves, and even revise these judgements based on new experiences they cannot even recall.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Kihlstrom, J. F., 7 Loftus, J. (2000). ''Preserved and impaired self-knowledge in amnesia: A case study''. Unpublished manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives that guide our search==
People have goals that lead them to seek, notice, and interpret information about themselves. These goals begin the quest for self-knowledge.
There are three primary motives that lead us in the search for self-knowledge:
* Self-enhancement
* Accuracy
* Consistency

===Self-enhancement===
{{Main article|Self-enhancement}}
'''[[Self-enhancement]]''' refers to the fact that people seem motivated to experience positive emotional states and to avoid experiencing negative emotional states. People are motivated to feel good about themselves in order to maximize their feelings of self-worth, thus enhancing their [[self-esteem]].&lt;br /&gt;
The emphasis on ''feelings'' differs slightly from how other theories have previously defined self-enhancement needs, for example the ''Contingencies of Self-Worth Model''.&lt;ref&gt;Crocker, J., &amp; Wolfe, C. T. (2001). Contingencies of self-worth. ''Psychological Review, 108,''593-623&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other theorists have taken the term to mean that people are motivated to '''''think''''' about themselves in highly favorable terms, rather than '''''feel''''' they are "good".&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. (1990). To be adored or to be known? The interplay of self-enhancement and self-verification. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburg, M. (1979). ''Conceiving the self.'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In many situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as highly capable or ''better'' than one's peers. However, in some situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as ''average'' or even ''worse'' than others. In both cases, thoughts about the self still serve to enhance feelings of self-worth.
The universal need is not a need to think about oneself in any specific way, rather a need to maximize one's feelings of self-worth. This is the meaning of the self enhancement motive with respect to self-knowledge.

====Arguments====
In Western societies, feelings of self-worth ''are'' in fact promoted by thinking of oneself in favorable terms.
* In this case, self-enhancement needs lead people to seek information about themselves in such a way that they are likely to conclude that they truly possess what they see as a positive defining quality.

See "[[#Self-verification theory|Self-verification theory]]" section.

===Accuracy===
Accuracy needs influence the way in which people search for self-knowledge. People frequently wish to know the truth about themselves without regard as to whether they learn something positive or negative.&lt;ref&gt;Trope, Y. (1986). Self-enhancement, self-assessment, and achievement behavior. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
There are three considerations which underlie this need:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D. (1991). Accuracy and bias in self-knowledge. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Occasionally people simply want to reduce any uncertainty. They may want to know for the sheer intrinsic pleasure of knowing what they are truly like.
* Some people believe they have a moral ''obligation'' to know what they are really like. This view holds particularly strong in [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], particularly [[existentialism]].
* Knowing what one is really like can sometimes help an individual to achieve their goals. The basic fundamental goal to any living thing is survival, therefore accurate self-knowledge can be adaptive to survival.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1954"&gt;Festinger, L. (1954). A theory of social comparison processes. ''Human Relations, 7,''117-140&lt;/ref&gt;
Accurate self-knowledge can also be instrumental in maximizing feelings of self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikedes, C., &amp; Strube, M. J. (1997). Self-evaluation: To thine own self be good, to thine own self be sure, to thine own self be true, and to thine own self be better. ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 29''&lt;/ref&gt; Success is one of the number of things that make people feel good about themselves, and knowing what we are like can make successes more likely, so self-knowledge can again be adaptive. This is because self-enhancement needs can be met by knowing that one ''can not'' do something particularly well, thus protecting the person from pursuing a dead-end dream that is likely to end in failure.

===Consistency===
Many theorists believe that we have a motive to protect the self-concept (and thus our self-knowledge) from change.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S. (1980). The self-concept: A review and the proposal of an integrated theory of personality. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, P. (1945). ''Self-consistency: A theory of personality.'' New York: Island Press&lt;/ref&gt; This motive to have consistency leads people to look for and welcome information that is consistent with what they believe to be true about themselves; likewise, they will avoid and reject information which presents inconsistencies with their beliefs. This phenomenon is also known as [[self-verification theory]].
Not everyone has been shown to pursue a self-consistency motive;&lt;ref&gt;Steele, C. M., &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1992). The primacy of self-integrity. ''Psychological Enquiry, 3,''345-346&lt;/ref&gt; but it has played an important role in various other influential theories, such as  [[Cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). ''A theory of cognitive dissonance.'' Evanston, IL: Row Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-verification theory====
{{Main article|Self-verification theory}}This theory was put forward by [[William Swann]] of the [[University Of Texas|University of Texas at Austin]] in 1983 to put a name to the aforementioned phenomena. The theory states that once a person develops an idea about what they are like, they will strive to verify the accompanying self-views.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. (1983). Self-verification: Bringing social reality into harmony with the self. (As cited in Suls, J., &amp; Greenwald, A. G. (Eds.), ''Social psychological perspectives on the self, 2,''33-66. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum)&lt;/ref&gt;
Two considerations are thought to drive the search for self-verifying feedback:&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Stein-Seroussi, A., &amp; Giesler, R. B. (1992). Why people self-verify. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62,''392-401&lt;/ref&gt;
* We feel more comfortable and secure when we believe that others see us in the same way that we see ourselves. Actively seeking self-verifying feedback helps people avoid finding out that they are wrong about their self-views.
* Self-verification theory assumes that social interactions will proceed more smoothly and profitably when other people view us the same way as we view ourselves. This provides a second reason to selectively seek self-verifying feedback.
These factors of self-verification theory create controversy when persons suffering from low-self-esteem are taken into consideration. People who hold negative self-views about themselves ''selectively seek negative feedback'' in order to verify their self-views. This is in stark contrast to self-enhancement motives that suggest people are driven by the desire to feel good about themselves.

==Sources==
There are three sources of information available to an individual through which to search for knowledge about the self:
* The physical world
* The social world
* The psychological world

===The physical world===
The physical world is generally a highly visible, and quite easily measurable source of information about one's self. Information one may be able to obtain from the physical world may include:
* Weight - by weighing oneself.
* Strength - by measuring how much one can lift.
* Height - by measuring oneself.

====Limitations====
* Many attributes are not measurable in the physical world, such as kindness, cleverness and sincerity.
* Even when attributes can be assessed with reference to the physical world, the knowledge that we gain is not necessarily the knowledge we are seeking. Every measure is simply a ''relative measure'' to the level of that attribute in, say, the general population or another specific individual.
** This means that any measurement only merits meaning when it is expressed in respect to the measurements of others.
** Most of our personal identities are therefore sealed in comparative terms from the social world.

===The social world===
The comparative nature of self-views means that people rely heavily on the social world when seeking information about their selves. Two particular processes are important:
* ''[[Social comparison theory|Social Comparison Theory]]''&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1954"/&gt;
* ''Reflected Appraisals''

====Social comparison====
{{Main article|Social comparison theory}}
People compare attributes with others and draw inferences about what they themselves are like. However, the conclusions a person ultimately draws depend on whom in particular they compare themselves with. The need for accurate self-knowledge was originally thought to guide the social comparison process, and researchers assumed that comparing with others who are similar to us in the ''important'' ways is more informative.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J. V. (1989). Theory and research concerning social comparisons of personal attributes. ''Psychological Bulletin'', ''106'', 231-248&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Complications of the social comparison theory=====
People are also known to compare themselves with people who are slightly better off than they themselves are (known as an ''upward comparison'');&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. L. (1996). For better or worse: The impact of upward social comparisons on self-evaluations. ''Psychological Bulletin, 119,''51-69&lt;/ref&gt; and with people who are slightly worse off or disadvantaged (known as a ''downward comparison'').&lt;ref&gt;Wills, T. A. (1981). Downward comparison principles in social psychology. ''Psychological Bulletin 90,''245-271&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also substantial evidence that the need for ''accurate'' self-knowledge is neither the only, nor most important factor that guides the social comparison process,&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, V. S., &amp; Mickelson, K. D. (1995). Motives for social comparison. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21,''1200-1209&lt;/ref&gt; the need to feel good about ourselves affects the social comparison process.

====Reflected appraisals====
'''Reflected appraisals''' occur when a person observes how others respond to them. The process was first explained by the [[Sociology|sociologist]] Charles H. Cooley in 1902 as part of his discussion of the "''looking-glass self''", which describes how we see ourselves reflected in other peoples' eyes.&lt;ref name="cooley1902"&gt;Cooley, C. H. (1902). ''Human nature and the social order.'' New York: Charles Scribner's Sons&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a person's feelings towards themselves are socially determined via a three-step process:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A self-idea of this sort seems to have three principled elements: the imagination of our appearance to the other person; the imagination of his judgment of that appearance; and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification. The comparison with a looking-glass hardly suggests the second element, the imagined judgment which is quite essential. The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind." (Cooley, 1902, p.153)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In simplified terms, Cooley's three stages are:&lt;ref name="cooley1902" /&gt;
# We imagine how we appear in the eyes of another person.
# We then imagine how that person is evaluating us.
# The imagined evaluation leads us to feel good or bad, in accordance with the judgement we have conjured.
Note that this model is of a [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] nature.

In 1963, John W. Kinch adapted Cooley's model to explain how a person's ''thoughts''  about themselves develop rather than their ''feelings''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinch, J. W. (1963). A formalized theory of self-concept. ''American Journal of Sociology, 68,''481-486&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinch's three stages were:
# Actual appraisals - what other people actually think of us.
# Perceived appraisals - our perception of these appraisals.
# Self-appraisals - our ideas about what we are like based on the perceived appraisals.
This model is also of a phenomenological approach.

=====Arguments against the reflected appraisal models=====
Research has only revealed limited support for the models and various arguments raise their heads:
* People are not generally good at knowing what an individual thinks about them.&lt;ref&gt;Felson, R. B. (1993). The (somewhat) social self: How others affect self-appraisals. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
** Felson believes this is due to communication barriers and imposed social norms which place limits on the information people receive from others. This is especially true when the feedback would be negative; people rarely give one another negative feedback, so people rarely conclude that another person dislikes them or is evaluating them negatively.
* Despite being largely unaware of how one person in particular is evaluating them, people are better at knowing what other people ''on the whole'' think.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, D. A., &amp; DePaulo, B. M. (1993). Do people know how others view them? An empirical and theoretical account. ''Psychological Bulletin, 114,''145-161&lt;/ref&gt;
** The reflected appraisal model assumes that ''actual appraisals'' determine ''perceived appraisals''. Although this may in fact occur, the influence of a common third variable could also produce an association between the two.

The sequence of reflected appraisals may accurately characterize patterns in early childhood due to the large amount of feedback infants receive from their parents, yet it appears to be less relevant later in life. This is because people are not passive, as the model assumes. People ''actively'' and ''selectively'' process information from the social world. Once a person's ideas about themselves take shape, these also influence the manner in which new information is gathered and interpreted, and thus the cycle continues.

===The psychological world===
'''The psychological world''' describes our "inner world". There are three processes that influence how people acquire knowledge about themselves:
* [[Introspection]]
* [[Self-perception theory|Self-perception processes]]
* [[Attribution (psychology)|Causal attributions]]

====Introspection====
[[Introspection]] involves looking inwards and directly consulting our attitudes, feelings and thoughts for meaning.
Consulting one's own thoughts and feelings can sometimes result in meaningful self-knowledge. The accuracy of introspection, however, has been called into question since the 1970s. Generally, introspection relies on people's explanatory theories of the self and their world, the accuracy of which is not necessarily related to the form of self-knowledge that they are attempting to assess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=Richard E.|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1977|volume=84|issue=3|pages=231â259|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.84.3.231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A stranger's ratings about a participant are more correspondent to the participant's self-assessment ratings when the stranger has been subject to the participant's thoughts and feelings than when the stranger has been subject to the participant's behavior alone, or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, S. M. (1984). Self-knowledge and social inference: II. The diagnosticity of cognitive/affective and behavioral data. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46,''280-293&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparing sources of introspection.''' People believe that spontaneous forms of thought provide more meaningful self-insight than more deliberate forms of thinking. Morewedge, Giblin, and Norton (2014) found that the more spontaneous a kind of thought, the more spontaneous a particular thought, and the more spontaneous thought a particular thought was perceived to be, the more insight into the self it was attributed. In addition, the more meaning the thought was attributed, the more the particular thought influenced their judgment and decision making. People asked to let their mind wander until they randomly thought of a person to whom they were attracted to, for example, reported that the person they identified provided them with more self-insight than people asked to simply think of a person to whom they were attracted to. Moreover, the greater self-insight attributed to the person identified by the (former) random thought process than by the latter deliberate thought process led those people in the random condition to report feeling more attracted to the person they identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=Carey K.|last2=Giblin|first2=Colleen E.|last3=Norton|first3=Michael I.|title=The (perceived) meaning of spontaneous thoughts.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=2014|volume=143|issue=4|pages=1742â1754|doi=10.1037/a0036775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Arguments against introspection=====
&lt;!-- are these meant to be arguments against the reliability of introspection, or arguments why it's not a good idea to introspect? needs to be made clear --&gt;
Whether introspection always fosters self-insight is not entirely clear. Thinking too much about why we feel the way we do about something can sometimes confuse us and undermine true self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., &amp; Hodges, S. D. (1992). Attitudes as temporary constructions. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in an introspection condition are less accurate when predicting their own future behavior than controls&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., &amp; LaFleur, S. J. (1995). Knowing what you'll do: Effects of analyzing reasons on self-prediction. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 68,''21-35&lt;/ref&gt; and are less satisfied with their choices and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., Lisle, D., Schooler, J., Hodges, S. D., Klaaren, K. J., &amp; LaFleur, S. J. (1993). Introspecting about reasons can reduce post-choice satisfaction. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 19,''331-339&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is important to notice that introspection allows the exploration of the consious mind only, and does not take into account the unconscious motives and processes, as found and formulated by Freud. 

====Self-perception processes====
{{Main article|Self-perception theory}}
Wilson's work is based on the assumption that people are not always aware of ''why'' they feel the way they do. Bem's '''self-perception theory'''&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-perception theory. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; makes a similar assumption.
The theory is concerned with how people ''explain'' their behavior. It argues that people don't always ''know'' why they do what they do. When this occurs, they infer the causes of their behavior by analyzing their behavior in the context in which it occurred. Outside observers of the behavior would reach a similar conclusion as the individual performing it. The individuals then draw logical conclusions about why they behaved as they did.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Individuals come to "know" their own attitudes, emotions, and other internal states partially by inferring them from observations of their own overt behavior and/or the circumstances in which this behavior occurs. Thus, to the extent that internal cues are weak, ambiguous, or uninterpretable, the individual is functionally in the same position as an outside observer, an observer who must necessarily rely upon those same external cues to infer the individual's inner states." (Bem, 1972, p.2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The theory has been applied to a wide range of phenomena. Under particular conditions, people have been shown to infer their attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J. M., &amp; Hafer, C. L. (1990). Self-inference processes: Looking back and ahead. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; emotions,&lt;ref&gt;Laird, J. D. (1974). Self-attribution and emotion: The effects of expressive behavior on the quality of emotional experience. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29,''475-486&lt;/ref&gt; and motives,&lt;ref&gt;Lepper, M. R., Greene, D., &amp; Nisbett, R. E. (1973). Undermining of children's intrinsic interest with extrinsic rewards: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 28,''129-137&lt;/ref&gt; in the same manner described by the theory.

Similar to introspection, but with an important difference: with introspection we ''directly examine'' our attitudes, feelings and motives. With self-perception processes we ''indirectly infer'' our attitudes, feelings, and motives by ''analyzing our behavior''.

====Causal attributions====
Causal attributions are an important source of self-knowledge, especially when people make attributions for positive and negative events. The key elements in self-perception theory are explanations people give for their actions, these explanations are known as causal attributions.

Causal attributions provide answers to "Why?" questions by attributing a person's behavior (including our own) to a cause.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, B. (1985). An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion. ''Psychological Review, 92,''548-573&lt;/ref&gt;

People also gain self-knowledge by making attributions for ''other people's'' behavior; for example "If nobody wants to spend time with me it must be because I'm boring".

==Activation==
Individuals think of themselves in many different ways, yet only some of these ideas are active at any one given time. The idea that is specifically active at a given time is known as the '''Current Self-Representation'''. Other theorists have referred to the same thing in several different ways:
* The phenomenal self&lt;ref&gt;Jones, E. E., &amp; Gerard, H. B. (1967). ''Foundations of social psychology.'' New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spontaneous self-concept&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, W. J., &amp; McGuire, C. V. (1981). The spontaneous self-concept as affected by personal distinctiveness. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Self-identifications&lt;ref&gt;Schlenker, B. R., &amp; Weigold, M. F. (1989). Goals and the self-identification process: Constructing desired identities. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aspects of the working self-concept&lt;ref name="Markus, H. 1986"&gt;Markus, H., &amp; Kunda, Z. (1986). Stability and malleability of the self-concept. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51,''858-866&lt;/ref&gt;
The current self-representation influences information processing, emotion, and behavior and is influenced by both ''personal'' and ''situational'' factors.

===Personal factors that influence current self-representation===

====Self-concept====
[[Self-concept]], or how people ''usually'' think of themselves is the most important personal factor that influences current self-representation. This is especially true for attributes that are important and self-defining.

Self-concept is also known as the self-schema, made of innumerable smaller self-schemas that are "chronically accessible".&lt;ref name="Markus, H. 1986"/&gt;

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] affects the way people feel about themselves. People with high self-esteem are more likely to be thinking of themselves in positive terms at a given time than people suffering low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., &amp; Mankowski, T. A. (1993). Self-esteem, mood, and self-evaluation: Changes in mood and the way you see you. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64,''421-430&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mood state====
Mood state influences the accessibility of positive and negative self-views.

When we are happy we tend to think more about our positive qualities and attributes, whereas when we are sad our negative qualities and attributes become more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, C. (1995). Central and peripheral self-conceptions are differentially influenced by mood: Tests of the different sensitivity hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69,''759-777&lt;/ref&gt;

This link is particularly strong for people suffering low self-esteem.

====Goals====
People can deliberately activate particular self-views. We select appropriate images of ourselves depending on what role we wish to play in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, M. (1979). Self-monitoring processes (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular goal that influences activation of self-views is the desire to feel good.&lt;ref&gt;Kunda, Z., &amp; Santioso, R. (1989). Motivated changes in the self-concept. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 25,''272-285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational factors that influence current self-representation===

====Social roles====
How a person thinks of themselves depends largely on the social role they are playing. Social roles influence our personal identities.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. W., &amp; Donahue, E. M. (1994). One personality, multiple selves: Integrating personality and social roles. ''Journals of Personality, 62,''199-218&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social context and self-description====
People tend to think of themselves in ways that distinguish them from their social surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, L. J., &amp; Miller, D. T. (1995). The distinctiveness effect in social categorization: You are what makes you unusual. ''Psychological Science, 6,''246-249&lt;/ref&gt;
* The more distinctive the attribute, the more likely it will be used to describe oneself.
Distinctiveness also influences the salience of '''group identities'''.
:[[Self-categorization theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S. D., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory.'' Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that whether people are thinking about themselves in terms of either their social groups or various personal identities depends partly on the social context.
* Group identities are more salient in the intergroup contexts.

=====Group size=====
The size of the group affects the salience of group-identities. Minority groups are more distinctive, so group identity should be more salient among minority group members than majority group members.

=====Group status=====
Group status interacts with group size to affect the salience of social identities.

====Social context and self-evaluation====
The social environment has an influence on the way people evaluate themselves as a result of social-comparison processes.

=====The contrast effect=====

Social comparison, self-consistency, and the concept of the self. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 16,''148-156&lt;/ref&gt; However, this effect has come under criticism as to whether it is a primary effect, as it seems to share space with the assimilation effect, which states that people evaluate themselves more positively when they are in the company of others who are exemplary on some dimension.
* Whether the assimilation or contrast effect prevails depends on the psychological closeness, with people feeling psychologically disconnected with their social surroundings being more likely to show contrast effects. Assimilation effects occur when the subject feels psychologically connected to their social surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, M. B., &amp; Weber, J. G. (1994).

====Recent events====
Recent events can cue particular views of the self, either as a direct result of failure, or via mood.

==Deficiencies==

===Specific types===

====Misperceiving====
*Deficiency in knowledge of the ''present self''.
*Giving reasons but not feelings disrupts self-insight.

====Misremembering====

*Knowledge from the present ''overinforms'' the knowledge of the past.
*False theories shape autobiographical memory.

====Misprediction====
*Deficiency of knowledge of the ''future self''.
*Knowledge of the present ''overinforms'' predictions of future knowledge.
*[[Affective forecasting]] can be affected by [[durability bias]].

====Miswanting====

A '''subject''' is a being who has a [[subjective consciousness|unique consciousness]] and/or unique [[personhood|personal experiences]], or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside itself (called an "[[Object (philosophy)|object]]").

A ''subject'' is an observer and an ''object'' is a thing observed. This concept is especially important in [[Continental philosophy]], where 'the subject' is a central term in debates over the nature of the self.&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; The nature of the subject is also central in debates over the nature of [[subjective experience]] within the Anglo-American tradition of [[analytical philosophy]].

The sharp distinction between subject and object corresponds to the distinction, in the philosophy of [[RenÃ© Descartes]], between thought and extension. Descartes believed that [[Mental substance|thought]] ([[subjectivity]]) was the essence of the mind, and that [[res extensa|extension]] (the occupation of space) was the essence of matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Descartes|first=RenÃ© |title=The Principles of Philosophy|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4391/pg4391-images.html|section=LIII|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German idealism==
''Subject'' as a key-term in thinking about human [[consciousness]] began its career with the [[German Idealist]]s, in response to [[David Hume]]'s radical [[skepticism]]. The idealists' starting point was Hume's conclusion that there is nothing to the self over and above a big, fleeting bundle of perceptions.  The next step was to ask how this undifferentiated bundle comes to be experienced as a unity&amp;nbsp;â as a single ''subject''. Hume had offered the following proposal:

:"''...the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects.''&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David. {{Google books|6c3f0NqRmnUC|The Philosophical Works of David Hume (1826 edition)|page=27|19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and their successors sought to flesh out the process by which the subject is constituted out of the flow of sense impressions.  Hegel, for example, stated in his Preface to the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' that a subject is constituted by "the process of reflectively mediating itself with itself."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phprefac.htm Preface to the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel begins his definition of the subject at a standpoint derived from [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] physics: "the unmoved which is also ''self-moving''" (Preface, para. 22).  That is, what is not moved by an outside force, but which propels itself, has a ''prima facie'' case for subjectivity.  Hegel's next step, however, is to identify this power to move, this unrest that is the subject, as ''pure negativity''.  Subjective self-motion, for Hegel, comes not from any pure or simple kernel of authentic individuality, but rather, it is

::"...the bifurcation of the simple; it is the doubling which sets up opposition, and then again the negation of this indifferent diversity and of its anti-thesis" (Preface, para. 18).

The Hegelian subject's ''modus operandi'' is therefore cutting, splitting and introducing distinctions by injecting negation into the flow of sense-perceptions.  Subjectivity is thus a kind of structural effect&amp;nbsp;â what happens when Nature is diffused, refracted around a field of negativity and the "unity of the subject" for Hegel, is in fact a second-order effect, a "negation of negation".  The subject experiences itself as a unity only by purposively negating the very diversity it itself had produced. The Hegelian subject may therefore be characterized either as "self-restoring sameness" or else as "reflection in otherness within itself" (Preface, para. 18).

==Continental philosophy&lt;!--'Assujettissement', 'Ethopoiein', 'Split subject', 'Subjectivation', 'Subjectification', 'Post-structuralist subject' and 'Poststructuralist subject' redirect here; linked from 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--&gt;==
The thinking of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] provided a point of departure for questioning the notion of a unitary, autonomous Subject, which for many thinkers in the Continental tradition is seen as the foundation of the [[liberal theory]] of the [[social contract]].  These thinkers opened up the way for the [[deconstruction]] of the subject as a core-concept of [[metaphysics]].

Sigmund Freud's explorations of the [[unconscious mind]] added up to a wholesale indictment of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notions of subjectivity.

Among the most radical re-thinkers of human self-consciousness was [[Martin Heidegger]], whose concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' or "Being-there" displaces traditional notions of the personal subject altogether. With Heidegger, phenomenology tries to go beyond the classical dichotomy between subject and object, because they are linked by an inseparable and original relationship, in the sense that  there can be no world without a subject, nor the subject without world.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method]". ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):506â2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]], inspired by Heidegger and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], built on Freud's [[psychoanalytic]] model of the subject, in which the "'''[[Splitting (psychology)|split]] subject'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" is constituted by a [[double bind]]: alienated from [[jouissance]] when he or she leaves [[the Real]], enters into [[the Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] (during the [[mirror stage]]), and separates from the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] when he or she comes into the realm of language, difference, and [[Demand (psychoanalysis)|demand]] in [[the Symbolic]] or [[the Name of the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Stewart, Maire Jaanus, Richard Feldstein (eds.), ''Lacan in the German-Speaking World'', SUNY Press, 2004, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thinkers such as [[structural Marxist]] [[Louis Althusser]] and [[poststructuralist]] [[Michel Foucault]]&lt;ref name=:0&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/heartfield-james.htm#n13 |title = Postmodernism and the 'Death of the Subject' |last = Heartfield |first = James |year = 2002 |work = The Death of the Subject |accessdate= 28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; theorize the subject as a [[social construction]], the so-called '''poststructuralist subject'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Edel Heuven, "The Poststructuralist Subject and the Paradox of Internal Coherence", M.Sc. thesis, Wageningen University and Research, 2017, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Althusser, the "subject" is an [[Ideology|ideological]] construction (more exactly, constructed by the "[[Louis Althusser#Ideological state apparatuses|Ideological State Apparatuses]]"). One's subjectivity exists, "always already" and is discovered through the process of [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]]. Ideology inaugurates one into being a subject, and every ideology is intended to maintain and glorify its idealized subject, as well as the metaphysical category of the subject itself (see [[antihumanism]]). 

According to Foucault, it is the "effect" of [[power (sociology)#Foucault|power]] and "[[disciplinary institutions|disciplines]]" (see ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'': construction of the subject ('''subjectivation'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; or '''subjectification''', {{lang-fr|assujettissement}}) as student, soldier, "criminal", etc.). Foucault believed it was possible to transform oneself; he used the word '''''ethopoiein'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; from the word ''ethos'' to describe the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foucault | first = Michel | title = The hermeneutics of the subject : lectures at the CollÃ¨ge de France, 1981-1982 | publisher = Picador | location = New York | year = 2006 | pages= 237 | isbn = 9780312425708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectification was a central concept in [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[FÃ©lix Guattari]]'s work as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Genosko (ed.), ''Deleuze and Guattari: Deleuze and Guattari'', Routledge, 2001, p. 1315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
In contemporary [[analytic philosophy]], the issue of subjectâand more specifically the "point of view" of the subject, or "subjectivity"âhas received attention as one of the major intractable problems in [[philosophy of mind]] (a related issue being the [[mindâbody problem]]). In the essay "[[What is it like to be a bat?]]", [[Thomas Nagel]] famously argued that explaining [[subjective experience]]âthe "what it is like" to be somethingâis currently beyond the reach of scientific inquiry, because scientific understanding by definition requires an objective perspective, which, according to Nagel, is diametrically opposed to the subjective first-person point of view. Furthermore, one cannot have a definition of objectivity without being connected to subjectivity in the first place since they are mutual and interlocked.

In Nagel's book ''[[The View From Nowhere]]'', he asks: "What kind of fact is it that I am Thomas Nagel?". Subjects have a perspective but each subject has a unique perspective and this seems to be a fact in Nagel's view from nowhere (i.e. the birds-eye view of the objective description in the universe). The Indian view of "Brahman" suggests that the ultimate and fundamental subject is existence itself, through which each of us as it were "looks out" as an aspect of a frozen and timeless everything, experienced subjectively due to our separated sensory and memory apparati. These additional features of subjective experience are often referred to as ''[[qualia]]'' (see [[Frank Cameron Jackson]] and [[Mary's room]]).

'''Substantive equality''' is a fundamental aspect of [[Human Rights Law|human rights law]] that is concerned with equitable outcomes and [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] for disadvantaged and marginalized people and groups in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cusack, Simone, Ball, Rachel (2009) Eliminating Discrimination and Ensuring Substantive Equality.

== Definition ==
Substantive equality has been criticized for not having a clear definition. [[Sandra Fredman]] has however argued that substantive equality should be viewed as a four dimensional concept of recognition, redistribution, participation, and transformation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredman|first=Sandra|date=2016-04-16|title=Emerging from the Shadows: Substantive Equality and Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights|url=https://academic.oup.com/hrlr/article/16/2/273/2356204|journal=Human Rights Law Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=273â301|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngw001|issn=1461-7781}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redistributive dimension seeks to redress disadvantage through affirmative action, while the recognition dimension aims to promote the right to equality and identify the stereotypes, prejudice and violence that affect marginalized and disadvantaged individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The participative dimension uses Ely's insight to argue that [[judicial review]] must compensate marginalized individuals for their lack of political power. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5333737|title=Democracy and distrust : a theory of judicial review|last=1938-|first=Ely, John Hart,|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674196368|location=Cambridge|oclc=5333737}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The participative dimension may also implement positive duties to ensure that all those affected by discrimination can be active members of society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lastly, the transformative dimension recognizes that equality is not achieved through equal treatment and that the societal structures which reinforce disadvantage and discrimination must be modified or transformed to accommodate difference.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The transformative dimension may use both [http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Duty#Positive_and_negative_duties positive and negative duties] to redress disadvantage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Fredman advocates for a four-dimensional approach to substantive equality as a way to address the criticisms and limitations it faces due to the lack of agreeance on its definition by scholars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

== History ==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|alt=A marble bust of Aristotle. He has a full beard and short, combed-forward hair, and is wearing a yellow alabaster mantle.|Aristotle was the first to make the connection between equality and justice.]]
[[Aristotle]] was the first philosopher to articulate the connection between equality and justice. Aristotle believed equals were to be treated alike and unequals in an unlike manner.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Goonesekere, Savitri W.E (2011). The Concept of Substantive Equality and Gender in South East Asia. United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's notion of equality influenced the conception of formal equality in western jurisprudence. Formal equality advocates for the neutral treatment of all people based on the norms of the dominant group in society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Substantive equality originated in western jurisprudence and politics in opposition to formal equality during the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This approach was inspired by early landmark constitutional cases in America, which broke away from formal approaches to equality in favor of a more substantive process. For example, in [[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v Board of Education]] (1954) the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] deemed it unlawful to segregate childrenâs access to education on the basis of race.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This case was influential in transforming Americaâs anti-discrimination laws as it sought equitable outcomes and equal opportunities for [[African Americans]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The substantive approach rejects earlier notions that claimed social, political, economic, and historical differences were a legitimate justification for the differential treatment of marginalised and disadvantaged groups in society.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Law commission of Ontario (2012). Principles for the Law as it Affects Persons with Disabilities. Law commission of Ontario. {{ISBN|978-1-926661-38-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The substantive approach to equality is entrenched in human rights treaties, laws, and jurisprudence, which is then adopted and implemented by nation states and private actors. This is present in Article 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|ECHR]], which states that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; (275)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Article 14 prohibits discrimination in all aspects of public life on the basis of nominated attributes. Although article 14 fails to mention discrimination on the basis of sexuality, age, and disability recent developments in case law have shown that these grounds are illustrative but not exhaustive and can extend to include these factors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Nation states that have signed and ratified the ECHR have an obligation to enact legislation preventing discrimination by using special measures to protect and advance the lives of disadvantaged and marginalized individuals in society. Article 1(4) of the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|ICERD]] defines special measures as, "securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (9) These two articles are the fundamental principles that define the practice of substantive equality. Failure to enact substantive legislation by signatories may result in heavy sanctions and scrutiny from the international community.Â  Â  

== National approaches ==

=== Australia ===
Substantive equality is made apparent through the anti-discrimination laws of Australia, which aim to protect and advance the lives of marginalized and disadvantaged individuals. Anti-discrimination laws are enacted by commonwealth, state, and territory parliaments and are then interpreted by courts and tribunals.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/australian-anti-discrimination-and-equal-opportunity-law/oclc/1005961080|title=Australian anti-discrimination and equal opportunity law|last=Rees|first=Neil|last2=Rice|first2=Simon|last3=Allen|first3=Dominique|date=2018|isbn=9781760021559|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are covered under the following four key commonwealth statutes: the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|Racial Discrimination Act (1975)]], [[Sex Discrimination Act 1984|Sex Discrimination Act (1984)]], [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992|Disability Discrimination Act (1992)]], and [[Age Discrimination Act 2004|Age Discrimination Act (2004)]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

All Australian states and territories have enacted one statute called the [[Anti-discrimination laws in Australia|anti-discrimination]] or equal opportunities act which prohibits all forms of discrimination in public life on the basis of nominated attributes identified in Article 26 of the ICCPR.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This statute makes it unlawful to discriminate against others both directly, which is when a person is treated unfairly based on a nominated attribute, or indirectly which occurs when something is fair in form but discriminatory in practice.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, [https://www.humanrights.gov.au/quick-guide/12049 indirect discrimination] may occur in the workforce when employees or potential employees are expected to comply with a condition or requirement of the job (i.e. height restrictions) but are unable to meet them because they are unreasonable or unfair.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Failure to comply to anti-discrimination laws are enforceable in civil proceedings which may result in heavy fines or penalties. However, these laws have been criticized for focusing too much on compensation and not enough on preventing discrimination from occurring.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Anti-discrimination laws use substantive measures by promoting equal opportunities and implementing special measures identified in Article 1(4) [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|ICERD]] to overcome discrimination in the Australian society. Private actors, organizations, and governments use special measures in the form of [[affirmative action]] programs to ensure disadvantaged individuals are given the same opportunities as everyone else. The Australian government has identified women, [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]], people with disabilities, and non-English speaking migrants as high priority groups for the administration of special measures programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Northern Territory]] government has recognized Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and people with disabilities as high priority groups for their affirmative action programs by focusing on employment opportunities for these groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These programs use substantive measures as they acknowledge that there is a need to treat people differently by prioritizing these groups as they have been unfairly discriminated upon. For example, in 2011 the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|ABS]] reported that Indigenous peoples were 3 times more likely to be unemployed than non-indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Dillon Sarah, Nissim, Rivkah (2015). "Targeted Recruitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People: a Guideline for Employers". Australian Human Rights Commission. {{ISBN|978-1-921449-75-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates the need for affirmative action policies to protect and advance the lives of Aboriginal people, as they do not have the same access or opportunities to employment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;Â  Â  

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the government of the [[Northwest Territories]] announced in October 2018 that it would be implementing two new programs to increase employment and pay rates for [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous Canadian]] staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first, Indigenous career gateway program for entry-level staff, aims to increase the number of Indigenous people working for the territorial government. The second, Indigenous management development and training program, aims to help Indigenous government employees gain further training so that they can advance to higher-paid positions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cabinradio.ca/10061/news/nwt-launches-two-new-indigenous-employment-programs/|title=NWT launches two new Indigenous employment programs|last=Williams|first=Ollie|date=2018|work=Cabin Radio|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Cases ==

==== R v Kapp 2008 SCC 41 ====
The case of [[R v Kapp]] was instrumental in shifting the focus from formal equality to substantive equality in Canadian jurisprudence. In 1998, the Canadian government granted a communal fishing license exclusively to members of three Aboriginal bands for a period of 24 hours in the [[Fraser River|Fraser river]] that allowed them the right to fish and sell their catch.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreau|first=Sophia|date=2009|title=R.

==== Z v Z (no 2) (1997) 2NZLR 258 (CA) ====
The seminal case of Z v Z highlighted the issues with equal sharing of relationship property at the end of a relationship. In this the case, the couple had been married for 28 years.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garland|first=Fae|date=2014-11-01|title=Section 15 Property (Relationships) Act 1976: Compensation, Substantive Equality and Empirical Realities: English|url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/section-15-property-relationships-act-1976-compensation-substantive-equality-and-empirical-realities(c8c380d0-3090-4186-98f9-bd6694e1ffb3).html|journal=New Zealand Law Review|language=English|volume=2014|issue=3|pages=355â381|issn=1173-5864}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the primary caregiver Mrs Z gave up her career to care for the couple's children.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; At the end of the relationship, the couple had a property valued at $900,000. Mr Z was on a salary of over $300,000 per annum, while Mr Z received $7,000 in assistance from the government.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Z v Z, the court failed to protect the primary caregiver by not taking into account her future earning capacity and her past sacrifices.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The [[Property (Relationships) Act 1976|property (relationships) amendment act (2001)]] was introduced to rectify the problems of equal sharing highlighted in Z v Z.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The property act uses substantive equality to recognize that equal treatment can lead to disadvantage. The act recognizes the impact relationships can have on the earning capacities of individuals and it aims to place them in more substantive position at the end of the relationship.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, the property act has been criticized for its ability to achieve substantive equality, as it does not state how economic disparity should be quantified.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Scholars have argued that it does not protect the most vulnerable as it is skewed towards relationships with high incomes because it more difficult to establish an economic disparity in lower income cases.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

== Criticism ==
Substantive equality has been criticized in the past for its vague definition and its ability to help combat discrimination for marginalized and disadvantaged individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Scholars have argued that the meaning of substantive equality remains elusive, which makes it difficult to implement change due to the lack of consensus. The meaning of equality itself has been labeled as subjective as there are too many conflicting opinions within society to find one underlying definition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Substantive equality has also been criticized for its lack of ability to protect individuals from discrimination and for placing too much emphasis on compensation rather than preventing discrimination from occurring.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Welfare and affirmative action programs have been recognized as areas of concern, as the way in which they are delivered can be discriminatory in nature because they can reinforce and perpetuate stigmas that are held within society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Substantive equality is a well contested concept in which scholars, nations, and the law must work together in order to agree on a definition and appropriate framework for implementation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''supersoldier''' (or '''super soldier''') is a concept [[soldier]], often fictional, capable of operating beyond normal human limits or abilities. 

==Overview==
Supersoldiers are common in [[science fiction]] literature, films and video games. In 2012, [[DARPA]] was reported to be developing an externally powered [[Sarcos#Powered exoskeleton|XOS exoskeleton]] design for greatly increased strength and endurance.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2187276/U-S-Army-Soldiers-able-run-Olympic-speed-wont-need-food-sleep-gene-technology.html | title=Army of the future | publisher=The Daily Mail online | date=12 August 2012 | accessdate=4 August 2013 | author=Damien Gayle | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130804180543/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2187276/U-S-Army-Soldiers-able-run-Olympic-speed-wont-need-food-sleep-gene-technology.html | archivedate=4 August 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fictional supersoldiers are usually heavily [[Human enhancement|augmented]], either through [[eugenics]], [[genetic engineering]], [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] implants, [[medication|drugs]], [[brainwashing]], [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] events, an extreme training regimen or other scientific and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] means. Occasionally, some instances also use [[paranormal]] methods, such as [[black magic]] or technology and science of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin. In entertainment, the creators of such programs are viewed often as [[mad scientist]]s or stern [[military personnel]] depending on the emphasis, as their programs would typically go past [[ethics|ethical]] boundaries in the pursuit of science or military might.

==Cyborg soldier==
Some fictional supersoldiers can also be categorized as [[cyborg|cyborgs]] or [[cybernetic]] [[organism|organisms]] because of augmentations that are intended to enhance human capabilities or to exceed physical human restrictions.&lt;ref name = Footnote&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footnote1.com/robots-soldiers-cyborgs-the-future-of-warfare/ | title = The Cyborgization of Human Soldiers | publisher = Footnote1 | date =24 October 2013 | accessdate = 1 May 2015 | author = Armin Krishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Army==
In the book ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'' (2004), Welsh journalist [[Jon Ronson]] documented how the U.S. military repeatedly tried and failed to train soldiers in the use of parascientific combat techniques during the Cold War,&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/nov/21/politics | title=Acting the giddy goat. | publisher=Guardian News | work=Book review | date=21 November 2004 | accessdate=5 August 2013 | author=Tim Adams | quote=''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' by Jon Ronson, Picador, pp.240.}}&lt;/ref&gt; experimenting with New Age tactics and [[psychic]] phenomena such as remote viewing, astral projections, "death touch" and mind reading against various Soviet targets.

'''Tact''' is a term that [[B.F. Skinner]] used to describe a verbal [[operant]] which is controlled by a nonverbal stimulus (such as an object, event, or property of an object) and is maintained by nonspecific social reinforcement ([[praise]]).&lt;ref name="Skinner"&gt;{{cite book|author=Skinner, B.F.|year=1957|title=Verbal Behavior|publisher=Appleton Century Croft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less technically, a tact is a label. For example, a child may see their pet dog and say "dog"; the nonverbal stimulus (dog) evoked the response "dog" which is maintained by praise (or generalized conditioned reinforcement) "you're right, that is a dog!"

Chapter five of Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' discusses the tact in depth. A tact is said to "make contact with" the world, and refers to behavior that is under the control of generalized [[reinforcement]]. The controlling antecedent [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is [[nonverbal]], and constitutes some portion of "the whole of the physical environment." &lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

The tact described by Skinner includes three important and related events, known as the 3-term-contingency: a stimulus, a response, and a consequence, in this case reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt; A verbal response is occasioned by the presence of a stimulus, such as when you say "ball" in the presence of a ball. In this scenario, "ball" is more likely to be reinforced by the listener than saying "cat", showing the importance of the third event, reinforcement, in relation to the stimulus (ball) and response ("ball"). Although the stimulus controls the response, it is the verbal community which establishes the stimulus' control over the verbal response of the speaker. For example, a child may say "ball" in the presence of a ball (stimulus), the child's parent may respond "yes, that is a ball", (reinforcement) thereby increasing the probability that the child will say ball in the presence of a ball in the future. On the other hand, if the parent never responds to the child saying "ball" in the presence of a ball then the probability of that response will decrease in the future.

A tact may be pure or impure. For example, if the environmental stimulus evokes the response, the tact would be considered pure. If the tact is evoked by a verbal stimulus the resulting tact would be considered impure. For example, if a child is shown a picture of a dog, and emits the response "dog" this would be an example of a pure tact. If a child is shown a picture of a dog, and is given the verbal instruction "what is this?" then the response "dog" would be considered an impure tact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bondy, A., Tincani, M., Frost, L.|year=2004|title=Multiply controlled verbal operants: An analysis and extension to the picture exchange communication system|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=27|issue=2|pages=247â261|pmc=2755401|pmid=22478433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tact can be extended, as in generic, metaphorical, metonymical, solecistic, nomination, and "guessing" tact. It can also be involved in [[abstraction]]. Lowe, Horne, Harris &amp; Randle (2002) would be one example of recent work in tacts.

==Extensions==
The tact is said to be capable of generic extension. Generic extension is essentially an example of stimulus generalization. The novel stimulus contains all of the relevant features of the original stimulus. For example, we may see a red car and say "car" as well as see a white car and say "car". Different makes and models of cars will all evoke the same response "car".&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cooper,  J.C., Heron, T.E., &amp; Heward, W.L.|year=2007|title=Applied Behavior Analysis|edition=2nd|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0131421134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacts can be extended metaphorically; in this case the novel stimulus has only some of the defining features of the original stimulus. For example, when we describe something as "exploding with taste" by drawing the common property of an explosion with the response to our having eaten something (perhaps a strong response, or a sudden one).&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Tacts can undergo metonymical extension when some irrelevant but related feature of the original stimulus controls a response. In metonymical extension, one word often replaces another; we may replace a part for a whole. For example, saying "refrigerator" when shown a picture of a kitchen, or saying "White house" in place of "President."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

When controlling variables unrelated to standard or immediate reinforcement take over control of the tact, it is said to be solecistically extended. Malapropisms, solecism and catachresis are examples of this.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

Skinner notes things like serial order, or conspicuous features of an object, may come to play as nominative tacts. A proper name may arise as a result of the tact. For example, a house that is haunted becomes "The Haunted House" as a nominative extension to the tact of its being haunted.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

A guess may seemingly be the emission of a response in the absence of controlling stimuli. Skinner notes that this may simply be a tact under more subtle or hidden controlling variables, although this is not always the case in something like guessing the landing side of a coin toss, where the possible alternatives are fixed and there is no subtle or hidden stimuli to control responses.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

==Special conditions affecting stimulus control==
Skinner deals with factors that interfere with, or change, generalized reinforcement. It is these conditions which, in turn, affect verbal behavior which may depend largely or entirely on generalized reinforcement. In children with developmental disabilities, tacts may need intensive training procedures to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Pereira-Delgado, J.A. &amp; Oblak, M.|year=2007|title=The Effects of Daily Intensive Tact Instruction on the Emission of Pure Mands and Tacts in Non-Instructional Settings by Three Preschool Children with Developmental Delays|journal=Journal of early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention|volume=4|issue=2|pages=392â411|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/eib/4/2/392/|doi=10.1037/h0100381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as [[Poverty|deprivation]], emotional conditions and personal history may interfere with or change verbal behavior. Skinner mentions alertness, irrelevant emotional variables, "special circumstances" surrounding particular listeners or speakers, etc. (He refers to the conditions which are said to produce objective and subjective responses for example). We would now look at these as motivating operations/establishing conditions.

Under [[wikt:emersion|emersion]] conditions tacts will frequently emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Tsiouri, I. &amp; Greer, R.D.|year=2007|title=The Role of Different Social Reinforcement Contingencies in Inducing Echoic Tacts Through Motor Imitation Responding in Children with Severe Language Delays|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention|volume=4|issue=4|pages=229â48|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ805694|doi=10.1037/h0100397}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in children with disabilities, more intensive training procedures are often needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Schauffler, G. &amp; Greer, R.D.|year=2006|title=The Effects of Intensive Tact Instruction on Audience-Accurate Tacts and Conversational Units|journal=JEIBI|volume=3|issue=1|pages=121â7|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ843635|doi=10.1037/h0100326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distortion==
Distorted [[stimulus control]] may be minor as when a description (tact) is a slight exaggeration. Under stronger conditions of distortion, it may appear when the original stimulus is absent, as in the case of the response called a lie. Skinner notes that [[troubadour]]s and fiction writers are perhaps both motivated by similar forms of tact distortion. Initially, they may recount real events, but as differential reinforcement affects the account we may see distortion and then total fabrication.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

==Tact training==
Often, individuals with autism, developmental disabilities, or language delays have difficulty acquiring novel tacts. Many researchers in the field of verbal behavior and developmental disabilities have examined more intensive training procedures in order to teach tacts to these individuals. Specific types of prompts can be used in order to make a tact response more likely. For example, asking the student the question "what is this?" (this would be an example of an impure tact) has been used to prompt a correct tact response (this prompt can be faded until the learner can emit a pure tact). Echoic prompts (teacher repeats the correct answer which the learner must echo) have also been used to train tact responses. Kodak and Clements (2009) found that echoic training sessions before tact training was more effective at increasing independent tact responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kodak, T., &amp; Clements, A.|year=2009|title=Acquisition of mands and tacts with concurrent echoic training|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=42|pages=839â842|doi=10.1901/jaba.2009.42-839|pmc=2790939|pmid=20514191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner (1957) suggested that verbal operants were functionally independent, meaning that after teaching one verbal operant the individual may not be able to emit the topographically same response under different stimulus conditions. For example, a child may be able to request water, but may not be able to tact water. Researchers are currently examining procedures that may facilitate the generalization across verbal operants. Some studies have indicated, for example, that after teaching a child to [[Mand (psychology)|mand]] for items, they could then tact them as well without direct instruction. Multiple studies have found support for the emergence of tact responses without direct instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Egan, C. E., &amp; Barnes-Holmes, D.|year=2009|title=Emergence of tacts following mand training in young children with autism|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=42|issue=3|pages=691â696|doi= 10.1901/jaba.2009.42-691|pmc=2741075|pmid=20190930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Greer, R. D., Chavez-Brown, M., &amp; Rivera-Valdes, C.|year=2005|title=The emergence of the listener to speaker component of naming in children as a function of multiple exemplar instruction|journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior|volume=21|issue=1|pages=123â134|pmc=2774093|pmid=22477318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Petursdottir, A. I., Carr, J. E., &amp; Michael, J.|year=2005|title=Emergence of mands and tacts of novel objects among preschool children|journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior|volume=21|issue=1|pages=59â74|pmc=2774104|pmid=22477314}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teaching procedures are especially important for individuals with autism and developmental disabilities because the learner can gain additional skills without direct instruction time.

'''Taylor diagrams''' are [[mathematical diagram]]s designed to graphically indicate which of several approximate representations (or models) of a system, process, or phenomenon is most realistic.

It is used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the modeled and observed behavior in terms of three statistics:  the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]], the [[root mean square deviation|root-mean-square error]] (RMSE) error, and the [[standard deviation]].

==Sample diagram==
The sample Taylor diagram shown in Figure 1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/about/staff/Taylor/CV/Taylor_diagram_primer.pdf Taylor diagram primer (2005), K.E. Taylor]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the relative skill with which several global climate models simulate the spatial pattern of annual mean precipitation.  Eight models, each represented by a different letter on the diagram, are compared, and the distance between each model and the point labeled âobservedâ is a measure of how realistically each model reproduces observations.  For each model, three statistics are plotted: the Pearson correlation coefficient (gauging similarity in pattern between the simulated and observed fields) is related to the azimuthal angle (blue contours); the centered RMS error in the simulated field is proportional to the distance from the point on the x-axis identified as âobservedâ (green contours); and the standard deviation of the simulated pattern is proportional to the radial distance from the origin (black contours).  It is evident from this diagram, for example, that for Model F the correlation coefficient is about 0.65, the RMS error is about 2.6&amp;nbsp;mm/day and the standard deviation is about 3.3&amp;nbsp;mm/day.  Model Fâs standard deviation is clearly greater than the standard deviation of the observed field (indicated by the dashed contour at radial distance 2.9&amp;nbsp;mm/day). 
[[File:Primer fig1a.svg|400px|center|thumb|Fig. 1: Sample Taylor diagram displaying a statistical comparison with observations of eight model estimates of the global pattern of annual mean precipitation.]]

The relative merits of various models can be inferred from Figure 1. Simulated patterns that agree well with observations will lie nearest the point marked "observed" on the x-axis. These models have relatively high correlation and low RMS errors. Models lying on the dashed arc have the correct standard deviation (which indicates that the pattern variations are of the right amplitude). In Figure 1 it can be seen that models A and C generally agree best with observations, each with about the same RMS error. Model A, however, has a slightly higher correlation with observations and has the same standard deviation as the observed, whereas model C has too little spatial variability (with a standard deviation of 2.3&amp;nbsp;mm/day compared to the observed value of 2.9&amp;nbsp;mm/day). Of the poorer performing models, model E has a low pattern correlation, while model D has variations that are much larger than observed, in both cases resulting in a relatively large (~3&amp;nbsp;mm/day) centered RMS error in the precipitation fields. Note also that although models D and B have about the same correlation with observations, model B simulates the amplitude of the variations (i.e., the standard deviation) much better than model D, resulting in a smaller RMS error.

==Theoretical basis==
Taylor diagrams display statistics useful for assessing the similarity of a variable simulated by a model (more generally, the âtestâ field) to its observed counterpart (more generally, the âreferenceâ field).  Mathematically, the three statistics displayed on a Taylor diagram are related by the following formula (which can be derived directly from the definition of the statistics appearing in it):

 &lt;math&gt;E^{\prime2} = \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_t^2 - 2 \sigma_r \sigma_t \rho &lt;/math&gt;,

 where ''Ï'' is the correlation coefficient between the test and reference fields, ''E''â² is the centered RMS difference between the fields (with any difference in the means first removed), and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; are the variances of the reference and test fields, respectively.  The [[law of cosines]] &lt;math&gt;(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos\phi,&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are the length of the sides of the triangle, and ''Ï'' is the angle between sides ''a'' and ''b'') provides the key to forming the geometrical relationship between the four quantities that underlie the Taylor diagram (shown in Figure 2).[[File:Taylor diagram fig2.png|300px|right|thumb|Fig. 2: Geometrical relationship between statistics plotted on Taylor diagrams according to the law of cosines.]]  The standard deviation of the observed field &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_r)&lt;/math&gt; is side ''a''.  The [[standard deviation]] of the simulated field &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_t)&lt;/math&gt; is side ''b'', the centered [[root mean square deviation|RMS difference]] between the two fields (''E''â²) is side ''c'', and the cosine of the angle between sides ''a'' and ''b'' is the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] (''Ï'').

Note that the means of the fields are subtracted out before computing their second-order statistics, so the diagram does not provide information about overall biases, but solely characterizes the centered pattern error.

==Taylor diagram variants==
Among the several minor variations on the diagram that have been suggested are (see, Taylor, 2001&lt;ref name=Taylor2001/&gt;):

* extension to a second "quadrant" (to the left of the quadrant shown in Figure 1) to accommodate negative correlations;
* normalization of dimensional quantities (dividing both the RMS difference and the standard deviation of the "test" field by the standard deviation of the observations) so that the "observed" point is plotted at unit distance from the origin along the x-axis, and statistics for different fields (with different units) can be shown in a single plot;
* omission of the isolines on the diagram to make it easier to see the plotted points;
* use of an arrow to connect two related points on the diagram.  For example, an arrow can be drawn from the point representing an older version of a model to a newer version, which makes it easier to indicate more clearly whether or not the model is moving toward "truth," as defined by observations.

'''Teresa Toda''' ([[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]], June 24, 1950) is a Basque journalist. 
Her father was a Spanish diplomat.  During her childhood and youth, she lived in [[Chile]], in [[Brazil]], in the United States ([[Los Angeles]]), and in [[London]]. In 1968, she began studying journalism in Spain, at the University of Navarre, which was run by the Catholic Opus Dei.  
She became involved in left-wing, nationalist and anti-Franco politics, for which she was expelled together with around 40 students more. 
She returned to [[London]] where she worked for The [[Law Society Gazette]] and then at [[Visnews]] (television news agency). In 1971, she returned to [[Madrid]] to finish her career and worked at the daily paper ABC, thus getting to know the difficulties of journalism under [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].  
Later on, she moved to [[Barcelona]], where she worked at the Press Office of CCOO, a left wing trade union, during the first years of the Spanish "transition". She collaborated in a [[Catalan language|Catalan]] weekly as well.

She began working as a correspondent for [[Egin (newspaper)|Egin]], the Basque independentist newspaper, in Madrid in 1984. In 1989, after the shooting of two Basque MPâs in Madrid  as they were having supper, (one of them, Josu Muguruza,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zohardia|url = http://zohardia.esy.es/indexeng.html|website = zohardia.esy.es|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was also her Editor in [[Egin (newspaper)|Egin]]), she had to move to the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. She worked first as Editor of the Basque political section and, from 1992 to 1998, as Assistant Editor in Chief. Egin was shut down by the Spanish Government in July 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ten years after closure of the newspaper Egin and Egin Irratia radio {{!}} Baietz Fundazioa|url = http://www.baietz.org/?q=eu/node/3035|website = www.baietz.org|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The shutting down of the paper entailed judicial proceedings against the Editor in Chief, 8 members of the Board and Teresa Toda. While awaiting trial, she worked at the magazine of [[Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak|LAB]], an independentist Basque trade union. During those years, she became a member of the Board of [[Basque PEN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Euskal PEN - Basque PEN|url = http://www.euskalpen.eus/#!who-we-are/c11kq|website = Euskal PEN - Basque PEN|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became involved in activities in defence of freedom of speech and expression at diverse levels.

The trial began in 2005 at the Special Anti-Terrorist Court in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SONS OF MALCOLM: 42 WELL-KNOWN BASQUE COUNTRY ACTIVISTS ARRESTED|url = http://sonsofmalcolm.blogspot.com.es/2007/12/42-well-known-basque-country-activists.html|website = SONS OF MALCOLM|date = 2007-12-04|accessdate = 2015-10-07|first = Sukant|last = Chandan}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received harsh sentences, which the Supreme Court later on cut down. She finally served six full years, all of them in prisons very far from her home. 
During that time, she kept up her relationship with [[Basque PEN]] and, through them, with [[PEN International]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PEN International|url = http://www.pen-international.org/?lang=es|website = www.pen-international.org|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received tens of letters and cards every Christmas from writers all over the world, and she herself  wrote letters supporting imprisoned [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] journalists.
She was released in 2013, and since then she has resumed her activities at the Board of Basque PEN and in favour of freedom of speech.

She has also translated several books on conflict resolution, from English to Spanish.

According to the [[Global Terrorism Database]] maintained by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, have been recorded from 2000 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Terrorism Index 2015 |url=http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf |publisher=Institute for Economics and Peace |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etmologically, the word terror is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''Tersere'', which later becomes ''Terrere''. The latter form appears in European languages as early as the 12th century; its first known use in French is the word ''terrible'' in 1160. By 1356 the word ''terreur'' is in use. ''Terreur'' is the origin of the [[Middle English]] term ''terrour'', which later becomes the modern word "terror".&lt;ref name=jf /&gt;

[[File:JacobinVignette03.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Seal of the [[Jacobin]] Club: 'Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality'.]]
The term ''terroriste'', meaning "terrorist", is first used in 1794 by the French philosopher [[FranÃ§ois-NoÃ«l Babeuf]], who denounces [[Maximilien Robespierre]]{{'}}s [[Jacobin]] regime as a dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Princeton University Press |last=Palmer |first=R.R. |title=The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760â1800 |chapter=The French Directory Between Extremes |date=2014 |jstor=j.ctt5hhrg5.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kellner&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/17405900410001674515 |issn=1740-5904 |eissn=1740-5912 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=41â64 |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=9/11, spectacles of terror, and media manipulation: A critique of Jihadist and Bush media politics |journal=Critical Discourse Studies |date=April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years leading up to the Reign of Terror, the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] threatened Paris with an "exemplary, never to be forgotten vengeance: the city would be subjected to military punishment and total destruction" if the royal family was harmed, but this only increased the Revolution's will to abolish the monarchy.&lt;ref name=duncan /&gt; Some writers attitudes about [[French Revolution]] grew less favorable after the French monarchy was abolished in 1792. During the [[Reign of Terror]], which began in July 1793 and lasted thirteen months, Paris was governed by the Committee of Public safety who oversaw a regime of mass executions and public purges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4725-0912-3 |last=Crawford |first=Joseph |title=Gothic Fiction and the Invention of Terrorism: The Politics and Aesthetics of Fear in the Age of the Reign of Terror |date=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the French Revolution, ancient philosophers wrote about [[tyrannicide]], as tyranny was seen as the greatest political threat to Greco-Roman civilization. [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] were similarly occupied with the concept of tyranny, though the analysis of some theologians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] drew a distinction between usurpers, who could be killed by anyone, and legitimate rulers who abused their power â the latter, in Aquinas' view, could only be punished by a public authority. [[John of Salisbury]] was the first medieval Christian scholar to defend tyrannicide.&lt;ref name=jf&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=271â288 |last=Fine |first=Jonathan |title=Political and Philological Origins of the Term 'Terrorism' from the Ancient Near East to Our Times |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |date=2010 |jstor=20720662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars today trace the origins of the modern tactic of terrorism to the Jewish [[Sicarii Zealots]] who attacked Romans and Jews in 1st century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. They follow its development from the Persian [[Order of Assassins]] through to 19th-century anarchists. The "Reign of Terror" is usually regarded as an issue of etymology. The term terrorism has generally been used to describe violence by non-state actors rather than government violence since the 19th-century [[Anarchism in France|Anarchist Movement]].&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=3â21 |last=Ken Duncan |title=A Blast from the Past Lessons from a Largely Forgotten Incident of State-Sponsored Terrorism |journal=Perspectives on Terrorism |date=2011 |jstor=26298499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = OUP Oxford| isbn = 978-0-19-154198-8| last = Houen| first = Alex| title = Terrorism and Modern Literature: From Joseph Conrad to Ciaran Carson| date = 2002-09-12 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-135-16595-6| last = Thackrah| first = John Richard| title = Dictionary of Terrorism| date = 2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1795, [[Edmund Burke]] used the word "Terrorists" in a description of the new [[French Directory|French government called 'Directory']]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Burke]] â To The Earl Fitzwilliam (Christmas, 1795.)

Retrieved 10 July 2017. &lt;br /&gt;This Internet version contains two, mingled, indications of page numbers: one with single brackets like [260], one with double brackets like [ [309] ]. Burke lengthily introduces his view on 'this present [[French Directory|Directory government]]', and then writes on page [ [359] ]: "Those who arbitrarily erected the new building out of the old materials of their own [[National Convention|Convention]], were obliged to send for an Army to support their work.

There are over 109 different definitions of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Arie W 2006 pp. 45-48"&gt;Arie W. Kruglanski and Shira Fishman Current Directions in Psychological Science Vol. 15, No. 1 (Feb., 2006), pp. 45â48&lt;/ref&gt; American political philosopher [[Michael Walzer]] in 2002 wrote: "Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders".&lt;ref name=Walzer /&gt; [[Bruce Hoffman]], an American scholar, has noted that

It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[C.A.J. Coady]] has written that the question of how to define terrorism is "irresolvable" because "its natural home is in polemical, ideological and propagandist contexts".&lt;ref name=teichman&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 64| issue = 250| pages = 505â517| last = Jenny Teichman| title = How to Define Terrorism| journal = Philosophy|date = 1989| jstor = 3751606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French historian {{ill|Sophie Wahnich|fr|Sophie Wahnich|vertical-align=sup}} distinguishes between the [[revolutionary terror]] of the French Revolution and the terrorists of the September 11 attacks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense . . . The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wahnich |first=Sophie |date=2016 |title=In Defence of the Terror: Liberty or Death in the French Revolution |page=108 |publisher=Verso |edition=Reprint |isbn=978-1-78478-202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scurr |first=Ruth |date=17 August 2012 |title=In Defence of the Terror: Liberty or Death in the French Revolution by Sophie Wahnich â review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/17/defence-terror-french-wahnich-review |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experts disagree about "whether terrorism is wrong by definition or just wrong as a matter of fact; they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims, or its methods, or both, or neither; they disagree about whether or not states can perpetrate terrorism; they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of ''terror'' for a definition of ''terrorism''."&lt;ref name=teichman /&gt;

===State terrorism===
Alternatively, responding to developments in modern warfare, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Jonathan Friedman]] distinguish between state terrorism against [[non-combatant]]s and state terrorism against [[combatant]]s, including '[[Shock and Awe]]' tactics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shock and Awe" as a subcategory of "rapid dominance" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2006 |last1=James |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |last2=Friedman |first2=Jonathan |title=Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention |url=https://www.academia.edu/3587732 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London |page=xxx}}; and {{Cite book |last1=Nairn |first1=Tom |last2=James |first2=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |title=Global Matrix: Nationalism, Globalism and State-Terrorism |url=https://www.academia.edu/1642325 |year=2005 |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Nations===
In November 2004, a [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] report described terrorism as any act "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act".&lt;!-- ''(Note that this report does not constitute [[international law]])'' --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Reform |publisher=United Nations |date=21 March 2005 |url=https://www.un.org/unifeed/script.asp?scriptId=73 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427012107/http://www.un.org/unifeed/script.asp?scriptId=73 |archivedate=27 April 2007 |access-date=2008-07-11 |quote=The second part of the report, entitled "Freedom from Fear backs the definition of terrorismâan issue so divisive agreement on it has long eluded the world communityâas any action "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[international community]] has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term "terrorism" is politically and emotionally charged.&lt;ref name="Hoffman-1998-p32"&gt;Hoffman (1998), p. 32, See review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html Inside Terrorism].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ |title=Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism â The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination.&lt;ref name=Martyn&gt;Angus Martyn, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm The Right of Self-Defence under International Law-the Response to the Terrorist Attacks of 11 September], Australian Law and Bills Digest Group, Parliament of Australia Web Site, 12 February 2002. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216134913/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm |date=16 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a [[Definition of terrorism#Proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism|Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]] that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Paniagua (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4 ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997â2005''], p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The international community has adopted a series of [[Definition of terrorism#The sectoral approach|sectoral conventions]] that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities.

Since 1994, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.&lt;ref&gt;1994 United Nations Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annex to UN General Assembly resolution 49/60, "Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism", of December 9, 1994, [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r060.htm UN Doc. A/Res/60/49].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===U.S. law===
Various legal systems and government agencies use different [[Anti-terrorism legislation|definitions of terrorism in their national legislation]].

U.S. Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f(d) defines terrorism as:
"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2656f |title=22 U.S. Code Â§&amp;nbsp;2656f â Annual country reports on terrorism |website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

18 U.S.C. Â§&amp;nbsp;2331 defines "international terrorism" and "domestic terrorism" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled "Terrorism":

"International terrorism" means activities with the following three characteristics:

Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.

===Media spectacle===
A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:

{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.&lt;ref name=Bockstette2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bockstette, Carsten |year=2008 |title=Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques |issue=20 |url=http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-01 |journal=George C. Marshall Center Occasional Paper Series |issn=1863-6039 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Terrorists also attack national symbols, which may negatively affect a government, while increasing the prestige of the given [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] or its ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Juergensmeyer |first=Mark |title=Terror in the Mind of God |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2000 |pages=125â35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political violence===
Terrorist acts frequently have a political purpose.&lt;ref name=tws11janwq32&gt;{{cite news |title=Number of Terrorist Attacks, Fatalities |quote=The nation's deadliest terrorist acts&amp;nbsp;â attacks designed to achieve a political goal |publisher=The Washington Post |date=12 June 2009 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2009/06/12/GR2009061200051.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some official, governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Terrorism in the United States 1999 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url=https://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror99.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2008-07-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709091840/http://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror99.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2010}} to distinguish between actions authorized by a government (and thus "lawful") and those of other actors, including individuals and small groups. For example, carrying out a [[strategic bombing]] on an enemy city, which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause, would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government. This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted,{{Attribution needed|date=March 2010}} because: it denies the existence of [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref name=tws11jan6yu&gt;{{cite news |title=/Iraq accuses US of state terrorism |quote=Iraq has accused the United States of state terrorism amid signs that the war of words between the two countries is heating up. |publisher=BBC News |date=20 February 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1830640.stm|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An associated term is [[violent non-state actor]].&lt;ref name=tws11jan4eer&gt;{{cite news |author=Barak Mendelsohn |title=Sovereignty under attack: the international society meets the Al Qaeda network (abstract) |quote=This article examines the complex relations between a violent non-state actor, the Al Qaeda network, and order in the international system.

According to Ali Khan, the distinction lies ultimately in a political judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Ali|date=8 October 2006|title=A Theory of International Terrorism|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=935347|journal=Connecticut Law Review|volume=19|page=945|url-access=|via=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pejorative use ===
{{See also|Controversies about labeling terrorism}}
Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state-groups.&lt;ref name=Sinclair /&gt;&lt;ref name=JR.White /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heryant /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruthven /&gt;&lt;ref name=Walzer /&gt;

Those labeled "terrorists" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as [[separatist]], [[freedom fighter]], liberator, [[revolutionary]], [[vigilante]], [[Insurgent|militant]], paramilitary, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]], [[rebellion|rebel]], patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures. [[Jihad]]i, [[mujaheddin]], and [[fedayeen]] are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon. It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists.&lt;ref name=tws11janbcvc&gt;{{cite news |author1=Paul Reynolds |author2=quoting David Hannay |author3=Former UK ambassador |title=UN staggers on road to reform |quote=This would end the argument that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=BBC News |date=14 September 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4244842.stm|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, [[utilitarian]] philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the "harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism".&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;Rodin, David (2006). "Terrorism". In E. Craig (Ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, [[Michael Walzer]] argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when "a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so".&lt;ref name="Robin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jannmllk&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Steinfels |title=Beliefs; The just-war tradition, its last-resort criterion and the debate on an invasion of Iraq |quote=For those like Professor Walzer who value the just-war tradition as a disciplined way to think about the morality of war&amp;nbsp;... |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 March 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/us/beliefs-just-war-tradition-its-last-resort-criterion-debate-invasion-iraq.html?pagewanted=1|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Inside Terrorism'' [[Bruce Hoffman]] offered an explanation of why the term ''terrorism'' becomes distorted:
{{quote|On one point, at least, everyone agrees: ''terrorism'' is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view. Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label ''terrorist'' to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint.' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization ''terrorist'' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism.&lt;ref name=tws11jant5r4&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Hoffman |authorlink=Bruce Hoffman |title=Inside Terrorism |quote=Google cached copy |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-11468-0 |page=32 |year=1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html |access-date=2010-01-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416230530/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html |archivedate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jant5r555&gt;{{cite news |author=Bruce Hoffman |authorlink=Bruce Hoffman |title=Inside Terrorism |newspaper=The New York Times |year=1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws11jangbbjj&gt;{{cite news |author=Raymond Bonner |title=Getting Attention: A scholar's historical and political survey of terrorism finds that it works |quote=''Inside Terrorism'' falls into the category of 'must read,' at least for anyone who wants to understand how we can respond to international acts of terror. |newspaper=The New York Times: Books |date=1 November 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01bonnert.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists. For instance, for many years, some branches of the United States government refused to label members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States' closest allies (the United Kingdom) that the UK branded as terrorism. This was highlighted by the ''Quinn v. Robinson'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs4/783F2d776.html |title=Quinn v.

Media outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of "terrorist" and "terrorism" because they are loosely defined, potentially controversial in nature, and subjective terms.&lt;ref name="GUSG"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-t |title=Guardian and Observer style guide: T |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=19 December 2008 |access-date=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/page/guidance-reporting-terrorism-summary |title=BBC Editorial Guidelines on Language when Reporting Terrorism |publisher=BBC |access-date=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230022314/http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/page/guidance-reporting-terrorism-summary |archivedate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of terrorism}}
[[File:Fenian guy fawkesr1867reduced.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] was one of the earliest organizations to use modern [[terrorist tactics]]. Pictured, "The Fenian [[Guy Fawkes]]" by [[John Tenniel]] (1867).]]
Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/PM-Modis-vow-to-avenge-Uri-wont-remain-just-words-Manohar-Parrikar/articleshow/54456254.cms |title=PM Modi's vow to avenge Uri won't remain just words: Manohar Parrikar â Times of India |website=indiatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sicarii Zealots]], though some dispute whether the group, a radical offshoot of the [[Zealots]] which was active in [[Judaea Province]] at the beginning of the 1st century AD, was in fact terrorist. According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian [[Josephus]], after the [[Zealotry]] rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judas of Galilee]] formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the [[Sicarii]], in 6 AD.&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Their terror was also directed against Jewish "collaborators", including temple priests, [[Sadducees]], [[Herodian dynasty|Herodians]], and other wealthy elites.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "terrorism" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the [[Jacobin Club]] during the "[[Reign of Terror]]" in the [[French Revolution]]. "Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible", said Jacobin leader [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. In 1795, [[Edmund Burke]] denounced the Jacobins for letting "thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists&amp;nbsp;... loose on the people" of France.

In January 1858, Italian patriot [[Felice Orsini]] threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38"&gt;Crenshaw, Martha, ''Terrorism in Context'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight bystanders were killed and 142 injured.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38" /&gt; The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw38" /&gt;

Arguably the first organization to utilize modern terrorist techniques was the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucd.ie/adulted/coursesbycode/hn258/ |title=Terrorism: From the Fenians to Al Qaeda |access-date=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203100430/http://www.ucd.ie/adulted/coursesbycode/hn258/ |archivedate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1858 as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p179&lt;/ref&gt; that carried out attacks in England.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; The group initiated the [[Fenian dynamite campaign]] in 1881, one of the first modern terror campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelehan |first=Niall |title=The Dynamiters: Irish Nationalism and Political Violence in the Wider World 1867â1900 |year=2012 |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used modern, timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/02/13/one-skilled-scientist-is-worth-an-army-the-fenian-dynamite-campaign-1881-85/#.UkniH3-tbXQ |title=The Fenian Dynamite campaign 1881â85|access-date=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early terrorist group was [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]], founded in Russia in 1878 as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by [[Sergei Nechayev]] and "[[propaganda by the deed]]" theorist [[Carlo Pisacane]].&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cdi.org"&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502 History of Terrorism article by Mark Burgess] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511140810/http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502 |date=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 5"&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The group developed ideasâsuch as [[targeted killing]] of the 'leaders of oppression'âthat were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the ageâsuch as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Terrorism'', by Walter Laqueur, Transaction Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7658-0799-8}}, p. 92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RlqQHKpLfL8C]&lt;/ref&gt;âenabled them to strike directly and with discrimination.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/sept_11/changing_faces_02.shtml |title=BBC â History â The Changing Faces of Terrorism |website=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of terrorism refer to four major waves of global terrorism: "the Anarchist, the Anti-Colonial, the New Left, and the Religious. The first three have been completed and lasted around 40 years; the fourth is now in its third decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://politics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-299 |title=Terrorism as a Global Wave Phenomenon: Overview |website=Politics.oxfordre.com |accessdate=1 December 2017|doi-broken-date=2018-09-08 |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1975, the [[National Institute of Justice|Law Enforcement Assistant Administration]] in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled ''Disorders and Terrorism'', produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H. H. A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff.

The Task Force defines terrorism as "a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes".  It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/39469NCJRS.pdf |title=Disorders and Terrorism |website=National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals |date=1976 |pages=3â6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[File:US Army Humvee attacked.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army Humvee destroyed by a [[car bomb]], Baghdad, [[Iraq]] in 2006.]]--&gt;
* '''Civil disorder''' â A form of collective violence interfering with the [[peace]], security, and normal functioning of the community.
* '''Political terrorism''' â [[Violence|Violent]] criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate [[fear]] in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes.
* '''Non-Political terrorism''' â Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits "conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for [[coercion|coercive]] purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective".
* '''Quasi-terrorism''' â The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient. It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quasi-terrorism |url=https://mukkulreddy.wordpress.com/types-of-terrorism/quasi-terrorism/ |website=Mukkulreddy.wordpress.com|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Terrorism |url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/types-of-terrorism/ |publisher=Crime Museum|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TERRORISM |url=http://www.earthdash.org/more_info/terrorism.html |publisher=Earth Dashboard|access-date= 2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fleeing [[felony|felon]] who takes [[hostage]]s is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different.
* '''Limited political terrorism''' â Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a [[revolutionary]] approach; limited political terrorism refers to "acts of terrorism which are committed for [[ideology|ideological]] or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the [[Sovereign state|state]]".
* '''Official or state terrorism''' â "referring to nations whose rule is based upon [[fear]] and [[oppression]] that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions". It may also be referred to as '''Structural Terrorism''' defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy.

Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into '''domestic terrorism''' and '''international terrorism''', or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terrorism and homeland security: an introduction with applications |author=Philip P. Purpura |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-7506-7843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ItzwLVo8DwC&amp;pg=PA17 |pages=16â19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way the typology of terrorism may be defined:&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Rex A. ''Who Becomes a Terrorist and Why: The 1999 Government Report on Profiling Terrorists'', Federal Research Division, The Lyons Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Scheider, Jim Davis, ''Avoiding the abyss: progress, shortfalls and the way ahead in combatting the WMD threat'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009 p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations of terrorists ==
As well as there being no one agreed definition of terrorism, there is a similar lack of consensus regarding the causes - or motivations behind - terrorism. Numerous studies have identified certain behavioural and situational characteristics that are common, and perhaps causal, to the consequence of terrorism, specific analysis of case studies have lead to suggested motivations to individual historical acts.

A report conducted by Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK highlights the vast discrepencies between individual cases of terrorism recorded. To begin with, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many more are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault. 
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bombing Alone: Tracing the Motivations and Antecedent Behaviors of Lone-Actor Terrorists, |first1=Paul |last1=Gill |first2=John |last2=Horgan |first3=Paige |last3=Deckert |date=March 1, 2014 |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=425â435 |doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12312|pmid = 24313297|pmc=4217375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intimidation ====
Attacks on 'collaborators' are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control. This strategy was used in Ireland, in [[Kenya]], in [[Algeria]] and in [[Cyprus]] during their independence struggles. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==== International Attention ====
This strategy was used by [[Al-Qaeda]] in [[September 11 attacks|its attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973â2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]] in the United States on September 11, 2001. These attacks are also used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported, such as the [[Dawson's Field hijackings|Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970]] and the [[1975 Dutch train hostage crisis]].

==== Local/internal social standing ====
Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Abrahm"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abrahms |first=Max |title=What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy |journal=[[International Security]] |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=86â89 |date=March 2008 |url=http://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/publications/what_terrorists_really_want_terrorist_motives_and_counterterrorism_strategy |format=PDF 1933 [[Kilobyte|KB]] |issn=0162-2889 |accessdate=2008-11-04 |doi=10.1162/isec.2008.32.4.78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined.&lt;ref name="Abrahm" /&gt;

==== Cultural tolerance of violence ====
Additionally, Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mousseau |first1=Michael |title=Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror |journal=International Security |date=2002 |volume=27 |issue=3 |doi=10.1162/01622880260553615 |pages=5â29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/06/many-terrorists-first-victims-are-their-wives-were-not-allowed-talk-about Many terrorists' first victims are their wives â but we're not allowed to talk about that] ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Perceived illegitimacy of the State ====
Some terrorists like [[Timothy McVeigh]] were motivated by revenge against a state for its actions against its citizens.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==== Religious beliefs/zealotry ====
According to Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that Just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. Many were chronically unemployed and consistently struggled to hold any form of employment for a significant amount of time. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault. 
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Mental Health ====
Ariel Merari, a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since 1983 through media reports that contained biographical details, interviews with the suicidesâ families, and interviews with jailed would-be suicide attackers, concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Merari |first1=Ariel |title="Psychological Aspects of Suicide Terrorism," in Bruce Bongar et al., Psychology of Terrorism. |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour, Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes - such as fatherless, friendless, jobless situations - or suicidal symptoms. By which he means, they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of 'having nothing to lose'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atran |first1=Scott |title=Mishandling Suicide Terrorism |journal=The Washington Quarterly |date=2004 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=67â90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nationalism ====
Although a common factor in terrorism is a strong religious belief there are other factors such as cultural, social and 
political that wholly preclude religion. For example, the drive behind these Chechen terrorists are quite distinct and unique from others. Many of the Chechens considered themselves secular freedom fighters, nationalist insurgents seeking to establish an independent secular state of Chechnya. Although a distinction should be made between national Chechen terrorists and non-Chechen fighters who have adopted the idea from abroad. Few Chechen fighters fought for the jihads whereas most of the non-Chechen fighters did (Janeczko, 2014)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janeczko |first1=Matthew |title='Faced with death, even a mouse bites': Social and religious motivations behind terrorism in Chechnya |date=19 Jun 2014 |pages=428â456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Financial support for family ====
Another factor are perceived assurances of financial stability for the actor's families, that they are given when they join a terrorist organization or complete an attempt of terror. An extra grant is provided for the families of suicide bombers.&lt;ref name="Arie W 2006 pp. 45-48"/&gt;

While a democratic nation espousing [[civil liberties]] may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties.&lt;ref name=tws11janetrr&gt;{{cite news |author=Rick Young |title=PBS Frontline: 'Spying on the Home Front' |quote=...&amp;nbsp;we and Frontline felt that it was important to look more comprehensively at the post-9/11 shift to prevention and the dilemma we all now face in balancing security and privacy. |publisher=''PBS: Frontline'' |date=16 May 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/05/03/DI2007050301142.html|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, [[homegrown terrorism]] has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden.&lt;ref name="Hayden"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordy |last=Yager |title=Former intel chief: Homegrown terrorism is a devil of a problem |publisher=thehill.com |date=25 July 2010 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/110759-former-intel-chief-homegrown-terrorism-is-a-devil-of-a-problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist(s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system.&lt;ref&gt;shabad, goldie and francisco jose llera ramo.

According to the [[Global Terrorism Index]] by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[religious extremism]] has overtaken [[Separatism|national separatism]] and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world. Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks. The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda. Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks. The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown. The prevalence of Islamist groups in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Syria]] is the main driver behind these trends.&lt;ref name=arnett&gt;{{cite news |author=George Arnett |title=Religious extremism main cause of terrorism, according to report |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 November 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/nov/18/religious-extremism-main-cause-of-terrorism-according-to-report|access-date= 22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are [[Boko Haram]], [[Al Qaeda]], the [[Taliban]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. These groups have been most active in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. 80% of all deaths from terrorism occurred in one of these five countries.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt;

[[Terrorism in Pakistan]] has become a great problem.

[[Israel]] has also had problems with [[Jewish religious terrorism]]. [[Yigal Amir]] assassinated Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in 1995. For Amir, killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians. {{sfn|Spaaij|2012|page=68}}

== Perpetrators ==
The [[perpetrator]]s of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states. According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may also carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war. However, the most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive [[Covert cell|cells]], highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London underground bombing]], [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] and the [[2002 Bali bombing]] were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks. These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient [[telecommunications]] to succeed where others had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sageman |first=Mark |title=Understanding Terror Networks |publisher=U. of Pennsylvania Press |year=2004 |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=166â67 |isbn=978-0-8122-3808-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/personal-characteristics-of-lone-actor-terrorists/ |title=Personal Characteristics of Lone-Actor Terrorists |date=29 February 2016 |author1=Prof. Dr. Edwin Bakker |author2=Jeanine de Roy van Zuijdewijn |access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as ''violent non-state actors''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A 2007 study by economist [[Alan B. Krueger]] found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28% vs. 33%) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47% vs. 38%). Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families, vs. 30% of male Palestinians, and over 60% had gone beyond high school, vs. 15% of the populace.A study into the poverty-stricken conditions and whether or not,terrorists are more likely to come from here,show that people who grew up in these situations tend to show aggression and frustration towards others.

State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of [[Political Science]] Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German [[The Blitz|bombing of London]], the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], the British and American [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], and the U.S. [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]]. He argues that "the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents." He also cites the [[first strike]] option as an example of the "terror of coercive diplomacy" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using [[nuclear weapon]]s in "crisis management" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of [[foreign policy]] was shaped by the presence and use of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state .&lt;ref name="tws11jangbhh"&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Stohl |title=The Superpowers and International Terror |publisher=International Studies Association, Atlanta |date=1 April 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Stohl |title=Terrible beyond Endurance?

== Connection with tourism ==
The connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the [[Luxor massacre]] in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=SÃ¶nmez |first1=S.

== Funding ==
{{Main|Terrorist financing}}
[[State-sponsored terrorism|State sponsors]] have constituted a major form of funding; for example, [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations, were funded by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="ncua" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tws11jan4r67"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jeremy Lott |title=Tripped Up |quote=and before the Soviet Union fell, terrorist organizations were funding themselves through subsidies from Communist governments |publisher=Reason Magazine |date=6 October 2004 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2004/10/06/tripped-up|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Gang]] received funding from [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] officers in Beirut to undermine the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Aims and activities of the Stern Group in Palestine |journal=Research and Analysis Branch |volume=2717 |issue=R &amp; N |date=1 December 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]] has created and nurtured terrorist groups as policy for achieving tactical objectives against its neighbours, especially [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/5779916/Pakistani-president-Asif-Zardari-admits-creating-terrorist-groups.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |title=Pakistani president Asif Zardari admits creating terrorist groups | access-date= |first=Dean |last=Nelson |date=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Revolutionary tax]]" is another major form of funding, and essentially a euphemism for "[[protection money]]".&lt;ref name=ncua&gt;[http://www.ncua.gov/letters/2002/02-CU-14.pdf Detection of Terrorist Financing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814082429/http://ncua.gov/letters/2002/02-CU-14.pdf |date=August 14, 2009 }}, U.S. National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary taxes "play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population".&lt;ref name=ncua /&gt;

Other major sources of funding include [[kidnapping]] for ransoms, [[smuggling]] (including [[wildlife smuggling]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://site.d66.nl/gerbrandy/document/eu_action_plan_against_wildlife/f=/vj7iilz6wlmw.pdf Gerben Jan Gerbrandy claiming that terrorist networks hunt wildlife for funding themselves]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222022640/http://site.d66.nl/gerbrandy/document/eu_action_plan_against_wildlife/f%3D/vj7iilz6wlmw.pdf |date=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fraud, and robbery.&lt;ref name=ncua /&gt; The [[Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant]] has reportedly received funding "via private donations from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.france24.com/static/infographies/2013/syrie-groupes-terroristes-carte/en/index.html Syria's top Islamist and jihadist groups]". [[France 24]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Financial Action Task Force]] is an inter-governmental body whose mandate, since October 2001, has included combating [[terrorist financing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/0,3417,en_32250379_32236947_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Terrorist Financing |publisher=The Financial Action Task Force |access-date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactics ==
{{Main|Tactics of terrorism}}
[[File:WallStexplosion1920.jpg|thumb|The [[Wall Street bombing]] at noon on September 16, 1920 killed thirty-eight people and injured several hundred. The perpetrators were never caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gage |first=Beverly |title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-975928-6 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cvK3VNcp28C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity, usually using [[explosives]] or [[poison]].&lt;ref&gt;Suicide bombings are the most effective terrorist act in this regard. See the following works:
* {{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Hoffman |title=The Logic of Suicide Terrorism |work=[[Atlantic Monthly]] |volume=291 |issue=5 |pages=40â47 |date=June 2003 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/the-logic-of-suicide-terrorism/302739/}}

Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through [[organized crime]]. Communications occur through modern [[telecommunications]], or through old-fashioned methods such as [[courier]]s. There is also concern about terrorist attacks employing [[weapons of mass destruction]].

Terrorism is a form of [[asymmetric warfare]], and is more common when direct [[conventional warfare]] will not be effective because forces vary greatly in power.&lt;ref name=tws11jan1q21q&gt;{{cite news |title=Hackers warn high street chains |quote=That's the beauty of asymmetric warfare. You don't need a lot of money, or an army of people. |publisher=BBC News |date=25 April 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7366995.stm|access-date= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political conflict. The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include:
* [[Secession]] of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state
* Dominance of territory or resources by various [[ethnic groups]]
* Imposition of a particular form of government
* Economic deprivation of a population
* Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army
* Religious fanaticism

== Responses ==
[[File:1080 Poisoning Scare At New World in Wellington.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism]]
Responses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the [[political spectrum]] and reassessments of [[value system|fundamental values]].

Specific types of responses include:
* [[Anti-terrorism legislation|Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers]]
* [[Target hardening]], such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers
* Preemptive or reactive military action
* Increased intelligence and surveillance activities
* Preemptive humanitarian activities
* More permissive interrogation and detention policies

The term "[[counter-terrorism]]" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors.

According to a report by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin in [[The Washington Post]], "Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/ |title=A hidden world, growing beyond control |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=19 July 2010 |first1=Dana |last1=Priest |first2=William |last2=Arkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

America's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought. Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home.&lt;ref name=ankony1&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "A New Strategy for America's War on Terrorism", ''Patrolling'' magazine, 75th Ranger Regiment Association, Winter 2011, 56â57.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction of the ''U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Sarah Sewall states the need for "U.S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravityâthe deciding factor in the struggle.... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemiesânew insurgent recruits or informantsââand erode support of the host nation." Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: "Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted.... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction."&lt;ref&gt;Sewall, Sarah, introduction to ''The U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy, often termed "courageous restraint", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield, yet it fails to address the central truth: the terrorists we face are mostly homegrown.&lt;ref name=ankony1 /&gt;

=== Terrorism research ===
Terrorism research, also called terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British [[Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence]], the [[Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies]], and the [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism]] (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tinnes |first1=J |year=2013 |title=100 Core and Periphery Journals for Terrorism Research |url=http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/258 |journal=Perspectives on Terrorism |volume=7 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International agreements ===
One of the agreements that promote the international legal anti-terror framework is the Code of Conduct Towards Achieving a World Free of Terrorism that was adopted at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2018. The Code of Conduct was initiated by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Its main goal is to implement a wide range of international commitments to counter terrorism and establish a broad global coalition towards achieving a world free of terrorism by 2045. The Code was signed by more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=70 countries sign Counter-Terrorism Code initiated by Kazakhstan |url=https://www.inform.kz/en/70-countries-sign-counter-terrorism-code-initiated-by-kazakhstan-says-president_a3450890 |website=inform.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass media ==

[[File:Plakat La Terroriste.jpg|thumb|''La Terroriste'', a 1910 poster depicting a female member of the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]] throwing a bomb at a Russian official's car.|left]]
Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media. Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media.&lt;ref&gt;The Media and Terrorism: A Reassessment [[Paul Wilkinson (professor)|Paul Wilkinson]]. ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Summer 1997), pp. 51â64 Published by Frank Cass, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/responding-to-cyber-jihad-towards-an-effective-counter-narrative/ |title=Responding to Cyber Jihad: Towards an Effective Counter Narrative |date=31 March 2015 |author=Dr. Bibi van Ginkel |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism â The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |access-date=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism. However, this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely [[James F. Pastor]] explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terrorism &amp; Public Safety Policing: Implications of the Obama Presidency |author=Pastor, James F. |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4398-1580-9 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcome of terrorist groups ==

[[File:RANDterroristGpsEnd2006.svg|thumb|upright=2|How terrorist groups end (n = 268): The most common ending for a terrorist group is to convert to nonviolence via negotiations (43 percent), with most of the rest terminated by routine policing (40 percent).  Groups that were ended by military force constituted only 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;The researchers found 648 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006.  Of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006 (Jones and Libicki, 2008, p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Jones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006.  They found 648.  of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ones that ended, 43 percent converted to nonviolent political actions, like the [[Good Friday Agreement|Irish Republican Army]] in Northern Ireland.  Law enforcement took out 40 percent.  Ten percent won.  Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were taken out by military force.

Forty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006.  Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors.  Only 5 percent were taken out by law enforcement.   26 percent won.  21 percent succumbed to military force.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 101, Table 5.4)&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists.  To avoid that, the [[rules of engagement]] must be conscious of [[collateral damage]] and work to minimize it.

Another researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cronin |first1=Audrey Kurth |title=How Terrorism Ends: Understanding the Decline and Demise of Terrorist Campaigns |date=2009 |publisher=Princeton U. Pr |isbn=978-0-691-13948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Capture or killing of a group's leader. (Decapitation).
# Entry of the group into a legitimate political process. (Negotiation).
# Achievement of group aims. (Success).
# Group implosion or loss of public support. (Failure).
# Defeat and elimination through brute force. (Repression).
# Transition from terrorism into other forms of violence. (Reorientation).

The following terrorism databases are or were made publicly available for research purposes, and track specific acts of terrorism:
* [[Global Terrorism Database]], an open-source database by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2015 with more than 150,000 cases.
* [[MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]]
* [[Worldwide Incidents Tracking System]]
* [[Tocsearch]] (dynamic database)
The following public report and index provides a summary of key global trends and patterns in terrorism around the world
* [[Global Terrorism Index]], produced annually by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]]

Jones and Libicki (2008) includes a table of 268 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006 with their status as of 2006:  still active, splintered, converted to nonviolence, removed by law enforcement or military, or won.  (These data are not in a convenient machine-readable format but are available.)

The case examines how the rescued survivors, who kill and eat one person in order to survive, should be treated by the law.]]

"'''The Case of the Speluncean Explorers'''" is an article by legal philosopher [[Lon L. Fuller]] first published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1949. Largely taking the form of a fictional judgment, it presents a [[jurisprudence|legal philosophy]] puzzle to the reader and five possible solutions in the form of [[judicial opinion]]s that are attributed to judges sitting on the fictional "Supreme Court of Newgarth" in the year 4300.{{efn|Fuller addressed his decision to date his scenario in the [[fifth millennium]] in the article's postscript, writing that "the reader puzzled by the choice of date may wish to be reminded that the centuries which separate us from the year 4300 are roughly equal to those that have passed since the [[Fifth-century Athens|Age of Pericles]] [i.e. the fifth century]".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=645}} }}

The case involves five explorers who are caved in following a landslide. They learn via intermittent radio contact that, without food, they are likely to starve to death before they can be rescued. They decide to engage in [[cannibalism]], and select one of their number to be killed and eaten so that the others may survive. They decide who should be killed by throwing a pair of dice.  After the four survivors are rescued, they are charged and found guilty of the [[murder]] of the fifth explorer. If their appeal to the Supreme Court of Newgarth fails, they face a mandatory [[capital punishment|death sentence]]. Although the wording of the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is intense public pressure for the men to avoid facing the death penalty.

The article offers five possible judicial responses. Each differs in its reasoning and on whether the survivors should be found guilty of breaching the law.  Two judges affirm the convictions, emphasising the importance of the [[separation of powers]] and [[Plain meaning rule|literal approach]] to [[statutory interpretation]]. Two other judges overturn the convictions; one focuses on "common sense" and the popular will while the other uses arguments drawn from the [[natural law]] tradition, emphasizing the [[purposive approach]]. A fifth judge, who is unable to reach a conclusion, recuses himself.  As the Court's decision is a tie, the original convictions are upheld and the men are sentenced to death.

Fuller's account has been described as "a classic in [[jurisprudence]]"{{sfn|D'Amato|1980|p=467}} and "a microcosm of [the 20th] century's debates" in legal philosophy.{{sfn|Eskridge Jr.|1993|p=467}}  It allows for contrasts to be drawn between different legal philosophies, with the main two being [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]].  In the 50 years following the article's publication, a further 25 hypothetical judgments were written by various authors whose perspectives include [[natural law]] theory, [[consequentialism]], plain meaning [[positivism]] or [[textualism]], purposivism, historical contextualism, realism, pragmatism, [[critical legal studies]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], [[process theory]] and minimalism.{{sfn|Roederer|2003|p=388}}

==Synopsis==
===Facts===
The facts of the case are recounted in the first judicial opinion, which is given by Chief Justice Truepenny.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1851}}

Five cave explorers became trapped inside a cave following a landslide.  They have limited food supplies and no sources of nutrition inside the cave. Above ground, substantial resources are spent to rescue them, with 10 workmen killed in subsequent landslides near the blocked entrance. Radio contact is eventually established with the cavers on the 20th day of the cave-in, and the cavers learn that another 10 days would be required in order to free them. They then consult with medical experts, who inform them that they are unlikely to survive to the rescue given the likelihood of starvation.

[[File:Two red dice 01.svg|thumb|180px|left|In "the Case of the Speluncean Explorers", the person to be eaten was chosen by throwing a pair of dice. This method had also been suggested for choosing the victim in the similar real-life case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''.]]

One of the cavers, Roger Whetmore, then asks on the cavers' behalf if the cavers could survive 10 days longer "if they consumed the flesh of one of their number". The medical experts reluctantly confirm this to be the case. Whetmore then asks if they should [[sortition|draw lots]] to select a person to be killed and eaten. No one outside the cave is willing to answer this question. Radio contact is subsequently lost.

Once the cave-in is cleared, it is discovered that only four cavers have survived; Roger Whetmore had been killed and eaten by the others. The survivors state that Whetmore had originally come up with the ideas of cannibalism and choosing the victim through random chance, offering a pair of [[dice]] in his possession.

Before the dice are cast, Whetmore allegedly expresses a wish to withdraw from the arrangement, preferring to wait another week "before embracing an expedient so frightful and odious". The others refuse to accept his change of mind, and cast the dice on his behalf. The survivors claim that Whetmore conceded that the dice were thrown fairly. He is subsequently killed and eaten.

Following their rescue and recovery, the survivors are charged with the murder of Whetmore. The relevant statute provides that "Whoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be punished by death", offering no exceptions which would be relevant to the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1853}} The jury seek a [[special verdict]], so that they can make limited findings of fact without having to return a verdict on whether it constitutes murder. The cavers are ultimately convicted of murder.

The [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentence]] for murder in Newgarth is [[death by hanging]]. Both the trial judge and members of the jury petition the Chief Executive to [[Commutation of sentence|commute the sentence]] of the surviving spelunkers from the death penalty to six months' imprisonment. The Chief Executive refuses to act while the Supreme Court of Newgarth considers the appeal.

===Opinion of Chief Justice Truepenny===
The first opinion is largely [[Exposition (narrative)|expository]]; it is used to recount the facts of the case.  The Chief Justice states that the statute is unambiguous, with no applicable legal defences, so it must be applied by the court.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=619}}  He adds that granting mercy is a decision for the executive branch of government to make, rather than the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} However, the Chief Justice suggests that the judges of the court should add their names to the petition of the trial judge and jury requesting the Chief Executive to show mercy to the defendants. This would allow justice to be achieved "without impairing either the letter or spirit of our statutes and without offering any encouragement for the disregard of law".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}

===Opinion of Justice Foster===
{{Quote|text=I believe something more is on trial in this case than the fate of these unfortunate explorers; that is the law of our Commonwealth. If this Court declares that under our law these men have committed a crime, then our law is itself convicted in the tribunal of common sense, no matter what happens to the individuals involved in this petition of error. For us to assert that the law we uphold and expound compels us to a conclusion we are ashamed of, and from which we can only escape by appealing to a dispensation resting within the personal whim of the Executive, seems to me to amount to an admission that the law of this Commonwealth no longer pretends to incorporate justice.|sign=Justice Foster{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}}}

The second opinion takes a different approach to the Chief Justice's.  In determining that the convictions should be overturned, Justice Foster makes two main points.  Firstly, the defendants were in a "[[state of nature]]" at the time of the killing, so the laws of nature applied to them. The laws of nature allowed to agree to sacrifice one person for the survival of the rest.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} Secondly, assuming the laws of Newgarth did apply, a {{cfy|text=[[functional approach]]|date=March 2016}} should be used in applying the statute.  As its main purpose is deterrence, the judge concluded that, just as with a case of self-defence, the purpose of the statute would not be served by upholding the convictions.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=624}}

The judge counters potential objections of [[judicial activism]] by suggesting that although judges must obey the will of legislators, they must do so intelligently. He draws analogies to servants who need to "read between the lines" of their masters' instructions; strict literal compliance may not always be the actual intention.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=625}}  Thus the "correction of obvious legislative errors or oversights is not to supplant the legislative will, but to make that will effective."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}}

===Opinion of Justice Tatting===
In the third opinion, Justice Tatting is emotionally "torn between sympathy for [the defendants] and a feeling of abhorrence and disgust at the monstrous act they committed".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}} He ultimately finds himself unable to decide the case.

Justice Tatting disagrees strongly with Justice Foster's rationales in overturning the convictions. He criticizes the "state of nature" concept and is not satisfied with Justice Foster's formulation placing the law of contract above the law against murder.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=627â628}} He also notes the difficulty of applying the [[purposive approach]] to the criminal statute which has multiple purposes, including retribution and rehabilitation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=628â629}} He distinguishes the self-defence exception that was created by past judges on the basis that it is not a "willful" killing, so it does not contradict the wording of the statute.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=629}} He finds that the self-defence exception could not be applied to the present case as it would raise "a quagmire of hidden difficulties".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=630}} 

The judge cites the case of  ''Commonwealth v Valjean'',{{efn|This reference invokes [[Jean Valjean]], the protagonist in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel ''[[Les MisÃ©rables]]''. In the novel, Valjean is imprisoned after stealing bread to feed his sister's starving children.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=70â71}} }} in which starvation was held not to justify the theft of a loaf of bread, let alone homicide. These combined objections lead Justice Tatting to reject Justice Foster's reasoning as "intellectually unsound and approaching mere rationalization."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

Despite rejecting Justice Foster's reasoning, Justice Tatting cannot bring himself to reach the alternative view, that the defendants' convictions should be upheld. He states that "almost every consideration that bears on the decision of the case
is counterbalanced by an opposing consideration leading in the opposite direction."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}} Concluding with a criticism of the prosecutor for deciding to bring the prosecution in the first place, the judge makes the "unprecedented" decision of withdrawing from the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

===Opinion of Justice Keen===
The fourth opinion begins by excluding [[executive clemency]] and the morality of the defendants' actions as relevant factors to the court's deliberations.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} Rather, the question before the court is purely one of applying the legislation of Newgarth and determining whether the defendants wilfully took the life of Whetmore. He criticizes the other judges for failing to distinguish the legal from the moral aspects of the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} While he shares their preference that the defendants be spared from death, he respects the obligations of his office to put his "personal predilections" of what constitutes justice out of mind when interpreting and applying the law.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}}

Justice Keen objects vehemently to Justice Foster's purposive approach allowing the plain words of the law to be ignored.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=67}} He emphasizes that laws may have many possible purposes, with difficulties arising in divining the actual "purpose" of a piece of legislation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}}

Justice Keen recalls that earlier instances of judicial activism in Newgarth had ultimately led to [[civil war]], which established the supremacy of the legislature over the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}} He concludes by criticizing the courts' creation of the self-defence excuse, stating that waiting for the legislature to enact such revisions would have led to a stronger legal system.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}

===Opinion of Justice Handy===
In contrast to the other judges, Justice Handy prefers to use a "pragmatic, common-sense approach", rather than abstract legal theories, to resolve the case.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He criticizes his colleagues' "obscuring curtain of legalisms" when the case simply requires the application of "practical wisdom" of "human realities".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}} He emphasizes the need for the courts to maintain public confidence, which requires them to follow the 90% majority in favour of applying a token punishment or releasing the defendants altogether.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He is prepared to use Justice Foster's purposive approach doctrine as the legal rationale.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}}

Justice Handy notes that apart from the ambivalent Justice Tatting, the other judges share the majority public opinion.  The judges voting to uphold the convictions simply differ from Justices Foster and Handy on whose role it is to spare the defendants from the death penalty.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=642}}

'''''The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans''''' is a 2010 nonfiction book by U.S. author [[Mark Jacobson]].&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress catalog record http://lccn.loc.gov/2010015455&lt;/ref&gt; It recounts the attempt to ascertain the origin of a [[Lampshades made from human skin|lampshade]] claimed to be made out of human skin.

==Synopsis==
In the aftermath of  [[Hurricane Katrina]], a lampshade, purported to be made from the skin of a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victim, turned up in a sidewalk [[Garage sale|rummage sale]] in [[New Orleans]]. Purchased for $35 by Skip Henderson, the lampshade was sent to his friend Mark Jacobson, a writer living in [[Brooklyn|New York]]. Jacobson embarked on a quest to discover the origin of the lampshade. [[Genetic testing]] initially confirmed it was made from [[human skin]]. However, because of the condition of the tanned skin, there was no way to determine the ethnic origin of the person whose skin was used, or if it was indeed a relic of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;National Public Radio, [https://www.npr.org/2010/12/28/132416206/New-Book-Tells-Story-Of-The-Lampshade New Book Tells Grim Story Of 'The Lampshade'] December 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next few years, Jacobson attempted to track down the origin of and examine the meaning of the lampshade, how it ended up in New Orleans, and to decide what to ultimately do with the gruesome object. Both the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Yad Vashem]] museum in [[Jerusalem]], declined  to take possession of the lampshade,  saying that the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] lampshades made of human skin were probably a "myth".&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Over the course of his investigation, Jacobson examines the history of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], where such objects were reputed to have been made, as well as the racial and post-Katrina history of New Orleans, the world of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], the [[black market]] trafficking in such goods, and the mythology surrounding objects made from human skin.

==Cow skin==
In 2012 the lampshade was subjected to more sophisticated next-generation DNA testing and was found to be most likely cow skin.&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic'' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuqupFyq1o at 38m 30s&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8078">'''Transferred intent''' (or '''transferred malice''' in [[English law]]) is a legal doctrine that holds that, when the [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] to harm one individual inadvertently causes a second person to be hurt instead, the perpetrator is still held responsible. To be held legally responsible under the law, usually the court must demonstrate that the person has criminal intent, that is, that the person knew another would be harmed by his or her actions and wanted this harm to occur. If a murderer intends to kill John, but accidentally kills George instead, the intent is transferred from John to George, and the killer is held to have had criminal intent.

Transferred intent also applies to tort law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/torts/torts01.htm|title=LexisNexisÂ® for Law Schools â Sign In â LexisNexis|website=www.lexisnexis.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tort law]], there are generally five areas in which transferred intent is applicable: [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[assault]], [[false imprisonment]], [[trespass to land]], and [[trespass to chattels]].  Generally, any ''intent'' to cause any one of these five torts which results in the completion of any of the five tortious acts will be considered an intentional act, even if the actual target of the tort is one other than the intended target of the original tort.

See cases of ''Carnes v. Thompson'', (1932) Supreme Court of Missouri. 48 S.W. 2d 903 and ''Bunyan v. Jordan'' (1937), 57 C.L.R. 1, 37 S.R.N.S.W. 119 for examples.

==Discussion==

=== In the United States ===
In US criminal law, transferred intent is sometimes explained by stating that "the intent follows the bullet."  That is, the intent to kill ''person A'' with a bullet will apply even when the bullet kills the unintended victim, ''person B'' (''see [[mens rea]]''). Thus, the ''intent'' is ''transferred'' between victims.  However, intent only transfers between harms of a similar nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Penal Code, 2.03(2)|url=http://www1.law.umkc.edu/suni/CrimLaw/MPC_Provisions/model_penal_code_default_rules.htm|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if the defendant shoots at "Person A" intending to kill "A" but the bullet misses and instead hits a vase, causing it to break, the defendant is not deemed to have intended to break the vase.  This is because destruction of property is a kind of harm different from that contemplated by defendant.  The rationale underlying this distinction is that the defendant has only one intent.  If the law were to deem that the defendant intended to destroy property, it would be placing on him an intent he never hadâhe would now have both the intent to kill and the intent to destroy property.  In contrast, where the defendant intends to kill one person but ends up killing another, there's still only one intentâthe intent to kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regina v. Faulkner Case Brief|url=http://homepage.mac.com/johnpell/LWSO100/regina%20v.%20faulkner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interesting to compare the principle underlying the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]] 2004 in the [[United States]] which applies only to offenses over which the U.S. government has jurisdiction, namely crimes committed on [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] properties, against certain [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] officials and employees, and by members of the military, but treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of all levels of [[assault]] including [[murder]] and [[attempted murder]]:
"Sec. 1841. Protection of unborn children
:(a)(1) Whoever engages in conduct that violates any of the provisions of law listed in subsection (b) and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury (as defined in section 1365) to, a child, who is in utero at the time the conduct takes place, is guilty of a separate offense under this section.
:(2)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the punishment for that separate offense is the same as the punishment provided under Federal law for that conduct had that injury or death occurred to the unborn child's mother.
:2(B) An offense under this section does not require proof thatâ
::(i) the person engaging in the conduct had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or
::(ii) the defendant intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.
:2(C) If the person engaging in the conduct thereby intentionally kills or attempts to kill the unborn child, that person shall instead of being punished under subparagraph (A), be punished as provided under sections 1111, 1112, and 1113 of this title for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being."

=== In the United Kingdom ===
In the UK the transferred malice doctrine is not without controversy. The [[House of Lords]] in ''Attorney General's Reference  No  3  of  1994''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII
 | litigants = Attorney General's Reference No 3 of 1994

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reversed the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] decision (reported at (1996) 2 WLR 412), holding that the doctrine of transferred malice could not apply to convict an accused of [[murder in English law]] when the defendant had stabbed a pregnant woman in the face, back and abdomen. Some days after she was released from hospital in an apparently stable condition, she went into labour and gave birth to a premature child, who died four months later. The child had been wounded in the original attack but the more substantial cause of death was her prematurity. It was argued that the [[fetus]] was part of the mother so that any intention to cause [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH) to the mother was also an intent aimed at the fetus. Lord Mustill criticised the doctrine as having no sound intellectual basis, saying that it was related to the original concept of malice, i.e. that a wrongful act displayed a malevolence which could be attached to any adverse consequence, and this had long been out of date. Nevertheless, it would sometimes provide a justification to convict when that was a common sense outcome and so could sensibly be retained. The present case was not a simple "transfer" from mother to uterine child, but sought to create an intention to cause injury to the child after birth. This would be a double transfer: first from the mother to the fetus, and then from the fetus to the child when it was born. Then one would have to apply the fiction which converts an intention to commit GBH into the ''mens rea'' of murder. That was too much. But the accused could be convicted of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]].

In ''[[R v Gnango]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] controversially held that under the doctrines of joint enterprise and transferred malice D2 is guilty of V's murder if D1 and D2 voluntarily engage in fighting each other, each intending to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the other and each foreseeing that the other has the reciprocal intention, and if D1 mistakenly kills V in the course of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Regina v Armel Gnango|link=R v Gnango|court=UKSC|reporter=|scotcase=|year=2011|volume=|firstpage=|num=59|format=|parallelcite=|date=14 December 2011|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{essay|date=November 2010}}

A '''truth-bearer''' is an [[entity]] that is said to be either true or false and nothing else. The thesis that some things are true while others are false has led to different theories about the nature of these entities.  Since there is divergence of opinion on the matter, the term ''truth-bearer'' is used to be neutral among the various [[philosophical theory|theories]].  Truth-bearer candidates include [[proposition]]s, [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, [[Typeâtoken distinction|sentence-tokens]], [[statement (logic)|statements]], [[concept]]s, [[belief]]s, [[thought]]s, [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]]s, [[utterance]]s, and [[judgement]]s but different authors exclude one or more of these, deny their existence, argue that they are true only in a derivative sense, assert or assume that the terms are synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. 
* "In [[mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], a statement (also called a proposition) is a complete declarative sentence, which is either true or false." [http://www.jcu.edu/math/Vignettes/logic.htm Vignette 17 Logic, Truth and Language]
* "A statement is just that; it is a declaration about somethingâanythingâa declaration which can be evaluated as either true or false.  "I am reading this sentence" is a statement, and if indeed you have looked at it and comprehended its meaning, then it is safe to say that that statement can be evaluated as true."[http://home.att.net/~tangents/issue/think/concepts.htm Fundamental Logic Concepts: Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522140629/http://home.att.net/~tangents/issue/think/concepts.htm |date=2008-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or seek to avoid addressing their distinction or do not clarify it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. * "Some philosophers claim that declarative sentences of natural language have underlying [[logical form]]s and that these forms are displayed by [[well-formed formula|formulas]] of a [[formal language]]. Other writers hold that (successful) declarative sentences express propositions; and formulas of formal languages somehow display the forms of these propositions." {{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Stewart|title="Classical Logic" in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |editor=Edward N. Zalta|year=2008|edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/#1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Some distinctions and terminology as used in this article, based on Wolfram 1989&lt;ref name="Wolfram 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram |first=Sybil|publisher=Routledge, London and New York|title=Philosophical Logic|year=1989|isbn=0-415-02317-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Chapter 2 Section1) follow. 
''It should be understood that the terminology described is not always used in the ways set out, and it is introduced solely for the purposes of discussion in this article.''    Use is made of the [[typeâtoken distinction|typeâtoken]] and [[Useâmention distinction|useâmention]] distinctions. Reflection on [[occurrences of numerals]] might be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Occurrences of numerals]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In grammar a sentence can be a declaration, an [[explanation]], a question, a command. In logic a declarative sentence is considered to be a sentence that can be used to communicate truth. Some sentences which are grammatically declarative are not logically so.

A '''character'''&lt;ref name=character group="nb"&gt;
'''Character''' A ''character'' is a typographic character (printed or written), a unit of speech, a phoneme, a series of dots and dashes (as sounds, magnetic pulses, printed or written), a flag or stick held at a certain angle, a gesture, a sign as use in sign language, a pattern or raised indentations (as in brail) etc. in other words the sort of things that are commonly described as the elements of an alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; is a typographic character (printed or written) etc.

A '''word-token'''&lt;ref name=wordtoken group="nb"&gt;
'''Word-token'''
A word-token is a pattern of characters.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters A ''This toucan can catch a can'' contains six word-tokens&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D ''He is grnd''  contains three word-tokens&lt;/ref&gt; is a pattern of characters.
A '''word-type'''&lt;ref name=word-type group="nb"&gt;'''Word-type''' A word-type is an identical pattern of characters, .&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters A: ''This toucan can catch a can.'' contains five word-types (the word-token can occurring twice)
&lt;/ref&gt;
is an identical pattern of characters.
A '''meaningful-word-token'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-word-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-word-token''' A meaningful-word-token is a meaningful word-token.  ''grnd'' in D ''He is grnd.''  is not meaningful..&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful word-token.
Two word-tokens which mean the same are of the same '''word-meaning'''&lt;ref name=word-meaning group="nb"&gt;
'''Word-meaning''' Two word-tokens which mean the same are of the same word-meaning.  Only those word-tokens which are meaningful-word-tokens can have the same meaning as another word-token.
The pattern of characters A: ''This toucan can catch a can.''  contains six word-meanings.&lt;br /&gt;
Although it contains only five word-types, the two occurrences of the word-token ''can'' have different meanings.&lt;br /&gt;
On the assumption that ''bucket'' and ''pail'' mean the same, the pattern of characters B: ''If you have a bucket, then you have a pail'' contains ten word-tokens, seven word-types, and six word-meanings.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Sentence-token''' A sentence-token is a pattern of word-tokens.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is a sentence-token because ''grnd'' is a word-token (albeit not a '''meaningful''' word-token.)
&lt;/ref&gt; is a pattern of word-tokens.
A '''meaningful-sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-sentence-token''' A meaningful-sentence-token is a meaningful sentence-token or a meaningful pattern of meaningful-word-tokens.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is not a sentence-token because grnd is not a meaningful word-token.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful sentence-token or a meaningful pattern of meaningful-word-tokens.
Two sentence-tokens are of the same sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters&lt;ref name=sentence-type group="nb"&gt;
'''Sentence-type''' Two sentence-tokens are of the same sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P: ''I'm Spartacus'' and Q: ''I'm Spartacus'' are of the same sentence-type.&lt;/ref&gt;
A '''declarative-sentence-token''' is a sentence-token which that can be used to communicate truth or convey information.&lt;ref name=declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Declarative-sentence-token''' A declarative-sentence-token is a sentence-token which that can be used to communicate truth or convey information.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters E: ''Are you happy?'' is not a declarative-sentence-token because it interrogative not declarative.
&lt;/ref&gt;
A '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token''' is a meaningful declarative-sentence-token&lt;ref name=meaningful-declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens'''
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is a meaningful declarative-sentence-token.&lt;br /&gt; 
The pattern of characters F: ''Cats blows the wind'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it is grammatically ill-formed&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters G: ''This stone is thinking about Vienna'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because thinking cannot be predicated of a stone&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters H: ''This circle is square'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it is internally inconsistent&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd''  is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it contains a word-token (''grnd'') which is not a meaningful-word-token
&lt;/ref&gt;
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-type'''&lt;ref name=Meaningful-declarative-sentence-type group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-types'''
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P: ''I'm Spartacus'' and Q: ''I'm Spartacus'' are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type. In other words a sentence-type is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if all tokens of which are meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens
&lt;/ref&gt;
if they are identical patterns of word-tokens.
A '''nonsense-declarative-sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=nonsense-declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Nonsense-declarative-sentence-token'''
A nonsense-declarative-sentence-token is a declarative-sentence-token which is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.&lt;br /&gt;
The patterns of characters F: ''Cats blows the wind'', G: ''This stone is thinking about Vienna'' and H: ''This circle is square'' are nonsense-declarative-sentence-tokens because they are declarative-sentence-tokens but not meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens. The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is not a nonsense-declarative-sentence-token because it is not a declarative-sentence-token because it contains a word-token (''grnd'') which is not a meaningful-word-token.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a declarative-sentence-token which is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.
A '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use occurs when and only when a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is used declaratively, rather than, say, mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters T: ''Spartacus did not eat all his spinach in London on Feb 11th 2009'' is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token but, in all probability, it has never been used declaratively and thus there have been no meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses of T.  A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token can be used zero to many times. Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens-uses of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type are identical if and only if they are identical events in time and space with identical users.
&lt;/ref&gt;
occurs when and only when a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is used declaratively.

A '''referring-expression'''&lt;ref name=referring-expression group="nb"&gt;
'''Referring-expression''' An expression that can be used to pick out or refer to particular entity, such as definite descriptions and proper names
&lt;/ref&gt;
is expression that can be used to pick out or refer to particular entity.
A '''referential success'''&lt;ref name=referential-success group="nb"&gt;
'''Referential success''' a referring-expressionâs success in identifying a particular entity OR a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-useâs containing one or more referring-expression all of which succeed in identifying a particular entity
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a referring-expressionâs success in identifying a particular entity.
A '''referential failure'''&lt;ref name=referential-failure group="nb"&gt;
'''Referential failure''' a referring-expressionâs failure to identify a particular entity is referentially successful OR a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-useâs containing one or more referring-expression that fail to identify a particular entity.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a referring-expressionâs failure to identify a particular entity.
A '''referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''&lt;ref name=Referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use group="nb"&gt;
'''Referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''  A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use containing no referring-expression that fails to identify a particular entity. A use of a token of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type U: ''The King of France is baldâ'  is a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use if (and only if) the embedded referring-expression âThe King of Franceâ is referentially successful.  No use of a token of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type V: ''The highest prime has no factors other than itself and 1'' is not a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use since the embedded referring-expression ''The highest prime'' is always a referential failure.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use containing no referring-expression that fails to identify a particular entity.

==Sentences in natural languages==
As Aristotle pointed out, since some sentences are questions, commands, or meaningless, not all can be truth-bearers.
If in the proposal  "What makes the sentence ''Snow is white'' true is the fact that snow is white"   it is assumed that  '''sentences''' like ''Snow is white'' are truth-bearers, then it would be more clearly stated as "What makes the meaningful-declarative-sentence  ''Snow is white'' true is the fact that snow is white".

'''Theory 1a: '''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-'''types'''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;*'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-types'''
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P and Q above are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type. In other words a sentence-type is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if its tokens of are meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens&lt;/ref&gt;)
are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Criticisms of Theory 1a'''

Some meaningful-declarative-sentence-'''types''' will be both truth and false, contrary to our definition of truth-bearer, e.g. (i)  the liar-paradox sentences such as "This sentence is false". (see Fisher 2008&lt;ref name="Fisher 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|title=Philosophy of Logic|year=2008|isbn=0-495-00888-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (ii) Time, place and person dependent sentences e.g. "It is noon". "This is London", "I'm Spartacus".

''Anyone may ..ascribe truth and falsity to the deterministic propositional signs we here call utterances.  But if he takes this line, he must, like Leibniz, recognise that truth cannot be an affair solely of actual utterances, since it makes sense to talk of the discovery of previously un-formulated truths.'' (Kneale, W&amp;M (1962)&lt;ref name="Kneale 1962"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kneale|first=W&amp;M|title=The development of logic|publisher=Oxford|year=1962|isbn=0-19-824183-6}} page 593&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Revision to Theory 1a''', by making a distinction between type and token.

To escape the time, place and person dependent criticism the theory can be revised, making use or the [[typeâtoken distinction]],&lt;ref&gt;see Wolfram, Sybil (1989) generally on the application of typeâtoken distinction&lt;/ref&gt;  as follows

'''Theory 1b: '''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Quine argued that the '''primary''' truth-bearers are utterances &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Utterance''': The term ''utterance'' is frequently used to mean ''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.'' See e.g. Grice, '''Meaning''', 1957 http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/f09/semprag1/grice57.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having now recognised in a general way that what are true are sentences, we must turn to certain refinements.  What are best seen as primarily true or false are not sentences but events of utterances.  If a man utters the words 'It is raining' in the rain, or the words 'I am hungry' while hungry, his verbal performance counts as true.  Obviously one utterance of a sentence may be true and another utterance of the same sentence be false.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
QUINE 1970&lt;ref name="QUINE 1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=QUINE |first=W.V.|title=Philosophy of Logic|year=1970|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-663625-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; page 13

'''Criticisms of Theory 1b'''

(i) Theory 1b prevents sentences which are meaningful-declarative-sentence-types from being truth-bearers.  If all meaningful-declarative-sentence-types typographically identical to "The whole is greater than the part" are true then it surely follows that the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type "The whole is greater than the part" is true (just as all meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens typographically identical to "The whole is greater than the part" are English [[logical consequence|entails]] the meaningful-declarative-sentence-types "The whole is greater than the part" is English) (ii) Some meaningful-declarative-sentences-tokens will be both truth and false, or neither, contrary to our definition of truth-bearer.  E.g. A token, t, of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type âP: I'm Spartacusâ, written on a placard.  The token t would be true when used by Spartacus, false when used by Bertrand Russell, neither true nor false when mentioned by Spartacus or when being neither used nor mentioned.

'''Theory 1b.1'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers;  some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types are truth-bearers
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To allow that at least some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types can be truth-bearers Quine allowed so-called eternal sentences&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Eternal Sentence''': A sentence that stays forever true, or forever false, independently of any special circumstances under which they happen to be uttered or written.  More exactly,  a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type whose tokens have the same truth values. E.g. ''The whole is greater than the part'' is an eternal sentence, ''It is raining'' is not an eternal sentence but ''It rains in Boston, Mass., on July 15, 1968'' is an eternal sentence&lt;/ref&gt; to be truth-bearers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Peirces's terminology, utterances and inscriptions are ''tokens'' of the sentence or other linguistic expression concerned; and this linguistic expression is the ''type'' of those utterances and inscriptions.  In Frege's terminology, truth and falsity are the two ''truth values''.  Succinctly then, an eternal sentence is a sentence whose tokens have the same truth values.... What are best regarded as true and false are not propositions but sentence tokens, or sentences if they are eternal &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Quine 1970&lt;ref name="QUINE 1970"/&gt; pages 13â14

'''Theory 1c'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Arguments for Theory 1c'''

By respecting the [[useâmention]] Theory 1c avoids criticism (ii) of Theory 1b.

'''Criticisms of Theory 1c'''

(i) Theory 1c does not avoid criticism (i) of Theory 1b. (ii) meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are events (located in particular positions in time and space) and entail a user.  This implies that (a) nothing (no truth-bearer) exists and hence nothing (no truth-bearer) is true (of false) anytime anywhere (b) nothing (no truth-bearer) exists and hence nothing (no truth-bearer) is true (of false) in the absence of a user.  This implies that (a)  nothing was true before the evolution of users capable of using meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens and (b) nothing is true (or false) accept when being used (asserted) by a user.  Intuitively the truth (or falsity) of âThe tree continues to be in the quadâ continues in the absence of an agent to asset it.

'''Referential Failure'''
A problem of some antiquity is the status of sentences such as 
U: The King of France is bald
V: The highest prime has no factors
W: Pegasus did not exist 
Such sentences purport to refer to entitles which do not exist (or do not always exist). They are said to suffer from referential failure.  We are obliged to choose either (a) That they are not truth-bearers and consequently neither true nor false or (b) That they are truth-bearers and per se are either true of false.

'''Theory 1d'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Theory 1d takes option (a) above by declaring that meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses that fail referentially are not truth-bearers.

'''Theory 1e'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers;  some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types are truth-bearers
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Arguments for Theory 1e'''

Theory 1e has the same advantages as Theory 1d.  Theory 1e allows for the existence of truth-bearers (i.e., meaningful-declarative-sentence-types) in the absence of users and between uses.  If for any x, where x is a use of a referentially successful token of a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type y x is a truth-bearer then y is a truth-bearer otherwise y is not a truth bearer.  E.g. If all uses of all referentially successful tokens of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type âThe whole is greater than the partâ are truth-bearers (i.e. true or false) then the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type âThe whole is greater than the partâ is a truth-bearer.  If some but not all uses of some referentially successful tokens of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type âI am Spartacusâ are true then the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type âI am Spartacusâ is not a truth-bearer.

'''Criticisms of Theory 1e'''

Theory 1e makes implicit use of the concept of an agent or user capable of using (i.e. asserting) a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.  Although Theory 1e does not depend on the actual existence (now, in the past or in the future) of such users, it does depend on the possibility and cogency of their existence.  Consequently, the concept of truth-bearer under Theory 1e is dependent upon giving an account of the concept of a âuserâ.  In so far as referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are particulars (locatable in time and space) the definition of truth-bearer just in terms of referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence is attractive to those who are (or would like to be) nominalists. The introduction of âuseâ and âusersâ threatens the introduction of intentions, attitudes, minds &amp;c. as less-than=welcome ontological baggage

==Sentences in languages of classical logic==

In [[classical logic]] a [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] in a language is true or false under (and only under) an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] and is therefore a truth-bearer. For example, a language in the [[first-order predicate calculus]] might include one of more predicate symbols and one or more individual constants and one or more variables.  The interpretation of such a language would define a domain (universe of discourse); assign an element of the domain to each individual constant; assign the donation in the domain of some property to each unary (one-place) predicate symbol.&lt;ref&gt;See also '[[First-order logic#Semantics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a language L consisted in the individual constant ''a'', two unary predicate letters ''F'' and ''G'' and the variable ''x'', then an interpretation I of L might define the Domain D as animals, assign Socrates to ''a'',  the denotation of the property being a man to ''F'' and the denotation of the property being mortal to ''G''.  Under the interpretation I of L then ''Fa'' would be true [[if and only if|if, and only if]] Socrates is a man,  and the sentence ''{{all}}(Fx {{imp}} Gx)'' would be true if, and only if all men (in the domain) are mortal.  In some texts an interpretation is said to give   [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|"meaning"]] to the symbols of the language.  Since ''Fa'' has the value true under some (but not all interpretations) it is not the sentence-type ''Fa'' which is said to be true but only some sentence-tokens of ''Fa'' under particular interpretations. A token of ''Fa'' without an interpretation is neither true nor false.  Some sentences of a Language like L are said to be true under all interpretations of the sentence, e.g. ''{{all}}(Fx {{or-}} {{not}}Fx),'' such sentences being termed [[logical truth]]s, but again such sentences are neither true nor false in the absence of an interpretation.

==Propositions==
Many authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Russell, Wittgenstein, and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/facts/#FacPro:  "By âpropositionâ, we shall mean truth-bearer, and remain neutral as to whether truth-bearers are sentences, statements, beliefs or abstract objects expressed by sentences, for instanceâexcept in section 2.4.1."&lt;/ref&gt; use the term '''[[proposition]]''' as truth-bearers.  There is no single definition or usage.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Matthew, "Propositions", The Stanford (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/propositions/&gt;."The term âpropositionâ has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other âpropositional attitudesâ (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of sentences."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Propositions |last=Mark |first=Richard |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446801663/propositions.html |date=2006 |quote=On one use of the term, "propositions" are objects of assertion, what successful uses of declarative sentences say. As such, they determine truth-values and truth conditions. On a second, they are the objects of certain psychological states (such as belief and wonder) ascribed with verbs that take sentential complements (such as believe and wonder ). On a third use, they are what are (or could be) named by the complements of such verbs. Many assume that propositions in one sense are propositions in the others.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is used to mean a ''meaningful declarative sentence'' itself; sometimes it is used to mean '''the meaning of''' a meaningful declarative sentence.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosopher's tolerance towards propositions has been encouraged partly by ambiguity in the term 'proposition'. The term often is used simply for the sentences themselves, declarative sentences; and then some writers who do use the term for meanings of sentences are careless about the distinction between sentences and their meanings"  Quine 1970, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This provides two possible definitions for the purposes of discussion as below

'''Theory 2a''': &lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentences are propositions
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Theory 2b''':&lt;blockquote&gt;
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token expresses a proposition; two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens which have the same meaning express the same proposition; two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens with different meanings express different propositions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; (cf Wolfram 1989,&lt;ref name="Wolfram 1989 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Sybil|publisher=Routledge|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;21)

''Proposition'' is not always used in one or other of these ways.

'''Criticisms of Theory 2a.'''  
* If all and only meaningful-declarative-sentences '''are''' propositions, as advanced by Theory 2a, then the terms are synonymous and we can just as well speak of the meaningful-declarative-sentences themselves as the trutbearers - there is no distinct concept of proposition to consider, and the term ''proposition'' is literally redundant.

'''Criticisms of Theory 2b'''
* Theory 2b entails that if all meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens typographically identical to say, "I am Spartacus" have the same meaning then they (i) express the same proposition (ii) that proposition is both true and false,&lt;ref&gt;i.e. when expressed by a token-meaningful-declarative-sentence made by Spartacus, and when expressed by somebody other than Spartacus&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the definition of truth-bearer.
* The concept of a proposition in this theory rests upon the concept of meaning as applied to meaningful-declarative-sentences, in a word '''synonymy''' among meaningful-declarative-sentence s.  Quine 1970 argues that the concept of synonymy among meaningful-declarative-sentences cannot be sustained or made clear, consequently the concepts of "propositions" and "meanings of sentences" are, in effect, vacuous and superfluous&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophers who favor propositions have said that propositions are needed because truth only of propositions, not of sentences [read ''meaningful-declarative-sentences'' Ed], is intelligible. An unsympathetic answer is that we can explain truth of sentences to be propositional in their own terms: sentences are true whose meanings are true propositions.  Any failure of intelligibilty here is already his own fault." Quine 1970 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

see also [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Proposition]], ''The Russell-Myhill Antinomy'', also known as the ''Principles of Mathematics Appendix B Paradox''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/par-rusm.htm]

see also [http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth/#SH4b Internet Encycypedia of Philosophy] ''Propositions are abstract entities; they do not exist in space and time. They are sometimes said to be âtimelessâ, âeternalâ, or âomnitemporalâ entities. Terminology aside, the essential point is that propositions are not concrete (or material) objects. Nor, for that matter, are they mental entities; they are not âthoughtsâ as Frege had suggested in the nineteenth century. The theory that propositions are the bearers of truth-values also has been criticized. Nominalists object to the abstract character of propositions. Another complaint is that itâs not sufficiently clear when we have a case of the same propositions as opposed to similar propositions. This is much like the complaint that we canât determine when two sentences have exactly the same meaning. The relationship between sentences and propositions is a serious philosophical problem.''

==Statements==
Many authors consider ''statements'' as truth-bearers, though as with the term "proposition" there is divergence in definition and usage of that term. Sometimes 'statements' are taken to be meaningful-declarative-sentences; sometimes they are thought to be what is asserted by a meaningful-declarative-sentence.  It is not always clear in which sense the word is used. This provides two possible definitions for the purposes of discussion as below.

A particular concept of a statement was introduced by Strawson in the 1950s.,&lt;ref name="Strawson 1950"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strawson|first=PF|year=1950|title=On referring|journal=Mind|volume=9}} reprinted in Strawson 1971 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strawson 1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strawson|first=PF|year=1957|title=Propositions, Concepts and Logical Truths|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=7}} reprinted in {{cite book| title= Logico-Linguistic Papers|last=Strawson|first=P.F.|year=1971| publisher= Methuen| isbn= 0-416-09010-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strawson 1952" /&gt;

Consider the following:
*I: The author of [[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]] is dead
*J: The author of [[Ivanhoe]] is dead
*K: I am less than six feet tall
*L: I am over six feet tall
*M: The conductor is a bachelor
*N: The conductor is married

On the assumption that the same person wrote Waverley and Ivanhoe, the two distinct patterns of characters (meaningful-declarative-sentences) I and J make the same statement but express different propositions. &lt;br /&gt;
The pairs of meaningful-declarative-sentences (K, L) &amp; (M, N) have different meanings, but they are not necessarily contradictory, since K &amp; L may have been asserted by different people, and M &amp; N may have been asserted about different conductors.

''What these examples show is that we cannot identify that which is true or false (the statement) with the sentence used in making it; for the same sentence may be used to make different statements, some of them true and some of them false.'' (Strawson, P.F. (1952)&lt;ref name="Strawson 1952"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Strawson |first=P.F.|title=Introduction to Logical Theory|publisher=Methuen: London|year=1952|pages=4|isbn=0-416-68220-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This suggests:

* Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens which say the same thing of the same object(s) make the same statement.

'''Theory 3a'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only statements are meaningful-declarative-sentences. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Theory 3b'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentences can be used to make statements 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Statement'' is not always used in one or other of these ways.

'''Arguments for Theory 3a'''
* "All and only statements are meaningful-declarative-sentences." is either a stipulative definition or a descriptive definition.  If the former, the stipulation is useful or it is not; if the latter, either the descriptive definition correctly describes English usage or it does not. In either case no arguments, as such, are applicable

'''Criticisms of Theory 3a'''

* If the term ''statement'' is synonymous with the term ''meaningful-declarative-sentence'', then the applicable criticisms are the same as those outlined under sentence below
* If all and only meaningful-declarative-sentences '''are''' statements, as advanced by Theory 3a, then the terms are synonymous and we can just as well speak of the meaningful-declarative-sentences themselves as the truth-bearers â there is no distinct concept of statement to consider, and the term ''statement'' is literally redundant.

'''Arguments for Theory 3b'''

== Thoughts ==
Frege (1919) argued that an indicative sentence in which we communicate or state something, contains both a thought and an assertion, it expresses the thought, and the thought is the sense of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Frege 1919"&gt;Frege (1919) ''Die Gedanke'' trans AM and Marcelle Quinton in {{cite journal|last=Frege|first=G|year=1956|title=The thought: A logical Enquiry|journal=Mind|volume=65}} reprinted in Strawson 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===

[[File:Francisco Gomes de Matos(ed).jpg|150px|thumb|right|Francisco Gomes de Matos]]

Although the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) has language as one of its categories for equal rights, it does not explicitly list and elaborate on linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Languages of Israel: Policy, Ideology and Practice|year=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|location=United Kingdom|pages=52|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Xej-BQK9YEcC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=impacts+universal+declaration+of+linguistic+rights&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkGb0koIPh&amp;sig=rjqTbxbl35KdVCc4fJEkT-7wML4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JpVT5SwBcPnrAfNtvCNBw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author1=Spolsky, B.  |author2=Shohamy, E. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with declarations and rules on protecting specific languages and their rights, there was no binding document at that time that referred to all the languages or to world linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="FCUDLR Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENLLAÃ|url=http://www.linguistic-declaration.org/but-gb.htm|publisher=Linguistic Declaration.org|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there have been attempts to fill this gap by expanding on the importance of linguistic rights in the global scene.

In addition, the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (UDLR) holds regards to several policies that motivated the respect of linguistic rights. Some of the documents include:
* [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities|Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]]
* [[European Convention on Human Rights]]
* [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]
* [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]
* Universal Declaration of the Collective Rights of Peoples

The idea of a Declaration was first proposed in 1984, where a Brazilian by the name of Francisco Gomes de Matos introduced to the International Federation of Modern Language Teachers (FIPLV), a plea for a Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights.&lt;ref name="Plea for UDLR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Typologies of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/MatosTwoTypologiesofLinguisticRights.pdf|publisher=Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He listed some of the principal linguistic rights, together with their educational implications.

One of the most significant motivations stemmed from the 12th Seminar of the International Association for the Development of Intercultural Communication of 1987, held in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], which also recommended the introduction of a declaration for linguistic rights. The Seminar then adopted a preliminary declaration that indexed some fundamental types of linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt;

===Drafting===

The main objective of penning a Declaration was to define equality in linguistic rights, regardless of differences in political or territorial statuses. It serves to promote international commitment in respecting the rights of linguistic groups, especially those of historicity, as well as individuals who do not reside within their native communities.&lt;ref name="WACC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://waccglobal.org/en/19994-language-and-the-right-to-communicate/806-Universal-Declaration-of-Linguistic-Rights.html|publisher=The World Association for Christian Communication (WACC)|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the UDLR does not distinguish among official, non-official, majority, local, regional, and minority languages. There was much complexity tied to the drafting process because it was not easy to come up with equal measures, definitions and reasons, especially since it required an international consensus. For instance, one of the most common problems lie in clarifying concepts and their terminologies.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel" /&gt; Subsequently, follow-up meetings and feedback sessions were held in [[Paris]], [[Portugal]] and [[Frankfurt]].

In 1990, the FIPLV drafted a working document. On August 1991, the FIPLV organised a workshop in [[PÃ©cs]], [[Hungary]]. It was there that they managed to consolidate an agenda on fundamental principles for a UDLR. The Declaration was also discussed in December 1993, during a session of the Translations and Linguistic Rights Commission of the [[International PEN]].&lt;ref name="Linguistic Human Rights"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic Human Rights: Overcoming Linguistic Discrimination|year=1995|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=99â100|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Jo3NobRqFUQC&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author=Skutnabb-Kangas, T., Phillipson, R. &amp; Rannut, M.|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1994, a team was rooted to facilitate the process of writing the official document. About 40 experts from different countries and fields were involved in the first 12 drafts of the Declaration.&lt;ref name="CulturalRights.net" /&gt; Progressively, there were continuous efforts in revising and improving the Declaration as people contributed ideas to be included in it.

===Adoption===

It was on 6 June 1996, during the World Conference on Linguistic Rights in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], that the Declaration was acknowledged. The Conference, which was an initiative of the Translations and Linguistic Rights Commission of the [[International PEN|International PEN Club]] and the CIEMEN (Escarre International Center for Ethnic Minorities and the Nations), comprised 61 [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], 41 [[International PEN|PEN]] Centers and 40 experts. The document was signed and presented to a representative of the [[UNESCO]] Director General.&lt;ref name="CulturalRights.net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; However, this does not mean that the Declaration has gained approval.

In the same year, the Declaration was published in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It was later translated into other languages, some of which include [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Nynorsk]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].

Even so, there have been continuous efforts to bring the Declaration through as [[UNESCO]] did not officially endorse the UDLR at its General Conference in 1996,&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights" /&gt; and also in subsequent years, although they morally supported it.

As a result, a Follow-up Committee of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (FCUDLR) was created by the World Conference on Linguistic Rights. The FCUDLR is also represented by the CIEMEN, which is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organisation]].&lt;ref name="CIEMEN"&gt;{{cite news|title=CIEMEN presents a follow-up document before the Chairman of the UN Human Rights Council|url=http://www10.gencat.cat/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/noticies_detall.jsp?id=95&amp;idioma=5|accessdate=10 March 2012|newspaper=LinguamÃ³n News|date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objectives of having a follow-up committee was to 1) garner support, especially from international bodies, so as to lend weight to the Declaration and see it through to [[UNESCO]], 2) to maintain contact with [[UNESCO]] and take into account the many viewpoints of its delegates, and 3) to spread awareness of the UDLR and establish a web of support.&lt;ref name="FCUDLR Bulletin" /&gt;

Consequently, the committee started a Scientific Council consisting of professionals in Linguistic Law. The duty of the Council is to update and improve the Declaration from time to time by gathering suggestions&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; from those who are keen on the issue of linguistic rights.

The following summarises the progress of the UDLR:

==Contents and Themes==
{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}

===Structure===
The preamble of the Declaration provides six reasons underlying the motivations to promote the stated principles.

To ensure clarity in applicability across diverse linguistic environments, the declaration has included a preliminary title that addresses the definitions of concepts used in its articles (Articles 1-6).&lt;ref name="UDLR Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|location=Orlando (Florida)|url=http://www.linguistic-declaration.org/versions/angles.pdf|author=Follow-up Committee of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Title One (Articles 7-14) lists general principles asserting equal linguistic rights for language communities and for the individual. Besides the main principles, the second title delves into an overall linguistic rÃ©gime and is further divided into 6 sections. Section 1 (Articles 15-22) addresses language usage related to public administration and official bodies. Section 2 (Articles 23-30) touches on linguistic rights involving educational fields. 
Section 3 (Articles 31-34) defines linguistic rights concerning [[onomastics|naming]], while Section 4 (Articles 35-40) asserts the entitlement of language groups to mass media resources and new technologies. Section 5 (Articles 41-46) outlines the rights related to cultural artifacts. The last section of the second title, Section 6 (Article 47-52), touches on the individual or language group's rights in the socioeconomic sphere.

The Additional Dispositions call for the obligation of public powers to take measures ensuring the application of these rights and to inform other related bodies of these proclamations. As for the Final Dispositions, the founding of a Council of the Languages within the [[United Nations]] Organization is put forth, as well as the creation of a World Commission for Linguistic Rights, which is to be an unofficial, consultative council composed of experts in non-governmental organizations and those in the field of linguistic law.&lt;ref name="UNESCO's UDLR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.unesco.org/cpp/uk/declarations/linguistic.pdf|work=Major Non-Governmental Documents, UNESCO.org|publisher=UNESCO: Culture of Peace Programme|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening Article===
'''Preliminary Title: Article 1'''

1. This Declaration considers as a language community any human society established historically
in a particular territorial space, whether this space be recognized or not, which identifies itself as a
people and has developed a common language as a natural means of communication and cultural
cohesion among its members. The term language specific to a territory refers to the language of the
community historically established in such a space.&lt;ref name="UNESCO's UDLR" /&gt;

==Reactions==

One of the comments made was on the idealistic nature of the Declaration. As the Declaration considers all languages equal, it rejects terms such as âofficialâ, âregionalâ or âminorityâ languages and strongly advocates the full use of all historic community languages.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"/&gt;

Drawing from the articles pertaining to the educational issues (Articles 25, 26 and 30), it is stated that the education system should fully support the development of their community languages and other languages they wish to know in schools to the point of fluency and capability to use it in all social situations. In addition, research on language and culture of language communities is to be done at the university level. It has been argued that the 'rights' stated in those articles will remain the privilege of powerful language communities.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=543|author=Tove Skutnabb-Kangas|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that since the Declaration requires authorities to issue sanctions in the event of violation of the proclaimed rights, doubts have arisen regarding the likelihood of any government adopting the document.&lt;ref name="Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction|year=2006|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=146|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Xej-BQK9YEcC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA&amp;dq=impacts+universal+declaration+of+linguistic+rights&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkGb0koIPh&amp;sig=rjqTbxbl35KdVCc4fJEkT-7wML4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JpVT5SwBcPnrAfNtvCNBw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author=Tasaku Tsunoda|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governmental groups (other than the regional authorities in [[Spain]] such as [[Catalonia]], [[Menorca]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]]) in most countries find it hard to reconcile these fundamental principles of the Declaration with their current language policies and practices.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"/&gt;
There is a need to balance between regulations imposed by governments and the protection of the rights of the people in different language communities. Considerations such as acknowledging the primary human rights of minority peoples (e.g. issues of physical survival) are, instead, regarded as more dire than an issue like linguistic rights. Linguistic rights will hence be ignored before primary human rights can be properly attended to. Furthermore, the cost involved in executing sanctions is another cause of concern.&lt;ref name="Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction"/&gt; The main issue, however, is the fact that the article is not legally binding and duty-holders are never specified.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"/&gt;

Other responses include the issue that more rights are given to âlanguage communitiesâ in the Declaration. In the context of education, it is observed that other than language communities (equivalent to ânational territorially based minorities'), those who do not fit under this category will have to âassimilateâ, as having the right to education in the language of the territory does not necessarily equate to having the right to an education in oneâs own language.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"/&gt;

==Developments==

===Efforts in Ratification===

The Declaration is not [[International law|constitutional]] and has not been ratified by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], unlike the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Despite the Follow-up Committeeâs publication of the text in 1998,&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; which was backed by letters of support from world leaders, [[UNESCO]] has not ratified the document.&lt;ref name="International PEN page on UNESCO Portal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=The FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale des Professeurs de Langues Vivantes (FIPLV) and Language Rights|url=http://www.atriumlinguarum.org/contenido/langrights.pdf|publisher=Observatorio Atrium Linguarum|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On 19 April 2002, CIEMEN and [[International PEN]] convoked a summit during the World Congress on Language Policies in Barcelona. The FIPLV suggested that it would modify the Declaration so that it would be accepted and implemented. There were also further efforts to foster support for the UDLR through proposals and conferences in 2003.&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights" /&gt;

Since 2008, CIEMEN has been lobbying to place linguistic rights on the agenda of the states that are currently members of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC). Despite the positive responses to the document, member states perceived a lack of consensus on the matter and did not wish to be among the first to adopt the proposal. An event organised in Geneva in 2008, entitled ''Linguistic Rights to enhance Human Rights'', which coincided with the Eighth Session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]], aimed to garner support for a draft resolution for the UDLR to be presented at the September session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] conference. Ambassadors from [[Mexico]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Armenia]] and [[Nigeria]] expressed their support in a series of interviews. Later in September, the Advisory Committee of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] was called upon to take steps to present a proposal, in hopes that the UDLR could be added to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Nationalia: Linguistic rights closer to recognition by UN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Linguistic rights closer to being recognized by UN|url=http://www.nationalia.info/en/news/271|accessdate=9 March 2012|newspaper=Nationalia|date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Girona Manifesto===
The Girona Manifesto was developed by [[International PEN]]'s Translation and Linguistic Rights in May 2011 to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the Declaration.&lt;ref name=www20.gencat.cat&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalan chapter of the International PEN organization leads revisions to Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/afersexteriors/menuitem.548116b848978a59fea66dfbb0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=ae30321283550310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ae30321283550310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall&amp;contentid=eaeac4966c681310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;newLang=en_GB|publisher=gencat|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Girona Manifesto is an updated version that condenses the primary principles of the UDLR to aid its implementation. In September 2011, the manifesto was ratified by the International PEN Assembly of Delegates at the 77th Congress.&lt;ref name=pen-international.org1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girona Manifesto: Encapsulating the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/the-girona-manifesto-encapsulating-the-universal-declaration-of-linguistic-rights/
|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of the manifesto is based on the Universal Declarationâs 10 central principles. In contrast to the comprehensive and complex declaration which plays an important role in the field of linguistics and politics, the manifesto is laid out in a concise and practical way, intended to be âtranslated and disseminated as a tool to defend linguistic diversity around the world'. The goal is to bring attention the issue of language rights back to the international agenda.&lt;ref name="pen-international.org1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pen-international.org" /&gt;

It is thought to be an important step toward protecting and promoting all of the world's languages, including the ones at risk of extinction.&lt;ref name="pen-international.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girona Manifesto Press Release|url=http://www.pen-international.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/15092011.pdf|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[John Ralston Saul]], President of [[International PEN]] mentioned, "[It] could give us a clear public document with which to defend and advance languages with smaller populations as well as endangered languages".&lt;ref name="pen-international.org1" /&gt;

On 5 March 2012, the Girona Manifesto and its translated versions were presented at an event organized by Catalan PEN Centre. It was held at the Palau de la Generalitat, Barcelona.&lt;ref name=pen-international.orgnewsitems&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto translation appeal|url=http://pen-international.org/newsitems/girona-manifesto-translation-appeal/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto has been translated in 32 languages to date.&lt;ref name=pen-international.orgnewsitems1&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto On Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.pen-international.org/who-we-are/translation-linguistic-rights/girona-manifesto/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text of the Girona Manifesto on Linguistic Rights''':&lt;ref name=pen-international.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto on Linguistic Rights (English)|url=http://pen-international.org/who-we-are/translation-linguistic-rights/girona-manifesto/girona-manifesto-on-linguistic-rights/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Linguistic diversity is a world heritage that must be valued and protected.

2. Respect for all languages and cultures is fundamental to the process of constructing and maintaining dialogue and peace in the world.

3. All individuals learn to speak in the heart of a community that gives them life, language, culture and identity.

4. Different languages and different ways of speaking are not only means of communication; they are also the milieu in which humans grow and cultures are built.

5. Every linguistic community has the right for its language to be used as an official language in its territory.

6. School instruction must contribute to the prestige of the language spoken by the linguistic community of the territory.

7. It is desirable for citizens to have a general knowledge of various languages, because it favours empathy and intellectual openness, and contributes to a deeper knowledge of oneâs own tongue.

8. The translation of texts, especially the great works of various cultures, represents a very important element in the necessary process of greater understanding and respect among human beings.

9. The media is a privileged loudspeaker for making linguistic diversity work and for competently and rigorously increasing its prestige.

10. The right to use and protect oneâs own language must be recognized by the United Nations as one of the fundamental human rights

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3253">A '''vector addition system (VAS)'''  is one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems. Vector addition systems were introduced by [[Richard M. Karp]] and Raymond E. Miller in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karp|first1=Richard M.|last2=Miller|first2=Raymond E.|title=Parallel program schemata|journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences|date=May 1969|volume=3|issue=2|pages=147â195|doi=10.1016/S0022-0000(69)80011-5|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0000(69)80011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generalized to '''vector addition systems with states (VASS)''' by [[John Hopcroft|John E. Hopcroft]] and Jean-Jacques Pansiot in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopcroft|first1=John E.|last2=Pansiot|first2=Jean-Jacques|title=On the reachability problem for 5-dimensional vector addition systems|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|date=1979|volume=8|issue=2|pages=135â159|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both VAS and VASS are equivalent in many ways to [[Petri net]]s introduced earlier by [[Carl Adam Petri]]. [[File:Vector addition with states.svg|thumb|Example of a vector addition with states. In this VASS, e.g., q(1,2) can be reached from p(0,0), but q(0,0) cannot be reached from p(0,0).]]

== Informal definition ==

A ''vector addition system'' consists of a finite set of [[integer]] [[row vector|vectors]]. An initial vector is seen as the initial values of multiple counters, and the vectors of the VAS are seen as updates. These counters may never drop below zero. More precisely, given an initial vector with non negative values, the vectors of the VAS can be added componentwise, given that every intermediate vector has non negative values. A ''vector addition system with states'' is a VAS equipped with control states. More precisely, it  is a finite [[directed graph]] with [[Directed graph#Basic terminology|arcs]] labelled by [[integer]] vectors. VASS have the same restriction that the counter values should never drop below zero.

== Formal definitions and basic terminology ==

* A ''VAS'' is a finite set &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* A ''VASS'' is a finite [[directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;(Q, T)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq Q \times \mathbb{Z}^d \times Q&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Transitions ===

* Let &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt; be a VAS. Given a vector &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;, the vector &lt;math&gt;u + v&lt;/math&gt; can be ''reached'', in one transition, if &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u + v \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;(Q, T)&lt;/math&gt; be a VASS. Given a ''configuration'' &lt;math&gt;(p, u) \in Q \times \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;, the configuration &lt;math&gt;(q, u + v)&lt;/math&gt; can be ''reached'', in one transition, if &lt;math&gt;(p, v, q) \in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u + v \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;.
