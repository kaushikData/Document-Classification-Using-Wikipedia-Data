'''3361 Orpheus''' (1982 HR) is an [[Apollo asteroid]] that was discovered on 24 April 1982 by [[Carlos Torres (astronomer)|Carlos Torres]] at [[Cerro El Roble Astronomical Station]]. Its eccentric orbit crosses that of [[Mars]] and [[Earth]], and approaches [[Venus]] as well. From 1900 to 2100 it passes closer than 30&amp;nbsp;Gm to Venus 11, Earth 33, and Mars 14 times. It passed by Earth at a distance of about 40 lunar distances on 7 December 2013.

3361 Orpheus is a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] (PHA) because its [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] (MOID) is less than 0.05 AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is {{convert|0.0139|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; Its orbit is well-determined for the next several hundred years.

The orbital solution includes non-gravitational forces.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;

== Missions ==
3361 Orpheus had been one of the originally proposed targets for the [[Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous]] (NEAR) mission.

The proposed [[AIDA (mission)|AIDA]] may make a fly-by observation of 3361 Orpheus during its trajectory to asteroid [[65803 Didymos]].&lt;ref&gt;A.F.

'''''A Primate's Memoir''''' is a book by the [[United States|American]] [[biologist]] [[Robert Sapolsky|Robert M. Sapolsky]]. The book documents Sapolsky's years in [[Kenya]] studying [[baboons]] as a graduate student.  The chapters alternate between describing observations of a troop of baboons and the wildly different [[Culture of Africa|culture in Africa]] that he is increasingly cognizant of.  The book portrays an unconventional way of studying [[neurophysiology]] to determine the effects of stress on life expectancy.

The book was nominated for [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books]] in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2762">In the [[natural sciences]], especially in [[atmospheric sciences|atmospheric]] and [[Earth sciences]] involving [[applied statistics]], an '''anomaly''' is the [[deviation (statistics)|deviation]] in a quantity from its expected value, e.g., the difference between a measurement and a mean or a model prediction.&lt;ref name=Wilks&gt;Wilks, D.S. (1995) ''Statistical Methods in the Atmospheric science'', Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-751965-3}} (page 42)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similarly, a '''standardized anomaly''' equals an anomaly divided by a [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref name =Wilks/&gt; 
A group of anomalies can be analyzed spatially, as a map, or temporally, as a time series.
There are examples in atmospheric sciences and in geophysics.

==Calculation==
The [[Central tendency|location and scale measures]] used in forming an anomaly time-series may either be constant or may themselves be a time series or a map. For example, if the original time series consisted of temperatures measured every hour, the effect of typical daily cycles of temperature might be remove by subtracting a time series containing mean temperature values for each hour of the day: clearly, this can be extended by including seasonal variations of temperature.

[[Robust statistics]], resistant to the effects of [[outlier]]s, are sometimes used as the basis of the [[Data transformation (statistics)|transformation]].&lt;ref name =Wilks/&gt;

==Examples==

===Atmospheric sciences===
In the atmospheric sciences, the climatological [[annual cycle]] is often used as the mean value.  Famous atmospheric anomalies are for instance the [[Southern Oscillation]] index (SOI) and the [[North Atlantic oscillation]] index.  SOI is the atmospheric component of [[El Niño]], while [[North Atlantic oscillation|NAO]] plays an important role for [[Europe]]an [[weather]] by modification of the exit of the Atlantic [[storm track]].

===Geophysics===
* [[Bouguer anomaly]], anomaly in gravimetry
* [[Free-air anomaly]], gravity anomaly that has been computed for latitude and corrected for elevation of the station
* [[Gravity anomaly]], difference between the observed gravity and a value predicted from a model
* [[Iridium anomaly]], an unusual abundance of what is normally a very rare element in the Earth's crust
* [[Magnetic anomaly]], local variation in the Earth's magnetic field
** [[Kursk Magnetic Anomaly]], territory rich in iron ores located within Kursk Oblast, Belgorod Oblast, and Oryol Oblast
** [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]], large buried geologic structure in the Temagami region of Ontario, Canada

'''''Astérix''''', the first [[France|French]] satellite, was launched on November 26, 1965 by a [[Diamant|Diamant A]] rocket from the [[CIEES]] launch site at [[Hammaguir]], [[French Algeria]]. With ''Astérix'', France became the sixth country to have an artificial satellite in orbit after the [[USSR]] (''[[Sputnik 1]]'', 1957), the United States (''[[Explorer 1]]'', 1958), the United Kingdom (''[[Ariel 1]]'', 1962), Canada (''[[Alouette 1]]'', 1962), and Italy (''[[San Marco 1]]'', 1964), and the third to launch a satellite on its own (the UK, Canada and Italy's satellites were launched on American rockets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wade|first1=Mark|title=Asterix|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228044858/http://www.astronautix.com/a/asterix.html|website=Astronautix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite was originally designated '''A-1''', as the French Army's first satellite, but later renamed after the popular [[Franco-Belgian comics|French comics]] character [[Asterix|Astérix]].  Due to the relatively high altitude of its orbit, it is not expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Steve|title=Asterix|url=https://spacearchaeology.org/?p=499|website=Space Archaeology|accessdate=27 April 2018|date=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atmospheric temperature''' is a measure of [[temperature]] at different levels of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is governed by many factors, including [[insolation|incoming solar radiation]], [[humidity]] and [[altitude]]. When discussing [[surface air temperature]], the annual [[atmospheric temperature range]] at any geographical location depends largely upon the type of [[biome]], as measured by the [[Köppen climate classification]].

==Temperature versus height==
[[File:Atmospheric_Temperature_Trend.jpg|thumb|200px|These images show temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured by a series of satellite-based instruments between January 1979 and December 2005. The measurements were taken by Microwave Sounding Units and Advanced Microwave Sounding Units flying on a series of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather satellites. The instruments record microwave energy emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Source: [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=7839]]]
[[File:EarthAtmosphereBig.jpg|thumb|75px|right]]
{{main|lapse rate}}
In the Earth's atmosphere, temperature varies greatly at different heights relative to the [[Earth]]'s surface. The coldest temperatures lie near the [[mesopause]], an area approximately 80 km above the surface. In contrast, some of the warmest temperatures can be found in the [[thermosphere]], which receives strong [[ionizing radiation]] at the level of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]].

Temperature varies as one moves vertically upwards from the Earth's surface. It also depends on the change of latitude.

==Temperature range== 
The variation in temperature that occurs from the highs of the day to the cool of nights is called [[diurnal temperature variation]]. Temperature ranges can also be based on periods of a month, or a year. 

The size of ground-level atmospheric temperature ranges depends on several factors, such as:

* The average temperature
* The average [[humidity]]
* The regime of [[wind]]s (intensity, duration, variation, temperature, etc.)
* The proximity to large bodies of [[water]], such as the [[sea]]

[[File:Temperature-campinas.jpg|thumb|left|Average maximum, minimum and range of monthly air temperatures recorded in [[Campinas]], [[Brazil]], between January 2001 and July 2006]]
[[File:Temperature-aracaju.jpg|right|thumb|Average maximum, minimum and range of monthly air temperatures recorded in [[Aracaju]], state of [[Sergipe]], [[Brazil]], between January 2001 and July 2006]]
The figure at below-left shows an example of monthly temperatures recorded at one of such locations, the city of [[Campinas]], [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], which lies approximately 60&amp;nbsp;km north of the Capricorn line ([[latitude]] of 22 degrees). Average yearly temperature is 22.4 degrees Celsius, ranging from an average minimum of 12.2 degrees to a maximum of 29.9 degrees. The average temperature range is 11.4 degrees.&lt;ref name=agri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agritempo.gov.br/agroclima/sumario?uf=SP |title=Station statistics |work=Agritempo |accessdate=October 11, 2013 |language=pt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012041528/http://www.agritempo.gov.br/agroclima/sumario?uf=SP |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Variability along the year is small (standard deviation of 2.31 for the maximum monthly average and 4.11 for the minimum). It is easy to see in the graph another typical phenomenon of temperature ranges, which is its increase during winter (lower average air temperature).

In Campinas, for example, the daily temperature range in July (the coolest month of the year) may vary between typically 10 and 24 degrees Celsius (range of 14), while in January, it may range between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius (range of 10).

The effect of latitude, tropical climate, constant gentle wind and sea-side locations show smaller average temperature ranges, smaller variations of temperature, and a higher average temperature (second graph, taken for the same period as Campinas, at [[Aracaju]], capital of the state of [[Sergipe]], also in Brazil, at a latitude of 10 degrees, nearer to the [[Equator]]). Average maximum yearly temperature is 28.7 degrees Celsius and average minimum is 21.9. The average temperature range is 5.7 degrees only. Temperature variation along the year in Aracaju is very damped (standard deviation of 1.93 for the maximum temperature and 2.72 for the minimum temperature).&lt;ref name=agri/&gt;

== Uses ==

A location which combines an average temperature of 19 degrees Celsius, 60% average humidity and a temperature range of about 10 degrees Celsius around the average temperature (yearly temperature variation) is considered ideal in terms of [[comfort]] for the human species. Most of the places with these characteristics are located in the transition between temperate and tropical climates, approximately around the [[tropics]], particularly in the Southern hemisphere (the [[tropic of Capricorn]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Lifted Minimum Temperature==
{{see also|surface temperature inversion}}

The minimum temperature on calm, clear nights has been observed to occur not on the ground, but rather a few tens of centimeters above the ground.  The lowest temperature layer is called ''Ramdas layer'' after [[L. A. Ramdas]], who first reported this phenomenon in 1932 based on observations at different screen heights at six meteorological centers across India.&lt;ref&gt;Ramdas, L.A. and Atmanathan, S., 1932. ''The vertical distribution of air temperature near the ground at night''. Beitrage zur Geophysik, v.37, pp. 116–117.

 | volume=176
 | issue=4470}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phenomenon is attributed to the interaction of [[thermal radiation]] effects on atmospheric aerosols and [[convection]] transfer close to the ground.

==Global temperature==
{{seealso|Schumann resonances#Global temperature}}
The concept of a global temperature is commonly used in [[climatology]], and denotes the average temperature of the Earth based on surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=James E.|title=GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)|url=http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/|work=[[National Aeronautic and Space Administration]]|publisher=[[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]]|accessdate=1 September 2011|authorlink=James Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt; near-surface or [[troposphere|tropospheric]] measurements. These [[temperature record]]s and measurements are typically acquired using the [[satellite temperature record|satellite]] or [[instrumental temperature record|ground instrumental]] temperature [[thermometer|measurements]], then usually compiled using a database or [[computer model]]. Long-term global temperatures in [[paleoclimate]] are discerned using [[proxy (climate)|proxy data]].

'''Bismite''' is a [[bismuth]] [[oxide]] mineral, [[bismuth trioxide]] or Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a [[monoclinic]] mineral, but the typical form of occurrence is massive and clay-like with no macroscopic crystals. The color varies from green to yellow. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 4 to 5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 8.5 to 9.5, quite high for a nonmetallic mineral.

Bismite is a secondary oxidation zone mineral which forms from primary bismuth minerals.

It was first described from [[Goldfield, Nevada]] in 1868, and later from the Schneeberg District, [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]], [[Saxony]], [[Germany]].

The '''Central Ranges xeric scrub''' is a [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1302|name=Central Ranges xeric scrub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and description==
The region consists of sandy plains with some areas of rocky highland. These plains have a dry climate but do get some rain in both summer and winter. This area contains the remote city of [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] while the grasslands are home to a number of [[Indigenous Australian]] communities or are used for cattle grazing.

==Flora==
This ecoregion contains four [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] (IBRA) bioregions; [[Burt Plain]], [[MacDonnell Ranges]], [[Finke bioregion|Finke]], and [[Central Ranges]], and includes the [[Central Australian Mountain Ranges]] [[Centre of Plant Diversity]]. The habitats consists of thick, tough [[Triodia (plant)|spinifex]] grassland with some wooded areas of [[myall]] and [[Acacia coriacea|desert oak]] ''(Acacia coriacea)''. The region and the MacDonnell Ranges in particular are home to a number of specialised endemic plant species including the [[Livistona mariae|cabbage palm]]s of [[Palm Valley (Northern Territory)|Palm Valley]] in [[Finke Gorge National Park]].

==Fauna==
Birds include the [[red-tailed black cockatoo]] and the [[spinifexbird]] while animals include the [[black-flanked rock-wallaby]] population of the MacDonnell Ranges and the [[Australian green tree frog|green tree frog]]. 

Overgrazing by cattle and introduced animals including horses, donkeys and rabbits are a threat to habitats.

'''Armor''' has been used in the military for a long period of time during the course of history, but is becoming more frequently seen in the public sector as time passes. There are many different forms and ways that armor is being commercially used throughout the world today. The most popular and well-known uses are body and vehicle armor. There are other commercial uses including aircraft armor and armored glass.

==Armor technologies==

===Aramids===
[[Aramid|Aramid fiber]] is the generic name of a group of synthetic fibers which are used in vehicle armor, fire equipment, tires, and bulletproof vests. The material has extremely high strength while still being flexible, and is very resistant to heat (it does not melt). In 2011 worldwide production of aramids was more than 60,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Todd. Aramid Fibers
The Versatile Polymer Reinforcing Fiber. Retrieved from http://composite.about.com/od/aboutaramids/a/Aramid-Fibers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Para aramids====
The Para-aramid with the most production worldwide is [[Kevlar]]. It was commerciality introduced by [[Du Pont]] in 1972. In 1998 Kevlar accounted for 85% of the global market of para-aramid fibers. Kevlar is the material most often used in bulletproof vests. Different forms of Kevlar are anywhere from five to twenty times stronger than steel per weight.&lt;ref&gt;(2001, April 30). Aramid Fibers. http://www.chem.uwec.edu/Chem405_s01/malenirf/project.html&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantages of Kevlar are that it degrades with exposure to UV light, is expensive to produce, and is difficult to shape.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, V. (2001). What is Kevlar? Types of Kevlar. Retrieved from http://www.technologystudent.com/joints/kevlar2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meta aramids====
Meta aramids are aramid compounds that have a different molecular structure, giving them different physical properties to para aramid fibers. The most popular product of this kind is [[Nomex]]. Nomex has less strength than Kevlar, but it has extremely high heat, flame, ultraviolet, chemical, and radiation resistance. Meta aramids are commonly found in firefighting equipment, as well as military pilot suits and helmets.

===Dragon Skin===
[[Dragon Skin]] armor uses multiple ceramic and titanium composite two-inch discs that overlap, forming an armor that looks like scales of a dragon. This type of structure allows the vests to stay relatively light and flexible. Dragon skin has two main benefits over other types of body armor: It can take multiple hits from bullets and it doesn’t compromise the entire structure, and it deals with the blunt force of a bullet or projectile much better than most other types of body armor because the impact energy of a bullet can disperse over a larger area. In a test, using 5.56&amp;nbsp;mm, 7.62mm, and 9mm steel core, armor-piercing ammunition, and with more than a dozen shots, the dragon skin armor remains completely intact and no bullet penetrated through.

===Spider Silk===
[[Spider silk]] has some amazing natural properties and is one of nature’s strongest materials. Spider’s dragline silk has a tensile strength (force by which it can be stretched without breaking) similar to alloy steel, or about half as strong as Kevlar. Weight for weight it is five times stronger than steel. One apparent difference between the other armor materials is that the silk can be stretched up to 5 times its relaxed length without breaking.

==Commercial and cargo planes==
Following the bombing of the [[Pan Am Flight 103]] in 1988 the Transportation Security Laboratories have been developing ways to reduce the damage to an airplane by placing a hardened film around the cargo bay and overhead compartments. They have also changed the shape of the cargo bay to provide more security and to reduce the force of any explosion. 
To improve the circumstances in a case where an aircraft turbine engine fails, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) is working to design specific armor to protect the vital parts of the plane to assure safe flying until landing is accomplished. This armored barrier would prevent fragments from engine failure from damaging other sections of the airplane. High strength polymer fibers have been found to be the most effective material for this specific use.&lt;ref&gt;Shockey, D. A., Giovanola, J. H., Simons, J. W., Erlich, D. C., Klopp, R.

==Armored glass==
Armor Glass International, Inc. was founded by Michael Fjetland, BBA/JD, to "armor glass" under the trademark Armor Glass® to provide security from breach of the glass by natural disasters, explosions, burglars, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, golf balls or other harmful events. One of the main products offered by this company is security film. This type of film is 8 mil thick, is rated for a Large Missile Impact (Level C 4.5 lb.) and is placed on the inside of a window or other source of glass, the weakest link of every building, to create a more durable and defensive layer. Studies have shown that breach of a window by wind-borne debris hurled by hurricane-force winds is what leads to roof uplift and structural collapse. This protective film is used on many buildings in Washington D.C. such as the Pentagon, Smithsonian, Congress, etc. but is also used commercially throughout the world for any person or company striving for extra protection against specific unpredictable encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Armor Glass International.

==Vehicle armor==
The average person who purchases an automobile according to the [[International Armoring Corporation]] fits into at least one of the three categories. They have money, believe there is a genuine threat against their lives, or are a government official.  Upon receiving a down payment by the client the armoring process begins. At the beginning of the process the company assigned with the project meets with the client. This meeting is to determine how the automobile should be customized to fit the client’s needs based on type of car, threat level, and defensive options. When determining type of car the customer has many options as any automobile can be armored. However, the weight of the armor can vary from 500 to 2000 pounds requiring special suspension and engines upgrades to be installed. After the car type is chosen the customer is asked about their perceived threat level. This helps the manufactures to determine what ballistic protection level the car needs customized for (See also, International Armoring Corporation). Ballistic protection levels range Type 1 to Type IV and are governed by [[National Institute of Justice]] Standard 0108.01.  Once the preliminary review is completed and the specifications are finalized the manufacture begin the project.&lt;ref&gt;Medlin, R. C. (1982).

According to patent US 4352316 A* there are several steps when it comes to armoring a civilian automobile. First, the automobile is stripped of its interior. Second, door frames are rebuilt to include armor plating and bullet proof windows are added. Third, the vertical portions, top, and bottom of the automobile are enforced with armoring plating. Finally, the car’s battery and engine are encased in armor plating.&lt;ref&gt;Kolwell, K.C. Car and Driver. (December 2009). How To: Bulletproof a Car Retrieved from http://www.caranddriver.com/features/how-to-bulletproof-a-car-feature&lt;/ref&gt;   The objective of the plating is to prevent bullets from penetrating the automobile and entering into the passenger cabin. During the installation process various materials are used including; [[bulletproof glass]], [[ballistic nylon]], [[run flat]] inserts, and [[Lexan]]. Outside of the basic armoring package several defensive options are available to help improve the security of the automobile comprising; dual battery system, DVR security camera system, electric door handles, flashing front strobe lights, night vision systems, self-sealing fuel tank, and siren/loudspeaker system, etc.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Justice (December 1981) Ballistic Resistant Protective Material NIJ Standard 0108.01 Retrieved from: https://www.justnet.org/pdf/0108.01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==

===Economics of body armor===
The US body armor industry is worth $802 million  a year with a decrease just over nine percent in the last five years according to a market research done by [[IBISWorld]]. This is the result of the conclusion of the war in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of troops. There are currently around 80 companies in the US that are specializing in body armor from head to toe. The top four companies are said to control almost half of the market. The market is expected to come back from this 9% low due to needs for law enforcement and other private security firms. Just the body armor industry alone profits 39.3 million in profit. The military takes the majority with 72%, law enforcement take 14.2%, the commercial use has the remainder of the 13.8%.  The report states that the use of robots has reduced the need for body armor in highly dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. (July 2013).

===Economics of vehicle armor===
In a report done by Ibisworld.com commercial uses of vehicle armor only share an 8% of the 7.2 billion dollar industry. The market has been on a steady decline, 12% over the past five years and expected to drop another 2% over the next five years. 68% of the market is taken by the military and government. It profits just under 1 billion dollars a year. Exports of commercial armored vehicles are on the rise the majority of the exports go the United Arab Emirates about 29%. Most of the other majority are exported to the middle east.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, B. (December 2013). Uphill Battle: Despite Stable Foreign Demand, Low Government Spending Will Cut into Growth.

In physics and chemistry, the '''law of conservation of energy''' states that the total [[energy]] of an [[isolated system]] remains constant, it is said to be [[Conservation law|''conserved'']] over time.&lt;ref name=Feynman2Ch1S2&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I |publisher=Addison Wesley  |year=1970 |isbn=978-0 -201-02115-8  |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, [[chemical energy]] is [[Energy conversion|converted]] to [[kinetic energy]] when a stick of [[dynamite]] explodes. If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the [[kinetic energy]] of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.  Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass; however, [[special relativity]] showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and science now takes the view that mass–energy is conserved.

Conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by [[Noether's theorem]] as a consequence of [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[time translation symmetry]]; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.

A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a [[Perpetual motion#Classification|perpetual motion machine of the first kind]] cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M.

Ogg from the seventh German edition, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; For systems which do not have [[time translation symmetry]], it may not be possible to define conservation of energy.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]]]
[[Ancient]] [[philosopher]]s as far back as [[Thales of Miletus]] {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;550 BCE had inklings of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made. However, there is no particular reason to identify this with what we know today as "mass-energy" (for example, Thales thought it was water). [[Empedocles]] (490–430 BCE) wrote that in this universal system, composed of [[Classical element|four roots]] (earth, air, water, fire), "nothing comes to be or perishes";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janko|first=Richard|title=Empedocles, "On Nature"|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|year=2004 |volume=150 |pages=1–26|url=http://ancphil.lsa.umich.edu/-/downloads/faculty/janko/empedocles-nature.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement.

In 1605, [[Simon Stevinus]] was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that [[perpetual motion]] was impossible.

In 1638, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his analysis of several situations—including the celebrated "interrupted pendulum"—which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.

In 1669, [[Christian Huygens]] published his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his [[Horologium Oscillatorium]], he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.

The fact that kinetic energy is scalar, unlike linear momentum which is a vector, and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. It was Leibniz during 1676–1689 who first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with ''motion'' (kinetic energy). Using Huygens' work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several [[mass]]es, ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' each with [[velocity]] ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''),
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

was conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the ''[[vis viva]]'' or ''living force'' of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of [[kinetic energy]] in situations where there is no friction. Many [[physicist]]s at that time, such as Newton,  held that the [[conservation of momentum]], which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the [[momentum]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\!\sum_{i} m_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;

was the conserved ''vis viva''. It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously, given the proper conditions such as an [[elastic collision]].

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published his [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]], which was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.

[[File:Daniel Bernoulli 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]]]

The law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. The former enunciated the principle of [[virtual work]] as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his [[Hydrodynamica]], published in 1738, on this single conservation principle. Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the [[Bernoulli's principle]], which relates the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.

This focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the [[D'Alembert's principle]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]],
and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations of mechanics.

[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706  – 1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had all believed that "energy" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped from. In classical physics the correct formula is &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac12 mv^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy of an object, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; its mass and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its speed. On this basis, Châtelet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat…).&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber, Ruth, editor (2011) ''Émilie du Chatelet between Leibniz and Newton''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-94-007-2074-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arianrhod|first1=Robyn|title=Seduced by logic : Émilie du Châtelet, Mary Somerville, and the Newtonian revolution|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-993161-3|edition=US|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9444991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Engineer]]s such as [[John Smeaton]], [[Peter Ewart]], [[:de:Carl Holtzmann|Carl Holtzmann]], [[Gustave-Adolphe Hirn]] and [[Marc Seguin]] recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some [[chemist]]s such as [[William Hyde Wollaston]]. Academics such as [[John Playfair]] were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but in the 18th and 19th centuries the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.

Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of ''vis viva''. In 1783, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reviewed the two competing theories of ''vis viva'' and [[caloric theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Lavoisier, A.L. &amp; Laplace, P.S. (1780) "Memoir on Heat", ''Académie Royale des Sciences'' pp.&amp;nbsp;4–355&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] of [[cannon]]s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat, and (as importantly) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). ''Vis viva'' then started to be known as ''energy'', after the term was first used in that sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1807.

[[File:Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]]]]

The recalibration of ''vis viva'' to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {2}\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be understood as converting kinetic energy to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], was largely the result of [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] over the period 1819–1839. The former called the quantity ''quantité de travail'' (quantity of work) and the latter, ''travail mécanique'' (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculation.

In a paper ''Über die Natur der Wärme''(German "On the Nature of Heat/Warmth"), published in the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1837, [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]] gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in the words: "besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called ''Kraft'' [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others."

===Mechanical equivalent of heat===
A key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]''. The [[caloric theory]] maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.

In the middle of the eighteenth century, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.

In 1798, Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.

[[File:SS-joule.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[James Prescott Joule]]]]

The mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;von Mayer, J.R. (1842) "Remarks on the forces of inorganic nature" in ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''43''', 233&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the [[Dutch East Indies]], where he found that his patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less [[oxygen]], and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate.  He discovered that [[heat]] and [[mechanical work]] were both forms of energy and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.R. (1845). ''Die organische Bewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem Stoffwechsel. Ein Beitrag zur Naturkunde'', Dechsler, Heilbronn.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|[[James Prescott Joule|Joule]]'s apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]

Meanwhile, in 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the "Joule apparatus", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate.  He showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

Over the period 1840–1843, similar work was carried out by engineer [[Ludwig A. Colding]], although it was little known outside his native Denmark.

Both Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule's that eventually drew the wider recognition.

{{For|the dispute between Joule and Mayer over priority|Mechanical equivalent of heat: Priority}}

In 1844, [[William Robert Grove]] postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, [[light]], [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] by treating them all as manifestations of a single "force" (''energy'' in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book ''The Correlation of Physical Forces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Grove, W. R. | title=The Correlation of Physical Forces | location=London | publisher=Longmans, Green | year=1874 | edition=6th }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, drawing on the earlier work of Joule, [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[Émile Clapeyron]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] arrived at conclusions similar to Grove's and published his theories in his book ''Über die Erhaltung der Kraft'' (''On the Conservation of Force'', 1847).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= On the Conservation of Force|url=http://www.bartleby.com/30/125.html|publisher=Bartleby|accessdate= April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this publication.

In 1850, [[William Rankine]] first used the phrase ''the law of the conservation of energy'' for the principle.&lt;ref&gt;William John Macquorn Rankine (1853) "On the General Law of the Transformation of Energy," ''Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow'', vol. 3, no. 5, pages 276-280; reprinted in: (1) ''Philosophical Magazine'', series 4, vol. 5, no. 30, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ov22-gFMnEC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 106-117] (February 1853); and (2) W. J. Millar, ed., ''Miscellaneous Scientific Papers: by W. J. Macquorn Rankine'', ... (London, England: Charles Griffin and Co., 1881), part II, [https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneoussci00rank#page/203/mode/1up pages 203-208]: "The law of the ''Conservation of Energy'' is already known—viz. that the sum of all the energies of the universe, actual and potential, is unchangeable."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] claimed that the principle originated with Sir Isaac Newton, based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. This is now regarded as an example of [[Whig history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
{{main|Mass–energy equivalence}}

Matter is composed of such things as atoms, electrons, neutrons, and protons. It has [[rest mass|''intrinsic'' or ''rest'' mass]]. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of [[special relativity]] showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of ''rest energy''. This means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of ''other'' (non-material) forms of energy, for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the [[mass in special relativity|''total'' mass]] or ''total'' energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.

For example, an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] each have rest mass.  They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into [[photon]]s having electromagnetic radiant energy, but no rest mass.  If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total ''mass'' nor the total ''energy'' of the system will change.  The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.

Thus, conservation of energy (''total'', including material or ''rest'' energy), and [[conservation of mass]] (''total'', not just ''rest''), each still holds as an (equivalent) law.  In the 18th century these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.

===Conservation of energy in beta decay===
{{Main|Beta decay#Neutrinos in beta decay}}
The discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in [[beta decay]] have a continuous rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Carsten |year=2000 |editor1-link= |editor1-mask= |title=Controversy and Consensus: Nuclear Beta Decay 1911-1934 |url=https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/physics/book/978-3-7643-5313-1 |publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag |isbn=978-3-7643-5313-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode= 1978PhT....31i..23B |doi=10.1063/1.2995181 |title=The idea of the neutrino |journal=Physics Today |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=23–8 |year=1978 |last1=Brown |first1=Laurie M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by [[Enrico Fermi]] who proposed the correct [[Fermi's interaction|description of beta-decay]] as the emission of both an electron and an [[antineutrino]], which carries away the apparently missing energy.&lt;ref&gt;

==First law of thermodynamics==
{{main|First law of thermodynamics}}

For a [[Closed system#In thermodynamics|closed thermodynamic system]], the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = \mathrm{d}U + \delta W&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity of [[energy]] added to the system by a [[heat]]ing process, &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity of energy lost by the system due to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the system on its surroundings and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the [[internal energy]] of the system.

The δ's before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U&lt;/math&gt; increment of internal energy (see [[Inexact differential]]). Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term "heat energy" for &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; means "that amount of energy added as the result of heating" rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term "work energy" for &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; means "that amount of energy lost as the result of work". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as the result of work being performed on or by the system.

[[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)|Entropy]] is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.

For a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = P\,\mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] and &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; is a small change in the [[volume]] of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called ''quasi-static'', and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, then the heat energy may be written

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt; is a small change in the [[entropy]] of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system.

If an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written:&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949). ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance'', Oxford University Press, London, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–147].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W + u'\,dM,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dM&lt;/math&gt; is the added mass and &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass of the added mass, measured in the surroundings before the process.

==Noether's theorem==
{{main|Noether's theorem}}
[[File:Noether.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Emmy Noether]] (1882-1935) was an influential [[mathematician]] known for her groundbreaking contributions to [[abstract algebra]] and [[theoretical physics]].]]
The conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of [[Noether's theorem]], developed by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and first published in 1918. The theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called "energy". The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as "nothing depends on time per se".
In other words, if the physical system is invariant under the [[continuous symmetry]] of [[time translation]] then its energy (which is [[canonical conjugate]] quantity to time) is conserved.  Conversely, systems which are not invariant under shifts in time (an example, systems with time dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy&amp;nbsp;– unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again.  Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory (including [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]) in the flat [[space-time]].

==Relativity==
With the discovery of [[special relativity]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein]], energy was proposed to be one component of an [[four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]].  Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given [[inertial reference frame]].  Also conserved is the vector length ([[Minkowski space|Minkowski norm]]), which is the [[rest mass]] for single particles, and the [[invariant mass]] for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated—see the article on [[invariant mass]]).

The relativistic energy of a single [[mass]]ive particle contains a term related to its [[rest mass]] in addition to its kinetic energy of motion.  In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the [[rest frame]]) of a massive particle, or else in the [[center of momentum frame]] for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the [[total energy]] of particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is related to its [[rest mass]] or its [[invariant mass]] via the famous equation &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the rule of [[Mass in special relativity|''conservation of energy'' over time in special relativity]] continues to hold, so long as the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the [[invariant mass]], which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the [[energy–momentum relation]].

In [[general relativity]], energy–momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a [[stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]]. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics such as the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html|title=Is Energy Conserved in General Relativity?|authors=Michael Weiss and John Baez|accessdate=5 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe.

==Quantum theory==
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy of a quantum system is described by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] (or Hermitian) operator called the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which acts on the [[Hilbert space]] (or a space of [[wave functions]]) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the  evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum [[Noether's theorem]] for energy-momentum tensor operator. Note that due to the lack of the (universal) time operator in quantum theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in specific cases (see [[Uncertainty principle]]). Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2091">The '''Corsican montane broadleaf and mixed forests''' [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]], in the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]], are on the island of [[Corsica]]. The ecoregion includes the high-altitude regions of Corsica's mountain ranges.

==Setting==
The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|3,600|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, approximately 40% of the area of the island. The montane forests are surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests]]. The highest elevations in the ecoregion are [[Monte Cinto]] (2,710 m) and [[Monte Rotondo]] (2,625 m).

==Flora==
The ecoregion is home to several distinct forest communities, which vary with elevation and exposure.

Lower elevations are occupied by forests of evergreen sclerophyll oaks, including Holm oak ''([[Quercus ilex]])'' and cork oak ''([[Quercus suber]])''.

Middle elevations are predominantly forests of maritime pine ''([[Pinus pinaster]])'' interspersed with forests of mixed broadleaf deciduous trees, including downy oak ''([[Quercus pubescens]])'', sessile oak ''([[Quercus petraea]])'', European hop-hornbeam ''([[Ostrya carpinifolia]])'', Italian alder ''([[Alnus cordata]])'' and sweet chestnut ''([[Castanea sativa]])''.

At the higher elevations, forests of Corsican pine ''([[Pinus nigra]]'' subsp. ''salzmannii'' var. ''corsicana)'' predominate on the warmer south-facing slopes, while silver fir ''([[Abies alba]])'' and European beech ''([[Fagus sylvatica]])'' predominate on the cooler north-facing slopes. The highest elevations are subalpine shrublands, with green alder ''([[Alnus viridis]])'' juniper ''([[Juniperus communis]] subsp. alpina)'', sycamore maple ''([[Acer pseudoplatanus]])'', and stands of silver birch ''([[Betula pendula]])''.

The '''Cuban cactus scrub''' is a [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrubland]] [[ecoregion]] that occupies {{convert|3300|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} on the [[Windward and leeward|leeward]] coast of [[Cuba]].  Most of it occurs in the southeastern part of the island in the provinces of [[Guantánamo Province|Guantánamo]] and [[Santiago de Cuba Province|Santiago de Cuba]].  The ecoregion receives less than {{convert|800|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually.  The principal [[soil]]s are coastal [[rendzina]]s that were derived from [[coral]]line [[limestone]].  Cuban cactus scrub contains four vegetation zones: [[Xerophyte|xerophytic]] coastal and subcoastal scrubland, coastal thorny semidesert, coastal [[sclerophyll]]ous scrubland, and rocky coastal scrublands.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt1306 |name=Cuban cactus scrub|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrubland==
Vegetation in the xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrublands reaches a height of {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is dominated by [[Arecaceae|palms]] and [[succulent]]s, especially [[Cactus|cacti]].  Common evergreen plants include cafecillo (''[[Bourreria]] [[Bourreria virgata|virgata]]''), mostacilla (''[[Capparis cynophallophora]]''), guairaje (''[[Eugenia foetida]]''), ''[[Bursera]] [[Bursera glauca|glauca]]'', ''[[Bursera cubana|B. cubana]]'', ''[[Croton (plant)|Croton]]'' spp., ''[[Cordia]]'' spp., ''[[Calliandra]] [[Calliandra colletioides|colletioides]]'', ''[[Caesalpinia]]'' spp., ''[[Acacia]]'' spp., ''[[Phyllostylon]] [[Phyllostylon brasiliense|brasiliense]]'', ''[[Pseudosamanea|Pseudosamanea cubana]]'' and guayacán negro (''[[Guaiacum officinale]]'').  Tuna (''[[Opuntia stricta]]''), ''[[Opuntia|O.]] [[Opuntia militaris|militaris]]'', pitahaya (''[[Harrisia eriophora]]''), jijira (''[[Harrisia taetra|H. taetra]]''), miramar (''[[Pilosocereus]] [[Pilosocereus polygonus|polygonus]]''), aguacate cimarrón (''[[Acanthocereus|Dendrocereus]] [[Dendrocereus nudiflorus|nudiflorus]]''), maguey (''[[Agave]]'' spp.), erizo (''[[Melocactus]]'' spp.) and ''[[Leptocereus]]'' spp. are typical [[succulent]]s.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Coastal thorny semidesert==
Coastal thorny semidesert is similar to xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrubland in that they both have the same succulent composition and reach a height of {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  However, succulents represent a smaller proportion of the plant life in this zone.  Other plant species include vomitel Colorado (''[[Cordia sebestena]]''), manzanillo (''[[Manchineel tree|Hippomane mancinella]]'') and lirio de costa (''[[Plumeria]] [[Plumeria filifolia|filifolia]]'').&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Coastal sclerophyllous scrubland==
The vegetation in this zone is [[sclerophyll]]ous, meaning that their [[Leaf|leaves]] are hard.  It reaches a height of {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} with emergent [[tree]]s up to {{convert|5|-|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  This zone represents the transition between xeric shrublands and moister [[Cuban dry forests|dry forests]].  Plant life includes yana (''[[Picrodendron baccatum]]''), carne de doncella (''[[Maytenus]] [[Maytenus buxifolia|buxifolia]]''), yamaguey de loma (''[[Pictetia]] [[Pictetia spinosa|spinosa]]''), granadillo (''[[Brya ebenus]]'') and ébano (''[[Diospyros]] [[Diospyros grisebachii|grisebachii]]'').&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Rocky coastal scrublands==
The most sparse and stunted vegetation is found in this zone, which occurs adjacent to the ocean on [[karst]]ic soil.  The flora is tolerant of wind and [[Halophyte|salt spray]], and includes romero de playa (''[[Borrichia]] [[Borrichia arborescens|arborescens]]''), incienso de playa (''[[Argusia]] [[Argusia gnaphalodes|gnaphalodes]]''), and verdolaga de playa (''[[Sesuvium]] [[Sesuvium maritimum|maritimum]]'').&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Fauna==
[[Bird]]s of the cactus scrub include the [[Zapata sparrow]] (''Torreornis inexpectata sigmani''), [[Cuban vireo]] (''Vireo gundlachii''), [[Cuban gnatcatcher]] (''Polioptila lembeyei''), and [[Oriente warbler]] (''Teretistris fornsi'').  The [[yellow-striped pygmy eleuth]] (''Eleutherodactylus limbatus'') is a species of [[frog]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to this ecoregion, while several [[anole]] species and the Cuban rock iguana (''[[Cyclura nubila|Cyclura nubila nubila]]'') are endemic [[lizard]]s.&lt;ref name="WildWord"&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=nt1306|name=Cuban cactus scrub|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Cliff and Warren Country Park''' is in [[Folkestone]], in [[Kent]], England.
This country park is formed of the East Cliffs of [[Folkestone]], the sandy beaches of East Wear Bay and the land-slipped [[nature reserve]] land between the cliffs and the sea.

==History==
On the east cliffs, are three [[Martello Towers]]. These were built on the cliffs in 1804-09 to protect against the French invasion of [[Napoleon]]. Number 3, since 1990 is used as a Martello Tower visitor centre by [[Folkestone and Hythe (District)|Folkestone and Hythe]] Council.&lt;ref name=martello&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martello-towers.co.uk/south-coast/towers/3.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160901/http://www.martello-towers.co.uk/south-coast/towers/3.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside it is an information panel describing the [[Folkstone Roman Villa|Roman villa]] ruins on the site.&lt;ref name=romanvilla&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverfolkestone.co.uk/events/thedms.aspx?dms=13&amp;feature=1648&amp;venue=3032656 |title=E&amp;A Details |publisher=Discover Folkestone |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875 until 1892, near Martello Tower 1, was a public house called the Warren Inn. It was closed after people were caught drinking after hours. The [[Earl of Radnor]] had it closed, as it was on his land.&lt;ref name=warreninn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenthistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=6927.0 |title=Warren Inn, Folkestone |publisher=Kenthistoryforum.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The east cliffs were popular with Victorians who picnicked on the grassy meadows of the cliffs before heading down towards the sandy beaches.
The area was popular with burrowing [[rabbits]] and was named informally 'The Warren'.

[[File:Railway and train to Folkestone - geograph.org.uk - 1287644.jpg|thumb|left| Railway in the Warren (site of the former Halt Station)]]

In 1884, the [[South East Main Line]] railway was built from [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] to [[Folkestone]] and then onwards to [[Dover]], through the Warren.
[[Folkestone Warren Halt railway station]] was opened in 1886, and a bridge was built over the Main Line leading to a gate on to The Warren from which the public could picnic and enjoy the dramatic scenery in the area. Also a zig-zag path led down the East Cliff to the station.

In December 1915, a large [[landslip]] resulted in the entire [[undercliff]] supporting the Main Line moved towards the sea causing approximately 1.5 million cubic metres of chalk to slip or fall burying Warren Halt and the railway line. No-one was hurt in the occurrence. This was one of the largest landslides in Kent.&lt;ref name=landslide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/landslides/folkestoneWarren.html |title=Landslides at Folkestone Warren &amp;#124; Kent &amp;#124; British Geological Survey |publisher=BGS |date=1955-02-22 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station and the line were closed until 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geologyshop.co.uk/landslips.htm GeologyShop, "Folkestone &amp; Hythe Landslips; the Warren, Copt Point, Castle Hill and the relict seacliffs between Hythe and Lympne".]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warren was still a popular picnic spot in [[Edwardian period|Edwardian times]] and a nearby [[tea garden|tea chalet]] served hundreds of visitors daily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://outdoors.webshots.com/photo/1258666334045881475YQuwEh Jill Batchelor, "A buddleia waiting to start into growth again", 23 January 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The land was then defended from coastal erosion with the intentional effect of stopping any more landslips to the land beyond the line.
In 1923, the Halt Station was rebuilt by the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] which added a set of platforms. The station remained open for a further 16 years before another landslip in 1939.

In 1924, the land was given to the council of Folkestone for perpetual recreational use by the [[Earls of Radnor]] during the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shepway.gov.uk/content/category/1/200038/1748/ |title=Folkestone Town Council minutes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722042510/http://www.shepway.gov.uk/content/category/1/200038/1748/ |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the country park was formed soon after by the council. The park covers an area of 299.4 hectares (or {{convert|739.8|acre|m2}})

It has various paths leading through it towards the coastline and beach,&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite book

The site is well known for the amount of fossils being found in the park,&lt;ref name=fossils&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaultammonite.co.uk/Pages/Gault_Stratigraphy_files/East_Wear_Bay_1.htm |title=East_Wear_Bay_Folkestone |publisher=Gaultammonite.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the landslips are of great interest to those studying [[geomorphology]]. The land is generally formed out of [[Gault Clay]] (for the cliffs) and [[sandstone]] for the more resistant rocky headland of Copt Point. The site of a [[World War II]] [[observation post]].

[[File:Capel Cliffs and the Warren 1964 - geograph.org.uk - 64712.jpg|thumb|right| East Cliffs]]

After the Country Park was set up, grazing animals were banned, this has allowed shrubs and trees to seed naturally across the site. Patches of wildflower meadow still exist and these are the favoured habitats of various rare insects. Including a [[harvestman]] (''[[Trogulus tricarinatus]]'') and a [[millipede]] (''[[Polydesmus testaceus]]''). Also rare plant species in the park include; [[wild cabbage]] (''Brassica oleracea''), the Dover variety of [[Nottingham catchfly]] (''Silene nutans'' var. ''nutans'') and the extremely local clove-scented broom rape (''[[Orobanche caryophyllacea]]'').&lt;ref name=rarespeices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkestone-rye.net/section4_partII_chapter6.pdf |title=Section 4 - part II - Chapter 6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warren is an important habitat for many insects. Over 330 types of moth have been recorded visiting the site, including the continental migrant sub-angled wave moth (''[[Scopula nigropunctata]]''). The fiery [[clearwing moth]] is only found here,&lt;ref name=moth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/northdowns/text.asp?PageId=26 |title=Wildlife sites on the trail - North Downs Way - National Trails |publisher=Nationaltrail.co.uk |date=2005-05-16 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many butterflies.
The [[Grayling (butterfly)|grayling]] butterfly has a small colony in the site, the only one in Kent.&lt;ref name=greyling&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kingsdownkent.blogspot.com/2009/08/warren.html |title=Kingsdowner: Warren |publisher=Kingsdownkent.blogspot.com |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[White Cliffs Countryside Partnership|White Cliffs Countryside Project]] (WCCP), who are assisting by local volunteers to maintain the remaining areas of chalk grassland and meadow. They have created open grassy corridor habitats along the footpaths so that the wild flowers and insects can survive and access other parts of the important nature reserve.

[[File:East Cliffside Path - geograph.org.uk - 1287650.jpg|thumb|left|Warren Country Park]]

The [[Saxon Shore Way]] and [[North Downs Way]], (long distance trails lead through the park between Folkestone and Dover, via [[Capel-le-Ferne]].

Beside Wear Bay Road, on the northern fringes of the park, is Little Switzerland Camping Site; it is so named because of the mountainous-looking white cliffs nearby. 
&lt;ref name=littleswiss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caravancampingsites.co.uk/kent/littleswitzerland.htm |title=Little Switzerland Caravan and Camping Site |publisher=Caravancampingsites.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forementioned ''Tea Chalet'' is within the camp site.

==Location==
From Wear Bay Road in Folkestone, access to the Warren is from the Martello Towers on East Cliff, from a small car park past Little Switzerland Camp site, or via a cliffside path from New Dover Road, near [[Capel-le-Ferne]].

In [[atmospheric science]], '''equivalent temperature''' is the temperature of an [[air parcel]] from which all the [[water vapor]] has been extracted by an [[adiabatic]] process. 

[[Air]] contains water vapor that has been evaporated into it from liquid sources (lakes, sea, etc...). The energy needed to do that has been taken from the air. Taking a volume of air at [[temperature]] T and [[mixing ratio]] of  r&amp;nbsp;, drying it by condensation will restitute energy to the airmass. This will depend on the [[latent heat]] release as: 

&lt;math&gt;T_e \approx T + \frac {L_v}{c_{pd}}r&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,L_v&lt;/math&gt; : [[latent heat]] of [[evaporation]] (2400 kJ/kg {at 25C} to 2600 kJ/kg {at -40C})

&lt;math&gt;\,c_{pd}&lt;/math&gt; : [[specific heat]] at constant pressure for air (&lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; 1004 J/(kg·K)) 

Tables exist for exact values of the last two coefficients.

== Etymology and other names ==
[[File:Philadelphia Museum of Art - Ganesha.jpg|thumb|upright|175px|Ganesha, Madhya Pradesh, c. 750, India]]
Ganesha has been ascribed many other titles and epithets, including ''Ganapati'' (''Ganpati'') and ''Vighneshvara''. The Hindu title of respect ''[[Shri]]'' ({{lang-sa|श्री}}; [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|śrī}}''; also spelled ''Sri'' or ''Shree'') is often added before his name.

The name ''Ganesha'' is a Sanskrit compound, joining the words ''[[gana]]'' ({{IAST|gaṇa}}), meaning a group, multitude, or categorical system and ''isha'' ({{IAST|īśa}}), meaning lord or master.&lt;ref&gt;

* Apte, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''gaṇa'' when associated with Ganesha is often taken to refer to the gaṇas, a troop of semi-divine beings that form part of the retinue of [[Shiva]], Ganesha's father.&lt;ref&gt;For the derivation of the name and relationship with the {{IAST|gaṇas}}, see: Martin-Dubost. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term more generally means a category, class, community, association, or corporation.{{Sfn|Apte|1965|p= 395}} Some commentators interpret the name "Lord of the {{IAST|Gaṇas}}" to mean "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord of created categories", such as the elements.&lt;ref&gt;The word gaṇa is interpreted in this metaphysical sense by Bhāskararāya in his commentary on the {{IAST|gaṇeśasahasranāma}}.

Krishan, ''{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: Unravelling an Enigma'', 1999, p. 6): "Pārvati who created an image of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} out of her bodily impurities but which became endowed with life after immersion in the sacred waters of the Gangā. Therefore he is said to have two mothers—Pārvati and Gangā and hence called dvaimātura and also Gāngeya."&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{IAST|Gaṇādhipa}}'' (equivalent to ''Ganapati'' and ''Ganesha''), ''Ekadanta'' (one who has one tusk), ''[[Heramba]]'', ''Lambodara'' (one who has a pot belly, or, literally, one who has a hanging belly), and ''Gajanana'' (''{{IAST|gajānana}}''); having the face of an elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vinayaka'' ({{lang|sa|विनायक}}; ''{{IAST|vināyaka}}'') is a common name for Ganesha that appears in the {{IAST|Purāṇa}}s and in Buddhist Tantras.&lt;ref name="Thapan"&gt;Thapan, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This name is reflected in the naming of the eight famous Ganesha temples in Maharashtra known as the ''[[Ashtavinayak]]'' ({{lang-mr|अष्टविनायक}}, {{IAST|aṣṭavināyaka}}).&lt;ref&gt;For the history of the ''{{IAST|aṣṭavināyaka}}'' sites and a description of pilgrimage practices related to them, see: Mate, pp. 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The names ''Vighnesha'' ({{lang|sa|विघ्नेश}}; ''{{IAST|vighneśa}}'') and ''Vighneshvara'' ({{lang|sa|विघ्नेश्वर}}; ''{{IAST|vighneśvara}}'') (Lord of Obstacles)&lt;ref name="Vighnesha"&gt;These ideas are so common that Courtright uses them in the title of his book, ''Ganesha: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings''.  For the name ''Vighnesha'', see: {{Harvnb|Courtright|1985|pp= 156, 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to his primary function in Hinduism as the master and remover of obstacles (''{{IAST|vighna}}'').&lt;ref name="Krishanvii"&gt;For Krishan's views on Ganesha's dual nature see his quote: "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} has a dual nature; as Vināyaka, as a ''{{IAST|grāmadevatā}}'', he is ''{{IAST|vighnakartā}}'', and as {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} he is ''{{IAST|vighnahartā}}'', a ''{{IAST|paurāṇic devatā}}''." Krishan, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent name for Ganesha in the [[Tamil language]] is ''Pillai'' ({{lang-ta|பிள்ளை}}) or ''Pillaiyar'' ({{lang|ta|பிள்ளையார்}}).&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dubost, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; A.K. Narain differentiates these terms by saying that ''pillai'' means a "child" while ''pillaiyar'' means a "noble child". He adds that the words ''pallu'', ''pella'', and ''pell'' in the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian family of languages]] signify "tooth or tusk", also "elephant tooth or tusk".&lt;ref&gt;Narain, A.K. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: The Idea and the Icon". Brown, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Raina Thapan notes that the [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] ''pille'' in the name ''Pillaiyar'' might have originally meant "the young of the elephant", because the [[Pali]] word ''pillaka'' means "a young elephant".&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Burmese language]], Ganesha is known as ''Maha Peinne'' ({{my|မဟာပိန္နဲ}}, {{IPA-my|məhà pèiɴné|pron}}), derived from [[Pali]] {{IAST|Mahā Wināyaka}} ({{my|မဟာဝိနာယက}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Myanmar-English Dictionary |year=1993 |publisher=Dunwoody Press |location=Yangon |isbn=1881265471 |url=http://sealang.net/burmese/dictionary.htm |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210001846/http://www.sealang.net/burmese/dictionary.htm |archivedate=10 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread name of Ganesha in [[Thailand]] is ''Phra Phikanet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin Thomas McDaniel|title=The Lovelorn Ghost and the Magical Monk: Practicing Buddhism in Modern Thailand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMWrAgAAQBAJ |year=2013 | publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0231153775|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest images and mention of Ganesha names as a major deity in present-day Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

== Iconography ==
[[File:India ganesha.jpg|thumb|A 13th-century statue of Ganesha, [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]]-style, [[Karnataka]]]]

Ganesha is a popular figure in [[Indian art]].&lt;ref&gt;Pal, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike those of some deities, representations of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time.&lt;ref&gt;
* Martin-Dubost, for a comprehensive review of iconography abundantly illustrated with pictures.
* Chapter X, "Development of the Iconography of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Krishan|1999|pp=87–100}}, for a survey of iconography with emphasis on developmental themes, well-illustrated with plates.
* Pal, for a richly illustrated collection of studies on specific aspects of Ganesha with a focus on art and iconography.&lt;/ref&gt; He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, or sitting down on an elevated seat, or engaging in a range of contemporary situations.

Ganesha images were prevalent in many parts of [[India]] by the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th-century statue pictured is typical of Ganesha statuary from 900–1200, after Ganesha had been well-established as an independent deity with his own sect. This example &lt;!-- REQUEST: is it possible to get a photo of the statue referred to by Martin-Dubost or Pal (which is much larger), to eliminate this confusion? --&gt;features some of Ganesha's common iconographic elements. A virtually identical statue has been dated between 973–1200 by Paul Martin-Dubost,&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dubost, p. 213. In the upper right corner, the statue is dated as (973–1200).&lt;/ref&gt; and another similar statue is dated c.&amp;nbsp;12th century by Pratapaditya Pal.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, p. vi. The picture on this page depicts a stone statue in the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|Los Angeles County Museum]] of Art that is dated as c. 12th century.  Pal shows an example of this form dated c. 13th century on p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a big belly.  This statue has four arms, which is common in depictions of Ganesha. He holds his own broken tusk in his lower-right hand and holds a delicacy, which he samples with his trunk, in his lower-left hand. The motif of Ganesha turning his trunk sharply to his left to taste a sweet in his lower-left hand is a particularly archaic feature.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; A more primitive statue in one of the [[Ellora Caves]] with this general form has been dated to the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;See photograph 2, "Large Ganesh", in: Pal, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Details of the other hands are difficult to make out on the statue shown. In the standard configuration, Ganesha typically holds an [[Parashu|axe]] or a [[Ankus|goad]] in one upper arm and a [[Pasha (Hinduism)|pasha]] ([[noose]]) in the other upper arm. In rare instances, he may be depicted with a human head.&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Cambodia]], see Brown, p. 10
* [[Nandrudayan Vinayaka Temple]], see {{cite news|title=Vinayaka in unique form|url=http://www.thehindu.com/fr/2003/10/10/stories/2003101001411200.htm|accessdate=30 April 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=10 October 2003}}
* [[Uthrapathiswaraswamy Temple]] see Catlin, Amy; "Vātāpi Gaṇapatim": Sculptural, Poetic, and Musical Texts in the a Hymn to Gaṇeśa" in Brown pp. 146, 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of this old constellation of iconographic elements can still be seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer in a gesture of protection or fearlessness (abhaya [[mudra]]).&lt;ref&gt;

* Pal, p. 25, For two similar statues about to be immersed.&lt;/ref&gt; The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, which is a very popular theme.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Ganesha Nurpur miniature circa 1810 Dubost p64.jpg|175px|thumb|upright|A typical four-armed form. Miniature of [[Nurpur State|Nurpur]] school (circa 1810)&lt;ref&gt;Four-armed {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}. Miniature of Nurpur school, circa 1810. Museum of Chandigarh.  For this image see: Martin-Dubost (1997), p. 64, which describes it as follows: "On a terrace leaning against a thick white bolster, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} is seated on a bed of pink lotus petals arranged on a low seat to the back of which is fixed a parasol. The elephant-faced god, with his body entirely red, is dressed in a yellow [[dhoti]] and a yellow scarf fringed with blue. Two white mice decorated with a pretty golden necklace salute {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} by joining their tiny feet together. {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} counts on his rosary in his lower right hand; his two upper hands brandish an axe and an elephant goad; his fourth hand holds the broken left tusk."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ganesha has been represented with the head of an elephant since the early stages of his appearance in Indian art.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Puranic myths provide many explanations for how he got his elephant head.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his popular forms, ''[[Heramba|Heramba-Ganapati]]'', has five elephant heads, and other less-common variations in the number of heads are known.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; While some texts say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head, he acquires the head later in most stories.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recurrent motif in these stories is that Ganesha was created by [[Parvati]] using clay to protect her and [[Shiva]] beheaded him when Ganesha came between Shiva and [[Parvati]]. Shiva then replaced Ganesha's original head with that of an elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Details of the battle and where the replacement head came from varying from source to source.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Another story says that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva's laughter. Because Shiva considered Ganesha too alluring, he gave him the head of an elephant and a protruding belly.&lt;ref&gt;For creation of Ganesha from Shiva's laughter and subsequent curse by Shiva, see ''Varaha Purana'' 23.17 as cited in Brown: p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha's earliest name was ''Ekadanta'' (One Tusked), referring to his single whole tusk, the other being broken.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 1}} Some of the earliest images of Ganesha show him holding his broken tusk.&lt;ref&gt;Heras, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this distinctive feature is reflected in the ''[[Mudgala Purana]]'', which states that the name of Ganesha's second [[incarnation]] is Ekadanta.&lt;ref&gt;Granoff, Phyllis. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} as Metaphor". Brown, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha's protruding belly appears as a distinctive attribute in his earliest statuary, which dates to the Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries).&lt;ref&gt;"Ganesha in Indian Plastic Art" and ''Passim''. Nagar, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is so important that according to the ''Mudgala Purana'', two different incarnations of Ganesha use names based on it: ''Lambodara'' (Pot Belly, or, literally, Hanging Belly) and ''Mahodara'' (Great Belly).&lt;ref&gt;Granoff, Phyllis. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} as Metaphor". Brown, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both names are Sanskrit compounds describing his belly (IAST: ''{{IAST|udara}}'').&lt;ref&gt;For translation of ''udara'' as "belly" see: Apte, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmanda Purana'' says that Ganesha has the name Lambodara because all the universes (i.e., [[World egg|cosmic eggs]]; IAST: ''{{IAST|brahmāṇḍas}}'') of the past, present, and future are present in him.&lt;ref&gt;
* ''Br. P.'' 2.3.42.34
* Thapan, p. 200, For a description of how a variant of this story is used in the ''Mudgala Purana'' 2.56.38–9&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Ganesha's arms varies; his best-known forms have between two and sixteen arms.&lt;ref&gt;For an iconographic chart showing number of arms and attributes classified by source and named form, see: Nagar, pp. 191–195. Appendix I.&lt;/ref&gt; Many depictions of Ganesha feature four arms, which is mentioned in Puranic sources and codified as a standard form in some iconographic texts.&lt;ref&gt;For history and prevalence of forms with various arms and the four-armed form as one of the standard types see: {{Harvnb|Krishan|1999|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His earliest images had two arms.&lt;ref&gt;

Jain depictions of Ganesha show his vahana variously as a mouse, elephant, tortoise, ram, or peacock.&lt;ref&gt;

Ganesha is often shown riding on or attended by a [[mouse]], [[shrew]] or [[rat]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Nagar. Preface.
* Martin-Dubost, pp. 231–244.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin-Dubost says that the rat began to appear as the principal vehicle in sculptures of Ganesha in central and western India during the 7th century; the rat was always placed close to his feet.&lt;ref&gt;See note on figure 43 in: Martin-Dubost, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The mouse as a mount first appears in written sources in the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' and later in the ''Brahmananda Purana'' and ''Ganesha Purana'', where Ganesha uses it as his vehicle in his last incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Citations to ''Matsya Purana'' 260.54, ''Brahmananda Purana Lalitamahatmya'' XXVII, and ''Ganesha Purana'' 2.134–136 are provided by: Martin-Dubost, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ganapati Atharvashirsa]] includes a meditation verse on Ganesha that describes the mouse appearing on his flag.&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dubost, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The names ''{{IAST|Mūṣakavāhana}}'' (mouse-mount) and ''{{IAST|Ākhuketana}}'' (rat-banner) appear in the ''[[Ganesha Sahasranama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For {{IAST|Mūṣakavāhana}} see v. 6. For Ākhuketana see v. 67. In: ''{{IAST|Gaṇeśasahasranāmastotram: mūla evaṁ srībhāskararāyakṛta ‘khadyota’ vārtika sahita}}''. ({{IAST|Prācya Prakāśana: Vārāṇasī}}, 1991). Source text with a commentary by {{IAST|Bhāskararāya}} in Sanskrit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouse is interpreted in several ways. According to Grimes, "Many, if not most of those who interpret {{IAST|Gaṇapati}}'s mouse, do so negatively; it symbolizes ''[[Tamas (philosophy)|{{IAST|tamoguṇa}}]]'' as well as desire".&lt;ref&gt;For a review of different interpretations, and quotation, see: Grimes (1995), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along these lines, Michael Wilcockson says it symbolizes those who wish to overcome desires and be less selfish.&lt;ref&gt;''A Student's Guide to AS Religious Studies for the OCR Specification,'' by Michael Wilcockson, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Krishan notes that the rat is destructive and a menace to crops.  The Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|mūṣaka}}'' (mouse) is derived from the root ''{{IAST|mūṣ}}'' (stealing, robbing).  It was essential to subdue the rat as a destructive pest, a type of ''vighna'' (impediment) that needed to be overcome.  According to this theory, showing Ganesha as master of the rat demonstrates his function as ''Vigneshvara'' (Lord of Obstacles) and gives evidence of his possible role as a folk ''grāma-devatā'' (village deity) who later rose to greater prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin-Dubost notes a view that the rat is a symbol suggesting that Ganesha, like the rat, penetrates even the most secret places.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Removal of obstacles ===
Ganesha is ''Vighneshvara'' (''Vighnaraja,'' [[Marathi language|Marathi]] – ''Vighnaharta)'', the Lord of Obstacles, both of a material and spiritual order.&lt;ref&gt;"Lord of Removal of Obstacles", a common name, appears in the title of Courtright's ''{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings''. For equivalent Sanskrit names ''Vighneśvara'' and ''Vighnarāja'', see: Courtright, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; He is popularly worshipped as a remover of obstacles, though traditionally he also places obstacles in the path of those who need to be checked. Paul Courtright says that Ganesha's ''dharma'' and his raison d'etre is to create and remove obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;Courtright, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishan notes that some of Ganesha's names reflect shadings of multiple roles that have evolved over time.&lt;ref name="Krishanvii"/&gt; Dhavalikar ascribes the quick ascension of Ganesha in the Hindu pantheon, and the emergence of the {{IAST|Ganapatyas}}, to this shift in emphasis from ''{{IAST|vighnakartā}}'' (obstacle-creator) to ''{{IAST|vighnahartā}}'' (obstacle-averter).&lt;ref&gt;For Dhavilkar's views on Ganesha's shifting role, see Dhavalikar, M.K. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: Myth and reality" in {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both functions continue to be vital to his character.&lt;!-- , as Robert Brown explains, "even after the [[Template:IAST|{{IAST|Purāṇic Gaṇeśa}}]] is well-defined, in art [[Template:IAST|{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}]] remained predominantly important for his dual role as creator and remover of obstacles, thus having both a negative and a positive aspect". --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhi (Knowledge) ===
Ganesha is considered to be the Lord of letters and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Sanskrit, the word ''[[buddhi]]'' is a feminine noun that is variously translated as intelligence, wisdom, or intellect.{{Sfn|Apte|1965|p= 703}}  The concept of buddhi is closely associated with the personality of Ganesha, especially in the Puranic period, when many stories stress his cleverness and love of intelligence.  One of Ganesha's names in the ''[[Ganesha Purana]]'' and the ''[[Ganesha Sahasranama]]'' is ''Buddhipriya''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ganesha Purana'' I.46, v. 5 of the Ganesha Sahasranama section in GP-1993, Sharma edition. It appears in verse 10 of the version as given in the Bhaskararaya commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; This name also appears in a list of 21 names at the end of the ''Ganesha Sahasranama'' that Ganesha says are especially important.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma edition, GP-1993 I.46, verses 204–206. The Bailey edition uses a variant text, and where Sharma reads ''Buddhipriya'', Bailey translates ''Granter-of-lakhs.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''priya'' can mean "fond of", and in a marital context it can mean "lover" or "husband",&lt;ref&gt;Practical Sanskrit Dictionary By [[Arthur Anthony McDonell]]; p. 187 (''priya''); Published 2004; [[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publ; {{ISBN|8120820002}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the name may mean either "Fond of Intelligence" or "Buddhi's Husband".&lt;ref&gt;Krishan 1999; pp. 60–70 discusses Ganesha as "Buddhi's Husband".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Om ===
[[File:Ganesha asianartmuseumsf.jpg|thumb|upright|175px|Ganesha, Chola period, early 13th century.]]
Ganesha is identified with the Hindu [[mantra]] [[Om]], also spelled ''Aum''.  The term ''{{IAST|oṃkārasvarūpa}}'' (Om is his form), when identified with Ganesha, refers to the notion that he personifies the primal sound.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ganapati Atharvashirsa]]'' attests to this association. Chinmayananda translates the relevant passage as follows:{{Sfn|Chinmayananda|1987|p= 127, In Chinmayananda's numbering system, this is ''upamantra'' 8.}}

{{quote|(O Lord Ganapati!) You are (the Trimurti) [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva|Mahesa]]. You are [[Indra]]. You are fire &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Agni]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and air &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Vayu|{{IAST|Vāyu}}]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. You are the sun &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Surya|{{IAST|Sūrya}}]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the moon &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Chandra]]ma&lt;nowiki&gt;].&lt;/nowiki&gt; You are [[Brahman]]. You are (the three worlds) Bhuloka [earth], Antariksha-loka [space], and [[Swarga]]loka [heaven]. You are Om. (That is to say, You are all this).}}

Some devotees see similarities between the shape of Ganesha's body in iconography and the shape of Om in the [[Devanagari|Devanāgarī]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] scripts.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of both, see: Grimes, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First chakra ===
According to [[Kundalini yoga]], Ganesha resides in the first [[chakra]], called [[Muladhara]] ({{IAST|mūlādhāra}}). ''Mula'' means "original, main"; ''adhara'' means "base, foundation". The muladhara chakra is the principle on which the manifestation or outward expansion of primordial Divine Force rests.&lt;ref name="T83"&gt;Tantra Unveiled: Seducing the Forces of Matter &amp; Spirit By Rajmani Tigunait; Contributor Deborah Willoughby; Published 1999; Himalayan Institute Press; p. 83; {{ISBN|0893891584}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association is also attested to in the ''Ganapati Atharvashirsa''. Courtright translates this passage as follows: "You continually dwell in the [[sacral plexus]] at the base of the spine [{{IAST|mūlādhāra cakra}}]."&lt;ref name=courtright&gt;Translation. Courtright, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ganesha has a permanent abode in every being at the Muladhara.{{Sfn|Chinmayananda|1987|p= 127, In Chinmayananda's numbering system this is part of ''upamantra'' 7. 'You have a permanent abode (in every being) at the place called "Muladhara"'.}} Ganesha holds, supports and guides all other chakras, thereby "governing the forces that propel the [[wheel of life]]".&lt;ref name="T83" /&gt;

Allahabad Museum, New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;This work is reproduced and described in Martin-Dubost (1997), p. 51, which describes it as follows: "This square shaped miniature shows us in a Himalayan landscape the god {{IAST|Śiva}} sweetly pouring water from his {{IAST|kamaṇḍalu}} on the head of baby {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}. Seated comfortably on the meadow, {{IAST|Pārvatī}} balances with her left hand the baby {{IAST|Gaņeśa}} with four arms with a red body and naked, adorned only with jewels, tiny anklets and a golden chain around his stomach, a necklace of pearls, bracelets and armlets."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Though Ganesha is popularly held to be the son of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]], the [[Puranas|Puranic]] myths give different versions about his birth.&lt;ref&gt;
* Nagar, pp. 7–14. For a summary of Puranic variants of birth stories.
* Martin-Dubost, pp. 41–82. Chapter 2, "Stories of Birth According to the {{IAST|Purāṇas}}".&lt;/ref&gt; In some he was created by Parvati,&lt;ref&gt;''Shiva Purana'' IV. 17.47–57. ''Matsya Purana'' 154.547.&lt;/ref&gt;  in another he was created by Shiva ''and'' Parvati,&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Varāha}} Purana'' 23.18–59.&lt;/ref&gt; in another he appeared mysteriously and was discovered by Shiva and Parvati&lt;ref&gt;For summary of ''Brahmavaivarta Purana, Ganesha Khanda'', 10.8–37, see: Nagar, pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; or he was born from the elephant headed goddess Malini after she drank Parvati's bath water that had been thrown in the river.&lt;ref name="Melton2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Melton|first=J.

The family includes his brother, the god of war, [[Kartikeya]], who is also called Skanda and Murugan.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of variant names for Skanda, see: Thapan, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional differences dictate the order of their births.  In northern India, Skanda is generally said to be the elder, while in the south, Ganesha is considered the firstborn.&lt;ref&gt;Khokar and Saraswati, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North India|northern India]], Skanda was an important martial deity from about 500 BCE to about 600 CE, after which worship of him declined significantly. As Skanda fell, Ganesha rose. Several stories tell of sibling rivalry between the brothers&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 4, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; and may reflect sectarian tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha's marital status, the subject of considerable scholarly review, varies widely in mythological stories.&lt;ref name="lawrence_cohen"&gt;For a review, see: Cohen, Lawrence. "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}". Brown, pp. 115–140&lt;/ref&gt;One pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried ''[[Brahmacharya|brahmachari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;  
* {{Harvnb|Getty|1936|p=33}}. "According to ancient tradition, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} was a {{IAST|Brahmacārin}}, that is, an unmarried deity; but legend gave him two consorts, personifications of Wisdom (Buddhi) and Success (Siddhi)."
* {{Harvnb|Krishan|1999|p=63}}. "... in the ''{{IAST|smārta}}'' or orthodox traditional religious beliefs, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} is a bachelor or ''{{IAST|brahmacārī}}''"&lt;/ref&gt; This view is common in southern India and parts of northern India.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion on celibacy of Ganesha, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=126–129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another popularly-accepted mainstream pattern associates him with the concepts of ''Buddhi'' (intellect), ''Siddhi'' (spiritual power), and ''Riddhi'' (prosperity); these qualities are personified as goddesses, said to be Ganesha's wives.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of associations with Buddhi, Siddhi, Riddhi, and other figures, and the statement "In short the spouses of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} are the personifications of his powers, manifesting his functional features...", see: {{Harvnb|Krishan|1999|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also may be shown with a single consort or a nameless servant (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|daşi}}'').&lt;ref&gt;For single consort or a nameless ''{{IAST|daşi}}'' (servant), see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts, [[Sarasvati]] or {{IAST|Śarda}} (particularly in [[Maharashtra]]).&lt;ref&gt;For associations with Śarda and [[Sarasvati]] and the identification of those goddesses with one another, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=131–132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also associated with the goddess of luck and prosperity, [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;For associations with Lakshmi see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=132–135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another pattern, mainly prevalent in the [[Bengal]] region, links Ganesha with the banana tree, [[Kala Bo]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the Kala Bou, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=124–125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Shiva Purana]]'' says that Ganesha had begotten two sons: {{IAST|Kşema}} (prosperity) and {{IAST|Lābha}} (profit). In northern Indian variants of this story, the sons are often said to be {{IAST|Śubha}} (auspiciouness) and {{IAST|Lābha}}.&lt;ref&gt;For statement regarding sons, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 [[Hindi film]] ''[[Jai Santoshi Maa]]'' shows Ganesha married to Riddhi and Siddhi and having a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Ma]], the goddess of satisfaction. This story has no Puranic basis, but Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen cite Santoshi Ma's cult as evidence of Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.&lt;ref&gt;

== Worship and festivals ==
[[File:Ganesh Paris 2004 DSC08471.JPG|thumb|Celebrations of Ganesha by the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] community in [[Paris]], [[France]]]]

Ganesha is worshipped on many religious and secular occasions, especially at the beginning of ventures such as buying a vehicle or starting a business.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; K.N. Somayaji says, "there can hardly be a [Hindu] home [in India] which does not house an idol of Ganapati.&amp;nbsp;... Ganapati, being the most popular deity in India, is worshipped by almost all castes and in all parts of the country".&lt;ref&gt;K.N. Somayaji, ''Concept of Ganesha'', p. 1 as quoted in Krishan, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Devotees believe that if Ganesha is propitiated, he grants success, prosperity and protection against adversity.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha is a non-sectarian deity. Hindus of all denominations invoke him at the beginning of prayers, important undertakings, and religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;For worship of Ganesha by "followers of all sects and denominations, Saivites, Vaisnavites, Buddhists, and Jainas" see {{Harvnb|Krishan|1981–1982|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancers and musicians, particularly in southern India, begin art performances such as the [[Bharatnatyam]] dance with a prayer to Ganesha.&lt;ref name="Nagar, Preface"/&gt;  [[Mantra]]s such as ''Om Shri {{IAST|Gaṇeshāya}} Namah'' (Om, salutation to the Illustrious Ganesha) are often used. One of the most famous mantras associated with Ganesha is ''Om {{IAST|Gaṃ}} Ganapataye Namah'' (Om, {{IAST|Gaṃ}}, Salutation to the Lord of Hosts).&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees offer Ganesha sweets such as [[modak]]a and small sweet balls called [[laddu]]s.&lt;ref&gt; The term ''modaka'' applies to all regional varieties of cakes or sweets offered to Ganesha. Martin-Dubost, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; He is often shown carrying a bowl of sweets, called a ''{{IAST|modakapātra}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dubost, p.  204.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his identification with the color red, he is often worshipped with [[red sandalwood]] paste ({{IAST|raktachandana}})&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dubost, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; or red flowers. {{IAST|Dūrvā}} grass (''[[Cynodon dactylon]]'') and other materials are also used in his worship.&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dubost, pp. 95–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Festivals associated with Ganesh are Ganesh Chaturthi or Vināyaka chaturthī in the ''[[paksha|{{IAST|śuklapakṣa}}]]'' (the fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of ''[[Bhadrapada]]'' (August/September) and the [[Ganesh Jayanti]] (Ganesha's birthday) celebrated on the ''cathurthī'' of the ''{{IAST|śuklapakṣa}}'' (fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of ''[[Maagha|magha]]'' (January/February)."&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ganesha Chaturthi ===

[[File:Ganesh mimarjanam EDITED.jpg|thumb|175px|upright|Street festivities in [[Hyderabad, India]] during the festival of Ganesha Chaturthi]]

An annual festival honours Ganesha for ten days, starting on [[Ganesha Chaturthi]], which typically falls in late August or early September.&lt;ref&gt;For the fourth waxing day in {{IAST|Māgha}} being dedicated to Ganesa ({{IAST|Gaṇeśa-caturthī}}) see: Bhattacharyya, B., "Festivals and Sacred Days", in: Bhattacharyya, volume IV, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival begins with people bringing in clay idols of Ganesha, symbolising the god's visit. The festival culminates on the day of [[Ananta Chaturdashi]], when the idols (''[[murti]]s'') are immersed in the most convenient body of water.&lt;ref&gt;''The Experience of Hinduism: Essays on Religion in Maharashtra''; Edited By Eleanor Zelliot, Maxine Berntsen, pp. 76–94 ("The Ganesh Festival in Maharashtra: Some Observations" by Paul B. Courtright); 1988; SUNY Press; {{ISBN|088706664X}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- while the people shout "Ganapati Bappa Morya" (Ganesha come back soon next year). --&gt; Some families have a tradition of immersion on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 7th day. In 1893, [[Lokmanya Tilak]] transformed this annual Ganesha festival from private family celebrations into a grand public event.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf and Metcalf, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; He did so "to bridge the gap between the [[Brahmins]] and the non-Brahmins and find an appropriate context in which to build a new grassroots unity between them" in his nationalistic strivings against the British in [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Brown (1992), p. 9.
* Thapan, p. 225. For Tilak's role in converting the private family festivals to a public event in support of [[Indian nationalism]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of Ganesha's wide appeal as "the god for Everyman", Tilak chose him as a rallying point for Indian protest against British rule.&lt;ref&gt;
* Momin, A.R., ''The Legacy of G.S. Ghurye: A Centennial Festschrift'', p. 95.
* Brown (1991), p. 9. For Ganesha's appeal as "the god for Everyman" as a motivation for Tilak.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilak was the first to install large public images of Ganesha in [[Pandal|pavilions]], and he established the practice of submerging all the public images on the tenth day.&lt;ref&gt;For Tilak as the first to use large public images in ''{{IAST|maṇḍapas}}'' (pavilions or tents) see: Thapan, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, Hindus across India celebrate the Ganapati festival with great fervour, though it is most popular in the state of Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;For Ganesh Chaturthi as the most popular festival in Maharashtra, see: Thapan, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} in a Regional Setting". Courtright, pp. 202–247.&lt;/ref&gt;  The festival also assumes huge proportions in [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]], and in the surrounding belt of Ashtavinayaka temples.

=== Temples ===
{{further information|List of Ganapati temples|Ashtavinayak}}
[[File:Morgaon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Morgaon temple, the chief Ashtavinyak temple]]
In Hindu temples, Ganesha is depicted in various ways: as a subordinate deity (''{{IAST|pãrśva-devatã}}''); as a deity related to the principal deity (''{{IAST|parivāra-devatã}}''); or as the principal deity of the temple ({{IAST|pradhāna}}).&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; As the god of transitions, he is placed at the doorway of many Hindu temples to keep out the unworthy, which is analogous to his role as Parvati’s doorkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several shrines are dedicated to Ganesha himself, of which the Ashtavinayak (Sanskrit: अष्टविनायक; {{IAST|aṣṭavināyaka}}; lit. "eight Ganesha (shrines)") in Maharashtra are particularly well known. Located within a 100-kilometer radius of the city of [[Pune]], each of the eight shrines celebrates a particular form of Ganapati, complete with its own lore.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, pp. 110–112&lt;/ref&gt; The eight shrines are: [[Morgaon Ganesha Temple|Morgaon]], [[Siddhivinayak Temple, Siddhatek|Siddhatek]], [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]], [[Varadvinayak|Mahad]], [[Chintamani Temple, Theur|Theur]], [[Lenyadri]],  [[Vigneshwara Temple, Ozar|Ozar]] and [[Ranjangaon Ganpati|Ranjangaon]].

There are many other important Ganesha temples at the following locations: [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]] in Maharashtra; [[Chintaman Ganesh temple, Ujjain|
Ujjain]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]]; [[Jodhpur]], [[Nagaur]] and Raipur ([[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]]) in [[Rajasthan]]; Baidyanath in [[Bihar]]; [[Baroda]], Dholaka, and [[Valsad]] in [[Gujarat]] and Dhundiraj Temple in [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Prominent Ganesha temples in southern India include the following: the [[Rockfort Ucchi Pillayar Temple]] at [[Tiruchirapalli]] in [[Tamil Nadu]]; [[Kottarakkara Sree Mahaganapathi Kshethram|Kottarakkara]], [[Trivandrum|Pazhavangadi]], [[Madhur Temple|Kasargod]] in [[Kerala]]; [[Hampi]], and [[Ganesha Temple, Idagunji|Idagunji]] in [[Karnataka]]; and [[Bhadrachalam]] in [[Telangana]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;.

T. A. Gopinatha notes, "Every village however small has its own image of ''{{IAST|Vighneśvara}}'' (Vigneshvara) with or without a temple to house it in. At entrances of villages and forts, below ''{{IAST|pīpaḹa}}'' ([[Sacred fig]])  trees&amp;nbsp;... in a niche&amp;nbsp;... in temples of ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'' (Vishnu) as well as ''{{IAST|Śiva}}'' (Shiva) and also in separate shrines specially constructed in ''{{IAST|Śiva}}'' temples&amp;nbsp;... the figure of ''{{IAST|Vighneśvara}}'' is invariably seen."&lt;ref&gt;T.A. Gopinatha; ''Elements of Hindu Iconography'', pp. 47–48 as quoted in Krishan, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha temples have also been built outside of India, including [[Southeast Asia]], [[Nepal]] (including the four ''Vinayaka'' shrines in the [[Kathmandu valley]]),&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 147–158&lt;/ref&gt; and in several western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/tslesganesheng.html|title=Ganesha Temples worldwide|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217044207/http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/tslesganesheng.html|archivedate=17 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha appeared in his classic form as a clearly-recognizable deity with well-defined iconographic attributes in the early 4th to 5th centuries CE.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=19–21, chapter by AK Narain}} Some of the earliest known Ganesha images include two images found in eastern Afghanistan.

It is dated to the 4th-century.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=50–55, 120}} The second image found in [[Gardez]] has an inscription on Ganesha pedestal that has helped date it to the 5th-century.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=50–55, 120}} Another Ganesha sculpture is embedded in the walls of Cave 6 of the [[Udayagiri Caves]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]].

{{quote|What is inscrutable is the somewhat dramatic appearance of Gaṇeśa on the historical scene. His antecedents are not clear. His wide acceptance and popularity, which transcend sectarian and territorial limits, are indeed amazing. On the one hand, there is the pious belief of the orthodox devotees in Gaṇeśa's Vedic origins and in the {{IAST|Purāṇic}} explanations contained in the confusing, but nonetheless interesting, mythology. On the other hand, there are doubts about the existence of the idea and the icon of ''this'' deity" before the fourth to fifth century A.D. ... [I]n my opinion, indeed there is no convincing evidence [in ancient Brahmanic literature] of the existence of this divinity prior to the fifth century.}}

The evidence for more ancient Ganesha, suggests Narain, may reside outside Brahmanic or Sanskritic traditions, or outside geocultural boundaries of India.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=19–21, chapter by AK Narain}} Ganesha appears in [[China]] by the 6th century, states Brown,{{Sfn|Brown|1991|p=2}} and his artistic images in temple setting as "remover of obstacles" in South Asia appear by about 400 CE.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|p=8}} He is, states Bailey, recognized as goddess Parvati's son and integrated into [[Shaivism]] theology by early centuries of the common era.{{Sfn|Bailey|1995|p=ix}}

{{quote|In this search for a historical origin for Gaṇeśa, some have suggested precise locations outside the {{IAST|Brāhmaṇic}} tradition.... These historical locations are intriguing to be sure, but the fact remains that they are all speculations, variations on the Dravidian hypothesis, which argues that anything not attested to in the Vedic and Indo-European sources must have come into {{IAST|Brāhmaṇic}} religion from the Dravidian or aboriginal populations of India as part of the process that produced Hinduism out of the interactions of the Aryan and non-Aryan populations.  There is no independent evidence for an elephant cult or a totem; nor is there any archaeological data pointing to a tradition prior to what we can already see in place in the {{IAST|Purāṇic}} literature and the iconography of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}.}}

Thapan's book on the development of Ganesha devotes a chapter to speculations about the role elephants had in early India but concludes that "although by the second century CE the elephant-headed ''{{IAST|yakṣa}}'' form exists it cannot be presumed to represent {{IAST|Gaṇapati-Vināyaka}}. There is no evidence of a deity by this name having an elephant or elephant-headed form at this early stage.  {{IAST|Gaṇapati-Vināyaka}} had yet to make his debut."&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

These names are suggestive of Ganesha, and the 14th century commentator [[Sayana]] explicitly establishes this identification.&lt;ref&gt;For text of ''{{IAST|Maitrāyaṇīya Saṃhitā}}'' 2.9.1 and ''{{IAST|Taittirīya Āraṇyaka}}'' 10.1 and identification by {{IAST|Sāyaṇa}} in his commentary on the {{IAST|āraṇyaka}}, see: Rocher, Ludo, "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}'s Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature" in {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The description of Dantin, possessing a twisted trunk ({{IAST|vakratuṇḍa}}) and holding a corn-sheaf, a sugar cane,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajarajan|first=R.K.K.|year=2001|title=Sugarcane Gaṇapati|url=https://www.academia.edu/2378055/Sugarcane_Ganapati|journal=East and West, Rome|volume=51.3/4|pages=379–84|via=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/29757520?Search=yes&amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;searchText=Sugarcane&amp;searchText=Ganapati&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fgroup%3Dnone%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3BQuery%3DSugarcane%2BGanapati%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff JSTOR]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201041014/http://www.academia.edu/2378055/Sugarcane_Ganapati|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a club,&lt;ref&gt;Taittiriya Aranyaka, X, 1, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; is so characteristic of the Puranic Ganapati that Heras says "we cannot resist to accept his full identification with this Vedic Dantin".&lt;ref&gt;Heras, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Krishan considers these hymns to be post-Vedic additions.&lt;ref&gt;

Ganesha does not appear in the [[Indian epic]] literature that is dated to the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic period]].  A late interpolation to the epic poem ''[[Mahabharata]]'' says that the sage [[Vyasa]] ({{IAST|Vyāsa}}) asked Ganesha to serve as his scribe to transcribe the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed but only on condition that Vyasa recites the poem uninterrupted, that is, without pausing. The sage agreed but found that to get any rest he needed to recite very complex passages so Ganesha would have to ask for clarifications. The story is not accepted as part of the original text by the editors of the critical edition of the ''Mahabharata'',&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo "Ganesa's Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature". Brown, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the twenty-line story is relegated to a footnote in an appendix.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Mahābhārata}}'' Vol. 1 Part 2.

Brown dates the story to the 8th century, and [[Moriz Winternitz]] concludes that it was known as early as c. 900, but it was not added to the ''Mahabharata'' some 150 years later.

Stories about Ganesha often occur in the [[Puranas|Puranic]] corpus. Brown notes while the Puranas "defy precise chronological ordering", the more detailed narratives of Ganesha's life are in the late texts, c. 600–1300.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj Krishan says that the Puranic myths about the birth of Ganesha and how he acquired an elephant's head are in the later Puranas, which were composed of c. 600 onwards. He elaborates on the matter to say that references to Ganesha in the earlier Puranas, such as the Vayu and Brahmanda Puranas, are later interpolations made during the 7th to 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his survey of Ganesha's rise to prominence in [[Sanskrit literature]], Ludo Rocher notes that:&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}'s Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature". Brown, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Above all, one cannot help being struck by the fact that the numerous stories surrounding {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} concentrate on an unexpectedly limited number of incidents.  These incidents are mainly three: his birth and parenthood, his elephant head, and his single tusk.  Other incidents are touched on in the texts, but to a far lesser extent.}}

Ganesha's rise to prominence was codified in the 9th century when he was formally included as one of the five primary deities of [[Smartism]].  The 9th-century philosopher [[Adi Shankara]] popularized the "worship of the five forms" ([[Panchayatana puja]]) system among orthodox Brahmins of the Smarta tradition.&lt;ref&gt;

For the "five" divinities (''{{IAST|pañcādevatā}}'') becoming "the major deities" in general, and their listing as Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Surya, and Ganesha.&lt;/ref&gt;  This worship practice invokes the five deities Ganesha, [[Vishnu]], Shiva, [[Devi]], and [[Surya]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Grimes, p. 162.
* Pal, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Adi Shankara instituted the tradition primarily to unite the principal deities of these five major sects on an equal status.  This formalized the role of Ganesha as a complementary deity.

[[File:Prambanan-ganesha.jpg|thumb|upright|175px|Ganesha statue in 9th century [[Prambanan]] temple, Java, Indonesia]]
Once Ganesha was accepted as one of the five principal deities of [[Brahminical Hinduism|Brahmanism]], some [[Brahmin]]s chose Ganesha as their principal deity. They developed the [[Ganapatya]] tradition, as seen in the ''Ganesha Purana'' and the ''Mudgala Purana''.&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, pp. 196–197. Addresses the {{IAST|pañcāyatana}} in the {{IAST|Smārta}} tradition and the relationship of the ''Ganesha Purana'' and the ''Mudgala Purana'' to it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of composition for the ''Ganesha Purana'' and the ''Mudgala Purana''—and their dating relative to one another—has sparked academic debate. Both works were developed over time and contain age-layered strata. Anita Thapan reviews comment about dating and provide her own judgment. "It seems likely that the core of the Ganesha Purana appeared around the twelfth and thirteenth centuries", she says, "but was later interpolated."&lt;ref&gt;For a review of major differences of opinions between scholars on dating, see: Thapan, pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence W. Preston considers the most reasonable date for the ''Ganesha Purana'' to be between 1100 and 1400, which coincides with the apparent age of the sacred sites mentioned by the text.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Lawrence W.,  "Subregional Religious Centers in the History of Maharashtra: The Sites Sacred to {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: N.K. Wagle, ed., ''Images of Maharashtra: A Regional Profile of India''. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

R.C. Hazra suggests that the ''Mudgala Purana'' is older than the ''Ganesha Purana'', which he dates between 1100 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Hazra, "The {{IAST|Gaṇeśa Purāṇa}}", ''Journal of the Ganganatha Jha Research Institute'' (1951); 79–99.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Phyllis Granoff finds problems with this relative dating and concludes that the ''Mudgala Purana'' was the last of the philosophical texts concerned with Ganesha. She bases her reasoning on the fact that, among other internal evidence, the ''Mudgala Purana'' specifically mentions the ''Ganesha Purana'' as one of the four Puranas (the ''Brahma'', the ''Brahmanda'', the ''Ganesha'', and the ''Mudgala'' Puranas) which deal at length with Ganesha.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Granoff, "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} as Metaphor", in Brown, pp. 94–95, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While the kernel of the text must be old, it was interpolated until the 17th and 18th centuries as the worship of Ganapati became more important in certain regions.&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Another highly regarded scripture, the Ganapati Atharvashirsa, was probably composed during the 16th or 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Courtright, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ganesha Sahasranama]]'' is part of the Puranic literature, and is a litany of a thousand names and attributes of Ganesha. Each name in the [[sahasranama]] conveys a different meaning and symbolises a different aspect of Ganesha. Versions of the Ganesha Sahasranama are found in the ''[[Ganesha Purana]]''.{{Sfn|Bailey|1995|pp=258–269}}

One of the most important Sanskrit texts, that enjoys authority in ''Ganapatya'' tradition states John Grimes, is the ''Ganapati Atharvashirsa''.{{Sfn|Grimes|1995|pp=21–22}}

Commercial and cultural contacts extended India's influence in Western and Southeast Asia. Ganesha is one of a number of Hindu deities who consequently reached foreign lands.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha was particularly worshipped by traders and merchants, who went out of India for commercial ventures.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; From approximately the 10th century onwards, new networks of exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation. During this time, Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders.&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity is associated with the merchant community.&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus migrated to [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and took their culture, including Ganesha, with them.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 55}}  Statues of Ganesha are found throughout the region, often beside Shiva sanctuaries.  The forms of Ganesha found in the Hindu art of [[Java]], [[Bali]], and [[Borneo]] show specific regional influences.&lt;ref&gt;Getty, pp. 55–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  The spread of Hindu culture throughout Southeast Asia established Ganesha worship in modified forms in Burma, Cambodia, and Thailand. In [[Indochina]], Hinduism and [[Buddhism]] were practiced side by side, and mutual influences can be seen in the iconography of Ganesha in the region.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 52}}  In Thailand, Cambodia, and among the Hindu classes of the [[Cham (Asia)|Chams]] in Vietnam, Ganesha was mainly thought of as a remover of obstacles.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Today in Buddhist Thailand, Ganesha is regarded as a remover of obstacles, the god of success.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Before the arrival of [[Islam]], Afghanistan had close cultural ties with India, and the adoration of both Hindu and Buddhist deities was practiced. Examples of sculptures from the 5th to the 7th centuries have survived, suggesting that the worship of Ganesha was then in vogue in the region.&lt;ref&gt;
* Nagar, p. 175.
* Martin-Dubost, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha appears in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, not only in the form of the Buddhist god {{IAST|Vināyaka}}, but also as a Hindu demon form with the same name.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|pp= 37–45}}  His image appears in Buddhist sculptures during the late Gupta period.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 37}}  As the Buddhist god {{IAST|Vināyaka}}, he is often shown dancing.

* Getty, p. 42
* Nagar, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Other depictions show him as the Destroyer of Obstacles, and sometimes dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha appears in China and Japan in forms that show distinct regional character. In [[North China|northern China]], the earliest known stone statue of Ganesha carries an inscription dated to 531.&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dubost, p.  311.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, where Ganesha is known as [[Kangiten]], the Ganesha cult was first mentioned in 806.&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dubost, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palacio de '''Generalife''' ({{IPA-es|xe.ne.ɾa.ˈli.fe}}; {{lang-ar|جَنَّة الْعَرِيف}} ''Jannat al-‘Arīf'', literally, "Architect's Garden") was the summer [[palace]] and country estate of the [[Nasrid]] rulers of the [[Emirate of Granada]] in [[Al-Andalus]], now beside the city of [[Granada]] in the [[autonomous community]] of [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]].

==History==
The palace and gardens were built during the reign of [[Muhammad II of Granada|Muhammed II]] (1273-1302), Sultan of Granada, and later by [[Muhammed III]] (1302–1309). They were redecorated shortly after by [[Ismail I, Sultan of Granada|Abu I-Walid Isma'il]] (1313–1324). Much of the garden is a recent reconstruction of dubious authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4NPAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT908 |title=Gardens and Landscapes in Historic Building Conservation |author=Marion Harney |page=908 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Théophile Gautier]], a mid-19th century visitor, complained that:  {{Quotation|Of the Generalife nothing now remains but some arcades and some large panels of arabesques, unfortunately plastered over with layers of whitewash that have been applied again and again with all the obstinacy of a dispiriting cleanliness. Little by little the delicate sculptures and the marvellous guilloches of this fairy-like architecture have been obliterated, filled up, and engulfed. What is at present nothing more than a faintly-vermiculated wall, was formerly open lace-work as fine as those ivory leaves which the patience of the Chinese carves for fans.&lt;ref&gt;''Romantic Castles and Palaces, As Seen and Described by Famous Writers'', edited and translated by Esther Singleton; New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1901; pp. 169-173.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Design==
[[File:Generalife Palace.jpg|thumb|The Patio de la Acequia before the installation of modern fountains]]
The complex consists of the ''Patio de la Acequia'' (Court of the Water Channel or Water-Garden Courtyard), which has a long pool framed by flowerbeds, fountains, colonnades and pavilions, and the ''Jardím de la Sultana'' (Sultana's Garden or Courtyard of the Cypress). The former is thought to best preserve the style of the medieval [[Persian gardens|Persian garden]] in [[Al-Andalus]].

Originally the palace was linked to the [[Alhambra]] by a covered walkway across the ravine that now divides them. The Generalife is one of the oldest surviving [[Moors|Moorish]] gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Rosemary and Cavendish, Richard (2003). ''Wonders of the World: 100 Great Man-Made Treasures of Civilization''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., {{ISBN|1-58663-751-7}}, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
The present-day gardens were started in 1931 and completed by Francisco Prieto Moreno in 1951. The walkways are paved in traditional Granadian style with a mosaic of pebbles: white ones from the [[Darro (river)|River Darro]] and black ones from the [[Genil|River Genil]].&lt;ref&gt;Núñez, J. Agustín (Ed.). (2002). ''Muslim and Christian Granada''. Edilux. {{ISBN|84-95856-07-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Generalife is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in Granada, along with the Alhambra palace and gardens, and the [[Albayzín]] district.

'''HMS ''Endeavour''''', also known as '''HM Bark ''Endeavour''''', was a British [[Royal Navy]] research vessel that Lieutenant [[James Cook]] commanded to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] on his [[First voyage of James Cook|first voyage of discovery]] from 1768 to 1771.

She was launched in 1764 as the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Earl of Pembroke'', and the navy purchased her in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean and to explore the seas for the surmised ''[[Terra Australis]] Incognita'' or "unknown southern land". The navy renamed and commissioned her as ''His Majesty's [[Barque|Bark]] Endeavour''. She departed [[Plymouth]] in August 1768, rounded [[Cape Horn]], and reached [[Tahiti]] in time to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of [[Huahine]], [[Borabora]], and [[Raiatea]] to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, the first European vessel to reach the islands since [[Abel Tasman]]'s ''Heemskerck'' 127 years earlier.

In April 1770, ''Endeavour'' became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as [[Botany Bay]]. ''Endeavour'' then sailed north along the Australian coast. She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the [[Great Barrier Reef]], and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her. He then beached her on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies]] (now named [[Jakarta]]) for more substantial repairs, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands that they had visited. She resumed her westward journey on 26 December, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of [[Dover]] on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.

''Endeavour'' was largely forgotten after her epic voyage and spent the next three years sailing to and from the [[Falkland Islands]]. She was sold into private hands in 1775 and later renamed as ''Lord Sandwich''; she was hired as a British troop transport during the [[American War of Independence]] and was scuttled in a blockade of [[Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island]] in 1778. Her wreck has not been precisely located but is thought to be one of a cluster of five in Newport Harbor. Relics are displayed at maritime museums worldwide, including six of her cannon and an anchor. In September 2018, marine archaeologists announced that they had located what they believed to be the wreck of the ship off the coast of [[Rhode Island]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/19/wreck-of-captain-cooks-hms-endeavour-discovered-off-coast-of-america|title=Wreck of Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour 'discovered' off US coast|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 September 2018|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[HM Bark Endeavour Replica|replica of ''Endeavour'']] was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] in Sydney Harbour.  The US [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] is named after the ship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/Endeavour.html |title=John F.

==Construction==
''Endeavour'' was originally the merchant collier ''Earl of Pembroke'', built by Thomas Fishburn for Thomas Millner, launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of [[Whitby]] in [[North Yorkshire]],&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaNZ"/&gt; and of a type known locally as the ''Whitby Cat''. She was [[full rigged ship|ship-rigged]] and sturdily built with a broad, flat [[bow (ship)|bow]], a square [[stern]], and a long box-like body with a deep [[hold (ship)|hold]].&lt;ref name="Hosty41"&gt;Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

A flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be [[Beach (nautical)|beached]] for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a [[dry dock]]. Her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], internal floors, and [[Futtock shrouds|futtocks]] were built from traditional [[white oak]], her [[keel]] and [[stern post]] from [[elm]], and her masts from [[pine]] and [[fir]].&lt;ref&gt;Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans of the ship also show a double [[keelson]] to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.&lt;ref&gt;Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 33–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doubt exists about the height of her standing masts (excludes top and gallant masts&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;National Maritime Museum Greenwich Endeavour 1771 draught ZAZ6595&lt;/ref&gt;), as surviving diagrams of ''Endeavour'' depict the body of the vessel only, and not the mast plan.&lt;ref name="Marquardt"/&gt; While her main and foremast standing spars (excludes top and gallant masts&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;) are accepted to be a standard (standards differed from shipyard to shipyard and country to country&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The Seamans Vade-Mecum and defensive war by sea, William Mountaine 1761&lt;/ref&gt;) {{convert|69|and|65|ft}}, respectively from an annotation on one surviving ship plan [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594 &lt;ref&gt;National Maritime Museum Greenwich&lt;/ref&gt; which records these lengths has the mizzen as "16&amp;nbsp;yards 29&amp;nbsp;inches" ({{#expr:((16+(29/36))*0.9144)round1}}&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name="Marquardt"/&gt; If correct, this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full {{convert|9|ft|m}} shorter than the standards of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Rushton, Cooper 1711&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Edson 1985&lt;/ref&gt; late 20th century research suggested the annotation may be a transcription error and should read "19&amp;nbsp;yards&amp;nbsp;29 inches" ({{#expr:((19+(29/36))*0.9144)round1}}&amp;nbsp;m), which would more closely conform with both the naval standards (which standard?&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;) and the lengths of the other masts.&lt;ref name="Marquardt"&gt;Marquardt 1995, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent critical review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 to explain this shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst at the same time offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cook's Bark ''Endeavour'' along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark ''Endeavour'' spar measurements [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594,&lt;ref&gt;National Maritime Museum Endeavour 1771 draught ZAZ6594&lt;/ref&gt; and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10&amp;nbsp;ft above this as was sometimes done.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9&amp;nbsp;ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5&amp;nbsp;ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;) from the level of the water line. 

Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18&amp;nbsp;ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS ''Endeavour'' off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 at the top of this page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844.&lt;ref&gt;National Maritime Museum Greenwich Endeavour 1768 as fitted draught ZAZ7844&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught, it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of ''Endeavour'' support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.

The replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson, as is the model in the [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich. There is a difference between the height of the mizzen fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of ''Earl of Pembroke'' before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts.

==Purchase and refit by the Admiralty==
On 16 February 1768, the [[Royal Society]] petitioned [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the [[Admiralty]] elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (or "unknown southern land").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30&amp;nbsp;July 1768 (UK) |publisher=National Library of Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |accessdate=26 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721065703/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |archivedate=21 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer [[Alexander Dalrymple]], whose acceptance was conditional on a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] commission as a captain in the Royal Navy. [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Edward Hawke]] refused, going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman.&lt;ref name="gutenberg"&gt;{{gutenberg |no=14423 |name=A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels, Vol. 12}}, editor [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]]'s introduction footnote 3&lt;/ref&gt; In refusing Dalrymple's command, Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop {{HMS|Paramour|1694|6}} in 1698, when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Dr. [[Edmond Halley]].&lt;ref name="gutenberg"/&gt; The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed [[James Cook]], a naval officer with a background in mathematics and [[cartography]].&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, pp. 34, 46&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptable to both parties, Cook was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] and named as commander of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[longboat]], [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]] and [[yawl]] were provided as ship's boats, though the longboat was rotten and had to be rebuilt and painted with [[white lead]] before it could be brought aboard.&lt;ref name="Hough56"&gt;Hough 1994, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; These were accompanied by two privately owned skiffs, one belonging to the [[boatswain]] John Gathrey, and the other to Banks.&lt;ref&gt;Marquardt 1995, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was also equipped with a set of {{convert|28|ft|m|abbr=on}} sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or demasted.&lt;ref name="Marquardt18"/&gt; The refitted vessel was commissioned as ''His Majesty's [[Barque|Bark]] the Endeavour'', to distinguish her from the 4-gun [[Naval cutter|cutter]] {{HMS|Endeavour|1763 cutter|6}}.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaNZ"/&gt;

On 21 July 1768, ''Endeavour'' sailed to Galleon's Reach to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile Pacific island natives.&lt;ref name="Hough56"/&gt; Ten 4-pounder cannons were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed in the hold.

==Voyage of discovery==
{{main|First voyage of James Cook}}

===Outward voyage===
''Endeavour'' departed Plymouth on 26 August 1768, carrying 94&amp;nbsp;people and 18 months of provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|provisions|[c]}} Livestock on board included pigs, poultry, two greyhounds and a milking goat.&lt;ref&gt;Marquardt 1995, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The first port of call was [[Funchal]] in the [[Madeira Islands]], which ''Endeavour'' reached on 12 September. The ship was recaulked and painted, and fresh vegetables, beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage.&lt;ref name="Hough7576"&gt;Hough 1994, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; While in port, an accident cost the life of master's mate Robert Weir, who became entangled in the anchor cable and was dragged overboard when the anchor was released.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; To replace him, Cook [[shanghaiing|shanghaied]] a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby.&lt;ref name="Hough7576"/&gt;{{ref|Thurman|[d]}}

''Endeavour'' then continued south along the coast of Africa and across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to South America, arriving in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 13 November 1768. Fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for [[Cape Horn]], which she reached during stormy weather on 13 January 1769. Attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful, and ''Endeavour'' was repeatedly driven back by wind, rain and contrary tides. Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves.&lt;ref name="Beaglehole41-44"/&gt; At last, on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast&lt;!--the attached map doesn't seem to show this, although it does show a considerable trip towards Antarctica, which is not mentioned; why is this?--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Beaglehole41-44"&gt;Beaglehole 1968, pp. 41–44&lt;/ref&gt; The crew were sent to collect wood and water, while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore. On 17 January two of Banks' servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm.&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, pp. 91–97&lt;/ref&gt;

''Endeavour'' resumed her voyage on 21 January 1769,&lt;!--did they spend a month collecting plants in one spot??--&gt; heading west-northwest into warmer weather. She reached [[Tahiti]] on 10 April,&lt;ref name="Courier1878"&gt;{{cite news |last=McDermott |first=Peter Joseph |title=Pacific Exploration |work=The Brisbane Courier |page=5 |publisher=Brisbane Newspaper Company Ltd |date=6 November 1878 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1376345?searchTerm=James+Cook|accessdate=27 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she remained for the next three months. The transit of Venus across the Sun occurred on 3 June, and was observed and recorded by astronomer Charles Green from ''Endeavour'''s deck.&lt;ref name="Courier1878"/&gt;

===Pacific exploration===
The transit observed, ''Endeavour'' departed Tahiti on 13 July and headed northwest to allow Cook to survey and name the [[Society Islands]].&lt;ref name="Rigby34"&gt;Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Landfall was made at Huahine, Raiatea and Borabora, providing opportunities for Cook to claim each of them as British territories. An attempt to land the pinnace on the [[Austral Islands|Austral Island]] of [[Rurutu (Austral Islands)|Rurutu]] was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August, ''Endeavour'' finally turned south to explore the open ocean for ''Terra Australis Incognita''.&lt;ref name="Rigby34"/&gt;

In October 1769, ''Endeavour'' reached the coastline of New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to do so since [[Abel Tasman]]'s ''Heemskerck'' in 1642.&lt;ref name="Rigby34"/&gt; Unfamiliar with such ships, the [[Māori people]] at Cook's first landing point in [[Poverty Bay]] thought the ship was a floating island, or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of [[Hawaiki]].&lt;ref name="ANMM584"&gt;{{cite web |title=HMB ''Endeavour'' replica – Cook and Endeavour: Endeavour's People |publisher=Australian National Maritime Museum |year=2008 |url=http://www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=584 |accessdate=28 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080720095453/http://www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=584 |archivedate = 20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Endeavour'' spent the next six months sailing close to shore,&lt;ref name="Courier1878"/&gt; while Cook mapped the coastline and concluded that New Zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for ''Terra Australis''. In March 1770, the longboat from ''Endeavour'' carried Cook ashore to allow him to formally proclaim British sovereignty over New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Courier1878"/&gt; On his return, ''Endeavour'' resumed her voyage westward, her crew sighting the east coast of Australia on 19 April.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April, she became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of Australia, when Cook landed one of the ship's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as [[Botany Bay]], [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, pp. 168–170&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Endeavour track chart.jpg|center|thumb|600px|alt=Map: A line runs from Rio de Janeiro in South America, generally southward to Cape Horn and then west and northwest through the south Pacific Ocean to Tahiti and the Society Islands. The line then moves south and west to New Zealand, west to the Australian coast and north to Cape York.|An 1893 chart showing ''Endeavour'''s track]]

===Shipwreck===
For the next four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading generally northward. Just before 11&amp;nbsp;pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef,&lt;ref name="Cook11June"&gt;Beaglehole 1968, pp. 343–345&lt;/ref&gt; today called [[Endeavour Reef]], within the [[Great Barrier Reef]] system. The sails were immediately taken down, a [[Kedge anchor|kedging anchor]] set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water. The reef ''Endeavour'' had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to {{convert|70|ft}} less than one ship's length away.&lt;ref name="Cook11June"/&gt;

Cook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out.&lt;ref name="Cook11June"/&gt; The crew attached [[buoy]]s to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later,&lt;ref name="Parkin317"&gt;Parkin 2003, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin 2003, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

When, by Cook's reckoning, about {{convert|40|to|50|long ton|t}} of equipment had been thrown overboard, on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free.&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon of 12 June, the longboat carried out two large bower anchors, and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide. The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull. Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef, Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20&amp;nbsp;pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off.&lt;ref name="Cook12June"&gt;Beaglehole 1968, pp. 345–346&lt;/ref&gt; The anchors were retrieved, except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Cook12June"/&gt;

As expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef, and all three working pumps had to be continually manned. A mistake occurred in [[Sounding line|sounding]] the depth of water in the hold, when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams. The mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about {{convert|18|in|cm}} between soundings, sending a wave of fear through the ship. As soon as the mistake was realised, redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak.&lt;ref name="Cook12June"/&gt;

The prospects if the ship sank were grim. The vessel was {{convert|24|mi}} from shore&lt;ref name="Courier1878"/&gt; and the three ship's boats could not carry the entire crew.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin 2003, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Joseph Banks noted in his journal the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger, contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing orders in such circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Blainey 2008, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse&lt;!-- sometimes spelt Munkhouse, but Cook used "Monkhouse" in his journal. Brother of William Monkhouse, the gunner --&gt; proposed [[fothering]] the ship, as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin 2003, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of [[oakum]] and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin 2003, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

''Endeavour'' then resumed her course northward and parallel to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the [[Endeavour River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shipping |work=The Brisbane Courier |page=2 |publisher=Brisbane Newspaper Company Ltd |date=13 October 1873 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1329404?searchTerm=James+Cook|accessdate=27 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook attempted to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented ''Endeavour'' from crossing the [[sandbar|bar]] until the morning of 17 June. She grounded briefly on a sand spit but was refloated an hour later and [[warping (sailing)|warped]] into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and [[careening|careened]] to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles.&lt;ref&gt;Blainey 2008, pp. 252–257&lt;/ref&gt;

An examination of the hull showed that a piece of coral the size of a man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.&lt;ref name="Parkin335-336"&gt;Parkin 2003, pp. 335–336&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northward to Batavia===
After waiting for the wind, ''Endeavour'' resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 August 1770, reaching the northernmost point of [[Cape York Peninsula]] fifteen days later. On 22 August, Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Blainey 2008, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; Cook christened his landing place [[Possession Island National Park|Possession Island]], and ceremonial volleys of gunfire from the shore and ''Endeavour''{{'}}s deck marked the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Track of Endeavour.jpg|300px|thumb|left|alt=Map:A line runs from the Great Barrier Reef northward to Endeavour River and Cape York, then northwest through Torres Strait to the southern coastline of New Guinea. The line then heads west-southwest to Timor, westward parallel to but south of Java to Christmas Island, and northwest to Batavia.|Route of ''Endeavour'' from the Torres Strait to Java, August and September 1770]]
''Endeavour'' then resumed her voyage westward along the coast, picking a path through intermittent shoals and reefs with the help of the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, pp. 386–389&lt;/ref&gt; By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the [[Torres Strait]] between Australia and [[New Guinea]], earlier navigated by [[Luis Váez de Torres]] in 1606. To keep ''Endeavour''{{'}}s voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

After a three-day layover off the island of [[Savu]], ''Endeavour'' sailed on to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], the capital of the [[Dutch East Indies]], on 10 October.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, pp. 431–432&lt;/ref&gt; A day later lightning during a sudden tropical storm struck the ship, but the rudimentary "electric chain" or [[lightning rod]] that Cook had ordered rigged to ''Endeavour''{{'}}s mast saved her from serious damage.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship remained in very poor condition following her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in June. The ship's carpenter, John Seetterly,&lt;!-- or "Satterley", but Cook's log spells it the less traditional way ---&gt; observed that she was "very leaky – makes from twelve to six&amp;nbsp;inches an hour, occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, [[false keel]] gone from beyond the [[wikt:amidships|midships]]. Wounded on her [[wikt:larboard|larbord]] side where the greatest leak is but I could not come at it for the water."&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter's Report, J. Seetterly, 10 October 1770, cited in Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; An inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within ⅛&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm). Cook noted it was a "surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water" for the previous three-month voyage across open seas.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

After riding at anchor for two weeks, ''Endeavour'' was heaved out of the water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with [[shipworm]]s, which required careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull.&lt;ref name="ANMM5558"&gt;Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt; Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted.&lt;ref name="ANMM5558"/&gt; Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day ''Endeavour'' weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name="ANMM5558"/&gt;

===Return voyage===
Though ''Endeavour'' was now in good condition, her crew were not. During the ship's stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94&amp;nbsp;people aboard had been taken ill with [[malaria]] and [[dysentery]].&lt;ref&gt;Blainey 2008, pp. 338–344&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|Disease|[e]}} By the time ''Endeavour'' set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties.&lt;ref name="ANMM5558"/&gt; Over the following twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship's surgeon William Monkhouse.&lt;!-- not to be confused with his brother midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse --&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier1878"/&gt;

Cook attributed the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered that it be purified with [[lime (fruit)|lime]] juice, but this had little effect.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef, died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship's carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed ''Endeavour'' to resume her voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, pp. 449–450&lt;/ref&gt; The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three [[Ordinary seaman|ordinary seamen]] on 27 February.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 1771, ''Endeavour'' rounded the Cape of Good Hope and made port in [[Cape Town]] two days later. Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; The ship remained in port for four weeks awaiting the recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, pp. 460–461&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April, the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town, and ''Endeavour'' resumed her homeward voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 597&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, pp. 463–466&lt;/ref&gt; The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and ''Endeavour'' entered the port of [[Dover]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Beaglehole 1968, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately one month after his return, Cook was promoted to the rank of [[Commander]], and by November 1771 was in receipt of Admiralty Orders for a [[Second voyage of James Cook|second expedition]], this time aboard [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']].&lt;ref&gt;Hough 1994, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed during an altercation with Hawaiians at [[Kealakekua Bay]] on 14 February 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Voyage of the Resolution 1776–1780 |publisher=The University of Canterbury, New Zealand |year=2008 |url=http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/voyages/resolution/death.shtml |accessdate =16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later service==
While Cook was fêted for his successful voyage, ''Endeavour'' was largely forgotten. Within a week of her return to England, she was directed to [[Woolwich Dockyard]] for refitting as a naval transport.&lt;ref name="Hough215"&gt;Hough 1994, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Under the command of Lieutenant James Gordon she then made three return voyages &lt;ref&gt;Baines 2015, pp. 186–195.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Falkland Islands]].

The first, with Joseph Irving as sailing master (replaced by John Dykes at Portsmouth due to illness), was to deliver "sufficient provisions to serve 350 men to the end of the year 1772";&lt;ref&gt;TNA ADM 106/1205/364. Cited in Baines.&lt;/ref&gt; she sailed from Portsmouth on 8 November 1771, but due to terrible weather did not arrive at Port Egmont (the British base in the Falkland Islands) until 1 March. ''Endeavour'' sailed from Port Egmont on 4 May in a three-month non-stop voyage until she anchored at Portsmouth.

The second voyage was to reduce the garrison and replace ''HM Sloop Hound'', John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton [[shallop]] ''Penguin'', commander Samuel Clayton. She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in ''Endeavour''. ''Endeavour'' sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of ''Penguin'', and four ship's carpenters whose job was to reassemble ''Penguin'' on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April ''Endeavour'' and ''Hound'' sailed for England with their crew. One of ''Penguin's'' crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account.&lt;ref name="Penrose"&gt;Penrose 1775&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.&lt;ref&gt;TNA ADM 7/704. Cited in Baines.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third voyage sailed in January 1774 and her purpose was to evacuate the Falklands entirely as Britain was faced with political difficulties from the American Colonies, the French and the Spanish. The government thought that if British ships and troops were engaged in America, Spain might seize the Falklands, capturing the small garrison at Port Egmont and maybe killing some of them - this, it was feared, would trigger an outcry which might topple the government. ''Endeavour'' left England in January 1774, and sailed from the Falklands with all the British inhabitants on 23 April, leaving a flag and a plaque.

''Endeavour'' was [[paid off]] in September 1774,&lt;ref&gt;Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 1775 was sold by the Navy to shipping magnate [[Mather &amp; Co.|J. Mather]] for £645.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaNZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCSupdate"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allan |first=John |title=The Fate of Cook's Ships: Cook's Ships – A Summary Update |journal =Cook's Log |volume= 25 |issue= 3 |page=1929 |publisher=Captain Cook Society |location=United Kingdom |year=2002 |url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu7120.htm |accessdate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mather returned her to sea for at least one commercial voyage to [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Fate of Cook's Ships: What Do We Know About The Endeavour? – Part 2 |journal=Cook's Log |volume= 20 |issue=2 |page=1377 |publisher=Captain Cook Society |location=United Kingdom |year=1997 |url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu7113.htm |accessdate=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the [[American War of Independence]] had commenced, the British government needed ships to carry troops and materiel across the Atlantic. In 1775 Mather submitted ''Endeavour'' as a transport ship,&lt;ref&gt;Baines 2015, pp. 209-211&lt;/ref&gt; and she was rejected. Thinking that renaming her would fool Deptford Yard, Mather resubmitted ''Endeavour'' under the name ''Lord Sandwich''&lt;ref name="Abbass"&gt;Abbass, D. K. ''Rhode Island in the Revolution: Big Happenings in the Smallest Colony''. 2007. Part IV, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lord Sandwich'' was rejected in no uncertain terms: "Unfit for service. She was sold out Service Called ''Endeavour'' Bark refused before". Repairs were made, and the vessel was accepted in her third submission, under the name ''Lord Sandwich 2'' as there was already a transport ship called ''Lord Sandwich''.&lt;ref&gt;TNA ADM 106/3402 5 February 1776. Cited in Baines.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Lord Sandwich 2,'' master William Author, sailed on 6 May 1776 from Portsmouth in a fleet of 100 vessels, 68 of which were transports, which was under orders to support Howe's campaign to capture [[New York City|New York.]] ''Lord Sandwich 2'' carried 206 men mainly from the Hessian du Corps regiment of [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian mercenaries]].&lt;ref&gt;TNA ADM 1/487. Cited in Baines.&lt;/ref&gt; The crossing was terrible, and two Hessians who were in the same fleet made accounts of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Voyage of the First Hessian Army from Portsmouth to New York 1776.|last=Pfister and Seume|first=Albert and Johann|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scattered fleet assembled at Halifax and then sailed to Sandy Hook where other ships and troops assembled. On 15 August 1776 ''Lord Sandwich 2'' was anchored at Sandy Hook; also assembled there was ''Adventure'', which had sailed with ''Resolution'' on Cook's second voyage, now a storeship, captained by John Hallum. Another ship there at that time was ''HMS Siren'', captained by Tobias Furneaux, who had commanded ''Adventure'' on Cook's second voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Baines 2015 pp. 216–7&lt;/ref&gt;

New York was eventually captured, but [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in the hands of the Americans posed a threat as a base for recapturing New York, so in November 1776 a fleet, which included ''Lord Sandwich 2'' carrying Hessian Troops, set out to take [[Rhode Island]],&lt;ref name="RIMAP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANMM1617"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Report on the Australian National Maritime Museum's participation in the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project's search for HMB Endeavour |publisher=Australian National Maritime Museum |date=June 2003 |pages=16–17 |url=http://www.anmm.gov.au/webdata/resources/oaiFiles/EndeavourRPT2000No2b2.pdf |accessdate=6 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090706134055/http://www.anmm.gov.au/webdata/resources/oaiFiles/EndeavourRPT2000No2b2.pdf |archivedate= 6 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was taken but not subdued, and ''Lord Sandwich 2'' was needed as a [[prison ship]].&lt;ref name="Abbass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RIMAP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Search for the HMB Endeavour |publisher=Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project |year=2008 |url=http://www.rimarinearchproject.org/rimap_endeavor.htm |accessdate=28 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918230535/http://www.rimarinearchproject.org/rimap_endeavor.htm |archivedate=18 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final resting place==
[[File:Gun recovered from HMS Endeavour.JPG|right|thumb|A recovered cannon from ''Endeavour'' on display at the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]], [[England]]]]
The surrender of British General [[John Burgoyne]]'s army at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] brought France into the war, and in the summer of 1778 a [[pincer movement|pincer]] plan was agreed to [[Battle of Rhode Island#French arrival at Newport|recapture Newport]]: the [[Continental Army]] would approach overland, and a French Fleet would sail into the harbour. To prevent the latter the British commander, Captain John Brisbane, determined to blockade the bay by sinking surplus vessels at its mouth. Between 3 and 6 August a fleet of Royal Navy and hired craft, including ''Lord Sandwich 2'', were scuttled at various locations in the Bay.&lt;ref name="Hosty16-17"&gt;Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|scuttle|[f]}} ''Lord Sandwich'' ''2'', previously ''Endeavour'', previously ''Earl of Pembroke'', was sunk on 4 August 1778.&lt;ref&gt;TNA ADM 68/204 1778.&lt;/ref&gt;

The owners of the sunken vessels were compensated by the British government for the loss of their ships. The Admiralty valuation for 10 of the sunken vessels recorded that many had been built in Yorkshire, and the details of the ''Lord Sandwich'' transport matched those of the former ''Endeavour'' including construction in Whitby, a [[Builder's Old Measurement|burthen]] of 368 &lt;small&gt;71/94&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;tons, and re-entry into Navy service on 10 February 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbass |first=D.

In 1834 a letter appeared in the ''[[Providence Journal]]'' of Rhode Island, drawing attention to the possible presence of the former ''Endeavour'' on the seabed of the bay.&lt;ref name="CCS"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fate of Cook's Ships: What Do We Know About The Endeavour? - Part 1 |publisher=Captain Cook Society |year=2008 |url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu7112.htm |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was swiftly disputed by the British consul in Rhode Island, who wrote claiming that ''Endeavour'' had been bought from Mather by the French in 1790 and renamed ''Liberté''. The consul later admitted he had heard this not from the Admiralty, but as hearsay from the former owners of the French ship.&lt;ref name="CCS" /&gt; It was later suggested ''Liberté'', which sank off Newport in 1793, was in fact another of Cook's ships, the former HMS ''Resolution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Francis |title=Captain Cook's Endeavour found off coast of America |work=The Telegraph (UK) |publisher =Telegraph Media Group Ltd |date=18 May 2006 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1518741/Captain-Cooks-Endeavour-found-off-coast-of-America.html |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or another ''Endeavour'', a naval [[schooner]] sold out of service in 1782.&lt;ref name="CCS" /&gt; A further letter to the ''Providence Journal'' stated that a retired English sailor was conducting guided tours of a [[hulk (ship type)|hulk]] on the [[River Thames]] as late as 1825, claiming that the ship had once been Cook's ''Endeavour.''&lt;ref name="CCS" /&gt;

In 1991 the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) began research into the identity of the thirteen transports sunk as part of the Newport blockade of 1778, including ''Lord Sandwich.'' In 1999 RIMAP discovered documents in the [[Public Record Office]] (now called the National Archives) in London confirming that ''Endeavour'' had been renamed ''Lord Sandwich'', had served as a troop transport to North America, and had been scuttled at Newport as part of the 1778 fleet of transports.&lt;ref name="Hosty16-17"/&gt;

In 1999 a combined research team from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum examined some known wrecks in the harbour&lt;ref name="Hosty23-26"&gt;Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 23–26&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000, RIMAP and the ANMM examined a site that appears to be one of the blockade vessels, partly covered by a separate wreck of a 20th-century barge. The older remains were those of a wooden vessel of approximately the same size, and possibly a similar design and materials as ''Lord Sandwich'' ex ''Endeavour''.&lt;ref name="Hosty23-26"/&gt; Confirmation that Cook's former ship had indeed been in Newport Harbor sparked  public interest in locating her wreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Captain Cook's Endeavour 'found' |work=BBC World News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=18 May 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4994614.stm |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shipwreck may be Cook's Endeavour |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 May 2006 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200605/s1640502.htm |accessdate=9 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113163814/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200605/s1640502.htm|archivedate=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further mapping showed eight other 18th-century wrecks in Newport Harbor, some with features and conditions also consistent with ''Endeavour''.

They were seeking funds to build facilities for handling and storing recovered objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-36189421 |title=Endeavour: Has the ship Captain Cook sailed to Australia been found? - BBC News |newspaper=BBC |date=3 May 2016  |author= |accessdate= 3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 [[Fairfax Media]] reported that archaeologists from the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project had pinpointed the final resting place of the vessel. The possible discovery was hailed as a "hugely significant moment" in Australian history, but researchers have warned they were yet to "definitively" confirm whether the wreck had been located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/19/wreck-of-captain-cooks-hms-endeavour-discovered-off-coast-of-america|title=Wreck of Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour 'discovered' off US coast|first=Michael|last=McGowan|date=19 September 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Endeavour'' relics and legacy ==
In addition to the search for the remains of the ship herself, there was substantial Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of [[Cooktown]] sought to recover the six&amp;nbsp;cannons thrown overboard when ''Endeavour'' grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed.&lt;ref name="Parkin317"/&gt; Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an ''Endeavour'' cannon from shallow water near the Reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Interesting Relics | work =The Advertiser | page =4 | publisher =J.

In 1937, a small part of ''Endeavour'''s keel was given to the [[Commonwealth of Australia|Australian Government]] by philanthropist [[Charles Wakefield]] in his capacity as president of the [[Arthur Phillip|Admiral Arthur Phillip Memorial]].&lt;ref name="TCT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cook relics for National Library |work=The Canberra Times |page=3 |publisher=Federal Capital Press of Australia Ltd |date=16 May 1937 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2432570?searchTerm=hms+endeavour|accessdate=12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Prime Minister [[Joseph Lyons]] described the section of keel as "intimately associated with the discovery and foundation of Australia".&lt;ref name="TCT"/&gt;

Searches were resumed for the lost Endeavour Reef cannons, but expeditions in 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Parkin317"/&gt; They were finally recovered in 1969 by a research team from the American [[Academy of Natural Sciences]],&lt;ref name="ANMM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Endeavour cannon |publisher=Australian National Maritime Museum |year=2008 |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/endeavour-cannon |accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a sophisticated [[magnetometer]] to locate the cannons, a quantity of iron ballast and the abandoned bower anchor.

The [[Russell, New Zealand|Russell]] Museum, in the [[Bay of Islands]], [[New Zealand]], has a sailing one-fifth scale replica of ''Endeavour''. It was built in Auckland in 1969 and travelled by trailer throughout New Zealand and Australia before being presented to the museum in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cook's Endeavour model at Russell Museum |publisher =Russell Museum |url= http://www.russellmuseum.org.nz/endeavour.htm |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Whitby]] the "Bark Endeavour Whitby" is a scaled-down replica of the original ship. It relies on engines for propulsion and is a little less than half the size of the original. Trips for tourists take them along the coast to [[Sandsend]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallon, Andrew (2015) ''North York Moors, Coast &amp; York; Dalesman visitor guide''. Skipton: Dalesman; p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horace Gundry Alexander''' (18 April 1889&amp;nbsp;– 30 September 1989) was a British [[Quaker]] teacher and writer, [[pacifist]] and [[ornithology|ornithologist]]. He was the youngest of four sons of Joseph Gundry Alexander (1848–1918),{{sfn|Chmielewski}} two other sons being the ornithologists [[Wilfred Backhouse Alexander]] and [[Christopher James Alexander]] (1887–1917).{{sfn|Carnall|Wood|2004}} He was a friend of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].

==Life and work==
Horace was born on 18 April 1889 at [[Croydon]], England. His father Joseph Gundry Alexander (1848–1918) was an eminent lawyer, who had worked to suppress the [[opium]] trade between [[India]] and China. His mother was Josephine Crosfield Alexander. His early schooling was at [[Bootham School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bootham School Register|place=York, England&lt;!--|publisher=Bootham Old Scholars Association --&gt;|publisher=BOSA|first=Jenny | last=Woodland |year=2011|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[York]], after which he studied at [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated in history in 1912. In 1914 the [[First World War]] broke out, and he served as secretary on various anti-war committees. In 1916, as a [[conscientious objector]], he was initially exempted only from combatant [[military service]], but after two levels of appeal he was exempted on condition of teaching, which he took up via General Service with the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]], holding posts at [[Sibford School]], [[Warwick School]] and [[Cranbrook School, Kent|Cranbrook School]], [[Kent]].

He married Olive Graham (1892–1942) on 20 July 1918 and joined the staff of [[Woodbrooke College|Woodbrooke]], a Quaker college in [[Birmingham]], teaching international relations, especially in relation to the [[League of Nations]], from 1919 to 1944. His wife Olive died in 1942, having been confined to a wheelchair for several years. In the same year Alexander joined a section of the [[World War II]] [[Friends Ambulance Unit]] and went to parts of India threatened by Japan. In 1958 he married Rebecca Bradbeer (née Biddle, 1901–1991), an American Quaker. After ten years they moved to [[Pennsylvania]], United States, where he spent the remaining twenty years of his life.{{sfn|Carnall|Wood|2004}} He was also, for its first ten years, a governor of [[Leighton Park School]], a leading Quaker school in England. He died of a [[Stomach|gastrointestinal]] illness at Crosslands, a Quaker retirement community in [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0DC1E31F936A35753C1A96F948260 Obituary. New York Times 5 October 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ornithology==
Alexander was a lifelong dedicated and gifted [[birdwatching|birdwatcher]], keenly involved in the twentieth century movements for the protection and observation of birds. Along with two of his older brothers, Wilfred and Christopher, he took a keen interest in nature. Growing up in a Quaker home devoid of any other forms of entertainment, he found an interest in birds from the age of eight, when his older brother Gilbert gave him a book on natural history.{{sfn|Moss|2004|p=87}} In his autobiography he traced the precise origin of his interest in birds to 8.45 am on 25 March 1897, when an uncle pointed out a singing [[Common chiffchaff|chiffchaff]] in their garden.{{sfn|Fitter|1990}} It was not until he was 20 that he obtained his first pair of binoculars.{{sfn|Moss|2004|p=88}} He was one of a small group of amateur birdwatchers who developed the skills and set new standards for combining the pleasures of birdwatching with the satisfaction of contributing to ornithological science. He made many significant observations, mainly in Britain but also in India and the United States.

Horace spent most of his time in India and became interested in its birds in 1927. Ornithology at that time was not popular among Indians in India, and when Horace informed Gandhi of an expedition, Gandhi commented, "That is a good hobby, provided you don't shoot them." Horace demonstrated the use of binoculars as an acceptable alternative to the gun and carried them at most times. Horace Alexander joined [[Sidney Dillon Ripley]] on an expedition to the [[Naga hills]] in 1950. Ripley named a subspecies of the [[aberrant bush warbler]] after Alexander, although this is no longer recognised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Postilla| volume=6| year=1951|title=Notes on Indian Birds. IV. Some recently collected birds from Assam| author=Ripley, S. Dillon| pages=1–7|url=https://archive.org/stream/postilla150peab#page/n61/mode/2up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he founded the [[Delhi]] Birdwatching Society along with Lt. Gen. Harold Williams. One of the early members of this organisation was the young [[Indira Gandhi]], and the group encouraged Indian ornithologists such as Usha Ganguli.{{sfn|Wood| 2003}} Many of his notes were mislaid when one of his suitcases was lost in India in 1946.{{sfn|Moss|2004|p=102}}{{sfn|Bhutani|1984}} Through his influence on [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] he was instrumental in the designation of the [[Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary]] near Delhi.{{sfn|Fitter|1990}}

He was also a founder member, in 1929, of the [[West Midland Bird Club]] (then the Birmingham Bird Club),&lt;ref name="WMBC-chrono"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/chrono|title=Chronology|publisher=West Midland Bird Club|accessdate=7 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921053229/http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/chrono |archivedate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its president,&lt;ref name="WMBC-chrono" /&gt; during his long residence in Birmingham, England.

==Gandhi==
Alexander's father-in-law, John William Graham, believed that Gandhi was a subversive and that the Indians were unprepared for self-government. At the Quaker yearly meeting in 1930 the [[Nobel prize]]-winning poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] attacked British rule in India. The Quakers were disturbed by the address and John Graham was particularly outraged. Afterwards it was agreed that a representative would be sent to India to attempt a reconciliation between the [[Viceroy]], [[Lord Irwin]], and Gandhi. This task was assigned to Horace Alexander, who first met Gandhi in March 1928. He made it possible for Gandhi to attend the 1931 round-table conference in London. After the conference he founded the India Conciliation Group along with [[Agatha Harrison]] and [[Carl Heath]].{{sfn|Carnall|Wood|2004}} Becoming a close friend of Gandhi (who, in 1942, described Alexander as "one of the best English friends India has"), he wrote extensively about Gandhi's philosophy.{{sfn|Carnall|2010}} In 1947 he attempted to intervene to control the violence between Muslims and Hindus and was beside Gandhi in Calcutta on 15 August 1947.{{sfn|Carnall|Wood|2004}}

He was consulted by [[Richard Attenborough]] in the making of the film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', but felt that the scripts did not do justice to the people around Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textualities.net/geoffrey-carnall/gandhis-interpreter-a-life-of-horace-alexander|author=Carnall, Geoffrey|title=Gandhi's Interpreter: a life of Horace Alexander|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 he was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]] medal, the highest honour given to a non-Indian civilian.{{sfn|Carnall|Wood|2004}}

==Radio appearances==

{{Star formation}}
The '''Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] process that occurs when the surface of a [[star]] or a [[planet]] cools. The cooling causes the pressure to drop, and the star or planet shrinks as a result. This compression, in turn, heats the core of the star/planet. This mechanism is evident on [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] and on [[brown dwarf]]s whose central temperatures are not high enough to undergo [[nuclear fusion]]. It is estimated that Jupiter radiates more energy through this mechanism than it receives from the Sun, but Saturn might not. The latter process causes Jupiter to shrink at a rate of two centimetres each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Giant Planets of Our Solar System: Atmospheres, Composition, and Structure | author = Patrick G. J. Irwin | publisher = Springer | date = 2003 | isbn = 3-540-00681-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p8wCsJweUb0C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22kelvin+helmholtz+mechanism%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism was originally proposed by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] in the late nineteenth century to explain the source of energy of the [[Sun]]. By the mid-nineteenth century, [[conservation of energy]] had been accepted, and one consequence of this law of physics is that the Sun must have some energy source to continue to shine.  Because nuclear reactions were unknown, the main candidate for the source of solar energy was gravitational contraction.

However, it  soon was recognized by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] and others that the total amount of energy available through this mechanism only allowed the Sun to shine for millions of years rather than the billions of years that the geological and biological evidence suggested for the [[age of the Earth]]. (Kelvin himself had argued that the Earth was millions, not billions, of years old.) The true source of the Sun's energy remained uncertain until the 1930s, when it was shown by [[Hans Bethe]] to be [[nuclear fusion]].

== Power generated by a Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = BW Carroll &amp; DA Ostlie| title = An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics (2nd Ed.)| pages = 296–298| publisher = Pearson Addison Wesley| date = 2007| ISBN = 0-8053-0402-9| url = http://www.aw-bc.com/astrophysics| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222105230/http://www.aw-bc.com/astrophysics/| archivedate = 2015-12-22| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
It was theorised that the [[potential energy|gravitational potential energy]] from the contraction of the Sun could be its source of power. To calculate the total amount of energy that would be released by the Sun in such a mechanism (assuming uniform [[density]]), it was approximated to a perfect sphere made up of [[concentric]] shells. The gravitational potential energy could then be found as the integral over all the shells from the centre to its outer radius.

Gravitational potential energy from [[Newtonian mechanics]] is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;U = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], and the two masses in this case are that of the thin shells of width ''dr'', and the contained mass within radius ''r'' as one integrates between zero and the radius of the total sphere. This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;U = -G\int_0^R \frac{m(r) 4 \pi r^2 \rho}{r}\, dr,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the outer radius of the sphere, and ''m''(''r'') is the mass contained within the radius ''r''. Changing ''m''(''r'') into a product of volume and density to satisfy the integral,

:&lt;math&gt;U = -G\int_0^R \frac{4 \pi r^3 \rho 4 \pi r^2 \rho}{3r}\, dr = -\frac{16}{15}G \pi^2 \rho^2 R^5.&lt;/math&gt;

Recasting in terms of the mass of the sphere gives the total gravitational potential energy as

:&lt;math&gt;U = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}.&lt;/math&gt;

While uniform density is not correct, one can get a rough order of magnitude estimate of the expected age of our star by inserting known values for the [[Solar mass|mass]] and [[Solar radius|radius of the Sun]], and then dividing by the known [[Solar luminosity|luminosity of the Sun]] (note that this will involve another approximation, as the power output of the Sun has not always been constant):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U_\text{r}}{L_\odot} \approx \frac{1.1 \times 10^{41}~\text{J}}{3.9 \times 10^{26}~\text{W}} \approx 8\,900\,000~\text{years},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the luminosity of the Sun. While giving enough power for considerably longer than many other physical methods, such as [[chemical energy]], this value was clearly still not long enough due to geological and biological evidence that the Earth was billions of years old. It was eventually discovered that [[nuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] energy was responsible for the power output and long lifetimes of stars.&lt;ref&gt;

[[North Carolina]] is a U.S. state located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard]] in the southeastern United States. [[Tropical cyclones]]—[[storm]]s characterized by a large [[low pressure system|low-pressure]] center and numerous [[thunderstorms]] that produce strong winds and heavy rain—regularly affect the state. According to statistical hurricane research between 1886 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5% of all [[North Atlantic hurricane|North Atlantic tropical cyclones]] have affected the state.&lt;ref name="ncclimate"&gt;{{cite web|author=State Climate Office of North Carolina|year=2006|title=Hurricanes in North Carolina|accessdate=2008-04-03|url=http://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/print/8|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330154058/http://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/print/8|archivedate=2010-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list documents 52 tropical cyclones known to have affected the state between 2000 and the present. The most active month is September, with 20 total storms, while November is the least active month with two storms. While the most intense storm was [[Hurricane Isabel]] in 2003, [[Hurricane Florence]] in 2018 was the most destructive and caused the most fatalities. The first storm to impact the state during the period was [[Hurricane Florence (2000)|Hurricane Florence]] in September 2000, and the most recent was [[Hurricane Michael]] in October 2018; with [[Hurricane Florence]] in September 2018 before. In terms of windspeeds, [[Hurricane Isabel]] was the strongest storm to affect the state, producing [[maximum sustained winds]] equivalent to Category 2 status on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale]].&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division |year=2008 |title=Chronological List of All Hurricanes which Affected the Continental United States: 1851–2007 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=2010-04-12 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/ushurrlist18512007.txt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921102626/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/ushurrlist18512007.txt |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of all [[Pacific typhoon]]s that have had their names retired by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]. A total of 41&amp;nbsp;[[Tropical cyclone|typhoon]] names have been retired since the start of official [[List of previous tropical cyclone names|tropical cyclone naming]] in the western North [[Pacific Ocean]] in [[2000 Pacific typhoon season|2000]]. Tropical cyclone names are retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in a meeting in January or February.&lt;!--Examples&amp;nbsp;— http://www.gcs.gov.mo/showNews.php?DataUcn=28142&amp;PageLang=E, http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TC39_final_report.pdf--&gt; Those typhoons that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms. Several names were removed or altered [[list of tropical cyclone names|naming list]] for various reasons other than retirement. Collectively, retired typhoons have caused over $99&amp;nbsp;billion in damage ({{#time:Y}}&amp;nbsp;[[USD]]), as well as over 12,000&amp;nbsp;deaths.&lt;!--Data is based on stats from below--&gt;

[[File:Aerial view of Tacloban after Typhoon Haiyan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tacloban]] devastated by [[Typhoon Haiyan]]]]
The practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with systems named after places, saints or things they hit before the formal start of naming in the Western Pacific.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, Ray|url=http://www.metsoc.org.nz/system/files/journals/10/1/1990_101_24-26_rsmith.pdf|journal=Weather and Climate|year=1990|publisher=The Meteorological Society of New Zealand|volume=10|title=What's in a Name?|issue=1|pages=24–26|accessdate=August 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129194207/http://www.metsoc.org.nz/system/files/journals/10/1/1990_101_24-26_rsmith.pdf|archive-date=November 29, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the [[Kamikaze (typhoon)|Kamikaze]], [[1906 Hong Kong typhoon]], [[1922 Swatow typhoon]] and the [[1934 Muroto typhoon]].&lt;ref name="TC FAQ B1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Landsea, Christopher W|author2=Dorst, Neal M|date=June 1, 2014|title=Tropical Cyclone Frequently Asked Question|chapter=Subject: Tropical Cyclone Names: B1) How are tropical cyclones named?|accessdate=August 25, 2014|deadurl=no|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/TCFAQ_B.txt|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q9nmDAns?url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/TCFAQ_B.txt|archivedate=June 7, 2014|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the [[United States Weather Bureau]] in the Northern Atlantic basin, after hurricanes [[Hurricane Carol|Carol]], [[Hurricane Edna|Edna]], and [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] struck the [[East Coast of the United States]] and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year.&lt;ref name="Mahina"&gt;{{cite web|title=They Called the Wind Mahina: The History of Naming Cyclones|author=Dorst, Neal|url=ftp://ftp.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/pub/dorst/Mahina.pptx|author2=Hurricane Research Division|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|page=Slides 8–72|date=October 23, 2012|format=PPTX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced; however, it was decided at the 1969 Interdepartmental hurricane conference, that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired.&lt;ref name="Mahina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anna"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's time (June) to match for Anna...|newspaper=The Daily Gleaner|date=June 1, 1969|author=Reuters|page=2|location=Kingston, Jamaica}}{{subscription required|via=The Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tropical cyclone name to be removed in the South Pacific was Rosie after it had impacted Vanuatu and New Caledonia during 1971. Several names have been removed from the Pacific naming lists for various other reasons than causing a significant amount of death/destruction, which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and  political reasons.&lt;ref name="WMO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Regional Association IV: Hurricane Operational Plan 2013|date=May 30, 2013|author=RA IV Hurricane Committee|pages=98–99|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/OPERATIONALPLAN2013_en.pdf|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|chapter=Chapter 9: Tropical Cyclone Names|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HRD /&gt;

In 2000, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) began naming tropical cyclones from a list of 140&amp;nbsp;names, submitted by 14&amp;nbsp;countries. Previously, the JMA labeled storms with numbers, but not names. The JMA has been the official warning agency of the western Pacific Ocean since 1981, though other organizations have also tracked typhoons. The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) unofficially named tropical cyclones from [[1940–49 Pacific typhoon seasons#1947 Pacific typhoon season|1947]] to [[1999 Pacific typhoon season|1999]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Hong Kong Observatory]]|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclones in 2006|accessdate=2008-03-04|url=http://www.weather.gov.hk/publica/tc/tc2006/english/section1.htm#1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, there were several pre-determined [[list of previous tropical cyclone names|tropical cyclone lists]], in which many names were removed and replaced with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Digital Typhoon |year=2006 |title=Typhoon List View |accessdate=2008-03-04 |url=http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon/year/wnp/.html.en }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) names tropical cyclones using a separate list, which is adjusted periodically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea|year=2007|title=How are Tropical Cyclones Named?|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|accessdate=2008-03-05|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/TCFAQ_B.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several names were removed from the list. In 2002, the name ''Hanuman'' was replaced prior to being used, due to objection by the [[India Meteorological Department]] for reason of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific |year=2001 |title=Report of the Typhoon Committee on its Thirty-Fourth Session |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=2008-03-04 |url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/TCP_vO/Typhoon-C/final-report-TC34-dec2001.doc |format=DOC }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the name ''Kodo'' was replaced in 2002 without being used.&lt;ref name="2008wmo"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tropical Cyclone Programme|year=2008|title=Typhoon Committee Operational Manual&amp;nbsp;— Meteorological Component|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2008-03-04|url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP-23EDITION2008.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Koni was replaced by Goni, after an apparent misspelling was made. In 2004, the names ''Yanyan'' and ''[[Typhoon Tingting|Tingting]]'' were removed at the request of the [[Hong Kong Observatory]].&lt;ref name="2008wmo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hong Kong Observatory |year=2005 |title=Change of Tropical Cyclone Names : "Dolphin" and "Lionrock" to replace "Yanyan" and "Tingting" |accessdate=2008-03-04 |url=http://210.0.235.9/wxinfo/news/2005/pre1124e.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011115126/http://210.0.235.9/wxinfo/news/2005/pre1124e.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of nine names on the list had their spellings changed.&lt;ref name="2008wmo"/&gt; In February 2014, the name ''Sonamu'' was removed at the request from [[Malaysia]] due to causing unprecedented panic by the similar pronunciation to ''tsunami''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retirement of Names from the List of Names of Tropical Cyclones for the Typhoon Committee Region|url=http://www.typhooncommittee.org/46th/Docs/item%2011%20Programme/11.3%20retired%20TC%20name.pdf|publisher=Typhoon Committee|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015 the name ''Jongdari'' was chosen as replacement for ''Sonamu''. In the 46th session of the Typhoon Committee, it was noted the name ''Vicente'' appears on both the tropical cyclone name lists for the Western North Pacific and Eastern North Pacific. In response to this duplication the name ''Lan'' was chosen as replacement for ''Vicente'' on the Western North Pacific name list to avoid potential confusion.

Between 1947 and 2000, eleven names of significant tropical cyclones were retired from the list of names used by the United States [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]].&lt;ref name="Retired typhoons"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zhou, Xiao|author2=Lei, Xiaotu|year=2012|title=Summary of retired typhoons within the Western North Pacific Ocean|volume=1|issue=1|publisher=The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific/World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee|issn=2225-6032|journal=Tropical Cyclone Research and Review|pages=23–32|accessdate=December 21, 2014|doi=10.6057/2012TCRR01.03|url=http://tcrr.typhoon.gov.cn/EN/article/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&amp;id=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time other names were removed from the naming lists, including in 1979 when the lists of names used were revised to include both male and female names.&lt;ref name="Retired typhoons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ATCR 1979"&gt;{{cite report |author1=Naval Oceanography Command Center |author2=Joint Typhoon Warning Center |archivedate=November 14, 2014 |title=Annual Typhoon Report: 1979 |page=10 |url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1979atcr.pdf |deadurl=no |chapter=Chapter III: Summary of Tropical Cyclones |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U4xLZtah?url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1979atcr.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical Storm Lucille was the first name to be retired for its impacts, while Ophelia was retired because of its long {{convert|5000|mi|km|disp=flip|round=5|abbr=on}} track.&lt;ref name="Retired typhoons"/&gt;

'''High winds''' can blow railway trains off tracks and cause accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/w5531100m065g489/ | title = Overturning Probability of Railway Vehicles under Wind Gust Loads | journal = Iutam Symposium on Dynamics and Control of Nonlinear Systems with Uncertainty | author = C. Proppe, C. Wetzel | year = 2007 | publisher = Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dangers of high winds ==

High winds can cause problems in a number of ways:

* blow trains off the tracks.
* blow trains or wagons along the tracks and cause collisions.
* cause pantographs and overhead wiring to tangle.
* cause trees and other objects to fall onto the railway

== Preventative measures ==
Risks from high winds can be reduced by:
* wind fences akin to [[snow sheds]]
* lower profile of carriages
* lowered [[centre of gravity]] of vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | |first1=Klaus|last1=Kieper|first2=Reiner|last2=Preuß|first3=Elfriede|last3=Rehbein|title = Schmalspurbahn-Archiv | chapter = Bahnen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | page = 116 | publisher = Transpress | location = Berlin | year = 1982 | edition = 2nd| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* reduction in train speed or cancellation, at high winds
* a wider rail [[Track gauge|gauge]]
* improve overhead wiring with:
** regulated tension rather than fixed terminations
** shorter [[overhead lines|catenary]] spans
** solid conductors

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">'''Miscellaneous electric loads (MELs)''' in buildings are electric loads resulting from electronic devices not responsible for space heating, cooling, water heating, or lighting.&lt;ref name=ashraeJune08&gt;Roth, K., McKenney, K., Brodrick, J. "Small Devices, Big Loads." ASHRAE Journal. Vol. 60 No. 6.  June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  MELs are produced by hard-wired and “plug-in” electrical devices, including [[entertainment center|home entertainment centers]], kitchen electronics such as microwaves and toaster ovens, bath items such as hair dryers and electric hot tubs, and others such as security systems and ceiling fans.  MELs are gaining greater importance as home electronics become more sophisticated and more widespread, and miscellaneous electric use can only be expected to rise.&lt;ref name=hendron&gt;R. Hendron and M. Eastment, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39551.pdf  Development of an Energy-Savings Calculation Methodology for Residential Miscellaneous Electric Loads”],  ACEEE Conference Paper, August 2006, pp.1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Miscellaneous electric use includes a diverse collection of electronics, such as power adapters, pool pumps, computer equipment, televisions, door bells, phone/fax machines, and many others.  MELs usually do not include [[major appliance]]s such as refrigerators, stoves, dryers, etc.  Although each device may draw a small amount of power, the large and steadily increasing number of devices can use a significant portion of a home’s energy.  In the United States, MELs comprise nearly one quarter of residential energy use, larger than either heating or cooling energy end-use.  In [[low-energy house]]s, this percentage increases dramatically, because MELs are often ignored while increasing whole-house [[efficient energy use|efficiency]].&lt;ref name="ashraeJune08"/&gt;

On average, home entertainment equipment, including televisions, audio equipment, and computers, make up about half of the total MELs in a United States home.  About 13 percent of MELs come from devices in [[standby power|standby]] mode.

==Significance to zero-energy buildings==
MELs can be lowered by using fewer electronic devices, choosing more efficient electronics (for example, [[Energy Star]] appliances), modifying occupant behavior and managing [[standby power]].  Still, MELs are a significant obstacle in creating [[zero-energy building]]s.&lt;ref&gt;National Renewable Energy Laboratory, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100806211721/http://www.bira.ws/projects/files/9C3b_Potential_Savings_Appliances.pdf “Final Report: Potential Savings in Miscellaneous Electric Loads from Use of Next Generation Appliances”] 29 March 2007, pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Heating, cooling and [[water heating]] energy loads can be reduced by improvements to the [[building envelope]], [[HVAC]] and water heating equipment, and [[Duct (HVAC)|air distribution system]].  MELs are more elusive, however, because of their diversity.  Many miscellaneous electric devices that can be found in a large fraction of houses are smaller—for example toasters, televisions and internet routers, while larger power draws, such as well pumps or waterbed heaters, are present in only a small fraction of houses.  Such variety makes it hard to find a systematic method of reducing MELs.  If MELs cannot be reduced, the only way to counter them is with larger (and thus more costly) [[solar cell|solar]] arrays or other electricity generation methods.&lt;ref name=hendron/&gt;

==Energy feedback devices==

{{main | Home energy monitor}}

One reason MELs are difficult to reduce is because the use of small electric devices are controlled directly by a building’s inhabitants.  One way to reduce MELs is by the use of energy feedback devices which report real-time energy use to a house’s occupants.  The use of these devices has been tested in numerous studies which suggest whole-house savings of 5%-15%.&lt;ref&gt;Darby, Sarah, 2000, [http://www.electrisave.co.uk/cms/thesite/public/uploads/uploadsbank/1112705999_390.pdf "Making it obvious: designing feedback into energy consumption,"] Proceedings, 2nd International Conference on Energy Efficiency in Household Appliances and Lighting. Italian Association of Energy Economists, Naples, 2000. pp. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  
With recent advances in technology, energy feedback devices can be purchased for $100–$150.  Feedback devices allow people to identify and reduce [[standby power]] and as well as cut back on unnecessary power draws.  In addition, occupants can see the effects of running pool pumps/heaters, supplemental space heaters, air conditioners, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, D., Hoak, D., Cummings, J., [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-CR-1742-08.pdf “Pilot Evaluation of Energy Savings from Residential Energy Demand Feedback Devices,”] Florida Solar Energy Center, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Energy feedback devices can further assist zero energy buildings, where it is desirable to align electric loads with photovoltaic panel output.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, D., Hoak, D., [http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-CR-1665-06.pdf “How Much Energy Are We Using?

[[File:Oreobambos buchwaldii00.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Oreobambos buchwaldii|Buchwa bamboo]] at Tava marsh in Moribane forest]]
Müller et al. (2005) described two main vegetation types, namely a) moist, evergreen forest dominated by [[Newtonia buchananii|Forest newtonia]], [[Celtis mildbraedii|Chirinda stinkwood]], [[Erythrophleum suaveolens|Forest ordeal tree]] and [[Millettia stuhlmannii|Panga-panga]], and b) transitional forest on the northern verge of the forest, where the predominant species were [[Bersama abyssinica|Winged bersama]], Panga-panga, [[Pteliopsis myrtifolia|Two-winged pteleopsis]], [[Tabernaemontana elegans|Toad-tree]] and [[Xylopia longipetala|Bushveld bitterwood]].&lt;ref name=mon/&gt;

===Fauna===
Native mammals include [[African bush elephant|Bush elephant]], [[Bushbuck]], [[Red duiker]], [[Samango monkey]], [[Bushpig]] and several species of small carnivore.&lt;ref name=bri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Briggs |first1=Philip |title=Mozambique |date=2014 | page=222 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |isbn=1841624969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Moribane forest was intensively exploited from the early 20th century onwards, initially for natural rubber derived from [[Landolphia kirkii|Rubber vine]], and subsequently for its native timber species, namely [[Khaya anthotheca|Red mahogany]], [[Milicia excelsa|Iroko]] and Panga-panga. As the 21st century approached, it was damaged by wildfires and shifting agriculture.&lt;ref name=mon/&gt; Despite past overexploitation, the widespread occurrence of saplings of [[Synsepalum brevipes|Stem-fruit miraculous-berry]], Forest newtonia, Iroko, Panga-panga and Forest ordeal tree, gives reason for hope that it will naturally regenerate.&lt;ref name=mon&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monteiro |first1=José |last2=Dondeyne |first2=Stefaan |last3=Wursten |first3=Bart |last4=Bannerman |first4=James |last5=Meilby |first5=Henrik |last6=Sitoe |first6=Almeida |title=Vegetation composition of natural gaps in Moribane forest (Mozambique) |journal=African Journal of Ecology |date=December 2011 |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=510–514 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01281.x |url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/314129/2/Monteiro-2011_Vegetation+composition+of+natural+gaps+in+Moribane+forest_AfrJEcol.pdf |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renamo]] had a stronghold in the area during the [[Mozambican Civil War]]. By the end of the war in 1992 the forest was largely intact, but its Bush elephant population was reduced.&lt;ref name=dav&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Ian; Corsane, Gerard; Davis, Peter |title=Making sense of place: multidisciplinary perspectives |date=2014 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd |isbn=1843838990 |page=297 |edition=Volume 7 of Heritage Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the local people had earlier observed taboos on hunting of elephant, they now had concerns about the recovering elephant population. Chief Mpunga argued that the relation between elephants and humans was spiritual, and people subsequently moved out of the area frequented by the elephants.&lt;ref name=dav/&gt;

==Facilities==
Ndzou (i.e. Elephant) camp is a joint venture between Eco-Micaia and the local community,&lt;ref name=fit/&gt; which offers guided walks, and a chance of tracking of the shy, forest-living Bush elephants with a local guide. A number of forest trails can be taken from Ndzou camp or Mpunga ranger camp, varying from 4 to 12&amp;nbsp;km in length.&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kingman |first1=Andrew |title=Discover the secrets of the forest at Ndzou Camp in Manica Province | date= 2 April 2013 |url=http://www.clubofmozambique.com/solutions1/sectionnews.php?secao=tourism&amp;id=28179&amp;tipo=one |website=clubofmozambique.com |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mpunga ranger camp, located 3 km to the south of Ndzou, caters only for visitors who bring their own tents and camping gear, and who are self-sufficient in terms of food.&lt;ref name=bri/&gt; Ndzou has thatched rondavels, tents, a three-bedroom house, restaurant and bar.&lt;ref name=bri/&gt;

== Human history ==

=== Indigenous people ===
To [[Squamish people]], the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous people]] of this territory, the mountain is called ''Nch'kay''. In their [[Squamish language|language]] it means "Dirty Place" or "Grimy One".&lt;ref name="STUS"&gt;{{cite paper | author = Yumks | author2 = Reimer, Rudy | title = Squamish Traditional Use Study: Squamish Traditional Use of Nch’kay Or the Mount Garibaldi and Brohm Ridge Area | version = DRAFT | publisher = First Heritage Archaeological Consulting | date = April 2003 | url = http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/414673/d24044/1181338763782_401d3802844e42babeb6eb41577ab95b.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name of the mountain refers to the muddy water in the [[Cheekye River]].&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt; This mountain, like others located in the area, is considered sacred for it plays an important part in their [[History of the Squamish people|history]].  In their [[oral tradition|oral history]], they passed down a story of the [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]] covering the land.  During this time, only two mountains peaked over the water, and this mountain was one of them.  It was here that the remaining survivors of the flood latched their canoes to the peak and waited for the waters to subside.&lt;ref name="STUS"/&gt; The mountain also serves as weather indicator to the people, as when clouds cover the face of the mountain, it signals the coming of rain or snow.&lt;ref name="SNCL"&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Rudy | last1 = Reimer | last2=Yumks | title = Squamish Nation Cognitive Landscapes | booktitle = 39th Annual Canadian Archaeological Conference | pages = 4–5 | publisher = | date = April 2003| location = | url = http://archaeologywithoutreserve.com/Reimer%20CAA%202006%20Paper.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219153603/http://archaeologywithoutreserve.com/Reimer%20CAA%202006%20Paper.pdf | archivedate=2008-12-19|format=PDF| doi = | accessdate = 2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural ceremonial use, hunting, trapping and plant gathering occur around the Mount Garibaldi area, but the most important resource was a [[Stone tool|lithic]] material called [[obsidian]].&lt;ref name="STUS2"&gt;{{cite paper | author1 = Yumks | author2 = Reimer, Rudy | title = Squamish Traditional Use Study: Squamish Traditional Use of Nch’kay Or the Mount Garibaldi and Brohm Ridge Area | version = DRAFT | publisher = First Heritage Archaeological Consulting | date = April 2003 | url = http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/414673/d24044/1181338763782_401d3802844e42babeb6eb41577ab95b.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-05-19 | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obsidian is a black volcanic glass that was used to make knives, chisels, [[adze]]s, and other sharp tools in pre-contact times.  This material appears in sites dated to 10,000 years ago up to [[protohistoric]] time periods. The source for this material is found in upper parts of the mountain area in higher elevations that surround the mountain range.&lt;ref name="SNCL"/&gt;

=== Later history ===
British Explorer [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[George Vancouver]] reached [[Howe Sound]] in June 1792 and became the first European to see the mountain. During this time George Vancouver met and traded with the local natives in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Squamish BC Canada|url=http://www.bctravel.com/squamish/index.html |title=Welcome To Squamish – British Columbia Canada|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Giuseppe Garibaldi portrait2.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Garibaldi was named after [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in 1860]]
In 1860, while carrying out a survey of Howe Sound on board the [[Royal Navy]] survey ship [[HMS Plumper (1848)|HMS ''Plumper'']], Captain [[George Henry Richards]] was impressed by a gigantic mountain&lt;!--did he use that term?--&gt; dominating the view to the northeast. Captain Richards, and his officers, renamed the mountain after the Italian military and political leader [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who that year had succeeded in unifying [[Italy]] by patriating [[Sicily]] and [[Naples]].&lt;ref name="DF"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Government of British Columbia |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/garibaldi/ |title=Garibaldi Provincial Park |accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1907, the [[Vancouver]] mountaineers A. Dalton, W. Dalton, A. King, T. Pattison, J.J. Trorey, and G. Warren reached the summit of Mount Garibaldi.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=5329 |title=Mount Garibaldi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The views from the peak inspired the establishment of summer climbing camps at [[Garibaldi Lake]].&lt;ref name="DF"/&gt; This early interest led to the creation in 1920 of a park reserve.&lt;ref name="DF"/&gt;

In 1927, Garibaldi was made into a large wilderness park called [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]]. Named after Mount Garibaldi, this 1,946.5 square kilometre park was established to protect the rich geological history, diverse vegetation, iridescent waters, abundant wildlife, and rugged mountains, many of which are capped by glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Shangaan Webservices Inc.|url=http://www.britishcolumbia.com/parks/?id=49 |title=BC Parks – Garibaldi Provincial Park, Sea to Sky Hwy, Whistler, British Columbia|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When skiing caught on in the 1940s, Vancouver skiers began to search the [[glacier]]s and rugged mountains within the park. Early skiing was limited to the more easily reached area around [[Garibaldi Lake]].&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt; In the winter of 1944, a club group completed the first possible ski of Mount Garibaldi.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt; The famous mountaineers [[Don Munday|Don]] and [[Phyllis Munday]] completed lots of tracks additionally.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt; In the 1944–45 ''Canadian Alpine Journal'', the Mundays reported a ski attempt on Mount Garibaldi with Phil Brook, who was a friend of the Mundays.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt; They skied on Sphinx Glacier and scrabbled Panorama Ridge just north of [[Garibaldi Lake]] during the same trip. Most importantly, during this period a road was built on Paul Ridge near the small community of [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] at the north end of [[Howe Sound]], thereby affording better vehicle approach to the highlands near Mount Garibaldi.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt; With easier access Vancouver skiers spent even more time on the glaciers of Mount Garibaldi. The result of this was the formation in the 1940s of the Garibaldi Névé Traverse, an overnight adventure that (weather permitting) can include a fine descent of Mount Garibaldi.&lt;ref name="GZ"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHazBirR1hAC&amp;pg=PA93|title=Wild Snow: A Historical Guide to North American Ski Mountaineering|first=Louis W. | last=Dawson | isbn=978-0-930410-81-0|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsidiary peaks ==
[[File:MtGaribaldi-NorthFace-TheTable.jpg|thumb|right|The north face of Mount Garibaldi rises above [[The Table]] and [[Garibaldi Lake]] ]]

The broad top of Mount Garibaldi contains three named peaks. The highest peak is named as the mountain itself, reaching {{convert|2678|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="CD"/&gt; The second highest peak is the sharp pyramid of [[Atwell Peak]] at the southern edge of the summit plateau, which reaches a height of {{convert|2655|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and lies on the southwest end of Garibaldi Provincial Park.&lt;ref name="UU"/&gt; This peak is named after Atwell Duncan Francis Joseph King, leader of the first ascent of Mount Garibaldi in 1907.&lt;ref name="UU"&gt;{{cite bcgnis|id=9850 |name=Atwell Peak|accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest of the three is the rounded Dalton Dome, {{convert|2653|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, west of the highest summit.&lt;ref name="AJK"&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=7564 |title=Dalton Dome}}&lt;/ref&gt; This peak is named after Arthur Tinniswood Dalton, one of the guides of the 1907 ascent.&lt;ref name="AJK"/&gt;

A feature on the north side of the mountain, known as The Tent, reaches {{convert|2465|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and lies in Garibaldi Provincial Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=14967 |title=Tent, The (peak)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another minor summit on the south side of the mountain, {{convert|2056|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, is known as Diamond Head (sometimes Little Diamond Head) for its resemblance to [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]] in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=17301 |title=Diamond Head (mountain)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond Head was the site of a ski proposal and small lodge, now derelict. On the northwest side of Mount Garibaldi, Brohm Ridge lies outside the western boundary of Garibaldi Provincial Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=1120 |title=Brohm Ridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sharkfin sticks up out of the Warren Glacier on the northeast side of the mountain with a height of {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, just northeast of [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=14965 |title=Sharkfin, The (spur)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnar Peak rises on the south side of the mountain with a height of {{convert|1826|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, just southwest of Mamquam Lake at southwest end of Garibaldi Provincial Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=37964 |title=Columnar Peak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[pinnacle]]s of [[volcanic rock]] {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of Mount Garibaldi's summit, which attain heights of {{convert|1816|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1823|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, have been known as The Gargoyles since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=5320 |title=Gargoyles, The (peaks)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Glaciers and icefields ==

Two pocket glaciers lie right below the east side of [[Atwell Peak]], the [[Diamond Glacier (British Columbia)|Diamond Glacier]] to the southeast and the upper Bishop Glacier to the northeast. Straight north of Atwell toward Mount Garibaldi lies a small, high-elevation ice cap called the Cheekye Glacier, the name of which is associated with [[Cheekye River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=4986 |title=Cheekeye Glacier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climbing and recreation ==
[[Image:Mount Garibaldi3.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Garibaldi and The Table as seen from [[The Black Tusk]].]]

[[Mountaineering|Mountain climbing]] on Mount Garibaldi is fairly difficult; it is fairly steep-sided and involves climbing very loose rotten [[lava]] and [[volcanic ash]]. Fortunately, Mount Garibaldi has large areas of massive glaciation and extensive snowfields. The eastern and northern flanks of the mountain are smothered by the [[Garibaldi Névé]] where the finest climbing opportunities exist, making the easiest route a [[glacial]] travel or snow climb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt.

[[Hiking]], [[photography]], and [[camping]] are popular in the Garibaldi area. Several trailheads provide access to the backcountry.&lt;ref name="CU"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Government of British Columbia|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/garibaldi/ |title=Garibaldi Provincial Park|accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid to late summer, visitors pass through meadows of wildflowers along alpine trails. Garibaldi Provincial Park is also popular for winter sports, including backcountry skiing and snowshoeing.

== Geology ==
[[Image:Atwell Peak 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Atwell Peak]] ]]
Mount Garibaldi lies within the [[Coast Plutonic Complex]], which is the single largest contiguous [[granite]] outcropping in North America.&lt;ref name="ZZ"/&gt; The [[intrusion|intrusive]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s extend approximately {{convert|1800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the coast of British Columbia, the [[Alaska Panhandle]] and southwestern [[Yukon]]. This is a remnant of a once vast [[volcanic arc]] called the ''Coast Range Arc'' that formed as a result of [[subduction]] of the [[Farallon Plate|Farallon]] and [[Kula Plate]]s during the [[Jurassic]]-to-[[Eocene]] periods.&lt;ref name="ZZ"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture|url=http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/geo_history_wa/Coast%20Range%20Episode.htm |title=The Coast Range Episode (115 to 57 million years ago)|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Garibaldi, [[Mount Meager massif|Meager]], [[Mount Cayley massif|Cayley]] and [[Silverthrone Caldera|Silverthrone]] areas are of recent volcanic origin.&lt;ref name="DG"/&gt;

Mount Garibaldi is one of the few Cascade volcanoes that is made exclusively of [[dacite]] ([[Glacier Peak]] is the other).&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; The [[mountain]] has a unique asymmetrical shape because its main cone was constructed atop part of a large [[glacier]] system associated with the [[Cordilleran Ice Sheet]] that has since melted away.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; Unlike many of the other Cascade volcanoes to the south, Garibaldi does not dominate the surrounding landscape, which consists of many high, rugged peaks. Many residents of Vancouver are therefore not aware that there is a volcano closer to the city than the more easily visible [[Mount Baker]] in Washington State.

=== Origins ===
[[Image:Garibaldi Volcanic Belt-en.svg|thumb|right|350px|Map of the [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] centres, including the Mount Garibaldi area.]]
Mount Garibaldi began erupting about 250,000 years ago and has grown steadily since then.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; Like all of the Cascade volcanoes, Mount Garibaldi has its origins in the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]—a long convergent plate boundary that stretches from mid-[[Vancouver Island]] to [[Northern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network |url=http://www.pnsn.org/HAZARDS/CASCADIA/cascadia_zone.html |title=The Cascadia Subduction Zone – What is it?

=== Structure ===
[[Image:Mount Garibaldi topographic map-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Topographic map of the Garibaldi area]]

Mount Garibaldi is the largest volcano in southernmost British Columbia. Like other [[stratovolcano]]es, it is composed of many layers of hardened lava, [[tephra]], and volcanic ash. Eruptions are explosive in nature, and the most common form is the [[Peléan eruption|Peléan]] style, which involves [[viscous]] [[magma]], glowing avalanches of hot [[volcanic ash]] and [[pyroclastic flow]]s.&lt;ref name="PP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt; The source magma of this rock is classified as [[acid]]ic, having high to intermediate levels of [[silica]] (as in [[rhyolite]], [[dacite]], or [[andesite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Petty M.

Mount Garibaldi is known both for the very high quality exposures of its internal structure and for its conspicuous [[topography|topographic]] anomalies, which can be attributed to the growth of the mountain onto a large glacier system and the subsequent collapse of the flanks of the volcano with the melting of the ice.&lt;ref name="SLV"/&gt; The western flanks of the mountain expose basement rocks, sheared and altered [[quartz]] [[diorite]], carved by streams and glaciers into a rugged topography with relief up to {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="SLV"/&gt; Valleys in this jagged surface have been filled with 0.52 to 0.22 million year old [[dacite]] and [[andesite]] flows, [[tuff]] [[breccia]]s, and [[lava dome|domes]], precursors of the activity at Mount Garibaldi.&lt;ref name="SLV"/&gt; About {{convert|0.8|cumi|km3|1}} of material remains in the volcano.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; In modern times, the apron of material around the volcano's main vent extends at least {{convert|4.8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from its source in places that were covered by ice. In other areas its extent is less and its slope is steeper.

Stratovolcanoes are a common feature of subduction zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire|url=http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH3/Group1/Website/Stratovolcano.html |title=Stratovolcanoes |accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magma that forms them arises when water, which is trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous [[basalt]] rock of the upper oceanic crust, is released into [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] rock of the [[asthenosphere]] above the sinking oceanic slab. The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressure/temperature conditions for specific minerals as the plate subducts to lower depths. The water freed from the subducting slab lowers the [[melting point]] of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily at the base of the [[lithosphere]]. The magma then rises through the [[crust (geology)|crust]], incorporating silica rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate composition. When the magma nears the surface it pools in a [[magma chamber]] under the volcano. The relatively low pressure of the magma allows water and other [[volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) dissolved in the magma to begin to come out of solution, much like when a bottle of [[carbonated water]] is opened.&lt;ref name="QYT"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USGS|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/StratoVolcano/description_composite_volcano.html |title=Composite Volcanoes and Stratovolcanoes, Subduction-Zone Volcanoes |accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a critical volume of magma and gas accumulates, the obstacle provided by the [[volcanic cone]] is overcome, leading to a sudden [[explosive eruption]].&lt;ref name="QYT"/&gt;

=== Ancestral stages of eruptive activity ===
[[Image:Mount Garibaldi outline.jpg|thumb|right|Red outline indicates the ancestral volcano]]
The mountain grew in three phases. Garibaldi's first phase resulted in the creation of a broad composite cone made of dacite and [[breccia]] that has been [[potassium-argon dating|potassium-argon dated]] to 250,000 years old.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; Parts of this "proto-Garibaldi" or ancestral volcano are exposed on Garibaldi's lower northern and eastern flanks and on the upper {{convert|240|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} of Brohm Ridge. Around where Columnar Peak and possibly [[Glacier Pikes]] are now located, a series of coalescing dacite [[lava dome]]s were constructed.  During the ensuing long period of dormancy, the [[Cheekye River]] cut a deep valley into the cone's western flank that was later filled with a glacier.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt;

After reaching its maximum extent the Cheekye Glacier along with part of the area's [[ice sheet]] were covered with [[volcanic ash]] and fragmented debris from Garibaldi. This period of growth began with the eruption of the [[Atwell Peak]] plug dome from a ridge surrounded by the several thousand foot ice sheet. As the plug dome rose, massive sheets of broken lava crumbled as [[Scree|talus]] down its sides. Numerous [[Peléan eruption|Peléan]] [[pyroclastic flow]]s (consisting of a super-heated mix of [[gas]], ash, and [[pumice]]) accompanied these cooler avalanches, forming a fragmental cone {{convert|6.3|km3|cumi|1}} in volume and an overall slope of 12 to 15 degrees. ([[Erosion]] has since steepened this slope.)&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; Some of the glacial ice was melted by the eruptions, forming a small [[lake]] against Brohm Ridge's southern arm. The volcanic [[sandstone]]s seen today atop Brohm Ridge were created by ash settling in this lake.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"&gt;{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Stephen L. | title = Fire Mountains of the West: The Cascade and Mono Lake Volcanoes| publisher = [[Mountain Press Publishing Company]] | year=  1988 | pages= 283–288 | isbn = 0-87842-220-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Elfin Lakes, Opal Cone.jpg|thumb|right|Elfin Lakes and [[Opal Cone]] on Garibaldi's southeast flank]]

Glacial overlap was most significant on the west and somewhat to the south.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; Subsequent melting of the ice sheet and its component glaciers initiated a series of avalanches and [[mudflow]]s on Garibaldi's western flank that moved nearly half of the original cone's volume into the Squamish Valley.&lt;ref name="CD"&gt;{{cite gvp | vnum=1200-20-|title=Garibaldi|accessdate= 2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series of [[debris flow]]s carried {{convert|2.5|km3|cumi|1}} of the mountain into the Squamish Valley where it covers {{convert|10|sqmi|km2|0}} to a thickness of about {{convert|300|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; Gaps left by melting ice caused minor to moderate cone distortion where the ice sheet was thin and major distortion where it was thick. The ice was thickest in and thus cone distortion was greatest over the buried Cheekye valley.

Soon before or after the buried ice had melted away, [[dacite]] lava quietly erupted from [[Opal Cone]] southeast of the [[Atwell Peak]] plug dome 10,700 to 9,300 years ago&lt;ref name="PP"/&gt; and flowed {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} down [[Ring Creek]] on Garibaldi's southern and southwestern flanks without encountering any residual glacial ice.&lt;ref name="SLV"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood | first1=Charles A. | last2=Kienle|first2=Jürgen| chapter= | pages= | title=Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada | year=2001 | edition= | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location=[[Cambridge]], [[England]]| isbn= 978-0-521-43811-7|oclc= 27910629}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the lava flows traveled down a 30% to 35% grade over the landslide scar on the western flank.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; About {{convert|0.15|cumi|km3|2}} of dacite erupted in Garibaldi's third period of activity.&lt;ref name="88HarrisSL"/&gt; This lava forms a thin layer of solid rock on the southern and western sides of the volcano and contains well-defined lava flow margin levees.&lt;ref name="PP"/&gt; The Ring Creek lava flow is very unusual because lengthy lava flows are usually attained by fluid [[basalt]] flows, but the Ring Creek flow is [[dacite]].&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt;

== Volcanic hazards ==
[[Image:Squamish valley.jpg|thumb|left|Looking southward down the Squamish valley from the Siguard Creek trail lookout. Mount Garibaldi can be seen prominently in the background.]]
Volcanic eruptions in Canada rarely cause fatalities because of their remoteness and low level of activity. The only known fatality due to volcanic activity in Canada occurred at the [[Tseax Cone]] in 1775, when a {{convert|22.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long [[basalt]]ic lava flow travelled down the [[Tseax River|Tseax]] and [[Nass River]]s, destroying a [[Nisga'a]] village and killing approximately 2,000 people by [[volcanic gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;

The hazard from lava flows would be low to moderate because the nature of the lavas would prevent them from travelling far from their source, even though the [[Ring Creek]] lava flow ends only {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Squamish.&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt; Magma with high to intermediate levels of [[silica]] (as in [[andesite]], [[dacite]] or [[rhyolite]]) commonly move slowly and typically cover small areas to form steep-sided mounds called [[lava dome]]s.&lt;ref name="IGJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lava Flows and Their Effects|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/lava/index.php|author=USGS|accessdate=2007-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lava domes often grow by the extrusion of many individual flows less than {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} thick over a period of several months or years.&lt;ref name="IGJ"/&gt; Such flows will overlap one another and typically move less than a few meters per hour.&lt;ref name="IGJ"/&gt; Lava flows with high to intermediate levels of silica rarely extend more than {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from their source; for example, Garibaldi's {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long Ring Creek [[dacite]] lava flow.

=== Landslides ===
In the past, Garibaldi has had large [[debris flow]]s. A section of the mountain collapsed into the [[Cheakamus River]] valley when the glacier Garibaldi was built on melted, creating a jagged unstable slope at the head of the [[Cheekye River]].&lt;ref name="GHJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living in the shadow of volcanoes |work=Geoscape Vancouver |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2008-01-04 |url=http://geoscape.nrcan.gc.ca/vancouver/living_e.php |accessdate=2008-07-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125035850/http://geoscape.nrcan.gc.ca/vancouver/living_e.php |archivedate=2005-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated landslides from this steep cliff have created a huge debris fan at the mouth of the Cheekye River just north of [[Brackendale, British Columbia|Brackendale]] called the [[Cheekye Fan]].&lt;ref name="GHJ"/&gt; Danger from future collapses have limited the growth of Brackendale onto the fan.&lt;ref name="GHJ"/&gt;

The steep northern edge of [[The Barrier]] in the Garibaldi area has partly collapsed several times, the most recent being in 1855–56.&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt; This collapse created a large boulder field below it, which gave [[Rubble Creek]] its name.&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt; Danger from future collapses prompted the provincial government to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1981. This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of [[Garibaldi, British Columbia|Garibaldi]] nearby, and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone.&lt;ref name="AW"/&gt; Although imminent danger is unlikely, special regulations exist to warn potential danger and to minimize the risk to life and property in the event of a landslide.&lt;ref name="CU"/&gt;

== Monitoring ==
[[Image:Mount Garibaldi1.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Garibaldi]]
Currently, Mount Garibaldi is not monitored closely enough by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] to ascertain how active the volcano's magma system is.&lt;ref name="KIO"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Natural Resources Canada |url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/mon_e.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yTgBuL9K?url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/mon_e.php |archivedate=2011-05-06 |title=Volcanoes of Canada: Monitoring volcanoes |accessdate=2008-05-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing network of [[seismometer|seismographs]] has been established to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the mountain.&lt;ref name="KIO"/&gt; It may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption.&lt;ref name="KIO"/&gt; It might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting.&lt;ref name="KIO"/&gt;

A possible way to detect an eruption is studying Garibaldi's geological history since every volcano has its own pattern of behaviour, in terms of its eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions.&lt;ref name="KIO"/&gt;

While there is a likelihood of Canada being critically affected by local or close by volcanic eruptions argues that some kind of improvement program is required.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; Benefit-cost thoughts are critical to dealing with natural hazards.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; However, a benefit-cost examination needs correct data about the hazard types, magnitudes and occurrences. These do not exist for volcanoes in British Columbia or elsewhere in Canada in the detail required.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;

Other volcanic techniques, such as hazard mapping, displays a volcano's eruptive history in detail and speculates an understanding of the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; At present no hazard maps have been created for Mount Garibaldi because the level of knowledge is insufficient due to its remoteness.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; The majority of information has been collected in a lengthy, separate way from the support of several employees, such as [[volcanologist]]s and other geologic [[scientist]]s. Current knowledge is best established at the [[Mount Meager massif]] north of Mount Garibaldi and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; An intensive program classifying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;

[[Image:Mount Garibaldi4.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Garibaldi close up from Tantalus]]
The existing network of seismographs to monitor tectonic earthquakes has existed since 1975, although it remained small in population until 1985.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; Apart from a few short-term seismic monitoring experiments by the Geological Survey of Canada, no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at Mount Garibaldi or at other volcanoes in Canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; Active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and frequently within {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors, particularly for earthquake depth.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; Such monitoring detects the risk of an eruption, offering a forecasting capability which is important to mitigating volcanic risk.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; Currently Mount Garibaldi does not have a seismograph closer than {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; With increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity, the prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location accuracy and depth decreases, and the network becomes less accurate.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; The inaccurate earthquake locations in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt are a few kilometers, and in more isolated northern regions they are up to {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; The location magnitude level in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is about magnitude 1 to 1.5, and elsewhere it is magnitude 1.5 to 2.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; At carefully monitored volcanoes both the located and noticed events are recorded and surveyed immediately to improve the understanding of a future eruption.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; Undetected events are not recorded or surveyed in British Columbia immediately, nor in an easy-to-access process.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;

In countries like Canada it is possible that small precursor earthquake swarms might go undetected, particularly if no events were observed; more significant events in larger swarms would be detected but only a minor subdivision of the swarm events would be complex to clarify them with confidence as volcanic in nature, or even associate them with an individual volcanic edifice.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;

== Garibaldi Lake volcanic field ==
[[Image:Mount Garibaldi and Garibaldi Lake from 2150 meters.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Garibaldi, The Table and Garibaldi Lake viewed from {{convert|2150|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}]]
{{main|Garibaldi Lake volcanic field}}

Mount Garibaldi is associated with a group of small volcanoes that form the Garibaldi Lake [[volcanic field]]. An unusual volcanic structure called [[The Table]] is located between [[Garibaldi Lake]] and Mount Garibaldi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite bcgnis|id=16718 |title=Table, The (mountain)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This several-hundred-foot-high flat-topped volcano is made of layers of [[andesite|andesitic]] dacite that are arranged like a stack of more or less equal sized [[pancake]]s. The Table was formed in the early [[Holocene]] at a time when the Cordilleran [[ice sheet]] covered the region.&lt;ref name="AH"/&gt; As the volcano's lava rose it melted the part of the ice sheet above The Table's vent, creating space for the lava to move into. Repeated eruptions constructed the steep-walled stack of lava seen today.

[[The Black Tusk]] is a large spire of extensively eroded dark [[volcanic rock]] that is shaped like a [[Walrus]] [[tusk]]. It is considered to be the remnant of an [[extinct volcano|extinct]] [[andesite|andesitic]] [[stratovolcano]] which formed between about 1.3 and 1.1 million years ago.&lt;ref name="AH"/&gt;

[[Mount Price (British Columbia)|Mount Price]], west of Garibaldi Lake, 5&amp;nbsp;km south of The Black Tusk, was formed in three stages of activity, dating back 1.1 million years, the latest of which produced two large [[lava|lava flows]] from [[Clinker Peak]] during the early Holocene that ponded against the retreating continental [[ice sheet]] and formed [[The Barrier]], containing Garibaldi Lake.&lt;ref name="AH"&gt;{{cite gvp |vnum=1200-19- |title=Garibaldi Lake|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinder Cone (British Columbia)|Cinder Cone]] stands {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above a gap between two arms of Helmet Glacier on Garibaldi's flanks. During summer its [[Volcanic crater|crater]] is filled with a snow melt lake.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2538">The first '''[[Canada|Canadian]] National Ambient [[Air Quality]] Objectives''' were developed in the mid-1970s. These objectives were set for various [[air pollutants]]. The NAAQO had three levels indicating severity  (maximum desirable, acceptable and tolerable levels) and also evaluated effect levels (maximum desirable, acceptable and tolerable levels).

In 1992, a review of the NAAQOs suggested that many air pollutants had no effect thresholds (e.g. [[ozone|tropospheric ozone]] or very low effect thresholds). As such, scientifically defensible effect levels could not be identified. In 2000, the revised NAAQOs framework specifies a '''Reference Level''', above which there are demonstrated effects on human health and/or the environment, and an '''Air Quality Objective''' (AQO), which is meant to be protective for the general public and environment and which also considers aspects of technical feasibility. This approach is different from how the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] are set in the [[US]], where cost is explicitly not considered in the proposal to strengthen the air quality standards to protect human health and the environment. In addition, the US NAAQS are periodically reviewed, frequently strengthened, commonly enforced and allow serious legal penalties if the standards are not met. In contrast, the Canadian NAAQOs are infrequently reviewed, rarely strengthened, not enforced, and the only penalty for not meeting the Canadian NAAQOs is shame.

The original NAAQOs have not been formally revised to the new two-level system. As an interim approach, data are compared with the existing desirable and acceptable NAAQOs for sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone.

The air quality objectives must be consistent with the [[Canadian Environmental Protection Act]] (CEPA) 1999. They must also be based on scientific principles, such as risk assessment and risk management. The NAAQOs are set by the federal government based on recommendations from a National Advisory Committee and Working Group on Air Quality Objectives and Guidelines. Provincial governments have the option of adopting these either as objectives or as enforceable standards according to their legislation.

The '''Natural Capital Initiative''' (NCI) is a partnership of UK organisations which promotes and supports decision-making across government, business and the private sector that results in the sustainable management of our [[natural capital]].&lt;ref name=CEH&gt;{{cite web|title=The Natural Capital Initiative|url=https://www.ceh.ac.uk/natural-capital-initiative|website=www.ceh.ac.uk|publisher=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2009, it is a partnership between two of the UK's learned societies and two of its scientific research institutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/public-policy/natural-capital-initiative/|publisher=British Ecological Society|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely: 
*[[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]]
*[[Royal Society of Biology]]
*[[British Ecological Society]]
*[[James Hutton Institute]].

==Aims==
Its stated mission is "to support decision-making that results in the sustainable management of our natural capital based on sound science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/about/|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|publisher=National Capital Initiative|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to provide decision-makers from UK government, academia, business, and civil society with a high-level forum for cross-sectoral dialogue on how to realise the UK government's stated objective of embedding [[natural capital]] thinking in policy and practice, and it does this based upon sound evidence from across the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name=CEH/&gt;

The four main objectives of the Natural Capital Initiative are to:

*Inform the Government's implementation of the [[Ecosystem Approach|ecosystems approach]] - a framework for looking at whole ecosystems in decision-making and valuing the services they provide.
*Identify gaps in science, policy and implementation that inhibit an ecosystems approach.
*Work with government, parliament, agencies, [[NGO]]s, the private sector, scientific bodies and the wider public.
*Inspire the next generation to engage in the sustainable use of the natural environment.

The NCI was established in 2009 in response to the increasing global awareness of the need for more sustainable management of the world's limited natural resources,&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Educating human capital for the preservation of natural capital|url=http://consciouscomms.com/educating-human-capital-for-the-preservation-of-natural-capital/|website=consciouscomms.com|publisher=Conscious Communications|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as highlighted by the 2005 [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Milliennium Ecosystem Assessment|url=http://millenniumassessment.org/en/About.html|website=millenniumassessment.org|publisher=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in April 2009 at a three-day [[symposium]] held in London, entitled ''Valuing our Life Support Systems''. Its conclusions were published in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Our Life Support Systems: Symposium Report|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nci_full_lo-2.pdf|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Our Life Support Systems: Symposium Report Executive Summary|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nci_summary_lo-2.pdf|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|publisher=Natural Capital Initiative|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DEFRA&gt;{{cite web|title=What nature can do for you|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/396840/pb13897-nature-do-for-you.pdf|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=DEFRA|accessdate=7 March 2016|page=23|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the James Hutton Institute announced it was joining the partnership.&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;{{cite web|title=James Hutton Institute joins the Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.hutton.ac.uk/news/james-hutton-institute-joins-natural-capital-initiative|website=www.hutton.ac.uk|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the NCI held a second major symposium/summit, entitled: ‘Valuing our Life Support Systems’ with the aim of pushing forward the shared natural capital agenda.&lt;ref name=CEH/&gt;

The Chair of the NCI (as at 2016) is Professor Alison Hester of the [[James Hutton Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCI Chair|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/secretariat/|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The Natural Capital Initiative has been recognised as one of the key groups or organisations in the UK now examining the main issues surrounding the depletion of natural resources and in encouraging the preservation of natural capital.&lt;ref name=Hutton/&gt; 

Its 2009 symposium recommendations are included in the UK government own recommendations and resource documents to senior policy-makers.&lt;ref name=DEFRA/&gt;

In recent years the NCI's support for the development of high-level policy based on sound science, and in line with an ecosystems approach to decision-making, has transferred into reality in a number of ways. In particular, the [[Natural Capital Committee]], supported by [[DEFRA]], evolved out of the UK Government's 2011 'Natural Environment White Paper', as did the 48 [[Local Nature Partnership]]s now established across England which focus on sustainable land management, greening economic growth and human health and wellbeing.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

In 2014 the NCI called on the UK government to introduce a [[natural capital accounting]] element into its [[National accounts|national accounting framework]], and supported the Natural Capital Committee's own proposal for a 25-year Government plan for the UK Natural Environment, which is now under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative urges Government act now to reverse decline in natural capital|url=https://www.rsb.org.uk/news/14-news/1122-natural-capital-initiative-urges-government-to-act-now-to-reverse-decline-in-natural-capital|website=www.rsb.org.uk|publisher=Royal Society of Biology|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government will produce a 25 year plan for the natural environment|url=http://esinternational.com/government-will-produce-a-25-year-plan-for-the-natural-environment/|website=esinternational.com|publisher=ESI|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the NCI published a symposium report, entitled 'Valuing our Life Support Systems', which was launched at a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] event on 25 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing our Life Support Systems Report Launch|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/valuing-our-life-support-systems-report-launch-/|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was chaired by [[Barry Gardiner|Barry Gardiner MP]]. The report spelled out the need for a methodology to be established for valuing natural capital. It also raised concerns there was a danger that natural capital could be treated as a commodity unless an ethical framework was in place to ensure the process of natural capital valuation was applied fairly and evenly. It urged that all natural capital concepts needed to be clear, evidence-based and robust, and it welcomed the Government's proposal to extend the life of the Natural Capital Committee until at least the end of that current parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative: Valuing our Life Support Systems Report|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/Valuingourlifesupportsystemssummaryfinal.pdf|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=Houses of Parliament|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|I love this report...I shall steal shamelessly [from it]...I thought the phrase "''The UK is a world leader in environmental science and in writing policy; it is not a world leader in taking subsequent action''" was just gorgeous; it should be written in capital letters over the entrance of [[DEFRA]]!...There has been avoidable failure by government.

{{Libertarian socialism |expanded=Philosophies}}
'''Neozapatismo''' or '''Neozapatism''' (sometimes mislabeled as '''[[Zapatismo]]''') is the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[ideology]] behind movements such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]. The official anthem of Neozapatismo and the Zapatista territories is the [[Himno Zapatista]]. The ideology is based on [[anarchism]], [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] tradition, [[Marxism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/6664#attachments |title=Morgan Rodgers Gibson (2009) 'The Role of Anarchism in Contemporary Anti-Systemic Social Movements', Website of Abahlali Mjondolo, December, 2009 |publisher=Abahlali.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/7619 |title=Morgan Rodgers Gibson (2010) 'Anarchism, the State and the Praxis of Contemporary Antisystemic Social Movements, December, 2010 |publisher=Abahlali.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://fiq.ischool.utoronto.ca/index.php/fiq/article/view/104/256 The Zapatista Effect: Information Communication Technology Activism and Marginalized Communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816101810/https://fiq.ischool.utoronto.ca/index.php/fiq/article/view/104/256 |date=2011-08-16 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; the thoughts of [[Emiliano Zapata]], and the thoughts of [[Subcomandante Marcos|Subcomandante Insurgente Galeano]]. Neozapatismo is the ideology of the Zapatistas, who govern a [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities|large territory]] in [[Chiapas]] and have since the beginning of the [[Chiapas conflict]]. Neozapatismo has no official founder, but its thoughts are mainly attributed to Subcomandante Insurgente Galeano (formerly Subcomandante Marcos) and [[Emiliano Zapata]]. The Neozapatista ideology is believed to be derived largely from [[libertarian socialism]], [[libertarian Marxism]] (including [[autonomism]]), [[social anarchism]], [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|anarcho-collectivism]], [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[communalism]], [[direct democracy]], and [[radical democracy]].

===Agrarianism===
{{Main|Agrarianism}}
[[Emiliano Zapata]], the man of which Neozapatismo is named after, was a strong Agrarianist in Mexico. He personally led rebels against the Mexican government in order to redistribute plantation land to the farm workers. Zapata began to protest the seizure of land by wealthy plantation owners, but his protest did not achieve his goal, so he turned to violence. This cause of redistribution was Zapata's true life's goal, he often symbolizes the Agrarianist cause in Mexico today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/emiliano-zapata-9540356|title=Emiliano Zapata|website=Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] have made similar Agrarianist demands such as [[land reform]] mandated by the 1917 [[Constitution of Mexico]] but largely ignored by the governing [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]].{{sfn|O'Neil et al.|2006|p=377}} When negotiating with the government the EZLN did not demand independence from Mexico, but rather [[autonomy]], and (among other things) that the [[natural resource]]s extracted from Chiapas benefit more directly the people of Chiapas.

===Libertarian socialism===
{{Main|Libertarian socialism}}
Neozapatismo often relies of [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] economic theories. The most well-known concept of Neozapatismo is its opposition to capitalist globalization. On the signing of the famed globalization promoting [[NAFTA]] treaty the Zapatista rebels revolted, believing the signing of the treaty to have a negative economic effect on the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]]. The signing of [[NAFTA]] also resulted in the removal of Article 27, Section VII, from the [[Mexican Constitution]], which had guaranteed land reparations to indigenous groups throughout Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2014/1/3/zapatista_uprising_20_years_later_how|title=Zapatista Uprising 20 Years Later: How Indigenous Mexicans Stood Up Against NAFTA “Death Sentence”|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economics of the Zapatista occupied [[Chiapas]] is based on [[collectivism]] using the cooperative model with [[syndicalist]] aspects. The means of production are cooperatively owned by the public and there are no supervisors or owners of the property. All economic activity is local and self-sufficient, but products may be sold to the international market for fundraising purposes. The most famous examples of this model are the [[Zapatista coffee cooperatives]] that bring in the most income for the Zapatista movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexicosolidarity.org/programs/alternativeeconomy/zapatismo/en|title=Autonomous University of Social Movements|website=mexicosolidarity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the Zapatistas have been steadfast in  resisting the violence of [[neoliberalism]] by practicing  horizontal autonomy and mutual aid.  Zapatista communities continue to build and maintain their own anti-systemic health, education, and sustainable agro-ecological systems.

Zapatista cooperatives are governed by the general assembly of the workers which is the supreme body of the cooperatives, it is convened at least once a year and elects a new administrative council every 3 years. Through their operation, the workers don’t depend on the local or global market. Through the collective organization and the cooperation with the solidarity networks at their disposal, the workers receive one price for their product or service that can cover the cost of work while also bringing workers a dignified income, which increases over the years. Workers may gain access to common structures and technical support. For as long as the cooperatives develop and improve their functions, they contribute some amount of their income to the autonomous programs of education, health, and to other social structures. Furthermore, the movements that participate in the fundraising solidarity networks of disposal return some amount of their incomes to the Zapatista communities.

===Theory of capitalism===
{{Main|Criticism of capitalism}}
[[Subcomandante Marcos]] has also written an essay in which he claims that the [[neoliberalism]] and [[globalization]] constitute the "Fourth World War".&lt;ref name="fourth"&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nep/v002/2.3marcos.html The Fourth World War Has Begun] by Subcomandante Marcos, trans. Nathalie de Broglio, Neplantla: Views from South, Duke University Press: 2001, Vol. 2 Issue 3: 559-572&lt;/ref&gt; He termed the [[Cold War]] as the "Third World War."&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; In this essay, Marcos compares and contrasts his Third World War (the Cold War) with his termed "Fourth World War", which he says is a new type of war that we find ourselves in now: "If the Third World War saw the confrontation of capitalism and socialism on various terrains and with varying degrees of intensity, the fourth will be played out between large financial centers, on a global scale, and at a tremendous and constant intensity."&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; He goes on to say that [[economic globalization]] has created devastation through financial policies:&lt;ref name="fourth" /&gt; These views are not shared by all Zapatistas but have influenced Neozapatismo and Neozapatista thinking.

==Political organization==
[[File:Zapatismo Idea.jpg|thumbnail|An image of the origins of the Neozapatismo idea.]]

===Democracy===
{{Main|Direct democracy}}
Zapatista communities are organized in an anarchistic manner. All decisions are made by a decentralized [[direct democracy]] in an autonomous manner. The original goal for this organization was for all the indigenous groups in Mexico to have autonomous government, today in the Zapatista territory the Mexican government has no control.&lt;ref name="solidarity-us.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://solidarity-us.org/node/226|title=Mexico: The Zapatistas' New Fight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The councils in which the community may meet and vote on local issues in the Zapatista [[Chiapas]] are called the [[Councils of Good Government]]. In a [[Direct Democracy]] any issue may be voted on, any issue may be brought up to be voted on, and all decisions are passed by a majority vote. There are no restrictions on who may govern or who may vote. Since December 1994, the Zapatistas had been gradually forming several [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous municipalities]], called [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities]] (MAREZ). In these municipalities, an assembly of local representatives forms the ''Juntas de Buen Gobierno'' or [[Councils of Good Government]] (JBGs).

The Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities are run in various communities, the general assemblies meet for a week to decide on various aspects concerning the community. The assemblies are open to everyone, without a formal bureaucracy. The decisions made by the communities are then passed to elected delegates whose job is to pass the information to a board of delegates. The delegates can be revoked and also serve on a rotation basis. In this way, it is expected that the largest number of people may express their points of view.

===Unorganization===
{{Main|Unorganisation}}
Any military "commanders" within the movement have no actual power, they may not force anyone to do anything. Military leaders only serve as revolutionary vanguards, to educate those unaware of the movement and to fight for the movement. Some "commanders" are simply spokespeople for the movement, some of the more famed spokespeople like Marcos, are only characters whose public statements are controlled and decided by the leading activists' consensus. If any soldiers of the Zapatista movement act in a brutal or unjust manner, the Zapatistas allow others to act against that soldier. No member of Zapatista forces has any real power over another.

==Social concepts==

===Feminism===
{{Main|Anarcha-feminism}}
Neozapatismo is a heavily [[Feminist]] philosophy. Women are viewed as equals to men and some women such as [[Comandante Ramona]] and [[Subcomandante Elisa]] were leaders in the Zapatista movement. In the 1990s, one-third of the insurgents were women and half of the Zapatista support base was women.

Even though feminism is seen as a result of Westernization, indigenous Mayan women have struggled to “draw on and navigate Western ideologies while preserving and attempting to reclaim some indigenous traditions...which have been eroded with the imposition of dominant western culture and ideology."&lt;ref name="sites.psu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hymn|first1=Soneile|title=Indigenous Feminism in Southern Mexico|url=http://sites.psu.edu/illichjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/13963/2013/06/hymn4.pdf|publisher=The International Journal of Illich Studies 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous feminism is invested in women's struggles, indigenous people, and look to their heritage for solutions while using some western ideas for achieving feminism.

Zapatista women are invested in the collective struggle of Neozapatismo, and of women in general. Ana Maria, one of the movement leaders, said in an interview that women "participated in the first of January(Zapatista Uprising)... the women’s struggle is 	the struggle of everybody. In EZLN, we do not fight for our own interests but struggle against every situation that exists in Mexico; against all the injustice, all the marginalization, all the poverty, and all the exploitation that Mexican women suffer. Our struggle in EZLN is not for women in Chiapas but for all the Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=Yun-Joo|title=Constructing New Meanings through Traditional Values : Feminism and the Promotion of Women's Rights in the Mexican Zapatista Movement|url=http://www.ajlas.org/v2006/paper/2007vol20no305.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of Western Capitalism makes flexibility in gender and labor roles more difficult than the indigenous cultures traditional labor. “Indigenous women’s entry into the money economy has been analyzed as making their domestic and subsistence work evermore dispensable to the reproduction of the labor force and thus reducing women’s power within the family. Indigenous men have been 	forced by the need to help provide for the family in the globalized capitalist economic system that favors paid economic labor while depending on female subordination and unpaid subsistence labor. These ideals are internalized by many workers and imported back into the communities.”&lt;ref name="sites.psu.edu"/&gt; This capitalistic infiltration harmed Gender role, they were becoming more and more restrictive and polarized with the growing imposition of external factors on indigenous communities. Ever since the arrival of the Europeans and their clear distinction in the views of feminine home makers and masculine laborers.

Indigenous feminism also created more collaboration and contact between indigenous and mestiza women in the informal sector. After the emergence of the Zapatistas, more collaboration started to take place, and six months after the EZLN uprising, the first Chiapas State Women’s Convention was held. Six months after that, the National Women’s Convention was held in Querétaro; it included over three hundred women from fourteen different states.&lt;ref name="sites.psu.edu"/&gt;  In August 1997, the first National Gathering of Indigenous Women took place in the state of Oaxaca, it was organized by indigenous women and was attended by over 400 women. One of the most prevalent issues discussed in the conventions, was the relations between mestiza women and indigenous women. Oftentimes it became the situation where the mestiza women tended to “help” and the indigenous women were the one being “helped.”

The Zapatistas’ movement was the first time a guerrilla movement held women’s liberation as part of the goal for the uprising. Major Ana Maria&lt;ref&gt;[[Women in the EZLN#Major Ana Maria]]&lt;/ref&gt;—who was not only the woman who lead the EZLN capture of San Cristobal de las Casas during the uprising, but also one of the women who helped create the Women’s Revolutionary Law,&lt;ref&gt;[[Women in the EZLN#Women.27s Revolutionary Law]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ‘A general law was made, but there was no women’s law. And so we protested and said that there has to be a women’s law when we make our demands. We also want the government to recognize us as women. The right to have equality, equality of men and women.’ The Women’s Revolutionary Law came about through a woman named Susana and Comandanta Ramona&lt;ref&gt;[[Women in the EZLN#Comandante Ramona]]&lt;/ref&gt; traveling to dozens of communities and to ask the opinions of thousands of women. The Women’s Revolutionary Law was released along with the rest of the Zapatista demands aimed at the government during their public uprising on New Years Day of 1994.

===Women's Revolutionary Law===
{{Main|Women in the EZLN}}
On the day of the uprising, the EZLN announced the Women’s Revolutionary Law with the other Revolutionary Laws. The [[Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee]] created and approved of these laws which were developed through with consultation of indigenous women. The Women’s Revolutionary Law strived to change “traditional patriarchal domination” and it addressed many of the grievances that Chiapas women had.{{sfn|Rovira|2000|p=5}} These laws coincided with the EZLN’s attempt to “shift power away from the center to marginalized sectors."{{sfn|Rovira|2000|p=6}} The follow are the ten laws that comprised the Women’s Revolutionary Law.

#Women have the right to participate in the revolutionary struggle in the place and at the level that their capacity and will dictates without any discrimination based on race, creed, color, or political affiliation.
#Women have the right to work and to receive a just salary.
#Women have the right to decide on the number of children they have and take care of.
#Women have the right to participate in community affairs and hold leadership positions if they are freely and democratically elected.
#Women have the right to primary care in terms of their health and nutrition.
#Women have the right to education.
#Women have the right to choose who they are with (i.e. choose their romantic/sexual partners) and should not be obligated to marry by force.
#No woman should be beaten or physically mistreated by either family members or strangers. Rape and attempted rape should be severely punished.
#Women can hold leadership positions in the organization and hold military rank in the revolutionary armed forces.
#Women have all the rights and obligations set out by the revolutionary laws and regulations.{{sfn|Rodriguez|1998|p=150}}

===Postcolonialism===
{{Main|Postcolonialism}}
Zapatismo focuses heavily on [[Postcolonialism]] specifically [[Gaze#Postcolonial gaze|postcolonial gaze]]. First referred to by Edward Said as "orientalism", the term "post-colonial gaze" is used to explain how colonial powers treated the people of colonized countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|title=Orientalism|year=1978|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the colonized in a position of the "other" helped to shape and establish the colonial's identity as being the powerful conqueror, and acted as a constant reminder of this idea of subjectivity.

The theory of [[Gaze#Postcolonial gaze|postcolonial gaze]] studies the impacts of colonization on formerly colonized peoples and how these peoples overcome past colonial discrimination and marginalization by colonialists and their descendants.&lt;ref name="Lunga 2008 191–199"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lunga|first=Victoria|title=Postcolonial Theory: A Language for a Critique of Globalization|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|year=2008|volume=7|issue=3/4|pages=191–199|doi=10.1163/156914908x371349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, postcolonial gaze is being fostered predominantly in areas of large indigenous populations and prejudice, like the Chiapas. The Zapatistas not only raised many arguments about the consequences of capitalist globalization; it also questioned the long-standing ideas created by the Spanish colonialism.

==Cultural concepts==
{{Main|Anti-globalization movement}}
The Zapatista are famous for their armed revolt against [[globalization]] in their uprising, starting the [[Chiapas conflict]]. After the revolt the Zapatista controlled territory was mainly isolated from the rest of Mexico. The Zapatistas dislike the continuous pressure of modern technology on their people, preferring instead slow advancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cronkite.asu.edu/buffett/chiapas/for-zapatistas-revolution-moves-at-a-snails-pace-while-global-appeal-endures/|title=For Zapatistas, revolution moves at a snail’s pace while global appeal endures - Chiapas: State of Revolution|first=Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass|last=Communication|website=cronkite.asu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the locals speak in pre-Columbian languages indigenous to the area, rejecting the Spanish language's spread across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/glimpse-zapatista-movement-two-decades-later/|title=A Glimpse Into the Zapatista Movement, Two Decades Later - The Nation|first=Laura|last=Gottesdiener|publisher=|via=www.thenation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatistas teach local indigenous [[Mayan culture]] and practices. Official Mexican schools are criticized as not teaching [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] heritage or indigenous languages, while teaching of Zapatista evils and beating Zapatista children. In Zapatista schools the history of the Spanish colonization is taught with the history of the Tseltal, and the values of individualism, competition, consumerism and private property are seriously questioned and replaced with values like the community and solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roarmag.org/2014/01/zapatista-autonomous-education-chiapas/|title=ROAR Magazine|website=roarmag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are often taught in local indigenous languages such as the [[Ch’ol language]]. Although local's culture is held in a prideful light, the Zapatistas are quick to criticize and change culture to fit more leftist ideals. Women in the Chiapas region were commonly forced into marriage, birthed many children, and were told to stay home as home makers. The Zapatistas have attempted to end this tradition and create a sense of Feminism in the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/the-untold-story-of-womens-involvement-with-the-zapatistas-a-qa-with-hilary-klein|title=The Untold Story of Women in the Zapatistas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See above to read more about endorsed [[Anarcha-feminist]] concepts. Neozapatismo in general promotes any local culture as long as it does not impose itself onto another culture and if the culture is open to criticism.

The Zapatista movement and its philosophy tend to not focus on international issues or concepts of international politics, but there have been some statements and opinions on the matter. The Zapatista movement backs the idea of [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalism]] as a means to liberate the world from capitalist oppression as they try to do themselves. The Zapatista movement allows for cooperation with other similar movements and sympathizers worldwide, fundraising is often done outside of the Zapatista Chiapas.

The Zapatistas, specifically [[Subcommandante Marcos]] have made somewhat [[Anti-Zionist]] statements. Marcos has made statements in favor of the Palestinian peoples resistance and critical of the Israel's policies in Palestine. He claims that the Israeli army is an [[imperialist]] force attacking mainly innocent Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestinechronicle.com/zapatista-commander-gaza-will-survive/|title=Zapatista Commander: Gaza Will Survive - Palestine Chronicle|date=12 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subcommandante Marcos]] has made statements supporting [[Che Guevara]] and the policies of the [[Marxist Leninist]] Cuban government.{{Citation Needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2017}}

==Activist philosophy==
{{Main|Impossiblism}}
The Zapatista movement take various stances on how to change the political atmosphere of capitalism. The Zapatista philosophy on revolution is complicated and extensive. On the issue of voting in Capitalist Country's elections the movement rejects the idea of capitalist voting all together, calling for instead to organize for resistance. They neither ask for people to vote or not to vote, only to organize.&lt;ref name="solidarity-us.org"/&gt; The Zapatistas have engaged in armed struggle, specifically in the [[Chiapas conflict]], their reasons for so is the lack of results achieved through peaceful means of protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipaz.org/en/chiapas/peace-process-war-process/334-1994.html SIPAZ, International Service for Peace webisite, "1994"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020209/http://www.sipaz.org/en/chiapas/peace-process-war-process/334-1994.html |date=2015-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatistas consider the Mexican government so out of touch with its people it is illegitimate. Other than violence in the [[Chiapas conflict]] the Zapatistas have organized peaceful protest such as [[The Other Campaign]], although some of their peaceful protests have turned violent after police interactions. It seems that violent protest is only just in Zapatista eyes if it was brought on by others or if their political targets are unresponsive to their peaceful protests.

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
'''''Progression of Animals''''' (or '''''On the Gait of Animals'''''; {{lang-el|Περὶ πορείας ζῴων}}; {{lang-la|De incessu animalium}}) is one of [[Aristotle]]'s major [[Aristotle's biology|texts on biology]]. It gives details of [[gait]] and movement in various kinds of animals, as well as speculating over the structural homologies among living things.&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;Hall, Brian, Fins into Limbs: Evolution, Development, and Transformation, University of Chicago Press (2007), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's approach to the subject is to ask "why some animals are footless, others bipeds, others quadrupeds, others polypods, and why all have an even number of feet, if they have feet at all; why in fine the points on which progression depends are even in number." It is a good example of the way he brought [[teleology|teleological]] presumptions to empirical studies.

[[File:Conglomeratereyes.jpg|thumb|Conglomerate rock located at Point Reyes, California. Deposited by a submarine landslide, the rock is an example of a [[turbidite]]]]
'''Submarine landslides''' are [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[landslide]]s that [[sediment transport|transport sediment]] across the [[continental shelf]] and into the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]]. A submarine landslide is initiated when the downwards [[driving stress]] (gravity and other factors) exceeds the [[resisting stress]] of the seafloor slope material causing movements along one or more concave to planar rupture surfaces. Submarine landslides take place in a variety of different settings including planes as low as 1° and can cause significant damage to both life and property. Recent advances have been made in understanding the nature and processes of submarine landslides through the use of [[sidescan sonar]] and other seafloor mapping technology.&lt;ref name = "Hampton"&gt;Hampton, M &amp; Locat, J (1996) Submarine landslides. Reviews of Geophysics, 34, 33–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Locat2002"&gt;Locat, J &amp; Lee, HJ (2002) Submarine landslides: Advances and challenges.  Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 39, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mason"&gt;Mason, D, Habitz, C, Wynn, R, Pederson, G &amp; Lovholt, F (2006) Submarine landslides: processes, triggers and hazard protection. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 364, 2009–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Submarine Landslides have different causes which relate to both the [[geology|geological]] attributes of the landslide material and transient environmental factors affecting the submarine environment. Common causes of landslides include: i) presence of weak geological layers, ii) overpressure due to rapid accumulation of [[sedimentary deposits]], iii) [[earthquakes]], iv) storm wave loading and [[hurricanes]], v) [[gas hydrate]] dissociation, vi) [[groundwater]] seepage and high pore water pressure, vii) [[glacier|glacial]] loading, viii) [[High island|volcanic island]] growth, and ix) oversteepening.&lt;ref name="Hampton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mason" /&gt;

===Weak geological layers===
The presence of weak geological layers is a factor which contributes to submarine landslides at all scales. This has been confirmed by seafloor imaging such as [[multibeam echosounder|swath bathymetric]] mapping and 3D [[seismic reflection]] data. Despite their ubiquity, very little is known about the nature and characteristics of the weak geological layers, as they have rarely been sampled and very little [[geotechnical]] work has been conducted on them.  An example of a slide which was caused by weak geological layers is the [[Storegga slide]], near [[Norway]] which had a total volume of 3,300&amp;nbsp;km³.&lt;ref name = "Mason" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locat, J, Mienert, J &amp; Boisvert, L (eds) (2003) Submarine mass movements and their consequences: 1st international symposium. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overpressuring===
Overpressure due to rapid [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] of [[sediment]] is closely related to weak geological layers. An example of landslides caused by overpressure due to rapid deposition occurred in 1969 on the [[Mississippi delta]] after [[Hurricane Camile]] struck the region.&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;

===Earthquakes===
[[Earthquake]]s are a key factor which trigger most major submarine landslides. Earthquakes provide significant environmental stresses and can promote elevated pore water pressure which leads to failure. Earthquakes triggered the [[Grand Banks]] landslide of 1929, where a 20&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; submarine landslide was initiated after an earthquake.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nisbet"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nisbet | first1 = E. | last2 = Piper | first2 = D. | year = 1998 | title = Giant submarine landslides | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6674| page = 329 | doi=10.1038/32765| bibcode = 1998Natur.392..329N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stormwave loading===
Stormwave loading and [[hurricane]]s can lead to submarine landslides in shallow regions and were recognised as one of the factors which contributed to the slides which occurred on the [[Mississippi delta]] in 1969 following [[Hurricane Camille]].&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;

===Gas hydrates===
A number of studies have indicated that [[gas hydrate]]s lie beneath many submarine slopes and can contribute to the triggering of a landslide. Gas hydrates are ice-like substances consisting of water and natural gas, which are stable at the temperature and pressure conditions normally found on the seabed. When the temperature rises or the pressure drops the gas hydrate becomes unstable allowing some of the hydrate to dissociate and discharge bubble phase [[natural gas]]. If pore water flow is impeded then this gas charging leads to excess pore water pressure and decreased slope stability. Gas hydrate dissociation is thought to have contributed to slides at water depths of 1000 to 1300 m off the east coast of the United States and the Storegga slide off the east coast of [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huhnerbach"&gt;Huhnerbach, V. &amp; Masson, D. G. (2004) Landslides in the North Atlantic and its adjacent seas: an analysis of their morphology, setting and behaviour. Marine Geology, 213, 343–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groundwater seepage===
[[Groundwater seepage]] and elevated pore water pressure can cause submarine landslides. Elevated pore water pressure causes reduced frictional resistance to sliding and can result from normal depositional processes, or can be coupled with other causes such as earthquakes, gas hydrate dissociation and [[glacial loading]].&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;

===Glacial loading===
Sediment failure on [[Glacier|glacial]] margins as a result of glacial loading is common and operates on a wide spectrum of dimensions, ranging from relatively small scale mass wasting processes in [[fjord]]s to large scale slides covering several thousand square kilometres. Factors which are significant in glacial loading induced landslides are the flexing of crust due to the loading and unloading of a fluctuating ice front, variation in drainage and groundwater seepage, quick deposition of low [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] [[silt]]s, rapid formation of [[moraine]]s and [[till]] above hemipelagic interstaidal sediments. An example where glacial loading leads to submarine landsliding is the Nyk slide of northern [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, B., Laberg, J. S. &amp; Vorren, T. O. (2004) The Nyk Slide – morphology, progression, and age of a partly buried submarine slide offshore northern Norway. Marine Geology, 213, 277–289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanneste, M., Mienert, J. R. &amp; Bãinz, S. (2006) The Hinlopen Slide: A giant, submarine slope failure on the northern Svalbard margin, Arctic Ocean. Earth &amp; Planetary Science Letters, 245, 373–388.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volcanic island growth===
Slope failures due to [[volcanic island]] growth are among the largest on earth, involving volumes of several cubic kilometres. The failure occurs as large bodies of [[lava]] form above weak marine sediments which are prone to failure. Failure is particularly common on edifices which are over 2500&amp;nbsp;m but rare on edifices which are less than 2500&amp;nbsp;m. Variation in the behaviour of the slides is significant, with some slides barely keeping up with the growth on the upper part of the volcano while others may surge forward great distances, attaining landslide lengths greater than 200&amp;nbsp;km. Volcanic island submarine landslides occur in places such as the [[Hawaiian Islands]]&lt;ref name="Hampton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = N | year = 2003 | title = Susceptibility of mid-ocean ridge volcanic islands and seamounts to large scale landsliding | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 108 | issue = B8| pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1029/2002jb001997 | bibcode=2003JGRB..108.2397M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = J.

===Oversteepening===
Oversteepening is caused by scouring due to [[oceanic current]]s and can result in the triggering of submarine landslides.&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;

In some cases the relationship between the cause and the resulting landslide can be quite clear (e.g. the failure of an oversteepened slope) while in other cases the relationships may not be so obvious. In most cases more than one factor may contribute towards the initiation of a landslide event. This is clearly seen on the Norwegian continental slope where the location of landslides such as [[Storegga]] and Traenadjupet is related to weak geological layers. However the position of these weak layers is determined by regional variation in sedimentation style, which itself is controlled by large scale environmental factors such as climate change between [[glacial]] and [[interglacial]] conditions. Even when considering all the above listed factors, in the end it was calculated that the landslide needed an earthquake for it to ultimately be initiated.&lt;ref name="Hampton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;

The environments in which submarine landslides are commonly found in are [[fjords]], active [[river delta]]s on the [[continental margin]], submarine canyon fan systems, open [[continental slope]]s, and oceanic volcanic islands and ridges.&lt;ref name="Hampton" /&gt;

==Submarine landslide processes==

There are a variety of different types of submarine mass movements.  All of the movements are mutually exclusive, for example a slide cannot be a fall. Some types of mass movements, such as slides, can be distinguished by the disrupted step like morphology which shows that there was only minor movement of the failed mass. The displaced material on a slide moves on a thin region of high strain. In flows the slide zone will be left bare and the displaced mass may be deposited hundreds of kilometres away from the origin of the slide. The displaced sediment of fall will predominantly travel through the water, falling, bouncing and rolling. Despite the variety of different landslides present in submarine environment, only slides, debris flow and turbidity currents provide a substantial contribution to gravity driven sediment transport.&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;

Recent advances in 3-D [[seismic mapping]] have revealed spectacular images of submarine landslides off [[Angola]] and [[Brunei]], showing in detail the size of blocks transported and how they moved along the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;Gee M. J. R., Watts A.B., Masson D.G., &amp; Mitchell N.C. Landslides and the evolution of El Hierro in the Canary Islands, Marine Geology 177 (3–4) (2001) pp. 271–293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gee2007"&gt;Gee M.J.R., Uy H.S.,  Warren J.,  Morley C.K. and  Lambiase J.J.. (2007) The Brunei slide: A giant submarine landslide on the North West Borneo Margin revealed by 3D seismic data. Marine Geology, 246,  9–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initially thought that submarine landslides in cohesive sediments systematically and sequentially developed downslope from slide to debris flow to turbidity current through slowly increasing disintegration and entrainment of water. However it is now thought that this model is likely to be an oversimplification, as some landslides travel many hundreds of kilometres without any noticeable change into turbidity currents, as shown in figure 3 while others completely change into turbidity currents near to the source. This variation in the development of different submarine landslides is associated with the development of velocity vectors in the displaced mass. The in-place stress, sediment properties (particularly density), and morphology of the failed mass will determine whether the slide stops a short distance along the rupture surface or will transform into a flow which travels great distances.&lt;ref name="Hampton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;

The initial [[density]] of the sediment plays a key role in the mobilization into flows and the distances that the slide will travel. If the sediment is a soft, fluid material then the slide is likely to travel great distances and a flow is more likely to occur.  However, if the sediment is stiffer then the slide will only travel a short distance and a flow is less likely to occur. Furthermore, the ability to flow may also be dependent upon the amount of energy transferred to the falling sediment throughout the failure event. Often large landslides on the continental margin are complicated and components of slide, debris flow and turbidity current may all be apparent when examining the remains of a submarine landslide.&lt;ref name="Hampton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huhnerbach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gee2007" /&gt;

==Hazards==

The primary hazards associated with submarine landslides are the direct destruction of infrastructure and [[tsunami]].

Landslides can have significant economic impacts on infrastructure such as the rupture of fibre optic [[submarine communications cable]]s and pipelines and damage to offshore [[drilling platform]]s and can continue onwards on slope angles as low as 1°. An example of submarine cable damage was discovered in the Grand Banks slide of 1929 where the landslide and resulting turbidity current broke a series of submarine cables up to nearly 600&amp;nbsp;km away from the beginning of the slide.&lt;ref name="Hampton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nisbet" /&gt; Further destruction of infrastructure occurred when Hurricane Camille hit the Mississippi delta in 1969 causing a landslide which damaged several offshore drilling platforms.&lt;ref name="Locat2002" /&gt;

Submarine landslides can pose a significant hazard when they cause a tsunami. Although a variety of different types of landslides can cause tsunami, all the resulting tsunami have similar features such as large run-ups close to the tsunami, but quicker attenuation compared to tsunami caused by earthquakes. An example of this was the July 17, 1998, [[Papua New Guinea]]n landslide tsunami where waves up to 15&amp;nbsp;m high impacted a 20&amp;nbsp;km section of the coast killing 2,200 people, yet at greater distances the tsunami was not a major hazard. This is due to the comparatively small source area of most landslide tsunami (relative to the area affected by large earthquakes) which causes the generation of shorter wavelength waves. These waves are greatly affected by coastal amplification (which amplifies the local effect) and radial damping (which reduces the distal effect).&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McAdoo"&gt;McAdoo, B. G. &amp; Watts, P. (2004) Tsunami hazard from submarine landslides on the Oregon continental slope. Marine Geology, 203, 235–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent findings show that the nature of a tsunami is dependent upon volume, velocity, initial acceleration, length and thickness of the contributing landslide. Volume and initial acceleration are the key factors which determine whether a landslide will form a tsunami. A sudden deceleration of the landslide may also result in larger waves. The length of the slide influences both the wavelength and the maximum wave height. Travel time or run out distance of slide will also influence the resulting tsunami wavelength. In most cases the submarine landslides are noticeably subcritical, that is the [[Frounde number]] (the ratio of slide speed to wave propagation) is significantly less than one. This suggests that the tsunami will move away from the wave generating slide preventing the buildup of the wave. Failures in shallow waters tend to produce larger tsunamis because the wave is more critical as the speed of propagation is less here.  Furthermore, shallower waters are generally closer to the coast meaning that there is less radial damping by the time the tsunami reaches the shore. Conversely tsunamis triggered by earthquakes are more critical when the seabed displacement occurs in the deep ocean as the first wave (which is less affected by depth) has a shorter wavelength and is enlarged when travelling from deeper to shallower waters.&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McAdoo" /&gt;

The effects of a submarine landslide on infrastructure can be costly and landslide generated tsunami can be both destructive and deadly.

'''Giant Slides along the Norwegian Margin'''

[[Storegga Slide]] is among the largest recent submarine landslides discovered worldwide. Like many other submarine landslides from the North Atlantic it is dated to a Pleistocene - Holocene age. Such large submarine landslides have been interpreted to occur most frequent either during the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG) or during the deglaciation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maslin, M.|last2=Owen, M.|last3=Day, S.|last4=Long, D.|date=2004|others=|title=Linking continental-slope failures and climate change: testing the clathrate gun hypothesis.|url=http://www.geosociety.org/pubs/copyrt.htm#gsa|journal=Geology|volume=32| issue = 1|pages=53–56|doi=10.1130/G20114.1|via=|bibcode=2004Geo....32...53M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owen, M.|last2=Day, S.|last3=Maslin, M.|date=2007|title=Late Pleistocene submarine mass movements: occurrence and causes|url=|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=26|issue=7–8|pages=958–078|via=|bibcode=2007QSRv...26..958O|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2006.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee, H.|date=|title=Timing and occurrence of large submarine landslides on the Atlantic Ocean Margin|url=|journal=Marine Geology|volume=264|pages=53–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leynaud, D.|last2=Mienert, J.|last3=Vanneste, M.|date=2009|title=Submarine mass movements on glaciated and non-glaciated European continental margins: a review of triggering mechanisms and preconditions to failure|url=|journal=Marine Petroleum Geology|volume=26|pages=618–632|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During those glacial or deglacial times a series of geological processes modified intensely the shallow structure of the submarine continental margin. For instance, changing sea levels during glaciation and accompanying sea level drop produce enhanced erosive processes. Advancing or retreating glaciers eroded the continent and provided vast amounts of sediment to the continental shelf. These processes led to the building of trough mouth fans, similar to river fan deltas. The large sediment accumulation promoted slope failures that are observed in the subsurface structure as stacked debris flows above each other. Sliding happened often along weak layers that have less shear strength due to higher effective internal pore pressures e.g. from gashydrate dissolution, other fluids, or simply weakening is due to contrasting sediment properties within the sediment succession. Earthquakes caused by isostatic rebound due to waning glacials are typically assumed as final land-sliding triggers.

In recent years, a series of giant Mass Transport Deposits (MTDs) that are volumetrically much bigger than the deposits of the Storegga slide have been detected in several locations in the subsurface geological record of the Norwegian continental margin using geophysical methods. These MTDs exceed in size any slope failure of the youngest high-glacial times. Individual deposits reach up to 1&amp;nbsp;km in thickness and the largest are up to 300&amp;nbsp;km in length. The internal structure imaged with seismic methods shows sometimes a transparent or a chaotic character indicating disintegration of the slide mass. In other examples, subparallel layering supports a cohesive sliding/slumping on a large scale. Local over-pressures are indicated by diapiric structures indicating gravity driven sub-vertical movement of water-rich sediment masses.

A '''thunderstorm''', also known as an '''electrical storm''', '''lightning storm''', or '''thundershower''', is a [[storm]] characterized by the presence of [[lightning]] and its [[acoustics|acoustic]] effect on the [[Earth's atmosphere]], known as [[thunder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=21 April 2005|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=t |title=Weather Glossary – T|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunderstorms occur in a type of [[cloud]] known as a [[cumulonimbus]]. They are usually accompanied by [[Wind|strong winds]], [[heavy rain (meteorology)|heavy rain]], and sometimes [[Thundersnow|snow]], [[Ice pellets|sleet]], [[hail]], or, in contrast, [[Dry thunderstorm|no precipitation]] at all. Thunderstorms may [[thunderstorm training|line up in a series]] or become a [[rainband]], known as a [[squall line]]. Strong or [[severe thunderstorm]]s include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, including large hail, strong winds, and [[tornado]]es. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as [[supercell]]s, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the [[troposphere]] that they occupy, vertical [[wind shear]] sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.

Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm, moist air, sometimes along a [[Weather front|front]]. As the warm, moist air moves upward, it cools, [[condense]]s, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over {{convert|20|km|mi}}. As the rising air reaches its [[dew point]] temperature, water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice, reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell. Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth's surface. As the droplets fall, they collide with other droplets and become larger. The falling droplets create a [[downdraft]] as it pulls cold air with it, and this cold air spreads out at the Earth's surface, occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms.

Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the [[Mid-latitudes|mid-latitude]], where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes.&lt;ref name="nssl.noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|author-link=National Severe Storms Laboratory|title=tornadoes...''Nature's Most Violent Storms''|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/edu/safety/tornadoguide.html |date=September 1992 |work=A PREPAREDNESS GUIDE|accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. Thunderstorms, and the phenomena that occur along with them, pose great hazards. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by [[downburst]] winds, large hailstones, and [[flash flooding]] caused by heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and [[waterspout]]s.

There are four types of thunderstorms: [[Air-mass thunderstorm|single-cell]], [[Multicellular thunderstorm|multi-cell cluster]], multi-cell lines, and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. [[Mesoscale convective system]]s formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]] can be responsible for the development of [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s. [[Dry thunderstorm]]s, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of [[wildfire]]s from the heat generated from the [[cloud-to-ground lightning]] that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: [[weather radar]], [[weather station]]s, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the [[18th century]]. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Neptune]], and, probably, [[Venus]].

If enough [[Convective available potential energy|instability]] is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for [[cumulonimbus]] clouds to form and produce [[lightning]] and [[thunder]].

=== Developing stage ===

The first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be [[insolation|solar illumination]], where the heating of the ground produces [[thermals]], or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as ''[[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]]'' clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, [[latent heat]] is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an ''[[updraft]]'' through the process of [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] (hence the term [[Precipitation (meteorology)|convective precipitation]]). This process creates a [[low pressure area|low-pressure zone]] within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the [[Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="condensationenergy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.syr.edu/courses/modules/ENERGY/ENERGY_POLICY/tables.html |title=Rough Values of Various Processes |author=Gianfranco Vidali |date=2009 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |publisher=[[University of Syracuse]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315113421/http://physics.syr.edu/courses/modules/ENERGY/ENERGY_POLICY/tables.html |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mature stage ===
[[File:Anvil shaped cumulus panorama edit crop.jpg|thumb|Anvil-shaped thundercloud in the mature stage]]

In the mature stage of a thunderstorm, the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the [[tropopause]]. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic [[anvil]] shape. The resulting cloud is called ''[[cumulonimbus incus]]''. The water droplets [[coalescence (meteorology)|coalesce]] into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become [[rain]]. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as [[hail]]. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating ''[[downdrafts]]'' as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal [[turbulence]] can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even [[tornado]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotsweb.com/wx/w_sense.htm |title=Structural Icing in VMC|author=Pilot's Web The Aviator's Journal|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, if there is little [[wind shear]], the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out',&lt;ref name="Extreme Weather" /&gt; but, if there is sufficient change in wind speed or direction, the downdraft will be separated from the updraft, and the storm may become a [[supercell]], where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.&lt;ref name="motion"/&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Dissipating stage ===
[[File:Single-cell Thunderstorm in a No-shear Environment..jpg|thumb|left|A thunderstorm in an environment with no winds to shear the storm or blow the anvil in any one direction]]

In the dissipation stage, the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a [[downburst]]. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Weather World 2010 Project|publisher=University of Illinois|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/svr/comp/wind/home.rxml|title=Vertical Wind Shear|accessdate=2006-10-21|date=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The downdraft hitting the ground creates an [[outflow boundary]]. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the [[outflow boundary]] is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. T. Fujita|date=1985|title=The Downburst, microburst and macroburst: SMRP Research Paper 210|authorlink=Ted Fujita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:CAPE vs SHEAR.png|right|thumb|Conditions favorable for thunderstorm types and complexes]]

There are four main types of thunderstorms: single-cell, multi-cell, squall line (also called multi-cell line) and supercell. Which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere ("[[wind shear]]"). Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30 minutes.

Organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters/lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear, normally greater than {{convert|25|kn|m/s}} in the lowest {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the [[troposphere]],&lt;ref&gt;Markowski, Paul and Yvette Richardson.  Mesoscale Meteorology in Midlatitudes.  John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2010.
pp. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather. The supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms, most commonly associated with large hail, high winds, and tornado formation.  [[Precipitable water]] values of greater than {{convert|31.8|mm|in}} favor the development of organized thunderstorm complexes.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, R.A., C.F. Chappell, and L.R. Hoxit, (1979).

Soc., 60, 115-123.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those with heavy rainfall normally have precipitable water values greater than {{convert|36.9|mm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Schnetzler, Amy Eliza.  Analysis of Twenty-Five Years of Heavy Rainfall Events in the Texas Hill Country.  University of Missouri-Columbia, 2008.  pp. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upstream values of [[Atmospheric instability#CAPE and CIN|CAPE]] of greater than 800 J/kg are usually required for the development of organized convection.&lt;ref&gt;Markowski, Paul and Yvette Richardson.  Mesoscale Meteorology in Midlatitudes.  John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2010. pp. 215, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-cell===
{{Main article|Air-mass thunderstorm}}
[[File:Thunderstorm over Wagga Wagga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A single-cell thunderstorm over [[Wagga Wagga]].]]

This term technically applies to a single thunderstorm with one main updraft. Also known as [[air-mass thunderstorm]]s, these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales. They also occur in the cool unstable air that often follows the passage of a [[weather fronts|cold front]] from the sea during winter. Within a cluster of thunderstorms, the term "cell" refers to each separate principal updraft. Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation, as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary that sets up new thunderstorm development. Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability; hence the term "air mass thunderstorm". When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them, it is known as a pulse severe storm. Pulse severe storms are poorly organized and occur randomly in time and space, making them difficult to forecast. Single-cell thunderstorms normally last 20–30&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="tsbasics"/&gt;

===Multi-cell clusters===
{{Main article|Multicellular thunderstorm}}
[[File:8402 STS41B Challenger Thunderstorms over Brazil.JPG|thumb|A group of thunderstorms over [[Brazil]] photographed by the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]].]]

This is the most common type of thunderstorm development. ''Mature thunderstorms'' are found near the center of the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. ''Multicell storms'' form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more [[squall line]]s. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20&amp;nbsp;minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.&lt;ref name="tsbasics"/&gt;

===Multicell lines===

===Supercells===

Supercell storms are large, usually [[severe weather|severe]], quasi-steady-state storms that form in an environment where wind speed or wind direction varies with height ("[[wind shear]]"), and they have separate downdrafts and updrafts (i.e., where its associated precipitation is not falling through the updraft) with a strong, rotating updraft (a "[[mesocyclone]]"). These storms normally have such powerful updrafts that the top of the supercell storm cloud (or anvil) can break through the [[troposphere]] and reach into the lower levels of the [[stratosphere]], and supercell storms can be {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} wide. Research has shown that at least 90&amp;nbsp;percent of supercells cause [[severe weather]].&lt;ref name="motion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/unr/soo/scm/ZB06.pdf|title=Operational Forecasting of Supercell Motion: Review and Case Studies Using Multiple Datasets|author=Jon W.

A severe thunderstorm warning is issued if a thunderstorm becomes severe, or will soon turn severe.

==Motion==
[[File:Sturmfront auf Doppler-Radar-Schirm.jpg|thumb|Thunderstorm line viewed in [[reflectivity]] ([[dBZ (meteorology)|dBZ]]) on a [[plan position indicator]] radar display]]

The two major ways thunderstorms move are via [[advection]] of the wind and propagation along [[outflow boundary|outflow boundaries]] towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's [[troposphere]], the lowest {{convert|8|km|mi}} of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical [[wind shear]] vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On [[weather radar]], storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.&lt;ref name="motion"/&gt;

===Back-building thunderstorm===
A back-building thunderstorm, commonly referred to as a [[Training (meteorology)|training thunderstorm]], is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/corfidi/mcsflashflood_2015feb07.ppt|title=MCS Movement and Behavior (PowerPoint)|author=Stephen Corfidi|publisher=National Weather Service, Storm Prediction Center|date=2015-02-04|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/tstorms/tstrmtypes.htm|title=Types of Thunderstorms|author=National Weather Service|author-link=National Weather Service|publisher=National Weather Service Southern Region Headquarters|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in [[Black Hills flood|devastating flash flooding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/unr/?n=weather|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, [[Rapid City, South Dakota]]|title=The Rapid City Flood of 1972|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Central Region Headquarters|accessdate=2009-09-03|date=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event occurred in [[Boscastle]], England, on 16 August 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tintagelweb.co.uk/BoscastleFlood.htm|title=Boscastle Flood 2004|author=David Flower|publisher=Tintagel – King Arthur Country|date=2008-02-09|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over Chennai on 1 December 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0473.1|title=Role of Eastern Ghats Orography and Cold Pool in an Extreme Rainfall Event over Chennai on 1 December 2015|author=Jayesh Phadtare|publisher=American Meteorological Society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==
Each year, many people are killed or seriously injured by severe thunderstorms despite the advance warning. While severe thunderstorms are most common in the [[spring (season)|spring]] and [[summer]], they can occur at just about any time of the year.

===Cloud-to-ground lightning===

[[File:Blitze IMGP6376 wp.jpg|thumb|A return stroke, cloud-to-ground lightning strike during a thunderstorm.]]

[[Cloud-to-ground lightning]] frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations. One of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting.&lt;ref name='Scott2000'&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =10.1016/S0031-0182(00)00192-9 | title =The Pre-Quaternary history of fire | date =2000 | author =Scott, A | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume =164 | page =281 | bibcode =2000PPP...164..281S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a regime of low precipitation (LP) thunderstorms, where little precipitation is present, rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat.&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plaza.ufl.edu/rakov/Gas.html|title=Lightning Makes Glass|accessdate=November 7, 2007|publisher=[[University of Florida]], Gainesville|date=1999|author=Vladimir A.

Acid rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning. [[Distilled water]] has a [[Neutral solution|neutral]] [[pH]] of 7.  “Clean” or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.

A tornado is a violent, rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud (otherwise known as a thundercloud) or, in rare cases, the base of a [[cumulus cloud]]. Tornadoes come in many sizes but are typically in the form of a visible [[Funnel cloud|condensation funnel]], whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of [[debris]] and [[dust]].&lt;ref name="Renno"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Renno |first = Nilton O. |title = A thermodynamically general theory for convective vortices |journal = [[Tellus A]] |volume = 60 |issue = 4 |pages = 688–99 |date=August 2008 |url = http://vortexengine.ca/misc/Renno_2008.pdf |format=PDF|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0870.2008.00331.x |bibcode=2008TellA..60..688R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most tornadoes have wind speeds between {{convert|40|and|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, are approximately {{convert|75|m|ft}} across, and travel several kilometers (a few miles) before dissipating.

The [[Fujita scale]] and the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]] rate tornadoes by damage caused. An '''EF0''' tornado, the weakest category, damages trees but not substantial structures. An '''EF5''' tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large [[skyscraper]]s.

[[File:Kings Christian Church carpark Flooded.jpg|thumb|A flash flood caused by a severe thunderstorm]]

Waterspouts have similar characteristics as tornadoes, characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water, connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds. Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes, or more specifically, non-[[supercell]]ed tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Waterspout|title=Waterspout|date=2009|accessdate=2009-09-11|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620115657/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=waterspout|archivedate=2008-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spiralling columns of air frequently develop within tropical areas close to the [[equator]], but are less common within areas of [[high latitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/events/15Jan2009/overview.shtml|title=15 January 2009: Lake Champlain Sea Smoke, Steam Devils, and Waterspout: Chapters IV and V|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office, [[Burlington, Vermont]]|publisher=Eastern Region Headquarters|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flash flood===
{{Main article|Flash flood}}

Flash flooding is the process where a landscape, most notably an urban environment, is subjected to rapid floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Flash+flood|title=Flash Flood|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|date=2009|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085246/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Flash+flood|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal flooding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=Flood Products: What Do They Mean?|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=outreach_flw|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are frequently (though not always) associated with intense rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=Flash Flood|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/glossary.php?word=FLASH%20FLOOD|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it. Flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments, where few plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced. [[Soil]] erosion can occur as well, exposing risks of [[landslide]] phenomena.

===Downburst===
{{Main article|Downburst}}
[[File:Downburst damage.jpg|thumb|Trees uprooted or displaced by the force of a downburst wind in northwest Monroe County, [[Wisconsin]].]]

Downburst winds can produce numerous hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, and are often mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes,&lt;ref name="erh.noaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cae/svrwx/downburst.htm|title=Downbursts...|date=2009-01-27|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office [[Columbia, South Carolina]]|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Eastern Region Headquarters|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash.&lt;ref name="Extreme Weather" /&gt;&lt;ref name="erh.noaa" /&gt; Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.&lt;ref name="Extreme Weather" /&gt;

===Thunderstorm asthma===
{{Main article|Thunderstorm asthma}}

Thunderstorm asthma is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.&lt;ref&gt;Suphioglu C. Thunderstorm Asthma Due to Grass Pollen. ''Int Arch Allergy Immunol'' 1998;116:253–260. doi:10.1159/000023953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.E. &amp; Jonsson, H. Thunderstorm asthma.

==Safety precautions==
{{See also|Emergency management|Tornado preparedness}}

Most thunderstorms come and go fairly uneventfully; however, any thunderstorm can become [[Severe thunderstorm|severe]], and all thunderstorms, by definition, present the danger of [[lightning]].&lt;ref name="redcross"&gt;{{cite web|author=American Red Cross|title=Thunderstorm Safety Checklist|url=http://www.redcross.org/www-files/Documents/pdf/Preparedness/checklists/Thunderstorm.pdf|publisher=American Red Cross|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before, during, and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage.

===Preparedness===
Preparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness takes the form of general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year).&lt;ref name="NWS"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office|title=Thunderstorm|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/abq/?n=prepthunderstorms|work=Severe Weather Preparedness Information|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=24 August 2011|location=Albuquerque, NM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|title=Thunderstorms and Lightning|url=http://www.ready.gov/america/beinformed/thunderstorms.html|work=Ready|publisher=US Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=24 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623092608/http://www.ready.gov/america/beinformed/thunderstorms.html |archivedate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.&lt;ref name="fema"&gt;{{cite web|author=Federal Emergency Management Agency|title=What to Do Before a Thunderstorm|url=http://www.fema.gov/hazard/thunderstorm/th_before.shtm|publisher=US Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=24 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820113150/http://www.fema.gov/hazard/thunderstorm/th_before.shtm|archivedate=20 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) in the United States recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to occur:&lt;ref name=NWS/&gt;
:* Know the names of local counties, cities, and towns, as these are how warnings are described.&lt;ref name=NWS/&gt;
:* Monitor forecasts and weather conditions and know whether thunderstorms are likely in the area.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/blog.htm |title=NWS Lightning Safety Myths |publisher=Lightningsafety.noaa.gov |date=2014-06-30 |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Be alert for natural signs of an approaching storm.
:* Cancel or reschedule outdoor events (to avoid being caught outdoors when a storm hits).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
:* Take action early so you have time to get to a safe place.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
:* Get inside a substantial building or hard-topped metal vehicle before threatening weather arrives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
:* If you hear [[thunder]], get to the safe place immediately.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
:* Avoid open areas like hilltops, fields, and [[beach]]es, and don't be or be near the tallest objects in an area when thunderstorms are occurring.&lt;ref name=NWS/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
:* Don't shelter under tall or isolated trees during thunderstorms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
:* If in the woods, put as much distance as possible between you and any trees during thunderstorms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
:* If in a group, spread out to increase the chances of survivors who could come to the aid of any victims from a [[lightning strike]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Safety===
While safety and preparedness often overlap, “thunderstorm safety” generally refers to what people should do during and after a storm. The [[American Red Cross]] recommends that people follow these precautions if a storm is imminent or in progress:&lt;ref name=redcross/&gt;

:* Take action immediately upon hearing thunder. Anyone close enough to the storm to hear thunder can be struck by lightning.&lt;ref name=fema/&gt;
:* Avoid electrical appliances, including corded telephones.&lt;ref name=redcross/&gt; [[Cordless telephone|Cordless]] and wireless telephones are safe to use during a thunderstorm.&lt;ref name=fema/&gt;
:* Close and stay away from windows and doors, as glass can become a serious hazard in high wind.&lt;ref name=redcross/&gt;
:* Do not bathe or shower, as plumbing conducts [[electricity]].
:* If driving, safely exit the roadway, turn on hazard lights, and park. Remain in the vehicle and avoid touching metal.&lt;ref name=redcross/&gt;

The NWS stopped recommending the "lightning crouch" in 2008 as it doesn't provide a significant level of protection and will not significantly lower the risk of being killed or injured from a nearby lightning strike.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/lightning_faq.htm#5 |title=NWS JetStream – Lightning Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Srh.noaa.gov |date=2014-06-28 |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-six-lightning-facts-20140714-htmlstory.html |title=You're not safer crouching: Six things you didn't know about lightning |publisher=LA Times |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequent occurrences==
{{See also|United States rainfall climatology}}
[[File:Cumulonimbus Over Niagara Falls.JPG|thumb|left|A mild thunderstorm over [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]].]]

Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, even in the polar regions, with the greatest frequency in [[tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas, where they may occur nearly daily. At any given time approximately 2,000 thunderstorms are occurring on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Almanac of Geography, {{ISBN|0-7922-3877-X}}, page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kampala]] and [[Tororo]] in [[Uganda]] have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sky-fire.tv/index.cgi/thunderstorms.html#occur | title = How many thunderstorms occur each year? | work = Thunderstorms | publisher = Sky Fire Productions | accessdate = 2006-08-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070711070501/http://sky-fire.tv/index.cgi/thunderstorms.html#occur | archivedate = 2007-07-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim also made for [[Singapore]] and [[Bogor]] on the Indonesian island of [[Java (island)|Java]]. Other cities known for frequent storm activity include [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Caracas]], [[Manila]] and [[Mumbai]]. Thunderstorms are associated with the various [[monsoon]] seasons around the globe, and they populate the [[rainband]]s of [[tropical cyclone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/tropics/tc_hazards.htm|title=Tropical Cyclone Hazards|accessdate=2009-08-30|date=2008-10-08|author=[[National Weather Service]] JetStream|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In temperate regions, they are most frequent in spring and summer, although they can occur along or ahead of [[cold front]]s at any time of year.&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Roth|title=Unified Surface Analysis Manual|accessdate=2006-10-22|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may also occur within a cooler air mass following the passage of a cold front over a relatively warmer body of water. Thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures.

&lt;!--(should be moved to Climate of the United States)--&gt;
Some of the most powerful thunderstorms over the United States occur in the Midwest and the [[Southern United States|Southern states]]. These storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes. Thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the [[West Coast of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp2.pdf |title=National Severe Local Storms Operations Plan – Chapter 2 |format=PDF |author=Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology |publisher=[[Department of Commerce]] |date=2001-06-07 |accessdate=2006-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506002006/http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp2.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas, particularly the [[Sacramento Valley|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin Valley|San Joaquin]] Valleys of [[California]]. In spring and summer, they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the [[Rocky Mountains]] as part of the [[North American Monsoon]] regime. In the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the Midwest, but with less frequency and severity. During the summer, [[air-mass thunderstorm]]s are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of [[Florida]].

==Energy==
{{see also|Sprite (lightning)|Upper-atmospheric lightning|St. Elmo's fire}}
[[File:How thunderstorms launch particle beams into space 300dpi.jpg|thumb|How thunderstorms launch particle beams into space]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Thunder lightning Garajau Madeira 289985700.jpg|thumb|Thunderstorm over Garajau, [[Madeira]]]] --&gt;

If the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 5×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[kilograms|kg]] of water vapor are lifted, and the amount of [[energy]] released when this condenses is 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; [[joules]]. This is on the same order of magnitude of energy released within a tropical cyclone, and more energy than that released during [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima, Japan in 1945]].&lt;ref name="condensationenergy"/&gt;

The [[Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor]] results show that [[gamma ray]]s and [[antimatter]] particles ([[positron]]s) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html|title=Fermi Catches Antimatter-Hurling Storms|first=Rob|last=Garner|date=26 June 2015|work=nasa.gov|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es (TGF). TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning. The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ouellette|first=Jennifer|title=Fermi Spots Antimatter in Thunderstorms|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/fermi-spots-antimatter-in-thunderstorms.html|accessdate=16 January 2011|newspaper=Discovery News|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 TGFs may occur every day worldwide, but mostly go undetected.

==Studies==
In more contemporary times, thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity. Every spring, [[storm chasing|storm chasers]] head to the [[Great Plains]] of the United States and the Canadian Prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of videotaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~stumpf/cethics.html|title=Storm Chase Ethics|author=Alan Moller|authorlink=Alan Moller|date=2003-03-05|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio pulses produced by cosmic rays are being used to study how electric charges develop within thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=28329|title=Scientists use high-energy particles from space to probe thunderstorms|date=2009-06-02|accessdate=2009-09-09|author=Florida Institute of Technology|author-link=Florida Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; More organized meteorological projects such as [[VORTEX2]] use an array of sensors, such as the [[Doppler on Wheels]], vehicles with mounted automated [[weather station]]s, [[weather balloon]]s, and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vortex2.org/home/|title=What is VORTEX2?|author=VORTEX2|date=2009|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lightning is detected remotely using sensors that detect cloud-to-ground lightning strokes with 95&amp;nbsp;percent accuracy in detection and within {{convert|250|m|ft}} of their point of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/89annual/techprogram/paper_149149.htm|title=An Overview of the United States Precision Lightning Network (USPLN)|author=Peter P.

==Mythology and religion==
Thunderstorms strongly influenced many early civilizations. [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] believed that they were battles waged by [[Zeus]], who hurled lightning bolts forged by [[Hephaestus]]. Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes associated thunderstorms with the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]], who they believed was a servant of the [[Great Spirit]]. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] considered thunderstorms to occur when [[Thor]] went to fight [[Jötunn|Jötnar]], with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer [[Mjölnir]]. [[Hinduism]] recognizes [[Indra]] as the god of rain and thunderstorms. [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine accepted the ideas of [[Aristotle]]'s original work, called ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorologica]]'', that winds were caused by exhalations from the Earth and that fierce storms were the work of [[God]]. These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John D. Cox|title=Storm Watchers|page=7|isbn=0-471-38108-X|date=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] was out walking when a thunderstorm began, causing him to pray to God for being saved and promising to become a monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/theologians/martin-luther.html |title=Martin Luther|publisher=Christian History|language=English|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside of Earth==
Thunderstorms, evidenced by flashes of [[lightning]], on Jupiter have been detected and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice, suggesting a mechanism similar to that on Earth. (Water is a [[polar molecule]] that can carry a charge, so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning.)&lt;ref name="elkins-tanton"&gt;{{cite book

'''''Tree''''' was a controversial {{convert|24|m|ft|adj=on}} high [[inflatable]] [[sculpture]] by the artist [[Paul McCarthy]] that was briefly installed in the [[Place Vendôme]] in [[Paris]] in October 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29658502|title=Paris 'sex toy' sculpture raises storm|publisher=BBC News|date=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a {{ill|International Fair of Contemporary Art|fr|Foire internationale d'art contemporain|lt=FIAC}} exhibition called "Hors les murs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/art-world/paul-mccarthy-beaten-up-over-butt-plug-sculpture-136129|title=Paul McCarthy Beaten Up over Butt Plug Sculpture|publisher=Artnet|author= Alexander Forbes|date= October 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although officially described as a [[Christmas tree]], it was widely criticised for its similarity in appearance to a huge green [[butt plug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20141017-us-artist-erects-giant-green-butt-plug-paris-france-art/|title=US artist erects giant green 'butt plug' in Paris|publisher=France24|date=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2014/10/17/mccarthy-agresse-pour-l-erection-d-un-arbre-de-noel-ambigu-place-vendome_4507834_1655012.html|title=McCarthy agressé pour l'érection d'un arbre de Noël ambigu, place Vendôme|date=17 October 2014|language=French|first=Emmanuelle|last=Jardonnet|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy admitted that it was deliberately shaped as such as a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chazan|first1=David|title=Vandals deflate giant 'sex toy' sculpture in Paris|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11171441/Vandals-deflate-giant-sex-toy-sculpture-in-Paris.html|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy over the sculpture led to McCarthy being assaulted and the sculpture being vandalised only two days after its installation; a vandal climbed the fencing around it and cut the power supply which kept it inflated, in addition to cutting the cords holding it up. McCarthy stated that he did not want the work repaired or replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20141018-paris-giant-green-butt-plug-vandalised-paul-mccarthy-place-vendome/|title=Paris's giant 'butt plug' installation vandalised|publisher=France24|date=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/paris-flustered-erection-sex-toy-sculpture-article-1.1978409|title=Paris flustered erection sex toy sculpture|publisher=NY Daily News|date=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attention given to the sculpture brought a boom in sales of real butt plugs in Paris: a [[sex shop]] owner reported that he usually sold 50 per month predominantly to gay men, but in November 2014 sold over 1,000 roughly divided equally between heterosexual men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mulholland|first1=Rory|title=Parisians snap up 'butt plugs' after 'Tree' scandal|url=http://www.thelocal.fr/20141202/parisians-butt-plug-sex-toy-paul-mccarthy|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=The Local|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Confuse|Triple point}}
A '''triple junction''' is the point where the boundaries of three [[tectonic plate]]s meet. At the triple junction each of the three boundaries will be one of 3 types - a [[Mid-ocean ridge|ridge]] (R), [[oceanic trench|trench]] (T) or [[transform fault]] (F) - and triple junctions can be described according to the types of plate margin that meet at them (e.g. Transform-Transform-Trench, Ridge-Ridge-Ridge, or abbreviated F-F-T, R-R-R). Of the many possible types of triple junction only a few are [[Triple junction stability|stable]] through time ('stable' in this context means that the geometrical configuration of the triple junction will not change through geologic time). The meeting of 4 or more plates is also theoretically possible but junctions will only exist instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;The Solid Earth, An Introduction to Global Geophysics, [[C.M.R. Fowler]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first scientific paper detailing the triple junction concept was published in 1969 by [[W. Jason Morgan]], [[Dan McKenzie (professor)|Dan McKenzie]], and [[Tanya Atwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v224/n5215/abs/224125a0.html|title=Evolution of Triple Junctions|first=D. P.|last=McKenzie|first2=W. J.|last2=Morgan|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]]|volume=224|issue=5215|pages=125–133|date=11 October 1969|doi=10.1038/224125a0|bibcode = 1969Natur.224..125M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term had traditionally been used for the intersection of three divergent boundaries or spreading ridges. These three divergent boundaries ideally meet at near 120° angles.

In [[plate tectonics]] theory during the breakup of a continent, three divergent boundaries form, radiating out from a central point (the triple junction). One of these divergent plate boundaries fails (see [[aulacogen]]) and the other two continue spreading to form an ocean. The [[Seafloor spreading|opening]] of the south [[Atlantic Ocean]] started at the south of the [[South America]]n and [[Africa]]n continents, reaching a triple junction in the present [[Gulf of Guinea]], from where it continued to the west. The NE-trending [[Benue Trough]] is the failed arm of this junction.&lt;ref name=Petters1978&gt;{{cite journal

 |pages=311–322|doi=10.1086/649693
 |bibcode=1978JG.....86..311P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since, the term triple-junction has come to refer to any point where three tectonic plates meet.

==Interpretation==
The properties of triple junctions are most easily understood from the purely kinematic point of view where the plates are rigid and moving over the surface of the Earth. No knowledge of the Earth's interior or the geological details of the crust are then needed. Another useful simplification is that the kinematics of triple junctions on a flat Earth are essentially the same as those on the surface of a sphere. On a sphere, plate motions are described as relative rotations about [[Euler pole|Euler Poles]] (see [[Plate reconstruction]]), and the relative motion at every point along a plate boundary can be calculated from this rotation. But the area around a triple junction is small enough (relative to the size of the sphere) and (usually) far enough from the pole of rotation, that the relative motion across a boundary can be assumed to be constant along that boundary. Thus, analysis of triple junctions can usually be done on a flat surface with motions defined by vectors.

==Stability==
Triple junctions may be described and their stability assessed without use of the geological details but simply by defining the properties of the [[Mid-ocean ridge|ridges]], [[oceanic trench|trenches]] and [[transform faults]] involved, making some simplifying assumptions and applying simple velocity calculations. This assessment can generalise to most actual triple junction settings provided the assumptions and definitions broadly apply to the real earth situation.

A stable junction is one at which the geometry of the junction is retained with time as the plates involved move. This places restrictions on relative velocities and plate boundary orientation. An unstable triple junction will change with time, either to become another form of triple junction (RRF junctions easily evolve to FFR junctions), will change geometry or are simply not feasible (as in the case of FFF junctions).

By assuming that plates are rigid and that the earth is spherical, [[Leonhard Euler]]’s theorem of [[Euler's rotation theorem|motion on a sphere]] can be used to reduce the stability assessment to determining boundaries and relative motions of the interacting plates. The rigid assumption holds very well in the case of [[oceanic crust]], and the radius of the earth at the equator and poles only varies by a factor of roughly one part in 300 so the earth approximates very well to a sphere.

[[Dan McKenzie (geophysicist)|McKenzie]] and [[W. Jason Morgan|Morgan]]&lt;ref&gt;Evolution of Triple Junctions, McKenzie, D. P., and Morgan, W. J., Nature, 224, 125 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; first analysed the stability of triple junctions using these assumptions with the additional assumption that the [[Euler pole]]s describing the motions of the plates were such that they approximated to straight line motion on a flat surface. This simplification applies when the Euler poles are distant from the triple junction concerned. The definitions they used for R, T and F are as follows:

* R – structures that produce [[lithosphere]] symmetrically and perpendicular to the relative velocity of the plates on either side (this does not always apply, for example in the [[Gulf of Aden]]).
* T – structures that consume lithosphere from one side only. The relative velocity vector can be oblique to the plate boundary.
* F – [[active fault]]s parallel to the slip vector.

=== Stability criteria ===
For a triple junction between the plates A, B and C to exist, the following condition must be satisfied:

&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0

where &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the relative motion of B with respect to A.

This condition can be represented in velocity space by constructing a velocity triangle ABC where the lengths AB, BC and CA are proportional to the velocities &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.

Further conditions must also be met for the triple junction to exist stably – the plates must move in a way that leaves their individual geometries unchanged. Alternatively the triple junction must move in such a way that it remains on all three of the plate boundaries involved.

These criteria can be represented on the same velocity space diagrams in the following way. The lines ab, bc and ca join points in velocity space which will leave the geometry of AB, BC and CA unchanged. These lines are the same as those that join points in velocity space at which an observer could move at the given velocity and still remain on the plate boundary. When these are drawn onto the diagram containing the velocity triangle these lines must be able to meet at a single point, for the triple junction to exist stably.

These lines necessarily are parallel to the plate boundaries as to remain on the plate boundaries the observer must either move along the plate boundary or remain stationary on it.

* For a [[Mid-ocean ridge|ridge]] the line constructed must be the perpendicular bisector of the relative motion vector as to remain in the middle of the ridge an observer would have to move at half the relative speeds of the plates either side but could also move in a perpendicular direction along the plate boundary.
* For a [[transform fault]] the line must be parallel to the relative motion vector as all of the motion is parallel to the boundary direction and so the line ab must lie along AB for a transform fault separating the plates A and B.
* For an observer to remain on a [[oceanic trench|trench]] boundary they must walk along the strike of the trench but remaining on the overriding plate. Therefore, the line constructed will lie parallel to the plate boundary but passing through the point in velocity space occupied by the overriding plate.

The point at which these lines meet, J, gives the overall motion of the triple junction with respect to the earth.

Using these criteria it can easily be shown why the FFF triple junction is not stable: the only case in which three lines lying along the sides of a triangle can meet at a point is the trivial case in which the triangle has sides lengths zero, corresponding to zero relative motion between the plates. As faults are required to be active for the purpose of this assessment, an FFF junction can never be stable.

==Types==
McKenzie and Morgan determined that there were 16 types of triple junction theoretically possible, though several of these are speculative and have not necessarily been seen on earth. These junctions were classified firstly by the types of plate boundaries meeting – for example RRR, TTR, RRT, FFT etc. – and secondly by the relative motion directions of the [[Plate tectonics|plates]] involved. Some configurations such as RRR can only have one set of relative motions whereas TTT junctions may be classified into TTT(a) and TTT(b). These differences in motion direction affect the stability criteria.

McKenzie and Morgan claimed that of these 14 were stable with FFF and RRF configurations unstable, however, York&lt;ref&gt;Evolution of Triple Junctions, Letters to Nature, Nature 244, 341 – 342 (10 August 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; later showed that the RRF configuration could be stable under certain conditions.

===Ridge-Ridge-Ridge junctions===
[[Image:EAfrica.png|thumb|alt=A map of the Afar triangle, showing the East of Africa and the three ridges passing through the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the East African Rift Valley.|A map of the [[Afar Depression|Afar triangle]] in East Africa, another example of an RRR junction and the only triple junction on earth that can be seen above sea level.]]
An RRR junction is always stable using these definitions and therefore very common on earth, though in a geological sense ridge spreading is usually discontinued in one direction leaving failed [[rift]] zone. There are many examples of these present both now and in the geological past such as the South Atlantic opening with ridges spreading North and South to form the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], and an associated [[aulacogen]] in the [[Niger Delta]] region of Africa. RRR junctions are also common as rifting along three fractures at 120° is the best way to relieve stresses from uplift at the surface of a sphere; on earth stresses similar to these are believed to be caused by the mantle [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] thought to initiate rifting in continents.

The stability of RRR junctions is demonstrated below – as the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle always meet at a single point, the lines ab, bc and ca can always be made to meet regardless of relative velocities.

===Ridge-Trench-Fault junctions===
RTF junctions are less common, an unstable junction of this type (an RTF(a)) is thought to have existed at roughly 12[[Mya (unit)|Ma]] at the mouth of the [[Gulf of California]] where the [[East Pacific Rise]] currently meets the [[San Andreas Fault]] zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orfeus-eu.org/Announcements/workshop_utrecht/presentations/zhang.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727153513/http://www.orfeus-eu.org/Announcements/workshop_utrecht/presentations/zhang.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guadeloupe and Fallaron microplates were previously being subducted under the [[North American Plate]] and the northern end of this boundary met the [[San Andreas Fault]]. Material for this subduction was provided by a ridge equivalent to the modern [[East Pacific Rise]] slightly displaced to the west of the trench. As the ridge itself was subducted an RTF triple junction momentarily existed but subduction of the ridge caused the subducted lithosphere to weaken and ‘tear’ from the point of the triple junction. The loss of [[slab pull]] caused by the detachment of this lithosphere ended the RTF junction giving the present day ridge – fault system. An RTF(a) is stable if ab goes through the point in velocity space C, or if ac and bc are colinear.

===Trench-Trench-Trench junctions===
A TTT(a) junction can be found in central Japan where the [[Eurasian plate]] overrides the [[Philippine Plate|Philippine]] and [[Pacific plate]]s, with the Philippine plate also overriding the Pacific. Here the [[Japan Trench]] effectively branches to form the Ryukyu and Bonia [[Volcanic arc|arcs]]. The stability criteria for this type of junction are either ab and ac form a straight line or that the line bc is parallel to CA.

'''William Wales''' (1734? – 29 December 1798) was a British mathematician and [[astronomer]] who sailed with [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] on two voyages of discovery, then became Master of the [[Royal Mathematical School]] at [[Christ's Hospital]] and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].

==Early life==
Wales was born around 1734 to John and Sarah Wales and was baptised in [[Warmfield cum Heath|Warmfield]] (near the West Yorkshire town of [[Wakefield]]) that year. As a youth, according to the historian [[John Cawte Beaglehole]], Wales travelled south in the company of a Mr Holroyd, who became a plumber in the service of [[George III]].&lt;ref name="cooksoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=William Wales' First Voyage|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu4183.htm|accessdate=10 September 2009|author=Wendy Wales|work=Cook's Log|publisher=Captain Cook Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1760s, Wales was contributing to ''[[The Ladies' Diary]]''. In 1765 he married Mary Green, sister of the astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]].&lt;ref name="cooksoc" /&gt;

In 1765, Wales was employed by the [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Nevil Maskelyne]] as a ''[[Human computer|computer]]'', calculating [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]] that could be used to establish the longitude of a ship, for Maskelyne's ''[[The Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac]]''.&lt;ref name="JMR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmr.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conJmrArticle.54/viewPage/9|title=Providing longitude for all – The eighteenth-century computers of the Nautical Almanac|accessdate=6 August 2009|author=Mary Croarken|work=Journal for Maritime Research|date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the plans of the [[Royal Society]] to make observations of the June 1769 [[transit of Venus]], which would lead to an accurate determination of the [[astronomical unit]] (the distance between the Earth and the Sun), Wales and an assistant, Joseph Dymond, were sent to [[Prince of Wales Fort]] on [[Hudson Bay]] to observe the transit,&lt;ref name="NSWLib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/voyages/wales/index.html|accessdate=6 August 2009|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|title=William Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the pair being offered a reward of £200 for a successful conclusion to their expedition.&lt;ref name="cooksoc"/&gt; Other Royal Society expeditions associated with the 1769 transit were Cook's [[First voyage of James Cook|first voyage to the Pacific]], with observations of the transit being made at [[Tahiti]], and the expedition of [[Jeremiah Dixon]] and [[William Bayly (astronomer)|William Bayly]] to [[Norway]].

Due to winter pack ice making the journey impossible during the winter months, Wales and Dymond were obliged to begin their journey in the summer of 1768, setting sail on 23 June. Ironically, Wales when volunteering to make a journey to observe the transit, had requested that he be sent to a more hospitable location.&lt;ref name="RASC"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=[[Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]]|volume=98|issue=1|date=February 2004|last=Hudon|first=Daniel|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party arrived at Prince of Wales Fort in August 1768.&lt;ref name="AmericanScientist" /&gt;

Due to the scarcity of building materials at the chosen site, the party had to bring not only astronomical instruments, but the materials required for the construction of living quarters.&lt;ref name="AmericanScientist"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/1998/9/transits-travels-and-tribulations-iv/3|title=Transits, Travels and Tribulations, IV: Life on the High Arctic|first=J. Donald|last=Fernie|journal=American Scientist|date=September–October 1998|volume=86|issue=5|page=422|doi=10.1511/1998.37.3396}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their arrival, the pair constructed two "Portable Observatories", which had been designed by the engineer [[John Smeaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitofvenus.nl/history.html|title=Historical observations of the transit of Venus|accessdate=10 August 2009|author=Steven van Roode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction work occupied the pair for a month and then they settled in for the long winter season.

When the day of the transit, 3 June 1769, finally arrived, the pair were lucky to have a reasonably clear day and they were able to observe the transit at around local midday. However, the two astronomers' results for the time of first contact, when Venus first appeared to cross the disc of the Sun, differed by 11 seconds; the discrepancy was to prove a cause of upset for Wales.&lt;ref name="RASC"/&gt;

They were to stay in Canada for another three months before making the return voyage to England, thus becoming the first scientists to spend the winter at Hudson Bay.&lt;ref name="CanadianBiog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=2203|title=Wales, William|author=Glyndwr Williams|accessdate=6 August 2009|publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, Wales was still upset by the difference in the observations and refused to present his findings to the Royal Society until March 1770; however, his report of the expedition, including the astronomical results as well as other climatic and botanical observations, met with approval and he was invited by James Cook to join his next expedition.&lt;ref name="RASC"/&gt;

==Captain Cook's second circumnavigation voyage==
Wales and [[William Bayly (astronomer)|William Bayly]] were appointed by the [[Board of Longitude]] to accompany [[James Cook]] on his [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage of 1772–75]],&lt;ref name="NSWLib" /&gt; with Wales accompanying Cook aboard the [[HMS Resolution (1771)|''Resolution'']].  Wales' brother-in-law Charles Green, had been the astronomer appointed by the Royal Society to observe the 1769 transit of Venus but had died during the return leg of [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage]].&lt;ref name="ridpath"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/stamps/wales.htm|title=William Wales|accessdate=6 August 2009|publisher=[[Ian Ridpath]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary objective of Wales and Bayly was to test [[Larcum Kendall]]'s K1 chronometer, based on the H4 of [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref name="ridpath" /&gt; Wales compiled a log book of the voyage, recording locations and conditions, the use and testing of the instruments entrusted to him, as well as making many observations of the people and places encountered on the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wales|first=William|title=Log book of HMS 'Resolution'|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00058|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Following his return, Wales was commissioned in 1778 to write the official astronomical account of Cook's first voyage.&lt;ref name="bioenc"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-BF1CHkc50C&amp;pg=PA1189|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers: A-L|editor-first=Thomas A.|editor-last=Hockey|page=1189|isbn=978-0-387-31022-0|year=2007|first=Wayne|last=Orchison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wales became Master of the [[Royal Mathematical School]] at [[Christ's Hospital]] and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1776.&lt;ref name="JMR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CanadianBiog" /&gt; Amongst Wales' pupils at Christ's Hospital were [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Charles Lamb]].&lt;ref name="AmericanScientist" /&gt; It has been suggested that Wales' accounts of his journeys might have influenced Coleridge when writing his poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=167786&amp;sectioncode=22|title=From Fu Man Chu to a grizzly end|author=Christopher Ondaatje|authorlink=Christopher Ondaatje|date=15 March 2002|accessdate=11 August 2009|work=Times Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[Leigh Hunt]], another of Wales' pupils, remembered him as "a good man, of plain simple manners, with a heavy large person and a benign countenance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lord Byron and some of his comtemporanies with recollections of the author's life and of his visit to Italy|first=Leigh|last=Hunt|page=352|year=1828|publisher=Colburn|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=HugaOb_HoHsC&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed as Secretary of the [[Board of Longitude]] in 1795, serving in that position until his death in 1798.&lt;ref name="bioenc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, from Their Commencement, in 1665, to the Year 1800: 1763–1769|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guA_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA682|page=683|year=1809|publisher=[[Royal Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Earl Spencer, and his appointment confirmed 5 December 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00006/398|title=Papers of the Board of Longitude : Confirmed minutes of the Board of Longitude, 1780-1801 (5 December 1795)|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Digital Library|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of his work==
During his [[Vancouver Expedition|voyage of 1791–95]], [[George Vancouver]], who had studied astronomy under Wales as a midshipman on HMS ''Resolution'' during Cook's second circumnavigation, named Wales Point, a cape at the entrance to [[Portland Inlet]] on the coast of [[British Columbia]], in honour of his tutor; the name was later applied to the nearby [[Wales Island (British Columbia)|Wales Island]] by an official at the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|British Hydrographic Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.porcherislandcannery.ca/walesCannery.php|title=Wales Island Cannery|publisher=Porcher Island Cannery|accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his journal, Vancouver recorded his gratitude and indebtedness to Wales's tutelage "for that information which has enabled me to traverse and delineate these lonely regions."&lt;ref name="discovervancouver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovervancouver.com/articles/captain-george-vancouver|title=Captain George Vancouver|publisher=Discover Vancouver|accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wales featured on a [[New Hebrides]] (now [[Vanuatu]]) postage stamp of 1974 commemorating the 200th anniversary of Cook's discovery of the islands.&lt;ref name="ridpath"/&gt;

The asteroid [[15045 Walesdymond]], discovered in 1998, was named after Wales and Dymond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=15045+Walesdymond|title=15045 Walesdymond (1998 XY21)|publisher=JPL Small-Body Database Browser|accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zimmermann Telegram''' (or '''Zimmermann Note''' or '''Zimmerman Cable''') was a secret diplomatic communication issued from the [[Federal Foreign Office|German Foreign Office]] in January 1917 that proposed a military alliance between [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Mexico]]. In the event that the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]] against Germany, Mexico would recover [[Texas]], [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]]. The telegram was intercepted and decoded by [[Room 40|British intelligence]]. Revelation of the contents enraged Americans, especially after German Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Zimmermann]] publicly admitted the telegram was genuine on March 3, and helped generate support for the [[American entry into World War I|United States declaration of war on Germany]] in April.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |ref= Andrew |last= Andrew |first= Christopher |title= For The President's Eyes Only |year= 1996 |publisher= Harper Collins |isbn= 0-00-638071-9 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decryption was described as the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I,&lt;ref name=BBC2017/&gt; and one of the earliest occasions on which a piece of [[signal intelligence]] influenced world events.&lt;ref name=BBCHistory2017&gt;{{cite news|title=The telegram that brought America into the First World War|url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war|accessdate=17 January 2017|work=BBC History Magazine|date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Zimmermann.png|thumb|Arthur Zimmermann]]
The message came in the form of a [[code (cryptography)|coded]] telegram dispatched by [[Arthur Zimmermann]], a [[Secretary of state#Germany|''Staatssekretär'']] (a top level [[civil servant]]) in the Foreign Office of the German Empire on 19 January 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador to Mexico, [[Heinrich von Eckardt]]. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the resumption of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany on 1 February, an act the German government presumed would almost certainly lead to war with the United States. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the United States appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for military alliance with funding from Germany.

The decoded telegram is as follows:

{{quote|We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare. We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral. In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on the following basis: make war together, make peace together, generous financial support and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to you. You will inform the President of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain and add the suggestion that he should, on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace.&lt;br&gt;Signed, ZIMMERMANN}}

==Background==
===Previous German efforts to promote war===
Germany had long sought to incite a war between Mexico and the United States, which would have tied down American forces and slowed the export of American arms to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref= Katz |last= Katz |first= Friedrich |title= The Secret War in Mexico: Europe, the United States, and the Mexican Revolution |year= 1981 |location= |publisher= |isbn= | pages = 328–329}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans had engaged in a pattern of actively arming, funding and advising the Mexicans, as shown by the 1914 [[Ypiranga Incident]]&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1981), pp. 232–240.&lt;/ref&gt; and the presence of German advisors during the 1918 [[Battle of Ambos Nogales]]. The German Naval Intelligence officer [[Franz von Rintelen]] had attempted to incite a war between Mexico and the United States in 1915, giving [[Victoriano Huerta]] $12 million for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1981), pp. 329–332.&lt;/ref&gt; The German saboteur [[Lothar Witzke]] — responsible for the March 1917 munitions explosion at the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] in the San Francisco Bay Area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref= Tucker |first1= Spencer |last1= Tucker |first2= Priscilla Mary |last2= Roberts |title= World War One |location= Santa Barbara CA |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2005 |isbn= 1-85109-420-2 |lastauthoramp= y | page = 1606}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly responsible for the July 1916 [[Black Tom explosion]] in New Jersey — was based in Mexico City. The failure of United States troops [[Pancho Villa Expedition|to capture Pancho Villa in 1916]] and the movement of President Carranza in favor of Germany emboldened the Germans to send the Zimmermann note.&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1981), pp. 346–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German provocations were partially successful. Woodrow Wilson ordered the [[United States occupation of Veracruz|military invasion of Veracruz]] in 1914 in the context of the [[Ypiranga Incident]] and against the advice of the British government.&lt;ref name="Michael Small"&gt;{{cite book | first = Michael | last = Small | year = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KFgNYgx2rpEC&amp;q=%22anti-american+riots%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22anti-american%20riots%22&amp;f=false | title = The Forgotten Peace: Mediation at Niagara Falls, 1914 | page = 35 | publisher = University of Ottawa | location = Ottawa, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; War was prevented thanks to the [[Niagara Falls peace conference]] organized by the ABC nations, but the occupation was a decisive factor in [[Mexico in World War I|Mexican neutrality in World War I]].&lt;ref name="Lee Stacy"/&gt; Mexico refused to participate in the embargo against Germany and granted full guarantees to the German companies for keeping their operations open, specifically in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="Jürgen Buchenau"/&gt; These guarantees lasted for twenty-five years — coincidentally, it was on 22 May 1942 that Mexico declared war on the [[Axis Powers]] following the loss of two Mexican-flagged tankers that month to ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' U-boats.

===German motivation for the telegram===
The Zimmermann Telegram was part of an effort carried out by the Germans to postpone the transportation of supplies and other war materials from the United States to the Allied Powers that were at war with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref= Tuchman |author-link= Barbara Tuchman |last= Tuchman |first= Barbara W. |title= The Zimmermann Telegram |year= 1958 | isbn= 0-345-32425-0 | pages = 63, 73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of the telegram was to make the Mexican government declare war on the United States in hopes of tying down American forces and slowing the export of American arms.&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1981), pp. 328–329.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German High Command]] believed they would be able to defeat the British and French on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and strangle Britain with unrestricted submarine warfare before American forces could be trained and shipped to Europe in sufficient numbers to aid the Allied Powers. The Germans were encouraged by their successes on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] into believing that they would be able to divert large numbers of troops to the Western Front in support of their goals.

==Mexican response==
Mexican President [[Venustiano Carranza]] assigned a military commission to assess the feasibility of the Mexican takeover of their former territories contemplated by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Katz (1981), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The generals concluded that it would be neither possible nor even desirable to attempt such an enterprise for the following reasons:

* Mexico was in the midst of a civil war and Carranza's position was far from secure. A declaration of war by his regime would have provided an opportunity for opposing factions to align with the U.S. and Allied Powers in exchange for diplomatic recognition. 
* The United States was far stronger militarily than Mexico was. Even if Mexico's military forces were completely united and loyal to a single regime, no serious scenario existed under which they could invade and win a war against the United States.
* Germany's promises of "generous financial support" were very unreliable. The German government had already informed Carranza in June 1916 that they were unable to provide the necessary gold needed to stock a completely independent Mexican national bank.&lt;ref name="William Beezley"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = William | last1 = Beezley | first2 = Michael | last2 = Meyer | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Amt1ZXMeVYMC&amp;q=%22gold+to+stock%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22gold%20to%20stock%22&amp;f=false | title = The Oxford History of Mexico | page = 476 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if Mexico received financial support, the arms, ammunition, and other needed war supplies would presumably have to be purchased from the [[ABC nations]] (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), which would strain relations with them, as explained below.
* Even if by some chance Mexico had the military means to win a conflict against the United States and reclaim the territories in question, Mexico would have severe difficulty accommodating and pacifying a large English-speaking population that was [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|better supplied with arms]] than most civilian populations.
* Other foreign relations were at stake. The [[ABC nations]] organized the [[Niagara Falls peace conference]] in 1914 to avoid a full-scale war between the United States and Mexico over the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]]. If Mexico were to enter war against the United States, it would strain relations with those nations.

The Carranza government was recognized ''[[de jure]]'' by the United States on 31 August 1917 as a direct consequence of the Zimmermann telegram, since recognition was necessary to ensure [[Mexico in World War I|Mexican neutrality in World War I]].&lt;ref name="Thomas Paterson"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Paterson | first2 = J.

==British interception==
[[File:Ztel2.jpg|thumb|left|A portion of the Telegram as decrypted by [[British Naval Intelligence]] codebreakers. The word ''Arizona'' was not in the German codebook and thus had to be split into phonetic syllables.]]

The telegram was sent to the German embassy in the United States for re-transmission to Eckardt in Mexico. It has traditionally been claimed that the telegram was sent over three routes: transmitted by radio and also sent over two [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|trans-Atlantic telegraph cables]] operated by neutral governments (the United States and Sweden) for the use of their diplomatic services. But it has been established that only one method was used. The message was delivered to the United States Embassy in Berlin and then transmitted by [[diplomatic cable]] first to Copenhagen and then to London for onward transmission over transatlantic cable to Washington.&lt;ref name="Gannon"&gt;{{cite book |ref= Gannon |last= Gannon |first= Paul |title= Inside Room 40: The Codebreakers of World War I |location= London |publisher= Ian Allan Publishing |year= 2011|isbn= 978-0-7110-3408-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The misinformation about the "three routes" was spread by [[William Reginald Hall]], then the head of [[Room 40]], to try to conceal from the United States the fact that Room 40 was intercepting its cable traffic.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Direct telegraph transmission of the telegram was not possible because the British had cut the German international cables at the outbreak of war. However, the United States allowed limited use of its diplomatic cables with Germany to communicate with its ambassador in Washington. The facility was supposed to be used for cables connected with President Woodrow Wilson's peace proposals.&lt;ref name="Gannon"/&gt;

The Swedish cable ran from Sweden, and the United States cable from the United States embassy in [[Denmark]]. However, neither cable ran directly to the United States. Both cables passed through a relay station at [[Porthcurno]], near [[Land's End]], the westernmost tip of England. Here the signals were boosted for the long trans-oceanic jump ''(by radio)''. All traffic through the Porthcurno relay was copied to British intelligence, in particular to the [[cryptanalysis|codebreakers]] and analysts in [[Room 40]] at the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref name="SigSec"&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Rupert Allason |last= West |first= Nigel |title= The Sigint Secrets: The Signals Intelligence War, 1990 to Today-Including the Persecution of Gordon Welchman |publisher= Quill |location= New York |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-688-09515-1 | pages = 83, 87–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their telegraph cables had been cut, the German Foreign Office appealed to the United States for use of their cable for diplomatic messages. President Wilson agreed to this, in the belief that such cooperation would sustain continued good relations with Germany, and that more efficient German-American diplomacy could assist Wilson's goal of a negotiated end to the war. The Germans handed in messages to the United States embassy in Berlin, which were relayed to the embassy in Denmark and then to the United States by American telegraph operators. However, the United States placed conditions on German usage, most notably that all messages had to be in clear (i.e., uncoded). The Germans assumed that the United States cable was secure and used it extensively.&lt;ref name="SigSec"/&gt;

However, this put German diplomats in a precarious situation: They were reliant on the United States to transmit Zimmermann's note to its final destination, but the message's unencrypted contents would be deeply alarming to the Americans. The Germans persuaded [[United States Ambassador to Germany|U.S. Ambassador]] [[James W. Gerard]] to accept it in coded form, and it was transmitted on 16 January 1917.&lt;ref name="SigSec"/&gt;

In Room 40, [[Nigel de Grey]] had partially deciphered the telegram by the next day.&lt;ref name="Gannon"/&gt;  Room 40 had previously obtained German cipher documents, including the diplomatic cipher 13040 (captured in the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]), and naval cipher 0075, retrieved from the wrecked cruiser [[SMS Magdeburg|SMS ''Magdeburg'']] by the Russians, who passed it to the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Polmar |first1= Norman |last2=  Noot |first2= Jurrien |title= Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies 1718–1990 |location= Annapolis |publisher= US Naval Institute Press |year= 1991 |lastauthoramp= y |ref= Polmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disclosure of the Telegram would sway public opinion in the United States against Germany, provided the Americans could be convinced it was genuine. But Room 40 chief William Reginald Hall was reluctant to let it out, because the disclosure would expose the German codes broken in Room 40 and British eavesdropping on the United States cable. Hall waited three weeks. During this period, Grey and cryptographer [[William Montgomery (cryptographer)|William Montgomery]] completed the decryption. On 1 February Germany announced resumption of  "unrestricted" submarine warfare, an act which led the United States to break off diplomatic relations with Germany on 3 February.&lt;ref name="SigSec"/&gt;
[[File:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|The Telegram, completely decrypted and translated]]
Hall passed the telegram to the Foreign Office on 5 February, but still warned against releasing it. Meanwhile, the British discussed possible cover stories: to explain to the Americans how they got the ciphertext of the telegram without admitting to their ability to intercept American diplomatic communications (which they would continue to do for another twenty-five years); and to explain how they got the cleartext of the telegram without letting the Germans know their codes were broken. Furthermore, the British needed to find a way to convince the Americans the message was not a forgery.&lt;ref name=BBC2017&gt;{{cite news|title=Why was the Zimmerman Telegram so important?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38581861|accessdate=17 January 2017|work=BBC|date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first story, the British obtained the ciphertext of the telegram from the Mexican commercial telegraph office. The British knew that the German Embassy in Washington would relay the message by commercial telegraph, so the Mexican telegraph office would have the ciphertext. ''"Mr. H,"'' a British agent in Mexico, bribed an employee of the commercial telegraph company for a copy of the message. ([[Thomas Hohler|Sir Thomas Hohler]], then British ambassador in Mexico, claimed to have been ''"Mr. H,"'' or at least involved with the interception, in his autobiography.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}) This ciphertext could be shown to the Americans without embarrassment. Moreover, the retransmission was enciphered using the older cipher 13040, so by mid-February the British had not only the complete text, but also the ability to release the telegram without revealing the extent to which the latest German codes had been broken. (At worst, the Germans might have realized that the 13040 code had been compromised, but weighed against the possibility of United States entry into the war, that was a risk worth taking.) Finally, since copies of the 13040 ciphertext would also have been deposited in the records of the American commercial telegraph company, the British had the ability to prove the authenticity of the message to the United States government.&lt;ref name=BBCHistory2017/&gt;

As a cover story, the British could publicly claim that their agents had stolen the telegram's deciphered text in Mexico. Privately, the British needed to give the Americans the 13040 cipher so that the United States government could verify the authenticity of the message independently with their own commercial telegraphic records; however the Americans agreed to back the official cover story.  The German Foreign Office refused to consider a possible code break, and instead sent Ambassador Eckardt on a witch-hunt for a traitor in the embassy in Mexico. (Eckardt indignantly rejected these accusations, and the Foreign Office eventually declared the embassy exonerated.)&lt;ref name="SigSec"/&gt;

===Use===
On 19 February, Hall showed the Telegram to Edward Bell, secretary of the United States Embassy in Britain. Bell was at first incredulous and thought it to be a forgery. Once Bell was convinced the message was genuine, he became enraged. On 20 February, Hall informally sent a copy to United States Ambassador [[Walter Hines Page]]. On 23 February, Page met with British Foreign Minister [[Arthur James Balfour|Arthur Balfour]] and was given the ciphertext, the message in German, and the English translation. Page then reported the story to President [[Woodrow Wilson]], including details to be verified from telegraph company files in the United States. Wilson released the text to the media on 28 February 1917.

==Effect in the United States==
[[File:Cartoon for a Telegram.jpg|thumb|210px|1917 political cartoon about the Zimmermann Telegram]]
Popular sentiment in the United States at that time was [[Anti-Mexican sentiment|anti-Mexican]] as well as [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]], while in Mexico there was considerable [[anti-American sentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref= Link |last= Link |first= Arthur S. |title= Wilson: Campaigns for Progressivism and Peace: 1916–1917 |year= 1965 |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb01547.0005.001;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;cc=acls}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[John J. Pershing]] [[Pancho Villa Expedition|had long been chasing]] the revolutionary [[Pancho Villa]] and carried out several cross-border raids. News of the telegram further inflamed tensions between the United States and Mexico.
[[File:Exploding in his Hands.jpg|left|thumb|225x225px|"Exploding in his Hands"]]
However, there was also a notable [[anti-British sentiment]] in the United States, particularly among [[German Americans|German-]] and [[Irish American|Irish-Americans]].  Many Americans wished to avoid the conflict in Europe. Since the public had been told (untruthfully) that the telegram had been stolen in a deciphered form in Mexico, the message was widely believed at first to be an elaborate forgery perpetrated by British intelligence. This belief, which was not restricted to pacifist and pro-German lobbies, was promoted by German and Mexican diplomats and by some American newspapers, especially the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst press empire]]. This presented the Wilson administration with a dilemma. With the evidence the United States had been provided confidentially by the British, Wilson realized the message was genuine—but he could not make the evidence public without compromising the British codebreaking operation.

Any doubts as to the authenticity of the telegram were removed by Arthur Zimmermann himself. First at a press conference on 3 March 1917, he told an American journalist, "I cannot deny it. It is true." Then, on 29 March 1917, Zimmermann gave a speech in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in which he admitted the telegram was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref= Meyer |last= Meyer |first= Michael C. |title= The Mexican-German Conspiracy of 1915 |journal= The Americas |volume= 23 |issue= 1  |year=1966 |page=76 |doi=10.2307/980141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmermann hoped Americans would understand the idea was that Germany would only fund Mexico's war with the United States in the prior event of American entry into World War I.

On 1 February 1917, Germany began unrestricted submarine warfare against all ships in the Atlantic bearing the American flag, both passenger and merchant ships.  Two ships were sunk in February, and most American shipping companies held their ships in port. Besides the highly provocative war proposal to Mexico, the telegram also mentioned "ruthless employment of our submarines".  Public opinion demanded action.  Wilson had previously refused to assign US Navy crews and guns to the merchant ships. However, once the Zimmermann note was public, Wilson called for arming the merchant ships, but [[anti-war]] elements in the [[United States Senate]] blocked his proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Richard W | last = Leopold | title = The Growth of American Foreign Policy: A History | year = 1962 | pages = 330–31 | publisher = Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 1917, Congress voted to [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declare war on Germany]]; Wilson had asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] for "a [[The war to end war|war to end all wars]]" that would "make the world safe for democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur S. |last=Link |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era, 1910–1917 |year=1972 |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |pages=252–282 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodrow Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and Tampico in 1917–1918,&lt;ref name="Ernest Gruening"&gt;{{cite book | first = Ernest | last = Gruening | year = 1968 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VoBlAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=occupation+president+wilson | title = Mexico and Its Heritage | page = 596 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halevy"&gt;{{cite book | first = Drew Philip | last = Halevy | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WOfKxFigGSwC | title = Threats of Intervention: U.

==Japanese response==
The government of Japan, another nation mentioned in the Zimmerman Telegram, was already involved in World War I, on the side of the Allied Powers against Germany. The Japanese government later released a statement that Japan was not interested in changing sides and attacking America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://historyguy.com/zimmerman_telegram.htm | title = Zimmerman Telegram: What Was The Zimmerman Telegram, and How Did It Affect World War One? | date = | first = Roger | last = Lee | work = The History Guy | access-date = 27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autograph discovery==
In October 2005, it was reported that an original typescript of the deciphered Zimmermann Telegram had recently been discovered by an unnamed historian who was researching and preparing an official history of the United Kingdom's [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ). The document is believed to be the actual telegram shown to the American ambassador in London in 1917. Marked in Admiral Hall's handwriting at the top of the document are the words: "This is the one handed to Dr Page and exposed by the President." Since many of the secret documents in this incident had been destroyed, it had previously been assumed that the original typed "decrypt" was gone forever. However, after the discovery of this document, the GCHQ official historian said: "I believe that this is indeed the same document that Balfour handed to Page."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |ref= Fenton |last= Fenton |first= Ben |work= The Telegraph |location= London |date= 17 October 2005 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1500812/Telegram-that-brought-US-into-Great-War-is-found-found.html  |title= Telegram that brought US into Great War is Found Found }}&lt;/ref&gt;
