      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3522">'''Antonia Rufina Maymón Giménez''' (18 July 1881 &amp;ndash; 20 December 1959)  was a Spanish [[rationalist]] [[pedagogue]], militant [[naturist]], [[anarchist]], and [[feminist]] who published books on various topics.

Antonia Rufina Maymón Giménez was born on July 18, 1881 in [[Madrid]], Spain to a family from [[Aragon]]. She studied to be a teacher in the 'Escuela Normal Femenina' of [[Zaragoza]], a city where she also married professor Lorenzo Lagoon, an anarchist. For her membership in the National Committee against the war in Morocco, she was  tried and convicted, along with [[Teresa Claramunt]] and [[Josefa Lopez]]. In those years, she published her first newspaper articles in various anarchist journals, as 'La Enseñanza Moderna' (Modern Education) and 'Cultura y Acción' (Culture and Action). The couple was exiled to [[Bordeaux]] in 1911, but she received amnesty two years later after the death of her husband. Upon her return, she spoke at rallies across the country and worked as a teacher in schools in [[Barcelona]], [[Sant Feliu de Guíxols]], [[Elda]] and [[Beniaján]]. Driving the naturist movement in Spain, she participated in and presided over congresses on these ideals in [[Bilbao]] and [[Malaga]]. After the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], she moved to Beniaján, where she settled permanently. There, she gave rallies for the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), held a school in her own home and developed an intense social work program among the needy. In 1932, she published "Estudios Racionalistas", where she exhibited her educational thoughts regarding children's education regardless of social class. At the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], she was convicted and imprisoned until 1944. Two years later, she was arrested and imprisoned  again for almost a year. Her health impaired, she returned to her home Beniaján where she gave private lessons. She died in a local hospital on 20 December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonia Maymón|url=http://www.biblioromance.es/Antonia-Maymon.php|website=biblioromance.es|accessdate=18 September 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Iturbe|1974|p=82}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4464">'''Ānvīkṣikī''' is a term in [[Sanskrit]] denoting roughly the "science of inquiry" and it should have been recognized in India as a distinct branch of learning as early as 650 BCE.&lt;ref name=Satis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satischandra Vidyabhusana|title=A History of Indian Logic|date=1920|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the centuries its meaning and import have undergone considerable variations. In the earliest period, the term was used to denote Atma-vidya, the science of the soul, in contrast to Adhyatma-vidya, the spiritual science, or Brahma-vidya, the divine science.&lt;ref name=Satis/&gt; In [[Manu Smriti]] the term  Ānvīkṣikī has been used as equivalent to Atma-vidya and it has been described as a branch of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=Satis/&gt; In the fourth century BCE, [[Kautilya]] in his [[Arthashastra]] recognised it as a distinct branch of learning different from Vedas and other disciplines. Kautilya classifies all disciplines into four categories: scripture (the three Vedas, ''trayi''), agriculture and commerce (''varta''), politics and public administration (''danda-niti''), and ''Ānvīkṣikī'', the investigative reflective science.&lt;ref name=Satis/&gt; The distinction between Atma-vidya and Ānvīkṣikī is that while the former embodied certain dogmatic assertions about the nature of the [[soul]], the latter contained reasons supporting those assertions. Thus Ānvīkṣikī dealt with two subjects, namely, ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atma]]'', soul, and ''hetu'', theory of reasons. The [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]],  and [[Lokayata]], in so far as they treated of reasons affirming or denying the existence of soul, were included by Kautilya in the Ānvīkṣikī.&lt;ref name=Satis2/&gt; Of the two subjects studied in the ambit of Ānvīkṣikī, the study of soul later developed and matured into a separate independent study described by the term ''Darsanas'' (meaning philosophy), and the theory  of    reasons was developed into an independent branch of study referred to as ''Nyaya'' or logic. This bifurcation of Ānvīkṣikī into philosophy and logic must have had its beginning in around 550 BCE with the exposition of the logical side of Ānvīkṣikī by [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]].&lt;ref name=Satis2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satischandra Vidyabhusana|title=A History of Indian Logic|date=1920|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the term Ānvīkṣikī has been in use in the general sense of a science embracing both the science of soul and the theory of reasons.

It is interesting to observe that when the part of Ānvīkṣikī dealing with the theory of reasons developed into logic, the term Ānvīkṣikī began to be used to denote in this exclusive sense also. For example, [[Manusamhita]] has used this term in this special sense of logic.&lt;ref name=Satis3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satischandra Vidyabhusana|title=A History of Indian Logic|date=1920|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gautama-dharma-sutra, [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]] all have used the term Ānvīkṣikī in this special sense. Ānvīkṣikī in this special sense has also been called by several other names, namely, ''Hetu-sastra'', ''Hetu-vidya'', ''Tarka-sastra'', ''Vada-vidya'', and also by [[Nyaya|Nyaya-sastra]].

==Teachers of Ānvīkṣikī==
There are a few great teachers who wrote about and taught the doctrines of Ānvīkṣikī in the earliest sense of the term, that is, as a study of both philosophy  and logic. [[Charvaka]] (c. 650 BCE), known for his materialistic doctrine, [[Kapila]] (c.  650–575 BCE), known for his doctrine of matter and soul, [[Dattatreya]] (c. 650 BCE), known for his parable of a tree, Punarvasu Atreya (c. 550 BCE), known for his dissertation on senses, Sulabha (c. 550 BCE), a lady ascetic known for canons of speech, [[Ashtavakra]] (c. 550–500 BCE) known as a violent debater, and Medhatithi Gautama (c. 550 BCE), known as the founder of Indian logic, are some of these great teachers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16744">'''Asian pride''' is a term utilized internationally but has various origins and meanings.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015" /&gt;

==International usage==
Asian pride is a broad term that can cover several topics. Within the [[international relations]] context, [[Asian people|Asian]] [[pride]] can be seen within Asian politics as advancement of [[Pan-Asianism]] through heavy criticism of the [[Western world|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langguth |first1=Gerd |year=1996 |title=Dawn of the "Pacific Century"? |journal=German Foreign Affairs Review |volume=47 |issue=4 |url=http://www.gerd-langguth.de/fremdsprachtext/asian_values.htm |accessdate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610190612/http://www.gerd-langguth.de/fremdsprachtext/asian_values.htm |archivedate=10 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dalrymple |first=Rawdon |title=Continental Drift: Australia's Search for a Regional Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujY4nUQdtkC&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Asian%20Pride%22&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Asian%20Pride%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 January 2013 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |isbn=9780754634461 |page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, China referred to India's successful [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] of ''Mangalyaan'' as the "pride of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-heralds-indias-mars-mission-mangalyaan-pride-asia-1466953 |title=China Heralds India's Mars Mission Mangalyaan as 'Pride of Asia'

==United States==
The pan-ethnicity Asian American concept is not embraced by many Asian Americans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wong |first=William |title=Yellow Journalist: Dispatches from Asian America |series=Maping Racisms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evNtIyLKQZcC&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2001 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=9781566398305 |page=187 |quote=The Asian pride argument is not realistic in these times, at least in most cities and especially at state and national levels. For one thing, what is "Asian Pride"? There is a pan-Asian sentiment among some Asian Americans. Many Americans of Asian background, though, don't embrace the vague "Asian American" sobriquet. The identity label of choice rangers from plain old "American" to particular Asian ethnicity.}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Tilden Rhea|title=Race Pride and the American Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nlue11bhyb4C&amp;pg=PA39|date=1 May 2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00576-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yellow Power===
In the United States the term has older roots within the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter culture movement]] among Asian Americans in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meredith Leigh Oyen|editor=Gina Misiroglu|title=American Countercultures: An Encyclopedia of Nonconformists, Alternative Lifestyles, and Radical Ideas in U.S. History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4KsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=26 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47729-7|page=45|chapter=Asian Pride}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period there was the [[Black Power]] movement, and Asian Americans seeing the impact it had on African-American culture and overall society, rejecting being called "[[Oriental]]" and the stereotype of the "[[yellow peril]]" used the term Asian Pride, along with "yellow power", to advance empowerment of Asian Americans.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret L. Andersen|author2=Howard F.

===Hip Hop culture===
A more modern usage of the term "Asian Pride" (also spelled '''AZN pride''') the [[United States]] is a positive stance to being Asian American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Malaspina|title=The Ethnic and Group Identity Movements: Earning Recognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYvUouktxv4C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0633-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term arose from influences of [[Hip hop#Culture|hip hop culture]] within [[Asian American]] communities in the [[Western United States]] due to the creation of an Asian American pan-ethnicity (the concept was influenced in the late 20th century due to the influence of publications such as ''[[Yolk magazine|Yolk]]'' and ''[[Giant Robot (magazine)|Giant Robot]]'' magazines) that did not specify a specific ethnicity (such as [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]], or [[Hmong American|Hmong]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DiMaggio |first=Paul |last2=Fernández-Kelly |first2=María Patricia  |title=Art in the Lives of Immigrant Communities in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uHJprl1xkmUC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=Asian+pride&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XAfUUPPpLOGuiQLk7YHQAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813547572 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kathleen |editor1-last=Nadeau |editor2-first= Jonathan H.X.  |editor2-last=Lee |last=Nguyen |first=Jason R. |title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife, Volume 1 |chapter=Pan Asian Americans: "Got Rice?" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0sEJ_0vV1QC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313350672 |page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of this was the [[Got Rice?]] term, which spun off from the advertising campaign [[Got Milk?]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Malaspina|title=The Ethnic and Group Identity Movements: Earning Recognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYvUouktxv4C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0633-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger Asian Americans are finding strength from their Asian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chou |first=Rosalind S. |title=Asian American Sexual Politics: The Construction of Race, Gender, and Sexuality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVUvp-XcLB8C&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9781442209244 |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another usage of the term was [[Greg Pak]]'s ''Asian Pride Porn!'', which used [[political correct]] [[pornography]] parody to present Asian Americans in a positive light compared to their [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States#Emasculation and asexuality|portrayal in late 20th century mainstream media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rachel C.

===Got Rice?===
The phrase '''"Got Rice?"''' is a term that was coined by [[Asian American]] youth in the 1990s shortly after the original "[[Got Milk?]]" advertising campaign for the California Milk Board in 1993.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H. X. Lee|author2=Kathleen M. Nadeau|title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BrfLWdeISoC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35066-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has since come to be used as a symbol for the cohesiveness of Asian American cultural identity and cultural pride, especially on the [[Internet]]. It's usually mentioned close to the [[Asian Pride]] slogan.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011" /&gt;

The humor is derived from the fact that [[rice]] is a staple food in many Asian cultures. The slogan can thus be viewed as an Asian American cultural response to American media and advertising.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011" /&gt;

There is also a parody song called "Got Rice?", often referred as AZN Pride, which samples [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac's]] "[[Changes (Tupac Shakur song)|Changes]]".&lt;ref name="Raphael-HernandezSteen2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TuNguyen2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu|author2=Mimi Thi Nguyen|title=Alien Encounters: Popular Culture in Asian America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCt-TShr854C&amp;pg=PA66|date=27 March 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8983-5|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song dates back to at least 2000, and has been described as being in the [[wikt:raptivist|raptivist]] genre;&lt;ref name="Raphael-HernandezSteen2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heike Raphael-Hernandez|author2=Shannon Steen|title=AfroAsian Encounters: Culture, History, Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvqgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 November 2006|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-7690-2|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also noted as an example of Asian Americans, specifically [[Chinese Americans]], adoption and adaption of [[Hip Hop culture]].&lt;ref name="Lee2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H.

====T-shirt campaign====
While the phrase itself presumably began as Asian American slang, the first notable usage is the T-shirt campaign first started by the Asian American magazine ''[[Yolk magazine|Yolk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | author= Olivia Barker
  | title= Eastern Influences Become Icons of Popular Culture
  | url = http://www.modelminority.com/article8.html
  | publisher=USA Today
  | date = March 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Soon, other Asian American organizations began promoting the phrase and selling similar T-shirt designs. The organizations and their proponents intended for the T-shirts to be a fun way of promoting Asian American cultural heritage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Political identi-tees don’t all have to be so in-your-face. The Japanese American National Museum (http://www.janm.org/) in L.A.’s Little Tokyo offers an array of kinder, gentler tees commemorating aspects of Japanese-American heritage both fun and serious. Among the most popular designs, a line of adult and baby tees feature the rallying cry of the lactose liberation movement, "Got Rice?"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |author=S. D. Ikeda 
 |url=http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/ikeda_asian_tshirts1_archived.asp 
 |title=Identi-tees: Stereotypes, Abercrombie &amp; the Chest as a Battlefield

 |archivedate=2006-03-16 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many in the Asian American community viewed the design as evidence of significant progress for the viability of Asian American culture and identity; whereas before identity may have been enforced on Asians via stereotypes from the dominant society, the "Got Rice?" shirts were an attempt by Asian Americans to define their identity and to take back those symbols used to stereotype them.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Berner.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; formalizes [[mathematical structure]] and its concepts in terms of a labeled [[directed graph]] called a ''[[Category (mathematics)|category]]'', whose nodes are called  ''objects'', and whose labelled directed edges are called  ''arrows'' (or [[morphism]]s). A [[Category (mathematics)|category]] has two basic properties: the ability to [[Function composition|compose]] the arrows [[Associativity|associatively]], and the existence of an [[Identity function|identity]] arrow for each object. The language of category theory has been used to formalize concepts of other high-level [[abstractions]] such as [[set theory|sets]], [[ring theory|rings]], and [[group theory|groups]]. Informally, category theory is a general theory of [[function (mathematics)|functions]].

Several terms used in category theory, including the term "morphism", are used differently from their uses in the rest of mathematics. In category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself.

[[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] introduced the concepts of categories, [[functor]]s, and [[natural transformation]]s in 1942–45 in their study of [[algebraic topology]], with the goal of understanding the processes that preserve mathematical structure.

Category theory has practical applications in [[programming language theory]], for example the usage of [[Monad (functional programming)|monads in functional programming]].   It may also be used as an axiomatic foundation for mathematics, as an alternative to [[set theory]] and other proposed foundations.

==Basic concepts  ==
Categories represent abstractions of other mathematical concepts.
Many areas of mathematics can be formalised by category theory as [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. Hence category theory uses abstraction to make it possible to state and prove many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields in a much simpler way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geroch|first=Robert|title=Mathematical physics|year=1985|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-28862-8|pages=7|edition=[Repr.]|quote=Note that theorem 3 is actually easier for categories in general than it is for the special case of sets. This phenomenon is by no means rare.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic example of a category is the [[category of sets]], where the objects are sets and the arrows are functions from one set to another.  However, the objects of a category need not be sets, and the arrows need not be functions. Any way of formalising a mathematical concept such that it meets the basic conditions on the behaviour of objects and arrows is a valid category—and all the results of category theory apply to it.

The "arrows" of category theory are often said to represent a process connecting two objects, or in many cases a "structure-preserving" transformation connecting two objects. There are, however, many applications where much more abstract concepts are represented by objects and morphisms. The most important property of the arrows is that they can be "composed", in other words, arranged in a sequence to form a new arrow.

== Applications of categories==
Categories now appear in many branches of mathematics, some areas of [[theoretical computer science]] where they can correspond to [[Data type|types]] or to [[database schema]]s, and [[mathematical physics]] where they can be used to describe [[vector space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;B.

Springer-Verlag, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linear algebra]] can also be expressed in terms of categories of matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macedo | first1 = H.D. | last2 = Oliveira | first2 = J.N. | year = 2013 | title = Typing linear algebra: A biproduct-oriented approach | doi = 10.1016/j.scico.2012.07.012 | journal = Science of Computer Programming | volume = 78 | issue = 11| pages = 2160–2191 | arxiv = 1312.4818 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.747.2083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the first application of category theory outside pure mathematics was the "metabolism-repair" model of  autonomous living organisms by [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosen|first1=Robert|title=The representation of biological systems from the standpoint of the theory of categories|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics|date=1958|volume=20|pages=317–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Utility ==

=== Categories, objects, and morphisms ===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The study of [[category (mathematics)|categories]] is an attempt to ''axiomatically'' capture what is commonly found in various classes of related [[mathematical structures]] by relating them to the ''structure-preserving functions'' between them. A systematic study of category theory then allows us to prove general results about any of these types of mathematical structures from the axioms of a category.

Consider the following example. The [[class (set theory)|class]] '''Grp''' of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] consists of all objects having a "group structure". One can proceed to [[mathematical proof|prove]] [[theorem]]s about groups by making logical deductions from the set of axioms defining groups. For example, it is immediately proven from the axioms that the [[identity element]] of a group is unique.

Instead of focusing merely on the individual objects (e.g., groups) possessing a given structure, category theory emphasizes the [[morphism]]s – the structure-preserving mappings – ''between'' these objects; by studying these morphisms, one is able to learn more about the structure of the objects. In the case of groups, the morphisms are the [[group homomorphism]]s. A group homomorphism between two groups "preserves the group structure" in a precise sense; informally it is a "process" taking one group to another, in a way that carries along information about the structure of the first group into the second group. The study of group homomorphisms then provides a tool for studying general properties of groups and consequences of the group axioms.

A similar type of investigation occurs in many mathematical theories, such as the study of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] maps (morphisms) between [[topological space]]s in [[topology]] (the associated category is called '''Top'''), and the study of [[smooth function]]s (morphisms) in [[manifold theory]].

Not all categories arise as "structure preserving (set) functions", however; the standard example is the category of homotopies between [[pointed topological space]]s.

If one axiomatizes [[Finitary relation|relations]] instead of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], one obtains the theory of [[Allegory (category theory)|allegories]].

=== Functors ===
{{Main|Functor}}
{{See also|Adjoint functors#Motivation}}

A category is ''itself'' a type of mathematical structure, so we can look for "processes" which preserve this structure in some sense; such a process is called a [[functor]].

[[Diagram chasing]] is a visual method of arguing with abstract "arrows" joined in diagrams. Functors are represented by arrows between categories, subject to specific defining commutativity conditions. Functors can define (construct) categorical diagrams and sequences (viz. Mitchell, 1965){{citation needed|date=September 2018}}. A functor associates to every object of one category an object of another category, and to every morphism in the first category a morphism in the second.

As a result, this defines a category ''of categories and functors'' – the objects are categories, and the morphisms (between categories) are functors.

Studying categories and functors is not just studying a class of mathematical structures and the morphisms between them but rather the ''relationships between various classes of mathematical structures''. This fundamental idea first surfaced in [[algebraic topology]]. Difficult ''topological'' questions can be translated into ''algebraic'' questions which are often easier to solve.  Basic constructions, such as the [[fundamental group]] or the [[fundamental groupoid]] of a [[topological space]], can be expressed as functors to the category of [[groupoid]]s in this way, and the concept is pervasive in algebra and its applications.

=== Natural transformations ===
{{Main|Natural transformation}}

Abstracting yet again, some diagrammatic and/or sequential constructions are often "naturally related" – a vague notion, at first sight. This leads to the clarifying concept of [[natural transformation]], a way to "map" one functor to another. Many important constructions in mathematics can be studied in this context. "Naturality" is a principle, like [[general covariance]] in physics, that cuts deeper than is initially apparent. An arrow between two functors is a natural transformation when it is subject to certain naturality or commutativity conditions.

Functors and natural transformations ('naturality') are the key concepts in category theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mac Lane|1998|loc=p. 18: "As Eilenberg-Mac Lane first observed, 'category' has been defined in order to be able to define 'functor' and 'functor' has been defined in order to be able to define 'natural transformation'."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories, objects, and morphisms ==
{{Main|Category (mathematics)|Morphism}}

=== Categories ===
A ''category'' ''C'' consists of the following three mathematical entities:
* A [[Class (set theory)|class]] ob(''C''), whose elements are called ''objects'';
* A class hom(''C''), whose elements are called [[morphism]]s or [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] or ''arrows''. Each morphism '''''f''''' has a ''source object '''a''''' and ''target object '''b'''''. &lt;br /&gt;The expression {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}}, would be verbally stated as "''f'' is a morphism from ''a'' to ''b''".&lt;br /&gt;The expression {{nowrap|1='''hom(''a'', ''b'')'''}} – alternatively expressed as {{nowrap|1='''hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')'''}}, {{nowrap|1='''mor(''a'', ''b'')'''}}, or {{nowrap|1='''''C''(''a'', ''b'')'''}} – denotes the ''hom-class'' of all morphisms from ''a'' to ''b''.
* A [[binary operation]] ∘, called ''composition of morphisms'', such that for any three objects ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', we have {{nowrap|1=∘ : hom(''b'', ''c'') × hom(''a'', ''b'') → hom(''a'', ''c'')}}. The composition of {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''c''}} is written as {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}} or ''gf'',{{efn|Some authors compose in the opposite order, writing ''fg'' or {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g''}} for {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}}.  Computer scientists using category theory very commonly write {{nowrap|1=''f'' ; ''g''}} for {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}}}} governed by two axioms:
** [[Associativity]]: If {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}}, {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''c''}} and {{nowrap|1=''h'' : ''c'' → ''d''}} then {{nowrap|1=''h'' ∘  (''g'' ∘ ''f'') = (''h'' ∘ ''g'') ∘ ''f''}}, and
** [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]: For every object ''x'', there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''x'' → ''x''}} called the ''[[identity morphism]] for x'', such that for every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}}, we have {{nowrap|1=1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' = ''f'' = ''f'' ∘ 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
:: From the axioms, it can be proved that there is exactly one [[identity morphism]] for every object. Some authors deviate from the definition just given by identifying each object with its identity morphism.

=== Morphisms ===
Relations among morphisms (such as {{nowrap|1=''fg'' = ''h''}}) are often depicted using [[commutative diagram]]s, with "points" (corners) representing objects and "arrows" representing morphisms.

[[Morphism]]s can have any of the following properties. A morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' → ''b''}} is a:
* [[monomorphism]] (or ''monic'') if {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f'' ∘ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} for all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''x'' → ''a''}}.
* [[epimorphism]] (or ''epic'') if {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''b'' → ''x''}}.
* ''bimorphism'' if ''f'' is both epic and monic.
* [[isomorphism]] if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''a''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g'' ∘ ''f'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.{{efn|Note that a morphism that is both epic and monic is not necessarily an isomorphism! An elementary counterexample: in the category consisting of two objects ''A'' and ''B'', the identity morphisms, and a single morphism ''f'' from ''A'' to ''B'', ''f'' is both epic and monic but is not an isomorphism.}}
* [[endomorphism]] if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}. end(''a'') denotes the class of endomorphisms of ''a''.
* [[automorphism]] if ''f'' is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. aut(''a'') denotes the class of automorphisms of ''a''.
* [[retract (category theory)|retraction]] if a right inverse of ''f'' exists, i.e. if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''a''}} with {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
* [[section (category theory)|section]] if a left inverse of ''f'' exists, i.e. if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' → ''a''}} with {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Every retraction is an epimorphism, and every section is a monomorphism. Furthermore, the following three statements are equivalent:
* ''f'' is a monomorphism and a retraction;
* ''f'' is an epimorphism and a section;
* ''f'' is an isomorphism.

==Functors==
{{Main|Functor}}

[[Functor]]s are structure-preserving maps between categories. They can be thought of as morphisms in the category of all (small) categories.

A ('''covariant''') functor ''F'' from a category ''C'' to a category ''D'', written {{nowrap|1=''F'' : ''C'' → ''D''}}, consists of:
* for each object ''x'' in ''C'', an object ''F''(''x'') in ''D''; and
* for each morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' → ''y''}} in ''C'', a morphism {{nowrap|1=''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''x'') → ''F''(''y'')}},

such that the following two properties hold:
* For every object ''x'' in ''C'', {{nowrap|1=''F''(1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''F''(''x'')&lt;/sub&gt;}};
* For all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' → ''y''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''y'' → ''z''}}, {{nowrap|1=''F''(''g'' ∘ ''f'') = ''F''(''g'') ∘ ''F''(''f'')}}.

A '''contravariant''' functor {{nowrap|1=''F'': ''C'' → ''D''}} is like a covariant functor, except that it "turns morphisms around" ("reverses all the arrows"). More specifically, every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' → ''y''}} in ''C'' must be assigned to a morphism  {{nowrap|1=''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''y'') → ''F''(''x'')}} in ''D''. In other words, a contravariant functor acts as a covariant functor from the [[opposite category]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; to ''D''.

==Natural transformations==
{{Main|Natural transformation}}

A ''natural transformation'' is a relation between two functors. Functors often describe "natural constructions" and natural transformations then describe "natural homomorphisms" between two such constructions. Sometimes two quite different constructions yield "the same" result; this is expressed by a natural isomorphism between the two functors.

If ''F'' and ''G'' are (covariant) functors between the categories ''C'' and ''D'', then a natural transformation η from ''F'' to ''G'' associates to every object ''X'' in ''C'' a morphism {{nowrap|1=η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''F''(''X'') → ''G''(''X'')}} in ''D'' such that for every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} in ''C'', we have {{nowrap|1=η&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''F''(''f'') = ''G''(''f'') ∘ η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}}; this means that the following diagram is [[commutative diagram|commutative]]:

[[Image:Natural transformation.svg|175px|center|Commutative diagram defining natural transformations]]

The two functors ''F'' and ''G'' are called ''naturally isomorphic'' if there exists a natural transformation from ''F'' to ''G'' such that η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is an isomorphism for every object ''X'' in ''C''.

==Other concepts==

===Universal constructions, limits, and colimits===
{{Main|Universal property|Limit (category theory)}}

Using the language of category theory, many areas of mathematical study can be categorized. Categories include sets, groups and topologies.

Each category is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common, such as the [[empty set]] or the [[product topology|product of two topologies]], yet in the definition of a category, objects are considered atomic, i.e., we ''do not know'' whether an object ''A'' is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept. Hence, the challenge is to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. To define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets, one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find ''[[universal property|universal properties]]'' that uniquely determine the objects of interest.

Numerous important constructions can be described in a purely categorical way if the ''[[category theory|category limit]]'' can be developed and dualized to yield the notion of a ''colimit''.

===Equivalent categories===
{{Main|Equivalence of categories|Isomorphism of categories}}

It is a natural question to ask: under which conditions can two categories be considered ''essentially the same'', in the sense that theorems about one category can readily be transformed into theorems about the other category? The major tool one employs to describe such a situation is called ''equivalence of categories'', which is given by appropriate functors between two categories. Categorical equivalence has found [[Equivalence of categories#Examples|numerous applications]] in mathematics.

===Further concepts and results===
The definitions of categories and functors provide only the very basics of categorical algebra; additional important topics are listed below. Although there are strong interrelations between all of these topics, the given order can be considered as a guideline for further reading.
* The [[functor category]] ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''C''&lt;/sup&gt; has as objects the functors from ''C'' to ''D'' and as morphisms the natural transformations of such functors. The [[Yoneda lemma]] is one of the most famous basic results of category theory; it describes representable functors in functor categories.
* [[Dual (category theory)|Duality]]: Every statement, theorem, or definition in category theory has a ''dual'' which is essentially obtained by "reversing all the arrows". If one statement is true in a category ''C'' then its dual is true in the dual category ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;. This duality, which is transparent at the level of category theory, is often obscured in applications and can lead to surprising relationships.
* [[Adjoint functors]]: A functor can be left (or right) adjoint to another functor that maps in the opposite direction. Such a pair of adjoint functors typically arises from a construction defined by a universal property; this can be seen as a more abstract and powerful view on universal properties.

===Higher-dimensional categories===
{{Main|Higher category theory}}
Many of the above concepts, especially equivalence of categories, adjoint functor pairs, and functor categories, can be situated into the context of ''higher-dimensional categories''. Briefly, if we consider a morphism between two objects as a "process taking us from one object to another", then higher-dimensional categories allow us to profitably generalize this by considering "higher-dimensional processes".

For example, a (strict) [[2-category]] is a category together with "morphisms between morphisms", i.e., processes which allow us to transform one morphism into another. We can then "compose" these "bimorphisms" both horizontally and vertically, and we require a 2-dimensional "exchange law" to hold, relating the two composition laws. In this context, the standard example is '''Cat''', the 2-category of all (small) categories, and in this example, bimorphisms of morphisms are simply [[natural transformation]]s of morphisms in the usual sense. Another basic example is to consider a 2-category with a single object; these are essentially [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]]. [[bicategory|Bicategories]] are a weaker notion of 2-dimensional categories in which the composition of morphisms is not strictly associative, but only associative "up to" an isomorphism.

This process can be extended for all [[natural number]]s ''n'', and these are called [[n-category|''n''-categories]]. There is even a notion of ''[[quasi-category|ω-category]]'' corresponding to the [[ordinal number]] [[ω (ordinal number)|ω]].

Higher-dimensional categories are part of the broader mathematical field of [[higher-dimensional algebra]], a concept introduced by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]].  For a conversational introduction to these ideas, see [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html John Baez, 'A Tale of ''n''-categories' (1996).]

{{main|Timeline of category theory and related mathematics}}
{{rquote|right|It should be observed first that the whole concept of a  category is essentially an auxiliary one; our basic concepts are essentially those of a functor and of a natural transformation [...]|[[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]]|General theory of natural equivalences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eilenberg|first=Samuel|last2=MacLane|first2=Saunders|date=1945|title=General theory of natural equivalences|url=https://www.ams.org/tran/1945-058-00/S0002-9947-1945-0013131-6/|journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society|volume=58|pages=247|doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-1945-0013131-6|issn=0002-9947}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1942–45, [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] introduced categories, functors, and natural transformations as part of their work in topology, especially [[algebraic topology]]. Their work was an important part of the transition from intuitive and geometric [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[axiom]]atic [[homology theory]]. Eilenberg and Mac Lane later wrote that their goal was to understand natural transformations. That required defining functors, which required categories.

[[Stanislaw Ulam]], and some writing on his behalf, have claimed that related ideas were current in the late 1930s in Poland. Eilenberg was Polish, and studied mathematics in Poland in the 1930s. Category theory is also, in some sense, a continuation of the work of [[Emmy Noether]] (one of Mac Lane's teachers) in formalizing abstract processes; Noether realized that understanding a type of mathematical structure requires understanding the processes that preserve that structure. To achieve this understanding, Eilenberg and Mac Lane proposed an axiomatic formalization of the relation between structures and the processes that preserve them.

The subsequent development of category theory was powered first by the computational needs of [[homological algebra]], and later by the axiomatic needs of [[algebraic geometry]]. General category theory, an extension of [[universal algebra]] having many new features allowing for [[semantic]] flexibility and [[higher-order logic]], came later; it is now applied throughout mathematics.

Certain categories called [[topos|topoi]] (singular ''topos'') can even serve as an alternative to [[axiomatic set theory]] as a foundation of mathematics. A topos can also be considered as a specific type of category with two additional topos axioms. These foundational applications of category theory have been worked out in fair detail as a basis for, and justification of, [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]. [[Topos|Topos theory]] is a form of abstract [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]], with geometric origins, and leads to ideas such as [[pointless topology]].

[[Categorical logic]] is now a well-defined field based on [[type theory]] for [[intuitionistic logic]]s, with applications in [[functional programming]] and [[domain theory]], where a [[cartesian closed category]] is taken as a non-syntactic description of a [[lambda calculus]]. At the very least, category theoretic language clarifies what exactly these related areas have in common (in some [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] sense).

Category theory has been applied in other fields as well. For example, [[John Baez]] has shown a link between [[Feynman diagrams]] in Physics and monoidal categories.&lt;ref name="Baez09"&gt;{{cite arxiv |first1=J.C. |last1=Baez |first2=M. |last2=Stay |title=Physics, topology, logic and computation: A Rosetta stone |year=2009 |eprint=0903.0340 |class=quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application of category theory, more specifically: topos theory, has been made in mathematical music theory, see for example the book ''The Topos of Music, Geometric Logic of Concepts, Theory, and Performance'' by [[Guerino Mazzola]].

More recent efforts to introduce undergraduates to categories as a foundation for mathematics include those of [[William Lawvere]] and Rosebrugh (2003) and Lawvere and [[Stephen Schanuel]] (1997) and Mirroslav Yotov (2012).

In [[continuum mechanics]], the '''Cauchy stress [[tensor]]'''  &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, '''true stress tensor''',&lt;ref name=Irgens/&gt; or simply called the '''stress tensor''' is a second order [[tensor]] named after [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]].  The tensor consists of nine components &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; that completely define the state of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] at a point inside a material in the deformed state, placement, or configuration. The tensor relates a unit-length direction vector '''n''' to the stress vector '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''n''')&lt;/sup&gt; across an imaginary surface perpendicular to '''n''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf n)}= \mathbf n \cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}\quad \text{or} \quad T_j^{(n)}= \sigma_{ij}n_i.&lt;/math&gt;

where,

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{11} &amp; \sigma _{12} &amp; \sigma _{13} \\
\sigma _{21} &amp; \sigma _{22} &amp; \sigma _{23} \\
\sigma _{31} &amp; \sigma _{32} &amp; \sigma _{33} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]

\equiv \left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{xx} &amp; \sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{xz} \\
\sigma _{yx} &amp; \sigma _{yy} &amp; \sigma _{yz} \\
\sigma _{zx} &amp; \sigma _{zy} &amp; \sigma _{zz} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]
\equiv \left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _x &amp; \tau _{xy} &amp; \tau _{xz} \\
\tau _{yx} &amp; \sigma _y &amp; \tau _{yz} \\
\tau _{zx} &amp; \tau _{zy} &amp; \sigma _z \\
\end{matrix}}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The SI units of both stress tensor and stress vector are N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to the stress scalar. The unit vector is dimensionless.

The Cauchy stress tensor obeys the tensor transformation law under a change in the system of coordinates. A graphical representation of this transformation law is the [[Mohr's circle]] for stress.

The Cauchy stress tensor is used for stress analysis of material bodies experiencing [[Infinitesimal strain theory|small deformations]]: It is a central concept in the [[linear elasticity|linear theory of elasticity]]. For large deformations, also called [[Finite strain theory|finite deformations]], other measures of stress are required, such as the [[Stress (mechanics)#Alternative measures of stress|Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor]], the [[Biot stress tensor]], and the [[Kirchhoff stress tensor]].

According to the principle of [[conservation of linear momentum]], if the continuum body is in static equilibrium it can be demonstrated that the components of the Cauchy stress tensor in every material point in the body satisfy the equilibrium equations ([[Cauchy momentum equation|Cauchy's equations of motion]] for zero acceleration). At the same time, according to the principle of [[conservation of angular momentum]], equilibrium requires that the summation of [[Torque|moments]] with respect to an arbitrary point is zero, which leads to the conclusion that the [[Stress (mechanics)#Equilibrium equations and symmetry of the stress tensor|stress tensor is symmetric]], thus having only six independent stress components, instead of the original nine.

There are certain invariants associated with the stress tensor, whose values do not depend upon the coordinate system chosen, or the area element upon which the stress tensor operates. These are the three [[eigenvalues]] of the stress tensor, which are called the [[#Principal stresses and stress invariants|principal stresses]].

[[File:stress vector.svg|370px|right|thumb|Figure 2.1c Stress vector on an internal surface S with normal vector n. Depending on the orientation of the plane under consideration, the stress vector may not necessarily be perpendicular to that plane, ''i.e.'' parallel to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;, and can be resolved into two components: one component normal to the plane, called ''normal stress'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}&lt;/math&gt;, and another component parallel to this plane, called the ''shearing stress'' &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The '''Euler–Cauchy stress principle''' states that ''upon any surface (real or imaginary) that divides the body, the action of one part of the body on the other is equivalent (equipollent) to the system of distributed forces and couples on the surface dividing the body'',&lt;ref name=Truesdell/&gt; and it is represented by a field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}&lt;/math&gt;, called the stress vector, defined on the surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and assumed to depend continuously on the surface's unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fung/&gt;{{rp|p.66–96}}

To formulate the Euler–Cauchy stress principle, consider an imaginary surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; passing through an internal material point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; dividing the continuous body into two segments, as seen in Figure 2.1a or 2.1b (one may use either the cutting plane diagram or the diagram with the arbitrary volume inside the continuum enclosed by the surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;).

Following the classical dynamics of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], the motion of a material body is produced by the action of externally applied [[force]]s which are assumed to be of two kinds: [[Surface force|surface forces]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; and [[Body force|body forces]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith &amp; Truesdell p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the total force &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; applied to a body or to a portion of the body can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal F = \mathbf b + \mathbf F&lt;/math&gt;

Only surface forces will be discussed in this article as they are relevant to the Cauchy stress tensor.

When the body is subjected to external surface forces or ''contact forces'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt;, following [[Euler's laws|Euler's equations of motion]], internal contact forces and moments are transmitted from point to point in the body, and from one segment to the other through the dividing surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;,  due to the mechanical contact of one portion of the continuum onto the other (Figure 2.1a and 2.1b). On an element of area &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, with normal [[vector (geometry)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt;, the force distribution is equipollent to a contact force &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; exerted at point P and surface moment &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf M&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the contact force is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf F= \mathbf T^{(\mathbf n)}\,\Delta S&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf T^{(\mathbf n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''mean surface traction''.

Cauchy’s stress principle asserts&lt;ref name=Mase/&gt;{{rp|p.47–102}} that as &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; becomes very small and tends to zero the ratio &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf F/\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf F/dS&lt;/math&gt; and the couple stress vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf M&lt;/math&gt; vanishes. In specific fields of continuum mechanics the couple stress is assumed not to vanish; however, classical branches of continuum mechanics address non-[[chemical polarity|polar]] materials which do not consider couple stresses and body moments.

The resultant vector &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf F/dS&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ''surface traction'',&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt; also called ''stress vector'',&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt; ''traction'',&lt;ref name="Fung"/&gt; or ''traction vector''.&lt;ref name="Mase"/&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}=T_i^{(\mathbf{n})}\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; associated with a plane with a normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;T^{(\mathbf{n})}_i= \lim_{\Delta S \to 0} \frac {\Delta F_i}{\Delta S} = {dF_i \over dS}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation means that the stress vector depends on its location in the body and the orientation of the plane on which it is acting.

This implies that the balancing action of internal contact forces generates a ''contact force density'' or ''Cauchy traction field'' &lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf T(\mathbf n, \mathbf x, t)&lt;/math&gt; that represents a distribution of internal contact forces throughout the volume of the body in a particular [[Continuum mechanics|configuration of the body]] at a given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. It is not a vector field because it depends not only on the position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; of a particular material point, but also on the local orientation of the surface element as defined by its normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lubliner&gt;Lubliner&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the orientation of the plane under consideration, the stress vector may not necessarily be perpendicular to that plane, ''i.e.'' parallel to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt;, and can be resolved into two components (Figure 2.1c):

* one normal to the plane, called ''normal stress''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma_\mathrm{n}}= \lim_{\Delta S \to 0} \frac {\Delta F_\mathrm n}{\Delta S} = \frac{dF_\mathrm n}{dS},&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;dF_\mathrm n&lt;/math&gt; is the normal component of the force &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; to the differential area &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt;

* and the other parallel to this plane, called the ''shear stress''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf \tau= \lim_{\Delta S \to 0} \frac {\Delta F_\mathrm s}{\Delta S} = \frac{dF_\mathrm s}{dS},&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;dF_\mathrm s&lt;/math&gt; is the tangential component of the force &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; to the differential surface area &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt;. The shear stress can be further decomposed into two mutually perpendicular vectors.

===Cauchy’s postulate===
According to the ''Cauchy Postulate'', the stress vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}&lt;/math&gt; remains unchanged for all surfaces passing through the point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and having the same normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt;&lt;ref name=Basar/&gt; i.e., having a common [[tangent]] at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the stress vector is a function of the normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt; only, and is not influenced by the curvature of the internal surfaces.

===Cauchy’s fundamental lemma===
A consequence of Cauchy’s postulate is ''Cauchy’s Fundamental Lemma'',&lt;ref name=Irgens/&gt;&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atanackovic/&gt; also called the ''Cauchy reciprocal theorem'',&lt;ref name=Hjelmstad/&gt;{{rp|p.103–130}} which states that the stress vectors acting on opposite sides of the same surface are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Cauchy’s fundamental lemma is equivalent to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]] of motion of action and reaction, and is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;- \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}= \mathbf{T}^{(- \mathbf{n})}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Cauchy’s stress theorem—stress tensor==
''The state of stress at a point'' in the body is then defined by all the stress vectors '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''n''')&lt;/sup&gt; associated with all planes (infinite in number) that pass through that point.&lt;ref name=Chen/&gt; However, according to ''Cauchy’s fundamental theorem'',&lt;ref name=Atanackovic/&gt; also called ''Cauchy’s stress theorem'',&lt;ref name=Irgens/&gt; merely by knowing the stress vectors on three mutually perpendicular planes, the stress vector on any other plane passing through that point can be found through coordinate transformation equations.

Cauchy’s stress theorem states that there exists a second-order [[tensor field]] '''σ'''('''x''', t), called the Cauchy stress tensor, independent of '''n''', such that '''T''' is a linear function of '''n''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf n)}= \mathbf n \cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}\quad \text{or} \quad T_j^{(n)}= \sigma_{ij}n_i.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation implies that the stress vector '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''n''')&lt;/sup&gt; at any point ''P'' in a continuum associated with a plane with normal unit vector '''n''' can be expressed as a function of the stress vectors on the planes perpendicular to the coordinate axes, ''i.e.'' in terms of the components ''σ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the stress tensor '''σ'''.

To prove this expression, consider a [[tetrahedron]] with three faces oriented in the coordinate planes, and with an infinitesimal area d''A'' oriented in an arbitrary direction specified by a normal unit vector '''n''' (Figure 2.2). The tetrahedron is formed by slicing the infinitesimal element along an arbitrary plane '''n'''. The stress vector on this plane is denoted by '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''n''')&lt;/sup&gt;. The stress vectors acting on the faces of the tetrahedron are denoted as '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;, '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;, and '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;, and are by definition the components ''σ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the stress tensor '''σ'''. This tetrahedron is sometimes called the ''Cauchy tetrahedron''. The equilibrium of forces, ''i.e.'' [[Euler's laws of motion|Euler’s first law of motion]] (Newton’s second law of motion), gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})} \, dA - \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_1)} \, dA_1 - \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_2)} \, dA_2 - \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_3)} \, dA_3 = \rho \left( \frac{h}{3}dA \right) \mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Cauchy tetrahedron.svg|280px|right|thumb|Figure 2.2. Stress vector acting on a plane with normal unit vector '''n'''.&lt;br /&gt; '''A note on the sign convention:''' The tetrahedron is formed by slicing a parallelepiped along an arbitrary plane '''n'''. So, the force acting on the plane '''n''' is the reaction exerted by the other half of the parallelepiped and has an opposite sign.]]

where the right-hand-side represents the product of the mass enclosed by the tetrahedron and its acceleration: ''&amp;rho;'' is the density, '''a''' is the acceleration, and ''h'' is the height of the tetrahedron, considering the plane '''n''' as the base. The area of the faces of the tetrahedron perpendicular to the axes can be found by projecting d''A'' into each face (using the dot product):

:&lt;math&gt;dA_1= \left(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{e}_1 \right)dA = n_1 \; dA,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dA_2= \left(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 \right)dA = n_2 \; dA,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dA_3= \left(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{e}_3 \right)dA = n_3 \; dA,&lt;/math&gt;

and then substituting into the equation to cancel out d''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})} - \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_1)}n_1 - \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_2)}n_2 - \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_3)}n_3 = \rho \left( \frac{h}{3} \right) \mathbf{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

To consider the limiting case as the tetrahedron shrinks to a point, ''h'' must go to 0 (intuitively, the plane '''n''' is translated along '''n''' toward ''O''). As a result, the right-hand-side of the equation approaches 0, so

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})} = \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_1)} n_1 + \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_2)} n_2 + \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_3)} n_3.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a material element (Figure 2.3) with planes perpendicular to the coordinate axes of a Cartesian coordinate system, the stress vectors associated with each of the element planes, ''i.e.'' '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;, '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;, and '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; can be decomposed into a normal component and two shear components, ''i.e.'' components in the direction of the three coordinate axes. For the particular case of a surface with normal [[unit vector]] oriented in the direction of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-axis, denote the normal stress by ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, and the two shear stresses as ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_1)}= T_1^{(\mathbf{e}_1)}\mathbf{e}_1 + T_2^{(\mathbf{e}_1)} \mathbf{e}_2 + T_3^{(\mathbf{e}_1)} \mathbf{e}_3 = \sigma_{11} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{12} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{13} \mathbf{e}_3,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_2)}= T_1^{(\mathbf{e}_2)}\mathbf{e}_1 + T_2^{(\mathbf{e}_2)} \mathbf{e}_2 + T_3^{(\mathbf{e}_2)} \mathbf{e}_3=\sigma_{21} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{22} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{23} \mathbf{e}_3,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_3)}= T_1^{(\mathbf{e}_3)}\mathbf{e}_1 + T_2^{(\mathbf{e}_3)} \mathbf{e}_2 + T_3^{(\mathbf{e}_3)} \mathbf{e}_3=\sigma_{31} \mathbf{e}_1 + \sigma_{32} \mathbf{e}_2 + \sigma_{33} \mathbf{e}_3,&lt;/math&gt;

In index notation this is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_i)}= T_j^{(\mathbf{e}_i)} \mathbf{e}_j = \sigma_{ij} \mathbf{e}_j.&lt;/math&gt;

The nine components ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the stress vectors are the components of a second-order Cartesian tensor called the ''Cauchy stress tensor'', which completely defines the state of stress at a point and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}= \sigma_{ij} = \left[{\begin{matrix} \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_1)} \\
\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_2)} \\
\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_3)} \\
\end{matrix}}\right] =
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{11} &amp; \sigma _{12} &amp; \sigma _{13} \\
\sigma _{21} &amp; \sigma _{22} &amp; \sigma _{23} \\
\sigma _{31} &amp; \sigma _{32} &amp; \sigma _{33} \\
\end{matrix}}\right] \equiv \left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{xx} &amp; \sigma _{xy} &amp; \sigma _{xz} \\
\sigma _{yx} &amp; \sigma _{yy} &amp; \sigma _{yz} \\
\sigma _{zx} &amp; \sigma _{zy} &amp; \sigma _{zz} \\
\end{matrix}}\right] \equiv \left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _x &amp; \tau _{xy} &amp; \tau _{xz} \\
\tau _{yx} &amp; \sigma _y &amp; \tau _{yz} \\
\tau _{zx} &amp; \tau _{zy} &amp; \sigma _z \\
\end{matrix}}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; are normal stresses, and ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; are shear stresses. '''The first index ''i'' indicates that the stress acts on a plane normal to the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' -axis, and the second index ''j'' denotes the direction in which the stress acts''' (For example, σ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; implies that the stress is acting on the plane that is normal to the 1&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; axis i.e.;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and acts along the 2&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt; axis i.e.;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A stress component is positive if it acts in the positive direction of the coordinate axes, and if the plane where it acts has an outward normal vector pointing in the positive coordinate direction.

Thus, using the components of the stress tensor
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})} &amp;= \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_1)}n_1 + \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_2)}n_2 + \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_3)}n_3 \\
&amp; = \sum_{i=1}^3 \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{e}_i)}n_i \\
&amp;= \left( \sigma_{ij}\mathbf{e}_j \right)n_i \\
&amp;= \sigma_{ij}n_i\mathbf{e}_j
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;T_j^{(\mathbf n)}= \sigma_{ij}n_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, in matrix form we have
:&lt;math&gt;\left[{\begin{matrix}
T^{(\mathbf n)}_1 &amp; T^{(\mathbf n)}_2 &amp; T^{(\mathbf n)}_3\end{matrix}}\right]=\left[{\begin{matrix}
n_1 &amp; n_2 &amp; n_3
\end{matrix}}\right]\cdot
\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma _{11} &amp; \sigma _{12} &amp; \sigma _{13} \\
\sigma _{21} &amp; \sigma _{22} &amp; \sigma _{23} \\
\sigma _{31} &amp; \sigma _{32} &amp; \sigma _{33} \\
\end{matrix}}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Voigt notation]] representation of the Cauchy stress tensor takes advantage of the [[symmetry]] of the stress tensor to express the stress as a six-dimensional vector of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \begin{bmatrix}\sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \sigma_3 &amp; \sigma_4 &amp; \sigma_5 &amp; \sigma_6 \end{bmatrix}^T \equiv \begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{33} &amp; \sigma_{23} &amp; \sigma_{13} &amp; \sigma_{12} \end{bmatrix}^T.&lt;/math&gt;
The Voigt notation is used extensively in representing stress–strain relations in solid mechanics and for computational efficiency in numerical structural mechanics software.

===Transformation rule of the stress tensor===
It can be shown that the stress tensor is a [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] second order tensor, which is a statement of how it transforms under a change of the coordinate system. From an ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''-system to an '' x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;' ''-system, the components ''σ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the initial system are transformed into the components ''σ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;' '' in the new system according to the tensor transformation rule (Figure 2.4):

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma'_{ij}=a_{im}a_{jn}\sigma_{mn} \quad \text{or} \quad \boldsymbol{\sigma}' = \mathbf A \boldsymbol{\sigma} \mathbf A^{T},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''A''' is a [[rotation matrix]] with components ''a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''. In matrix form this is

:&lt;math&gt;\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma'_{11} &amp; \sigma'_{12} &amp; \sigma'_{13} \\
\sigma'_{21} &amp; \sigma'_{22} &amp; \sigma'_{23} \\
\sigma'_{31} &amp; \sigma'_{32} &amp; \sigma'_{33} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]=\left[{\begin{matrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{13} \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{23} \\
\sigma_{31} &amp; \sigma_{32} &amp; \sigma_{33} \\
\end{matrix}}\right]\left[{\begin{matrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{21} &amp; a_{31} \\
a_{12} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{32} \\
a_{13} &amp; a_{23} &amp; a_{33} \\
\end{matrix}}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the [[matrix operation]], and simplifying terms using the [[Stress (mechanics)#Equilibrium equations and symmetry of the stress tensor|symmetry of the stress tensor]], gives

The [[Mohr circle]] for stress is a graphical representation of this transformation of stresses.

===Normal and shear stresses===
The magnitude of the [[tangential and normal components|normal]] stress component ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of any stress vector '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''n''')&lt;/sup&gt; acting on an arbitrary plane with normal unit vector '''n''' at a given point, in terms of the components ''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the stress tensor '''σ''', is the [[dot product]] of the stress vector and the normal unit vector:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sigma_\mathrm{n} &amp;= \mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})}\cdot \mathbf{n} \\
&amp;=T^{(\mathbf n)}_i n_i \\
&amp;=\sigma_{ij}n_i n_j.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of the shear stress component ''&amp;tau;''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, acting orthogonal to the vector '''n''', can then be found using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau_\mathrm{n} &amp;=\sqrt{ \left( T^{(\mathbf n)} \right)^2-\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2} \\
&amp;= \sqrt{T_i^{(\mathbf n)}T_i^{(\mathbf n)}-\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\left( T^{(\mathbf n)} \right)^2 = T_i^{(\mathbf n)} T_i^{(\mathbf n)} = \left( \sigma_{ij} n_j \right) \left(\sigma_{ik} n_k \right) = \sigma_{ij} \sigma_{ik} n_j n_k.&lt;/math&gt;

==Balance laws – Cauchy's equations of motion==
[[File:Equilibrium equation body.svg|200px|right|thumb|Figure 4. Continuum body in equilibrium]]

===Cauchy's first law of motion===
According to the principle of [[conservation of linear momentum]], if the continuum body is in static equilibrium it can be demonstrated that the components of the Cauchy stress tensor in every material point in the body satisfy the equilibrium equations.
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{ji,j}+ F_i = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, for a [[hydrostatic fluid]] in equilibrium conditions, the stress tensor takes on the form:
:&lt;math&gt; {\sigma_{ij}} = -p{\delta_{ij}} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the hydrostatic pressure, and &lt;math&gt;{\delta_{ij}}\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[kronecker delta]].

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of equilibrium equations
|-
|Consider a continuum body (see Figure 4) occupying a volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, having a surface area &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, with defined traction or surface forces &lt;math&gt;T_i^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; per unit area acting on every point of the body surface, and body forces &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; per unit of volume on every point within the volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, if the body is in [[Momentum#Relating to force – general equations of motion|equilibrium]] the resultant force acting on the volume is zero, thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S T_i^{(n)}dS + \int_V F_i dV = 0&lt;/math&gt;
By definition the stress vector is &lt;math&gt;T_i^{(n)} =\sigma_{ji}n_j&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \sigma_{ji}n_j\, dS + \int_V F_i\, dV = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Using the [[Divergence theorem|Gauss's divergence theorem]] to convert a surface integral to a volume integral gives
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \sigma_{ji,j}\, dV + \int_V F_i\, dV = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V (\sigma_{ji,j} + F_i\,) dV = 0&lt;/math&gt;
For an arbitrary volume the integral vanishes, and we have the ''equilibrium equations''
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ji,j} + F_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Cauchy's second law of motion===
According to the principle of [[conservation of angular momentum]], equilibrium requires that the summation of [[Torque|moments]] with respect to an arbitrary point is zero, which leads to the conclusion that the stress tensor is [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]], thus having only six independent stress components, instead of the original nine:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of symmetry of the stress tensor
|-
| Summing moments about point ''O'' (Figure 4) the resultant moment is zero as the body is in equilibrium. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
M_O &amp;=\int_S (\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{T})dS + \int_V (\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F})dV=0 \\
0 &amp;= \int_S\varepsilon_{ijk}x_jT_k^{(n)}dS + \int_V\varepsilon_{ijk}x_jF_k dV \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector and is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=x_j\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that &lt;math&gt;T_k^{(n)} =\sigma_{mk}n_m&lt;/math&gt; and using Gauss's divergence theorem to change from a surface integral to a volume integral, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0 &amp;= \int_S \varepsilon_{ijk}x_j\sigma_{mk}n_m\, dS + \int_V\varepsilon_{ijk}x_jF_k\, dV \\
&amp;= \int_V (\varepsilon_{ijk}x_j\sigma_{mk})_{,m} dV + \int_V\varepsilon_{ijk}x_jF_k\, dV \\
&amp;= \int_V (\varepsilon_{ijk}x_{j,m}\sigma_{mk}+\varepsilon_{ijk}x_j\sigma_{mk,m}) dV + \int_V\varepsilon_{ijk}x_jF_k\, dV \\
&amp;= \int_V (\varepsilon_{ijk}x_{j,m}\sigma_{mk}) dV+ \int_V \varepsilon_{ijk}x_j(\sigma_{mk,m}+F_k)dV \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The second integral is zero as it contains the equilibrium equations. This leaves the first integral, where &lt;math&gt;x_{j,m}=\delta_{jm}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V (\varepsilon_{ijk}\sigma_{jk}) dV=0&lt;/math&gt;

For an arbitrary volume V, we then have

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk}\sigma_{jk}=0&lt;/math&gt;

which is satisfied at every point within the body. Expanding this equation we have

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{12}=\sigma_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{23}=\sigma_{32}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{13}=\sigma_{31}&lt;/math&gt;

or in general

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

This proves that the stress tensor is symmetric
|}

However, in the presence of couple-stresses, i.e. moments per unit volume, the stress tensor is non-symmetric. This also is the case when the [[Knudsen number]] is close to one, &lt;math&gt;K_{n}\rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;, or the continuum is a non-Newtonian fluid, which can lead to rotationally non-invariant fluids, such as [[polymers]].

==Principal stresses and stress invariants==
&lt;!-- [[Principal stress]] redirects here --&gt;
At every point in a stressed body there are at least three planes, called ''principal planes'', with normal vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;, called ''principal directions'', where the corresponding stress vector is perpendicular to the plane, i.e., parallel or in the same direction as the normal vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;, and where there are no normal shear stresses &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}&lt;/math&gt;. The three stresses normal to these principal planes are called ''principal stresses''.

The components &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; of the stress tensor depend on the orientation of the coordinate system at the point under consideration. However, the stress tensor itself is a physical quantity and as such, it is independent of the coordinate system chosen to represent it. There are certain [[Invariant (physics)|invariants]] associated with every tensor which are also independent of the coordinate system. For example, a vector is a simple tensor of rank one. In three dimensions, it has three components. The value of these components will depend on the coordinate system chosen to represent the vector, but the [[Euclidean norm|magnitude]] of the vector is a physical quantity (a scalar) and is independent of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] chosen to represent the vector. Similarly, every second rank tensor (such as the stress and the strain tensors) has three independent invariant quantities associated with it. One set of such invariants are the principal stresses of the stress tensor, which are just the eigenvalues of the stress tensor. Their direction vectors are the principal directions or [[eigenvectors]].

A stress vector parallel to the normal unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{(\mathbf{n})} = \lambda \mathbf{n}= \mathbf{\sigma}_\mathrm n \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of proportionality, and in this particular case corresponds to the magnitudes &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}&lt;/math&gt; of the normal stress vectors or principal stresses.

Knowing that &lt;math&gt;T_i^{(n)}=\sigma_{ij}n_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_i=\delta_{ij}n_j&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T_i^{(n)} &amp;= \lambda n_i \\
\sigma_{ij}n_j &amp;=\lambda n_i \\
\sigma_{ij}n_j -\lambda n_i &amp;=0 \\
\left(\sigma_{ij}- \lambda\delta_{ij} \right)n_j &amp;=0 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[System of linear equations#Homogeneous systems|homogeneous system]], i.e. equal to zero, of three linear equations where &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; are the unknowns. To obtain a nontrivial (non-zero) solution for &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt;, the determinant matrix of the coefficients must be equal to zero, i.e. the system is singular. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\sigma_{ij}- \lambda\delta_{ij} \right|=\begin{vmatrix}
\sigma_{11} - \lambda &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{13} \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} - \lambda &amp; \sigma_{23} \\
\sigma_{31}&amp; \sigma_{32} &amp; \sigma_{33} - \lambda \\
\end{vmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the determinant leads to the ''characteristic equation''

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\sigma_{ij}- \lambda\delta_{ij} \right| = -\lambda^3 + I_1\lambda^2 - I_2\lambda + I_3=0&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I_1 &amp;= \sigma_{11}+\sigma_{22}+\sigma_{33} \\
&amp;= \sigma_{kk} = \text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \\
I_2 &amp;= \begin{vmatrix}
\sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{23} \\
\sigma_{32} &amp; \sigma_{33} \\
\end{vmatrix}
+ \begin{vmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{13} \\
\sigma_{31} &amp; \sigma_{33} \\
\end{vmatrix}
+
\begin{vmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} \\
\end{vmatrix} \\
&amp;= \sigma_{11}\sigma_{22}+\sigma_{22}\sigma_{33}+\sigma_{11}\sigma_{33}-\sigma_{12}^2-\sigma_{23}^2-\sigma_{31}^2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_{ii}\sigma_{jj}-\sigma_{ij}\sigma_{ji}\right) 
= \frac{1}{2}\left[ \left( \text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \right)^{2} - \text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{2}) \right] \\
I_3 &amp;= \det(\sigma_{ij}) = \det(\boldsymbol{\sigma})\\
&amp;= \sigma_{11}\sigma_{22}\sigma_{33}+2\sigma_{12}\sigma_{23}\sigma_{31}-\sigma_{12}^2\sigma_{33}-\sigma_{23}^2\sigma_{11}-\sigma_{31}^2\sigma_{22} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The characteristic equation has three real roots &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. not imaginary due to the symmetry of the stress tensor. The  &lt;math&gt; \sigma_1 = \max \left( \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3 \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_3 = \min \left( \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3 \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2=I_1-\sigma_1-\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt;, are the principal stresses, functions of the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;. The eigenvalues are the roots of the [[characteristic polynomial]]. The principal stresses are unique for a given stress tensor. Therefore, from the characteristic equation, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_3&lt;/math&gt;, called the first, second, and third ''stress invariants'', respectively, always have the same value regardless of the coordinate system's orientation.

For each eigenvalue, there is a non-trivial solution for &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; in the equation &lt;math&gt;\left(\sigma_{ij}- \lambda\delta_{ij} \right)n_j =0&lt;/math&gt;. These solutions are the principal directions or [[eigenvector]]s defining the plane where the principal stresses act. The principal stresses and principal directions characterize the stress at a point and are independent of the orientation.

A coordinate system with axes oriented to the principal directions implies that the normal stresses are the principal stresses and the stress tensor is represented by a diagonal matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \sigma_3
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The principal stresses can be combined to form the stress invariants, &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I_3&lt;/math&gt;. The first and third invariant are the trace and determinant respectively, of the stress tensor. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I_1 &amp;= \sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2}+\sigma_{3} \\
I_2 &amp;= \sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}+\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3}+\sigma_{3}\sigma_{1} \\
I_3 &amp;= \sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Because of its simplicity, the principal coordinate system is often useful when considering the state of the elastic medium at a particular point. Principal stresses are often expressed in the following equation for evaluating stresses in the x and y directions or axial and bending stresses on a part.&lt;ref name=Hamrock/&gt;{{rp|p.58–59}} The principal normal stresses can then be used to calculate the [[von Mises stress]] and ultimately the safety factor and margin of safety.

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2}= \frac{\sigma_{x} + \sigma_{y}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left (\frac{\sigma_{x} - \sigma_{y}}{2}\right)^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Using just the part of the equation under the [[square root]] is equal to the maximum and minimum shear stress for plus and minus. This is shown as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{max},\tau_{min}= \pm \sqrt{\left (\frac{\sigma_{x} - \sigma_{y}}{2}\right)^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Maximum and minimum shear stresses==
The maximum shear stress or maximum principal shear stress is equal to one-half the difference between the largest and smallest principal stresses, and acts on the plane that bisects the angle between the directions of the largest and smallest principal stresses, i.e. the plane of the maximum shear stress is oriented &lt;math&gt;45^\circ&lt;/math&gt; from the principal stress planes. The maximum shear stress is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\max=\frac{1}{2}\left|\sigma_\max-\sigma_\min\right|&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1\ge\sigma_2\ge\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\max=\frac{1}{2}\left|\sigma_1-\sigma_3\right|&lt;/math&gt;

When the stress tensor is non zero the normal stress component acting on the plane for the maximum shear stress is non-zero and it is equal to

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_1+\sigma_3\right)&lt;/math&gt;

\sigma_\mathrm{n} &amp;= \sigma_{ij}n_in_j \\
&amp;=\sigma_1n_1^2 + \sigma_2n_2^2 + \sigma_3n_3^2\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that &lt;math&gt;\left( T^{(n)} \right)^2=\sigma_{ij}\sigma_{ik}n_jn_k&lt;/math&gt;, the shear stress in terms of principal stresses components is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau_\mathrm{n}^2 &amp;= \left( T^{(n)} \right)^2-\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2 \\
&amp;=\sigma_1^2n_1^2+\sigma_2^2n_2^2+\sigma_3^2n_3^2-\left(\sigma_1n_1^2+\sigma_2n_2^2+\sigma_3n_3^2\right)^2 \\
&amp;=(\sigma_1^2-\sigma_2^2)n_1^2+(\sigma_2^2-\sigma_3^2)n_2^2+\sigma_3^2-\left[\left(\sigma_1-\sigma_3\right)n_1^2+\left(\sigma_2-\sigma_2\right)n_2^2+\sigma_3\right]^2 \\
&amp;= (\sigma_1-\sigma_2)^2n_1^2n_2^2+(\sigma_2-\sigma_3)^2n_2^2n_3^2+(\sigma_1-\sigma_3)^2n_1^2n_3^2 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The maximum shear stress at a point in a continuum body is determined by maximizing &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}^2&lt;/math&gt; subject to the condition that

:&lt;math&gt; n_in_i=n_1^2+n_2^2+n_3^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

This is a constrained maximization problem, which can be solved using the [[Lagrangian multiplier]] technique to convert the problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. Thus, the stationary values (maximum and minimum values)of &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}^2&lt;/math&gt; occur where the gradient of &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}^2&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to the gradient of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

The Lagrangian function for this problem can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F\left(n_1,n_2,n_3,\lambda\right) &amp;= \tau^2 + \lambda \left(g\left(n_1,n_2,n_3\right) - 1 \right) \\
&amp;= \sigma_1^2n_1^2+\sigma_2^2n_2^2+\sigma_3^2n_3^2-\left(\sigma_1n_1^2+\sigma_2n_2^2+\sigma_3n_3^2\right)^2+\lambda\left(n_1^2+n_2^2+n_3^2-1\right)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the Lagrangian multiplier (which is different from the &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; use to denote eigenvalues).

The extreme values of these functions are

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial F}{\partial n_1}=0 \qquad \frac{\partial F}{\partial n_2}=0 \qquad \frac{\partial F}{\partial n_3}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

thence

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial F}{\partial n_1} = n_1\sigma_1^2-2n_1\sigma_1\left(\sigma_1 n_1^2+\sigma_2 n_2^2+\sigma_3 n_3^2\right)+\lambda n_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial F}{\partial n_2} = n_2\sigma_2^2-2n_2\sigma_2\left(\sigma_1 n_1^2+\sigma_2 n_2^2+\sigma_3 n_3^2\right)+\lambda n_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial F}{\partial n_3} = n_3\sigma_3^2-2n_3\sigma_3\left(\sigma_1 n_1^2+\sigma_2 n_2^2+\sigma_3 n_3^2\right)+\lambda n_3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

These three equations together with the condition &lt;math&gt;n_in_i=1&lt;/math&gt; may be solved for &lt;math&gt;\lambda, n_1, n_2,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt;

By multiplying the first three equations by &lt;math&gt;n_1,\,n_2,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, and knowing that &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \sigma_{ij}n_in_j=\sigma_1n_1^2 + \sigma_2n_2^2 +\sigma_3n_3^2&lt;/math&gt; we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;n_1^2\sigma_1^2-2\sigma_1n_1^2\sigma_\mathrm{n}+n_1^2\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_2^2\sigma_2^2-2\sigma_2n_2^2\sigma_\mathrm{n}+n_2^2\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_3^2\sigma_3^2-2\sigma_1n_3^2\sigma_\mathrm{n}+n_3^2\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;

Adding these three equations we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[n_1^2\sigma_1^2+n_2^2\sigma_2^2+n_3^2\sigma_3^2\right]-2\left(\sigma_1n_1^2+\sigma_2n_2^2+\sigma_3n_3^2\right)\sigma_\mathrm{n}+\lambda\left(n_1^2+n_2^2+n_3^2\right)&amp;=0 \\
\left[\tau_\mathrm{n}^2+\left(\sigma_1n_1^2+\sigma_2n_2^2+\sigma_3n_3^2\right)^2\right]-2\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2+\lambda&amp;=0 \\
\left[\tau_\mathrm{n}^2+\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2\right]-2\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2+\lambda &amp;=0 \\
\lambda &amp;= \sigma_\mathrm{n}^2-\tau_\mathrm{n}^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

this result can be substituted into each of the first three equations to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial n_1} = n_1\sigma_1^2-2n_1\sigma_1\left(\sigma_1 n_1^2+\sigma_2 n_2^2+\sigma_3 n_3^2\right)+\left(\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2-\tau_\mathrm{n}^2\right) n_1 &amp;= 0 \\
n_1\sigma_1^2-2n_1\sigma_1\sigma_\mathrm{n}+\left(\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2-\tau_\mathrm{n}^2\right) n_1 &amp;= 0 \\
 \left(\sigma_1^2-2\sigma_1\sigma_\mathrm{n}+\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2-\tau_\mathrm{n}^2\right) n_1 &amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Doing the same for the other two equations we have
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial F}{\partial n_2}=\left(\sigma_2^2-2\sigma_2\sigma_\mathrm{n}+\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2-\tau_\mathrm{n}^2\right) n_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial F}{\partial n_3}= \left(\sigma_3^2-2\sigma_3\sigma_\mathrm{n}+\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2-\tau_\mathrm{n}^2\right) n_3= 0&lt;/math&gt;

A first approach to solve these last three equations is to consider the trivial solution &lt;math&gt;n_i=0&lt;/math&gt;. However, this option does not fulfill the constraint &lt;math&gt;n_in_i=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Considering the solution where &lt;math&gt;n_1=n_2=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_3 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, it is determine from the condition &lt;math&gt;n_in_i=1&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;n_3=\pm1&lt;/math&gt;, then from the original equation for &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}^2&lt;/math&gt; it is seen that &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;.
The other two possible values for &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained similarly by assuming

:&lt;math&gt;n_1=n_3=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_2=n_3=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_1 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, one set of solutions for these four equations is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
n_1&amp;=0,\,\,n_2&amp;=0,\,\,n_3&amp;=\pm1,\,\,\tau_\mathrm{n}&amp;=0 \\
n_1&amp;=0,\,\,n_2&amp;=\pm1,\,\,n_3&amp;=0,\,\,\tau_\mathrm{n}&amp;=0 \\
n_1&amp;=\pm1,\,\,n_2&amp;=0,\,\,n_3&amp;=0,\,\,\tau_\mathrm{n}&amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These correspond to minimum values for &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}&lt;/math&gt; and verifies that there are no shear stresses on planes normal to the principal directions of stress, as shown previously.

A second set of solutions is obtained by assuming &lt;math&gt;n_1=0,\, n_2\neq0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_3 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial F}{\partial n_2}= \sigma_2^2-2\sigma_2\sigma_\mathrm{n}+\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2-\tau_\mathrm{n}^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial F}{\partial n_3}=\sigma_3^2-2\sigma_3\sigma_\mathrm{n}+\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2-\tau_\mathrm{n}^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

To find the values for &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt; we first add these two equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sigma_2^2-\sigma_3^2-2\sigma_2\sigma_n+2\sigma_3\sigma_n&amp;=0 \\
\sigma_2^2-\sigma_3^2-2\sigma_n\left(\sigma_2-\sigma_3\right)&amp;=0 \\
\sigma_2+\sigma_3&amp;=2\sigma_n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that for &lt;math&gt;n_1=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \sigma_1n_1^2+\sigma_2n_2^2 + \sigma_3n_3^2=\sigma_2n_2^2 + \sigma_3n_3^2&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;n_1^2+n_2^2+n_3^2=n_2^2+n_3^2=1 &lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sigma_2+\sigma_3&amp;=2\sigma_n \\
\sigma_2+\sigma_3&amp;=2\left(\sigma_2n_2^2 + \sigma_3n_3^2\right) \\
\sigma_2+\sigma_3&amp;=2\left(\sigma_2n_2^2 + \sigma_3\left(1-n_2^2\right)\right)&amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and solving for &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;n_2=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}&lt;/math&gt;

Then solving for &lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;n_3=\sqrt{1-n_2^2}=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau_\mathrm{n}^2&amp;=(\sigma_2-\sigma_3)^2n_2^2n_3^2 \\
\tau_\mathrm{n}&amp;=\frac{\sigma_2-\sigma_3}{2}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The other two possible values for &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained similarly by assuming

:&lt;math&gt;n_2=0,\, n_1\neq0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_3 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_3=0,\, n_1\neq0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the second set of solutions for &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial F}{\partial n_1}=0&lt;/math&gt;, representing a maximum for &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;n_1=0,\,\,n_2=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},\,\,n_3=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},\,\,\tau_\mathrm{n}=\pm\frac{\sigma_2-\sigma_3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;n_1=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},\,\,n_2=0,\,\,n_3=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},\,\,\tau_\mathrm{n}=\pm\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;n_1=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},\,\,n_2=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},\,\,n_3=0,\,\,\tau_\mathrm{n}=\pm\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, assuming &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1\ge\sigma_2\ge\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum shear stress is expressed by

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{max}=\frac{1}{2}\left|\sigma_1-\sigma_3\right|=\frac{1}{2}\left|\sigma_\mathrm{max}-\sigma_\mathrm{min}\right|&lt;/math&gt;

and it can be stated as being equal to one-half the difference between the largest and smallest principal stresses, acting on the plane that bisects the angle between the directions of the largest and smallest principal stresses.

==Stress deviator tensor==
The stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as the sum of two other stress tensors:
# a ''mean [[hydrostatic stress]] tensor'' or ''volumetric stress tensor'' or ''mean normal stress tensor'', &lt;math&gt;\pi\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, which tends to change the volume of the stressed body; and
# a deviatoric component called the ''stress deviator tensor'', &lt;math&gt;s_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, which tends to distort it.
So:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}= s_{ij} + \pi\delta_{ij},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the mean stress given by

:&lt;math&gt;\pi=\frac{\sigma_{kk}}{3}=\frac{\sigma_{11}+\sigma_{22}+\sigma_{33}}{3}=\tfrac{1}{3}I_1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Pressure]] (&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) is generally defined as negative one-third the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the stress tensor minus any stress the divergence of the velocity contributes with, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;p = \lambda\, \nabla\cdot\vec{u} -\pi = \lambda\,\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_k} -\pi = \sum_k\lambda\,\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_k} -\pi,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a proportionality constant, &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divergence operator]], &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k'':th [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]], &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity]] and &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k'':th Cartesian component of &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}&lt;/math&gt;.

The deviatoric stress tensor can be obtained by subtracting the hydrostatic stress tensor from the Cauchy stress tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ s_{ij} &amp;= \sigma_{ij} - \frac{\sigma_{kk}}{3}\delta_{ij},\,\\
\left[{\begin{matrix}
s_{11} &amp; s_{12} &amp; s_{13} \\
s_{21} &amp; s_{22} &amp; s_{23} \\
s_{31} &amp; s_{32} &amp; s_{33}
\end{matrix}}\right]
&amp;=\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{13} \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{23} \\
\sigma_{31} &amp; \sigma_{32} &amp; \sigma_{33} 
\end{matrix}}\right]-\left[{\begin{matrix}
\pi &amp; 0   &amp; 0   \\
0   &amp; \pi &amp; 0   \\
0   &amp; 0   &amp; \pi
\end{matrix}}\right] \\
&amp;=\left[{\begin{matrix}
\sigma_{11}-\pi &amp; \sigma_{12}     &amp; \sigma_{13} \\
\sigma_{21}     &amp; \sigma_{22}-\pi &amp; \sigma_{23} \\
\sigma_{31}     &amp; \sigma_{32}     &amp; \sigma_{33}-\pi
\end{matrix}}\right].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Invariants of the stress deviator tensor===
As it is a second order tensor, the stress deviator tensor also has a set of [[Invariants of tensors|invariants]], which can be obtained using the same procedure used to calculate the invariants of the stress tensor. It can be shown that the principal directions of the stress deviator tensor &lt;math&gt;s_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are the same as the principal directions of the stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the characteristic equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\left| s_{ij}- \lambda\delta_{ij} \right| = -\lambda^3+J_1\lambda^2-J_2\lambda+J_3=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_3&lt;/math&gt; are the first, second, and third ''deviatoric stress invariants'', respectively. Their values are the same (invariant) regardless of the orientation of the coordinate system chosen. These deviatoric stress invariants can be expressed as a function of the components of &lt;math&gt;s_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; or its principal values &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s_3&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively, as a function of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; or its principal values &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
J_1 &amp;= s_{kk}=0,\, \\
J_2 &amp;= \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}s_{ij}s_{ji} = \tfrac{1}{2}\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{s}^2)\\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}(s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2) \\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{6}\left[(\sigma_{11} - \sigma_{22})^2 + (\sigma_{22} - \sigma_{33})^2 + (\sigma_{33} - \sigma_{11})^2 \right ] + \sigma_{12}^2 + \sigma_{23}^2 + \sigma_{31}^2 \\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{6}\left[(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2)^2 + (\sigma_2 - \sigma_3)^2 + (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2 \right ] \\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{3}I_1^2-I_2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2) - \frac{1}{3}\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})^2\right],\,\\
J_3 &amp;= \det(s_{ij}) \\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{3}s_{ij}s_{jk}s_{ki} = \tfrac{1}{3} \text{tr}(\boldsymbol{s}^3)\\
&amp;= \tfrac{1}{3}(s_1^3 + s_2^3 + s_3^3) \\
&amp;= s_1s_2s_3 \\
&amp;= \tfrac{2}{27}I_1^3 - \tfrac{1}{3}I_1 I_2 + I_3 = \tfrac{1}{3}\left[\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^3) - \text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^2)\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) +\tfrac{2}{9}\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})^3\right].\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;s_{kk}=0&lt;/math&gt;, the stress deviator tensor is in a state of pure shear.

A quantity called the equivalent stress or [[von Mises stress]] is commonly used in solid mechanics. The equivalent stress is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm e = \sqrt{3~J_2} = \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}~\left[(\sigma_1-\sigma_2)^2 + (\sigma_2-\sigma_3)^2 + (\sigma_3-\sigma_1)^2 \right]}
\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Octahedral stresses==
[[File:Octahedral stress planes.svg|300px|right|thumb|Figure 6. Octahedral stress planes]]
Considering the principal directions as the coordinate axes, a plane whose normal vector makes equal angles with each of the principal axes (i.e. having direction cosines equal to &lt;math&gt;|1/\sqrt{3}|&lt;/math&gt;) is called an ''octahedral plane''. There are a total of eight octahedral planes (Figure 6). The normal and shear components of the stress tensor on these planes are called ''octahedral normal stress'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{oct}&lt;/math&gt; and ''octahedral shear stress'' &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{oct}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Octahedral plane passing through the origin is known as the ''π-plane'' (''π'' not to be confused with ''mean stress'' denoted by ''π'' in above section) ''.'' On the ''π-plane'', &lt;math&gt;s_{ij} = I/3&lt;/math&gt;.

Knowing that the stress tensor of point O (Figure 6) in the principal axes is

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \sigma_3
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

the stress vector on an octahedral plane is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{T}_\mathrm{oct}^{(\mathbf{n})}&amp;= \sigma_{ij}n_i\mathbf{e}_j \\
&amp;=\sigma_1n_1\mathbf{e}_1+\sigma_2n_2\mathbf{e}_2+\sigma_3n_3\mathbf{e}_3\\
&amp;=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(\sigma_1\mathbf{e}_1+\sigma_2\mathbf{e}_2+\sigma_3\mathbf{e}_3)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The normal component of the stress vector at point O associated with the octahedral plane is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sigma_\mathrm{oct} &amp;= T^{(n)}_in_i \\
&amp;=\sigma_{ij}n_in_j \\
&amp;=\sigma_1n_1n_1+\sigma_2n_2n_2+\sigma_3n_3n_3 \\
&amp;=\tfrac{1}{3}(\sigma_1+\sigma_2+\sigma_3)=\tfrac{1}{3}I_1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the mean normal stress or hydrostatic stress. This value is the same in all eight octahedral planes.
The shear stress on the octahedral plane is then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tau_\mathrm{oct} &amp;=\sqrt{T_i^{(n)}T_i^{(n)}-\sigma_\mathrm{n}^2} \\
&amp;=\left[\tfrac{1}{3}(\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2+\sigma_3^2)-\tfrac{1}{9}(\sigma_1+\sigma_2+\sigma_3)^2\right]^{1/2} \\
&amp;=\tfrac{1}{3}\left[(\sigma_1-\sigma_2)^2+(\sigma_2-\sigma_3)^2+(\sigma_3-\sigma_1)^2\right]^{1/2} = \tfrac{1}{3}\sqrt{2I_1^2-6I_2} = \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3}J_2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{Certainty}}
'''Certainty''' is perfect [[knowledge]] that has total security from error, or the mental state of being without [[doubt]].

Objectively defined, certainty is total continuity and validity of all [[foundationalism|foundational]] inquiry, to the highest degree of precision. Something is certain only if no [[skepticism]] can occur. [[Philosophy]] (at least, historical [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] philosophy) seeks this state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==History==

===Pyrrho – ancient Greece===
{{Main|Pyrrho|l1=Pyrrho}}

Pyrrho is credited as being the first Skeptic philosopher.
The main principle of Pyrrho's thought is expressed by the word [[acatalepsia]], which denotes the ability to withhold assent from doctrines regarding the truth of things in their own nature; against every statement its contradiction may be advanced with equal justification. Secondly, it is necessary in view of this fact to preserve an attitude of intellectual suspense, or, as Timon expressed it, no assertion can be known to be better than another.

===Ibn-Rushd – Averroes===
{{Main|Ibn Rushd}}
Averroes was a purveyor of certain parts of Aristotelian philosophy. His philosophy was considered controversial in Muslim circles.&lt;ref name="philosophybasics. com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_averroes.html |title=Averroës (Ibn Rushd) &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy |publisher=Philosophybasics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in West with thinkers like St. Thomas Aquinas who said of Averroes, "the Arabian commentator as one who had, indeed, perverted the Peripatetic tradition, but whose words, nevertheless, should be treated with respect and consideration." Averroes' contribution to epistemology is only noted for the fact that he was one of the first to write on the topic and acted as a comparison for the traditional and definitive works of the Western tradition.{{cite web |url=https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/averroes |title=Averroes |last=Turner |first=William |website=Catholic Answers |publisher=Catholic Answers |access-date= February 28, 2018}}

===Descartes – 17th century===
[[Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' is a book in which Descartes first discards all belief in things which are not absolutely certain, and then tries to establish what can be known for sure. Although the phrase "[[Cogito, ergo sum]]" is often attributed to Descartes' ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', it is actually put forward in his ''Discourse on Method''. Due to the implications of inferring the conclusion within the predicate, however, he changed the argument to "I think, I exist"; this then became his first certainty.

===Ludwig Wittgenstein – 20th century===
''[[On Certainty]]'' is a series of notes made by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] just prior to his death. The main theme of the work is that [[Context (language use)|context]] plays a role in epistemology. Wittgenstein asserts an [[anti-foundationalism|anti-foundationalist]] message throughout the work: that every claim can be doubted but certainty is possible in a framework. "The function [propositions] serve in language is to serve as a kind of framework within which empirical propositions can make sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/wittgenstein/section4.rhtml |title=On Certainty |authorlink=Ludwig Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |publisher=[[SparkNotes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degrees of certainty==
{{see also|Inductive reasoning|Probability interpretations|Philosophy of statistics}}

Physicist [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] suggests that the need for identifying degrees of certainty is under-appreciated in various domains, including policy making and the understanding of science. This is because different goals require different degrees of certainty—and politicians are not always aware of (or do not make it clear) how much certainty we are working with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=edge.com |title= question center, SHAs – cognitive tools |url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Carnap]] viewed certainty as a matter of degree ("degrees of certainty") which could be [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] measured, with degree one being certainty. [[Bayesian analysis]] derives degrees of certainty which are interpreted as a measure of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[psychological]] [[belief]].

Alternatively, one might use the [[Legal burden of proof|legal degrees of certainty]]. These standards of evidence ascend as follows: no credible evidence, some credible evidence, a preponderance of evidence, clear and convincing evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, and beyond any shadow of a doubt (i.e. ''undoubtable''—recognized as an impossible standard to meet—which serves only to terminate the list).

==Foundational crisis of mathematics==
{{Main|Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis}}
The ''foundational crisis of mathematics'' was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics.

After several schools of the [[philosophy of mathematics]] ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be stated within [[mathematics]] itself began to be heavily challenged.

One attempt after another to provide unassailable foundations for mathematics was found to suffer from various [[paradox]]es (such as [[Russell's paradox]]) and to be [[consistency proof|inconsistent]].

Various schools of thought were opposing each other. The leading school was that of the [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] approach, of which [[David Hilbert]] was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as [[Hilbert's program]], which sought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a [[formal system]] proved sound by [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] [[finitism|finitistic]] means. The main opponent was the [[intuitionist]] school, led by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'', the leading mathematical journal of the time.

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], proved in 1931, showed that essential aspects of Hilbert's program could not be attained. In [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s first result he showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent finitely axiomatizable system—such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of [[arithmetic]]—a statement that can be shown to be true, but that does not follow from the rules of the system. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in Hilbert's program. In a next result Gödel showed that such a system was not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. This dealt a final blow to the heart of Hilbert's program, the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the "finitistic" ones, but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to, it was a ''weaker'' system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove). Meanwhile, the intuitionistic school had failed to attract adherents among working mathematicians, and floundered due to the difficulties of doing mathematics under the constraint of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]].

In a sense, the crisis has not been resolved, but faded away: most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the various logical paradoxes never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do (such as [[mathematical logic|logic]] and [[category theory]]), they may be avoided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27269">[[File:SDMB Pitchfork Drill Formation.jpg|thumb|Collective intentionality demonstrated in a human formation.]]
In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''collective intentionality''' characterizes the [[intentionality]] that occurs when two or more individuals undertake a task together. Examples include two individuals carrying a heavy table up a flight of stairs or dancing a tango.

This phenomenon is approached from [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[normative]] perspectives, among others. Prominent philosophers working in the psychological manner are [[Raimo Tuomela]], Kaarlo Miller, [[John Searle|John R. Searle]], and [[Michael Bratman|Michael E. Bratman]]. [[Margaret Gilbert]] takes a normative approach dealing specifically with group formation. [[J. David Velleman|David Velleman]] is also concerned with how groups are formed, but his account lacks the normative element present in Gilbert.

The notion that collectives are capable of forming [[intention]]s can be found, whether implicitly or explicitly, in literature going back thousands of years. For example, ancient texts such as [[Plato]]'s [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]&lt;ref name="The Republic"&gt;Allen, R.E. 2006. Plato, ''The Republic''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the cooperative determination of laws and social order by the group composed of society as a whole. This theme was later expanded into [[social contract]] theory by Enlightenment-era philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]]&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;Shapiro, Ian. 2010. ''Leviathan: Or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Locke]].&lt;ref name= "Two Treatises of Government"&gt;Laslett, Peter. 1988. ''Two Treatises of Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the likes of [[Wilfrid Sellars]]&lt;ref name="Ought"&gt;Sellars, Wilfrid. 1963. "Imperatives, Intentions, and the Logic of 'Ought," ''Morality and the Language of Conduct.'' Detroit: Wayne State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anthony Quinton]]&lt;ref name="Social Objects"&gt;Quinton, Anthony. 1975. "Social Objects." ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', Vol. 75, 67–87.&lt;/ref&gt; noted the existence of "We-Intentions" amid broader discussion of the concept of [[intentionality]], and thus laid the groundwork for the focused philosophical analysis of collective intentionality that began in the late 1980s.

==Raimo Tuomela and Kaarlo Miller==

Contemporary philosophical discussion of collective intentionality was initiated by [[Raimo Tuomela]] and Kaarlo Miller's "We-Intentions".&lt;ref name="Tuomela"&gt;Tuomela, Raimo and K. Miller. 1988. "We-Intentions," ''Philosophical Studies,'' Vol. 53, 367-389.&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, Tuomela and Miller assert three conditions necessary for a collective [[intention]], highlighting the importance of beliefs among the agents of the group. After citing examples that are commonly accepted as requiring more than one member to participate (carrying a table upstairs, playing tennis, toasting to a friend, conversing, etc.), they state their criteria:

:A member (A) of a [[collective]] (G) we-intends to do a group action (X) if and only if:

::1) (A) intends to do his or her part of X
::2) (A) believes that accomplishing X is possible, and that all members of G intend to do their part towards accomplishing X
::3) (A) believes that all the members of G also believe that accomplishing X is possible.&lt;ref name="Tuomela" /&gt;

To illustrate this idea, imagine Anne and Bob intend to carry a table (that is far too heavy for one person to carry) upstairs. In order for this action to qualify as a we-intention, Anne first needs to intend to do her part in carrying the table. Next, Anne needs to believe that carrying the table upstairs is possible, and that Bob intends to do his part in carrying. Finally, Anne needs to believe that Bob also believes that carrying the table upstairs is possible. If all of these conditions are met, then Anne and Bob have collective intentions under Tuomela and Miller's criteria.

==John Searle==
[[John Searle|John Searle's]] 1990 paper, "Collective Intentions and Actions" offers another interpretation of collective action. In contrast to Tuomela and Miller, Searle claims that collective intentionality is a "primitive phenomenon, which cannot be analyzed as the summation of individual intentional behavior".&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;Searle, John. 1990. "Collective Intentions and Actions," ''Intentions in Communication.'' Cambridge: MIT Press, 401-415.&lt;/ref&gt; He exemplifies the fundamental distinction between "I-intentions" and "We-intentions" by comparing the hypothetical case of a set of picnickers and a dance troupe. During a rainstorm, each picnicker ''spontaneously'' runs for cover. On the other hand, the members of the dance troupe run for cover ''as part of a preconceived routine''. Searle claims that the picnickers, whose intentions are individually oriented and simply happen to coincide, do not display collective intentionality, while members of the dance troupe do, because they deliberately cooperate with one another.

Searle's rebuttal to Tuomela and Miller's account begins with a counterexample involving a group of business school graduates who intend to pursue their own selfish interests, but believe that by doing so, they will indirectly serve humanity. These young businessmen believe that their fellow graduates will do likewise, but do not actively ''cooperate'' with one another in pursuing their goals. Searle holds that this example fulfills all of Tuomela and Miller's criteria for collective intentionality. However, he claims that collective intentionality does not actually exist in such a situation unless the graduates have organized and formed an explicit ''pact'' with one another to serve humanity through self-interested action.

:He proceeds to specify two criteria that must be satisfied by any proper account of collective intentionality:

::(1) It "must be consistent with the fact that society consists of nothing but individuals."
::(2) It must take into account that any individual's intentions are independent of "the fact of whether or not he is getting things right."&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;

Although a "we-intention" is always held by an individual, it must make fundamental reference to a collective formed in conjunction with the other individual(s). For instance, two individuals who, while sharing the labor of hollandaise-sauce production, each believe the proposition "''We'' are making hollandaise sauce", have formed a collective intention. This would not exist if they only held beliefs to the effect of "''I'' am stirring", or "''I'' am pouring". It is thus, Searle claims, that collective intentionality is not reducible to individual intentionality.

==Michael Bratman==

[[Michael Bratman|Michael Bratman's]] 1992 paper "Shared Cooperative Activity",&lt;ref&gt;Bratman, Michael. 1992. "Shared Cooperative Activity," ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 101, No. 2, 327-341.&lt;/ref&gt; contends that shared cooperative activity (SCA) can be reduced to "I-intentions". In other words, just as an individual can plan to act by him or herself, that same individual can also plan for a group to act. With this in mind, he presents three characteristics of shared cooperative activity:

::(1) Each participant must be mutually responsive to the intentions and actions of the others,
::(2) The participants must each be committed to the joint activity,
::(3) The participants must each be committed to supporting the efforts of the others.&lt;ref&gt;Bratman, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of Bratman's argument that supports these criteria is the idea of meshing subplans. Bratman claims that in a shared cooperative activity, individuals' secondary plans do not need to be the same, but they cannot conflict. For example, consider his example of two people who intend to paint a house together.&lt;ref&gt;Bratman, 330&lt;/ref&gt; Let us call these two people Alice and Bill. Suppose Alice wants to paint the house red and Bill wants to paint the house blue. Both are aware that their subplans conflict, and that the other is aware of it as well. Bratman argues that even if Alice and Bill do end up painting the house together, they do not have a shared cooperative activity, because their subplans are in conflict. Furthermore, each participant must also be committed to having subplans that mesh. Without this commitment, participants might disregard others' subplans, leading to a lack of cooperation. However, he additionally claims that their subplans need not be identical. For instance, suppose Alice wants to use an inexpensive paint and Bill wants paint from a specific hardware store. In this case, there is a way that both subplans can achieved: they could buy an inexpensive paint from Bill's store of choice. The details of Bratman's view are as follows:

:For a cooperatively neutral action, our doing an action J is an SCA if and only if:

::1) We do J (in a way that could involve cooperation, but does not have to)
::2) It is common knowledge between us that we are both committed to meshing subplans and
::3) (B) leads to (A) by way of mutual responsiveness (in the pursuit of completing our action) of intention and in action.&lt;ref&gt;Bratman, 334-339&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to Bratman===

One work associated with Bratman is Facundo Alonso's "Shared Intention, Reliance, and Interpersonal Obligations".&lt;ref name="AlonsoShared"&gt;Alonso, Facundo M. 2009. "Shared Intention, Reliance, and Interpersonal Obligation," ''Ethics'', Vol. 119, No. 3, 444-475.&lt;/ref&gt; Alonso contends that shared intention is a basis for interpersonal obligation. He begins the paper by asserting characteristics of joint action, which do not include multiple agents acting individually or factors of body movements, but instead are shared or collective intentions to act. Alonso distinguishes the normative theory supplied by Gilbert and the descriptive theory supplied by Bratman. Whereas Bratman focuses on intents, Alonso is also careful to point out Tuomela and Miller's focus on action to describe the roots of joint action. Alonso attempts to compromise both views by taking a path where joint action is not necessarily a normative or descriptive case. He argues for a system built off Bratman's that can take place in a descriptive nature addressed by Margaret Gilbert.

Stephen Butterfill offers another response to Bratman's view. He argues that Bratman's account is unable to explain simple interactions between agents.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfill, Stephen. 2012. "Joint Action and Development," ''The Philosophical Quarterly,'' Vol. 62, No. 246, 23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Butterfill states that Bratman cannot explain cooperative actions between very young children, who do not yet have an understanding of other minds.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfill, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Margaret Gilbert==

Whereas Bratman argues for a descriptive account of collective intentionality, other authors have taken a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] approach. [[Margaret Gilbert]] in "Walking Together: A Paradigmatic Social Phenomena",&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Margaret. 1990. "Walking Together: A Paradigmatic Social Phenomena," ''Midwest Studies in Philosophy'', Vol. 15, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; sets the conditions for people entering, enduring, and exiting acts of collective intentionality. Gilbert asserts that social groups in general can be defined by something as simple as two people walking together. In her analysis the basic conditions for collective intentions that must be satisfied are as follows:

::(1) People must know they are entering into an agreement by communicating it clearly (even if they are coerced). Gilbert states that this act of agreement is sufficient to set a goal for a group. Furthermore, the agreement groups the agents who comprise the group into a plural subject.
::(2) The agreement implies that each member is [[Obligation|obligated]] to completing the final goal.
::(3) Because of this implied obligation, any and all members may rebuke any one else who fails to do their part towards the completion of the goal. The "[[Rights|right]] to rebuke" is stated as a necessary feature of the group arrangement. This functions as a tool for each member of the group to ensure the goal is accomplished.
::(4) In order to break the agreement there has to be joint consent among all members of the group.

===Responses to Gilbert===

A number of philosophers have responded to the normative theory of Gilbert with papers that consider obligations, promises and commitments. One of these, Christopher McMahon, argues that Gilbert has observed crucial behavioral phenomena involved in acts of collective intentionality, but has misidentified the psychological dynamics underlying these phenomena. Specifically, he holds that the behaviors characterizing collective intentionality arise not from a set of mutual obligations which facilitate a "right to rebuke" but from the existence of de facto authority, or some kind of social decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Christopher. 2005. "Shared Agency and Rational Cooperation," ''Nous'', Vol. 39, No. 2, 284-308.&lt;/ref&gt; This de facto authority gives one party a right to partially determine another's intentions.

Facundo M. Alonso sets conditions for how the normative phenomenon of shared intention can arise. Alonso claims that shared intention involves mutual reliance between participants. He further argues for a cognitive requirement that each member publicly intends the joint activity. Thus, Alonso states, "[R]elations of mutual reliance generate...interpersonal obligations between the participants".&lt;ref name="AlonsoShared" /&gt; As a result, shared intentions generate normative promises that are enforced by mutual reliance and relevant obligation.

A. S. Roth offers his own modifications to Gilbert's account of intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Abraham Sesshu. 2004. "Shared Agency and Contralateral Commitments," ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol.113, No. 3, 359-410.&lt;/ref&gt; He, too, relies on a normative notion to explain collective intentions. Rather than obligations, however, Roth is interested in commitments. Roth enumerates four different types of commitment: participatory, contralateral, executive, and ipsilateral commitments. Roth claims that the contralateral commitments are necessary for joint actions to occur, and that they may have a moral component (though not necessarily). This opposes Gilbert's claim that the obligations found in joint activity have no moral component.

Christopher Kutz's work "Acting Together" contests the basis for what is considered a group.  When speaking of a group, it becomes common to say "they" did whatever action the group is seen as doing.  However, Kutz explains that each person may have varying levels of involvement in their group or their group efforts.  He also questions what obligations each member is considered to have to the group and what binds those individuals to their group.  To illustrate his objections, Kutz describes two group types: executive and participatory.  An "executive" commitment would extend to those members of a group who participate with others of a group only superficially but still carry the name of the group as a title. This includes people working in an office or an assembly line. A "participatory" group is involved directly with the process and end results of an action.  Each member is assumed to have at least some knowledge of all of the plans and sub-plans for the actions taken by the group.  This opens Kutz to a discussion about who, within the group, may be considered responsible for the actions of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Kutz, Christopher. 2000. "Acting Together" Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. 61, No. 1 (Jul., 2000), pp. 1-31 Published by: International Phenomenological Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==J. David Velleman==

[[J. David Velleman]] provides a reaction to [[Margaret Gilbert|Gilbert]] as well as [[John Searle|Searle]]. Velleman is concerned with explaining how a group is capable of making a decision, or, as he puts it, "how... several different minds (can) submit themselves to a single making up".&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, J. David. 1997. "How to Share an Intention," ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', Vol. 57, No. 1, 29-50, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, he picks up Gilbert's notion of the 'pool of wills', that is, "a single will forged from the wills of different individuals". However, according to Velleman, Gilbert does not explain how such a thing can be formed. To solve this problem, he turns to a portion of Searle's theory of intentions, namely that an "intention is a [[mental representation]] that causes behavior by representing itself as causing it".&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Velleman explains that, since a representation is capable of causing behavior, and [[speech acts]] are a form of representation, it is possible for a speech act to cause a behavior. That is, saying a thing can cause one to do that thing. Thus, a speech act can, in itself, be an intention. This is critical for him to make the case that an agent, having made a decision or an intending speech act, can "remain decided".&lt;ref&gt;Velleman, 42&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that agent can continue to intend after the speech act has been accomplished. With this, Velleman shows how an agent can make a decision for a group. If an agent utters a conditional intention, and another agent utters an intention that fulfills the conditions present in the previous utterance, then the second agent has effectively decided the question for the first agent. Thus, a single collective will has been formed from multiple individual wills.

Therefore, Velleman argues that collective intention is not the summation of multiple individual intentions, but rather one shared intention. This is accomplished by perceiving intentions as existing outside the mind of an individual and within a verbal statement. The verbal statements have causal power because of the desire to not speak falsely.

==Natalie Gold and Robert Sugden==

Collective intentionality has also been approached in light of economic theories, including [[game theory]]. According to Natalie Gold and [[Robert Sugden (economist)|Robert Sugden]], efforts to define collective intentions as individual intentions and related beliefs (such as those of [[Raimo Tuomela|Tuomela]] &amp; Miller and [[Michael Bratman]]) fail because they allow obviously non-cooperative actions to be counted as cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Natalie and R. Sugden. 2007. "Collective Intentions and Team Agency," ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 104, No. 3, 109-137.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in many simple games analyzed by game theory, the players are counted as acting jointly when they achieve the [[Nash equilibrium]], even though that equilibrium state is neither optimal nor achieved cooperatively. In the [[prisoner's dilemma]], the Nash equilibrium occurs when each player defects against the other, even though they would both do better if they cooperated.

The normal game for prisoners' dilemma is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Prisoner B stays silent (''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B betrays (''defects'')
|-
! Prisoner A stays silent (''cooperates'')
| Each serves 1 month|| Prisoner A: 12 months&lt;br/&gt;Prisoner B: goes free
|-
! Prisoner A betrays (''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br/&gt;Prisoner B: 12 months || Each serves 3 months
|}

Standard [[game theory]] bases [[rationality]] in [[Self-interest|individual self-interest]], and thus predicts that all [[rational agent]]s will choose ''defect''. However, as Gold and Sugden note, between 40 and 50 percent of participants in prisoner's dilemma trials instead choose ''cooperate''.&lt;ref name="GS118"&gt;Gold and Sugden, 118&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that by employing we-reasoning, a team of people can intend and act in rational ways to achieve the outcome they, as a group, desire. Members of a group reason with the goal of achieving not "what is best for me", but "what is best for us".&lt;ref name="GS118" /&gt; This distinction draws on Searle's claim that "the notion of a we-intention...implies the notion of ''cooperation''".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, 406&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, if each prisoner recognizes that he or she belongs to a team, he or she will conclude that cooperation is in the best interest of the group.

[[File:Term evolution used in 1889.jpeg|thumbnail|The term ''evolution'' in a book published in 1889]]

The English noun '''''evolution''''' (from [[Latin]]  {{lang|la|ēvolūtiō}} "unfolding, unrolling") refers to any kind of accumulation of change, or gradual directional change. It is the 3,117th most commonly used word in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/worddata/evolution|website=Word Data|accessdate=24 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021424/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/worddata/evolution|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term primarily refers to [[biology|biological]] [[evolution]], there are various types of [[Chemistry|chemical]] evolution and it is also found in economics, historical linguistics, and many other technical fields where [[system]]s develop or change gradually over time, e.g.  [[stellar evolution]], [[cultural evolution]],  the [[evolution of an idea]], [[evolution (philosophy)|metaphysical evolution]], [[spiritual evolution]], etc.

The English term prior to the late 19th century was confined to referring to goal-directed, pre-programmed processes such as [[embryological development]]. A pre-programmed task, as in a military [[:wikt:maneuver|maneuver]], using this definition, may be termed an "evolution."  

The term ''evolution'' (from its literal meaning of "unfolding" of something into its true or explicit form) carries a connotation of gradual improvement or directionality from a beginning to an end point. This contrasts with the more general [[:wikt:development|development]], which can indicate change in any direction, or [[revolution]], which implies recurring, periodic change. The term  [[biological devolution]] is coined as an antonym to ''evolution'', indicating such degeneration or decrease in quality or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=evolution&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length unit of the system is the [[furlong]], the mass unit is the mass of a [[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkin]] of water, and the time unit is the [[fortnight]].&lt;ref name="SKB"&gt;Stan Kelly-Bootle, "[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1229919 As Big as a Barn?]", ''ACM Queue'', March 2007, pp. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade"/&gt; Like the [[International System of Units|SI]] or [[MKS system of units|meter–kilogram–second]] systems, there are derived units for [[velocity]], [[volume]], [[mass]] and [[weight]], etc.

==Notable multiples and derived units==
===Microfortnight and other decimal prefixes ===
One '''microfortnight''' is equal to 1.2096 [[second]]s.&lt;ref name="Slade"&gt;Robert Slade, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mK2QhS11JtsC&amp;pg=PA122 Dictionary of information security]'', Syngress, 2006, {{ISBN|1-59749-115-2}}, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; This has become a joke in computer science because in the [[OpenVMS|VMS]] [[operating system]], the TIMEPROMPTWAIT variable, which holds the time the system will wait for an operator to set the correct date and time at boot if it realizes that the current value is bogus, is set in microfortnights.  This is because the computer uses [[busy waiting|a loop]] instead of the internal clock which has not been activated yet to run the timer.&lt;ref name=jargon&gt;{{cite web| url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/microfortnight.html| title=microfortnight| accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation notes that "[t]he time unit of micro-fortnights is approximated as seconds in the implementation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/doc/84final/6048/6048pro_096.html| title=HP OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference Manual |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824192345/http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/doc/84final/6048/6048pro_096.html |archive-date=2018-08-24 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jargon File]]'' reports that  the millifortnight (about 20 minutes) and nanofortnight have been occasionally used.&lt;ref name=jargon/&gt;

===Furlongs per fortnight===
One '''furlong per fortnight''' is a speed which would be barely noticeable to the naked eye. It [[Conversion of units#Speed|converts]] to: 
*1.663&lt;!--1.6630952--&gt;{{e|−4}} [[meter per second]], (i.e. 0.1663&amp;nbsp;mm/s)
*roughly one [[centimeter]] per [[minute]] (to within 1 part in 400),&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, if the inch were defined as 2.5454... cm, it would be 1 cm/min. {{cite web| url=http://www.uk-rec-sheds.org.uk/faq60.txt| format=TXT| title=FAQ for newsgroup UK.rec.sheds, version 2&amp;3/7th| year=2000| accessdate=2006-03-10| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306161426/http://www.uk-rec-sheds.org.uk/faq60.txt| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*5.987&lt;!--5.9871429--&gt;{{e|−4}}&amp;nbsp;km/h, 
*roughly three eighths of an inch per minute, and
*3.720&lt;!--3.7202381--&gt;{{e|−4}} mph.

===Speed of light===
The [[speed of light]] is 1.8026&lt;!--1.8026--&gt;{{e|12}} furlongs/fortnight (1.8026 megafurlongs/microfortnight). By [[mass–energy equivalence]], 1 firkin is equal to 3.24936676{{e|24}} &lt;math&gt;{}\rm firkin {\cdot} \frac{furlongs^2}{fortnight^2}&lt;/math&gt; (approx. {{val|3.478|e=15|ul=BTU}} or {{val|3.669|e=18|ul=joules}}).

===Others===
In the FFF system, [[heat transfer coefficient]]s are conventionally reported as [[BTU]] per foot-fathom&lt;ref&gt;The foot-fathom is a unit of area: 1 foot-fathom = 6 square feet.&lt;/ref&gt; per degree [[Fahrenheit]] per fortnight.

Like the more common furlongs per fortnight,&lt;ref name="obscure"/&gt; '''firkins per fortnight''' have been used with the meaning "any obscure unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fundamentals of object-oriented design in UML |first=Meilir |last=Page-Jones|first2= Larry L. |last2=Constantine|lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Addison–Wesley |year=2000 |page=235 |isbn=0-201-69946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign and Commonwealth Office migrated archives''' are sensitive and incriminating collections of documents from Britain's former [[British Empire|colonial governments]] that were sent back to the UK (hence ''migrated'') on the eve of decolonisation for storage in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|FCO]] archives to avoid their disclosure and subsequent embarrassment to [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]]. A great many similar documents were not repatriated, but instead destroyed.

[[Ben Macintyre]] of the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' summarised the procedure for [[Declassification|declassifying]] Foreign Office archival material as follows:
{{quotation|Under the [[Public Records Act 1958|Public Records Act]], documents are liable for release to the National Archives after 30 years. Up to 60 per cent of material is shredded and burnt at this stage. Less than 1 per cent is kept secret.

Some files transferred to the archives remain closed if they are deemed potentially harmful to international relations or contain personal information.

In 2005, two [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|Freedom of Information]] (FoI) requests were submitted to the FCO by researchers wanting [[Mau Mau]]-era government files.

Upon their 'discovery', [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] requested Anthony Cary, a former British High Commissioner to Canada, to conduct an internal review into why the migrated archives had been spotlighted neither by the FoI requests nor by the initial Court Disclosure request.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}} Cary reported the following month, and outlined the background as follows:
{{quotation|As British dependent territories came to independence decisions had to be taken about which papers to destroy, which to leave for successor administrations, and which to ship back to the UK. The general rule, as set out in a [[Colonial Office]] guidance telegram of 3 May 1961 on the 'disposal of classified records and accountable documents', was the successor Governments should not be given papers which:&lt;br /&gt;
* might embarrass HMG or other Governments;
* might embarrass members of the police, military forces, public servants or others eg police informers;
* might compromise sources of intelligence information; or
* might be used unethically by Ministers in the successor Government
In addition ''"There would be little object in handing over documents which would patently be of no value to the successor Government"''. A great many documents were destroyed on this basis, but others were returned to the UK. These became the so-called 'migrated archives', eventually totalling around 8,800 files.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}}}}

| quote = Britain does not stand alone in facing such colonial legacies. Despite a public apology made in 2004 and the pledge of increased aid commitments to Namibia, the German Government still faces claims from the Herero peoples over a genocide inflicted in 1904. The Italians, too, are entangled in claims from their occupation of Libya. Silvio Berlusconi has gone further than the Germans, issuing an apology and promising a reparations payment of $5 billion.

The British will look toward the German and not the Italian model in handling the Mau Mau case. An apology should be issued to Kenya, and if it was to be given with a pledge of development assistance, then this might help to lay the ghosts of the past.

This should happen, but is it likely? It would imply an admission that torture had taken place under British rule in Kenya. We are making fools of ourselves by denying this.

One excuse offered by the FCO for their failure to consult the files was that the ownership of the papers was confused, that the FCO merely possessed stewardship, thus the archives had been considered "out of bounds" for FoI requests (the FCO were not the owners, so they did not have the right to go through the documents). Cary, however, managed to uncover the fact that this was not the case, that there had been "major exceptions to the general principle that these papers have been considered 'out of bounds'."{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=6}} Such an excuse became irrelevant after the 2006 legal request from Leigh Day because ''all'' documents have to be checked when it comes to court cases.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=10}} "It was perhaps convenient to [think] that the migrated archives .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. did not need to be consulted for the purposes of FOI requests, while also being conscious of the files as a sort of guilty secret, of uncertain status and in the 'too difficult' tray", Cary concluded.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13336343 |title=Mau Mau torture files were 'guilty secret' |author=BBC News |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search that turned up the "lost" documents on Mau Mau revealed a second raft of documents had also been "lost" and, hopefully, also therefore awaited discovery.

===The process of removal/destruction===
Documents that were to be left to post-independence governments, known as "legacy files", were separated from "watch files", which were marked for destruction or repatriation. In Uganda, the process was codenamed Operation Legacy; in Kenya, the process was described as "a thorough purge" and directed by colonial Special Branch officers. Africans were forbidden from involvement: only "a servant of the Kenya government who is a British subject of European descent" could participate. The watch-file instructions also made clear to leave no trace of their existence to successor governments: "The legacy files must leave no reference to watch material. Indeed, the very existence of the watch series, though it may be guessed at, should never be revealed." If possible, a dummy file was inserted to ensure file and page numbering was uninterrupted by the cull; when too many dummies were needed, they simply removed or destroyed the entire section. In Kenya, instructions insisted that "emphasis is placed upon destruction", meaning much of the most shocking material was probably destroyed, and "the waste should be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up", so that not even a trace of the destruction was left. Large quantities of files were also "packed in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free water at maximum practicable distance from the coast". Malaya's purge was less rigorous, and was facilitated by less experienced officials.&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "BBC 2012 docs"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17734735 |last= Wallis |first= Holly |date= 18 April 2012 |title= British colonial files released following legal challenge |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "G blog 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-2 |last= Bowcott |first= Owen |date= 18 April 2012  |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 11.20am update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cary's report and the documents initially released had shown that, on 3 December 1963, nine days before Kenya formally declared independence, three wooden packing crates containing 1,500 highly sensitive government files were loaded on to a British United Airways flight bound for Gatwick. On the eve of Kenya's independence, Colonial Secretary [[Iain Macleod]] ordered that sensitive colonial-government documentation be destroyed or flown out of the country because its disclosure "might embarrass Her Majesty's Government".&lt;ref name="times_05042011b"/&gt;{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}}&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |last3= Norton-Taylor |first3= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Britain destroyed records of colonial crimes |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Embarrassment hardly covers it," remarked a ''Times'' editorial, noting that "the covert history of colonial administration in Kenya bears comparison to the methods of torture and summary execution in the French war in Algeria."&lt;ref name="times_05042011c"&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=5 April 2011 |title=Crimes of colonialism |author=Editorial |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article2972824.ece |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, the government officially admitted for the first time not merely to having relevant Mau Mau documents, but that it had a total of 8,800 files from 37 ex-colonies,&lt;ref name = "admission 1"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2974649.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 6 April 2011 |title= Britain's colonial files to be released |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 |quote= Lord Howell confirmed .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. for the first time last night .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that the Foreign Office holds 8,800 files from 37 former British administrations }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "admission 2"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2974649.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 8 April 2011 |title= Archive at 'spook central' had secret Mau Mau files |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 |quote= On Tuesday night, Lord Howell of Guildford, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister, made a statement acknowledging for the first time that it was 'general practice for the colonial administration to transfer to the United Kingdom, shortly before independence, selected documents which were not appropriate to hand on to the successor Government'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which it would make public in batches from April 2012 to November 2013.&lt;ref name = "Econ 21Apr2012"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21553073 |date= 21 April 2012 |title= End of empire |journal= The Economist |accessdate= 27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' opined: "Even given the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's apparent skill in such matters, it is quite a feat to ignore 300 boxes of documents filling 110ft of shelving for almost half a century."&lt;ref name = "T ed 07Apr2011"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article2975963.ece |author= Editorial |date= 7 April 2011 |title= Dust and Denial |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Anderson, describing the Mau Mau initial 2011 revelations as just a start, emphasised that other former British domains, including Malaya, Cyprus, and the Gulf States, likewise await a final reckoning, and that colonial personnel and tactics subsequently made their way into the policing of [[The Troubles]].&lt;ref name = "DaAn 22Jul2011"/&gt; In particular, noted [[Aileen McColgan]], the techniques alleged in 1950s Kenya were refined into what are now known as the "[[five techniques]]" for use in internment in 1970s Northern Ireland: wall-standing, [[hooding]], subjection to noise, [[Sleep deprivation|deprivation of sleep]], and deprivation of food and drink. She went on to note: "The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1977 that Britain had breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and 'inhuman and degrading treatment', by the use of the five techniques in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister, Edward Heath, told the Commons in 1972 that the techniques would [[Death of Baha Mousa|never again]] be used 'as an aid to interrogation', a commitment reiterated before the European Court."&lt;ref name = "McColgan 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article2977823.ece |last= McColgan |first= Aileen |date= 8 April 2011 |title= Inquiries won't show Britain at its best |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Cary investigation, Hague appointed [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]'s [[Tony Badger]] as "colonial files tsar" to oversee the review and transfer of the hidden files to the public domain. The Foreign Office duly released a first batch of more than 1,200 records from 12 former colonial territories in April 2012, a portion of some 10,000 files that Britain removed from 37 of its colonies.&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-fco-transparency-myth |last= Elkins |first= Caroline |date= 18 April 2012 |title= The colonial papers: FCO transparency is a carefully cultivated myth |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Badger described the migrated archives episode as "embarrassing, scandalous. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

While the government was besieged publicly with allegations of brutalities in the detention camps and the cover-up of systematised violence—and denying all allegations—it was culling and purging the record. The process—practised in other colonies as well—deliberately sought to remove incriminating evidence.

As the ''Guardian'''s summary shows, even after the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO continued to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in [[British Guiana]] in the 1950s and 1960s, though [[Richard Drayton]], [[Rhodes Professor of Imperial History]] at [[King's College London]], said this was simply not credible: "When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO that they had been destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them.

There was wide agreement that the FCO was still withholding files.

The Cyprus files exclude the period of the emergency. The Malaya files cover very little of the contested emergency years. The Kenya documents are a meagre subset of the files released (though culled) in the context of the Mau Mau case. For all 12 colonies covered in today's release, there appears to be a great deal pertaining to finance, tourism, administration and the like. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

Journalist Ian Cobain and others suggested that, owing to the nature of the British withdrawal from the [[Colony of Aden]], the incriminating material may, instead of being withheld, actually have been more comprehensively destroyed at the time of decolonisation, rather than migrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-8 |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |date= 18 April 2012 |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 3.51pm update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-9 |last1= Gooding |first1= Francis |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |date= 18 April 2012 |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 5.09pm update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Badger accepted that historians believed the FCO was "up to its old tricks again", and added: "Given the failure of the Foreign Office to acknowledge the existence of the migrated archives, I understand the legacy of suspicion. It is difficult to overestimate the degree of suspicion."&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012b"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/sins-colonialists-concealed-secret-archive |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Norton-Taylor |first2= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Sins of colonialists lay concealed for decades in secret archive |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 28 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ominously, the ''Guardian'' noted:
{{quote|In a number of colonies, as files were destroyed a certificate was completed and sent to London to show that the job had been done. Could these certificates also be stored at Hanslope Park, providing a glimpse of the contents of each file that was destroyed? The FCO was refusing to say on Tuesday, and insisted that any queries about such certificates should be the subject of an freedom of information request. Furthermore, Cary's report states that a separate inquiry is now examining the fate of a number of files that were lost or destroyed after they were returned to the UK. The FCO failed to answer a number of questions about that inquiry, stating only that the files remained missing despite an extensive search.&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012b"/&gt;}}
David Anderson expressed alarm at the Foreign Office refusal to release the index of the files that might enable historians to know what is missing.&lt;ref name = "Father 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3387165.ece |last1= Malvern |first1= Jack |last2= Kenber |first2= Billy |date= 18 April 2012 |title= How British diplomats nearly prevented the birth of Barack Obama |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett said that "the British Army retained ultimate operational control over all security forces throughout the Emergency", and that its military intelligence operation worked "hand in glove" with the Kenyan Special Branch "including in screening and interrogations in centres and detention camps".&lt;ref name = "Torture 2011"/&gt;

The Kenyan government sent a letter to Hague insisting that the UK government was legally liable for the atrocities.&lt;ref name="times_05042011b"/&gt; The Foreign Office, however, reaffirmed its position that it was not, in fact, liable for colonial atrocities,&lt;ref name="times_05042011b"/&gt; and argued that the documents had not "disappeared" as part of a cover up.&lt;ref name="ft_050411"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c4fde0d2-5fb6-11e0-a718-00144feab49a.html |author=James Blitz |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=5 April 2011 |title=Mau Mau case casts light on colonial records |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly ten years before, in late 2002, as the BBC aired a damning documentary on British crimes committed during the rebellion and 6,000 depositions had been taken for the legal case, former district colonial officer John Nottingham had expressed concern that compensation be paid soon, since most victims were in their 80s and would soon pass away. He told the BBC: "What went on in the Kenya camps and villages was brutal, savage torture.

===Cyprus===
The release of material in 2011 sparked legal threats from veterans of [[EOKA#EOKA_allegations_of_torture_by_British_forces|EOKA]], who fought a campaign against the British occupation of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2983111.ece |last= Theodoulou |first= Michael |date= 13 April 2011 |title= Greek Cypriots intend to sue Britain over torture in 1950s uprising |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 9 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/eoka-fighters-sue-brits-over-torture/20110414 |last= Dewhurst |first= Patrick |date= 14 April 2011 |title= EOKA fighters to sue Brits over torture |newspaper= [[Cyprus Mail]] |accessdate= 9 May 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518083948/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/eoka-fighters-sue-brits-over-torture/20110414 |archivedate= 18 May 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David French also utilised the FCO files on Cyprus from the Migrated Archives to prove that the British did not intentionally use a colonial policy of 'Divide and Rule' to flare up Community Tensions on the Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=French|first1=David|title=British Intelligence and the Origins of the EOKA Emergency|url=http://bjmh.org.uk/index.php/bjmh/article/view/33/25|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 2012 documents suggested that the British never intended peace talks with the rebels to succeed.

===Plans for chemical warfare testing in Botswana===
In 1943, Britain planned to test a "very virulent" type of poison gas in what was [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] (now [[Botswana]]). On 6 June 1943, Harold Eddey Priestman, Administrative Secretary to the High Commissioner in South Africa, sent a hand-written letter, marked "secret and personal", to Aubrey Denzil Forsyth-Thompson, Resident Commissioner of Bechuanaland, in which he explained: "Certain types of poison gas are being manufactured in the union [South Africa] on UK account. The UK Ministry of Aircraft Production have now asked that practical trials may be carried out on a considerable scale. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. We understand this poison gas is a very virulent type. It would therefore be necessary 1) to preclude access to the experimental area for a considerable time after the experiments had ceased. 2) and also to take into consideration any danger of the gas being carried by wind to areas adjacent to the experimental area."

The British looked for an "isolated area" within "reasonable distance" of an air base, that had a 15-mile buffer zone with no water sources, and that was "comparatively free from vegetation". Nowhere suitable could be found in South Africa, but they provisionally settled on somewhere in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Forsyth-Thompson later said that he was unwilling to consider testing in that area because it was surrounded by farms and it would be impossible to maintain secrecy. Under the codename of FORENSIC, air-launched trials were envisaged, but the approach of the rainy season prevented testing from going ahead. There is currently no evidence FORENSIC was actually executed.

Although it was never deployed, Britain stockpiled poison gas because of fears of its possible use by Germany.&lt;ref name = "Botswana"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3387203.ece |last1= Malvern |first1= Jack |last2= Kenber |first2= Billy |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Poison gas tests planned for site in Botswana |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "G Bots chem"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-poison-gas-tests-botswana |last= Norton-Taylor |first= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Britain planned poison gas tests in Botswana, records reveal |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | title=Feature Review: FUDGE | journal=[[Shadis]]

Andrew Kitkowski|url=http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_3576.html|title=FUDGE Expanded edition (Review)|accessdate=2007-09-24|publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, though the acronym has since been dropped, that phrase remains a good summation of the game's design goals. ''Fudge'' has been nominated for an [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Role-Playing Game System'' for the ''[[Deryni]] Role-Playing Game''.&lt;ref name="origins2005"&gt;{{cite press release| title =Academy announces Origins Award Nominations| publisher =Game Manufacturers Association| date =2006-03-15| url =http://gama.org/news-articles/academy-announces-origins-award-nominations#OX4-IMw6yIaqKiqvrHst1Q| accessdate =2007-09-24  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deryni"&gt;{{Cite web| title =FUDGE Deryni Adventure Game| date =2006-03-17| url =http://derynirealms.com/| accessdate = 2007-09-24  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than being a rigidly pre-defined set of rules like ''[[d20 System]]'' or ''[[GURPS]]'', ''Fudge'' offers a customizable toolkit for building the users' own specialized [[role-playing game system]].  Such things as what attributes and skills will define characters are left to be determined by the [[Game Master]] and players, and several different optional systems for resolving actions and conflicts are offered. ''Fudge'' is not tied to any particular [[genre]] or setting and world builders are encouraged to invent appropriate attributes and rules tailored to the campaign.&lt;ref name="fudgerules"&gt;{{Cite web| last =Kitkowski| first =Andrew| title =FUDGE Expanded Edition: Playtest Review| date =2000-11-14| url =http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_3576.html| accessdate = 2007-09-24  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project that would lead to ''Fudge'' was first proposed by [[Steffan O'Sullivan]] in November 1992 on the rec.games.design newsgroup,&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.design/msg/4dc266facabc766f net.rpg.freeform 1 of 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and over the following months that online community would contribute to the directed project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.design/msg/03ec8dc478bdc253 net.rpg.freeform 2 of 2]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest stipulations of O'Sullivan was that the basic system would always remain free to the public over the internet, and the [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] of the 1995 version still is.&lt;ref name="desnotes"&gt;[http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fud-des.html Fudge Designer's notes]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 version of ''Fudge'' is available under a non-commercial licence.

[[Grey Ghost Press]], with the endorsement of Steffan O'Sullivan, publishes an expanded form of the ''Fudge'' system. There have been three Grey Ghost Press editions, the most current being the ''Fudge 10th Anniversary Edition'', which includes several suggested rules systems for common RPG elements and an example basic fantasy "build" of the game.

In March 2004, Grey Ghost Press acquired the copyright of ''Fudge'', and on April 6, 2005, they released a version of ''Fudge'' under the [[Open Game License]].

The OGL license has allowed the ''[[FATE (role-playing game system)|FATE role-playing game system]]'' to build on ''Fudge'' as its underlying mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;http://rpgblog.typepad.com/rpg_blog/2005/05/the_fate_interv.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Fudge'' as one of ''The Millennium's Most Underrated Games''.  Editor [[Scott Haring]] stated that "''Fudge'' is an extremely flexible, rules-light system. It works great, and everybody who plays it, loves it. Why isn't it more popular? I dunno."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Most Influential Company and The Millennium's Most Underrated Game|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|last=Haring| first=Scott D. |authorlink=Scott Haring | url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1240| date=1999-11-25| accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name==
At the time ''Fudge'' was conceived, it was stylish to give role-playing games acronyms for names (for instance, ''[[GURPS]]'' and ''[[TWERPS]]'') and originally the usenet design project referred to the game as ''SLUG'', for "Simple Laid-back Universal Game".&lt;ref name="desnotes" /&gt; However, this was soon changed to ''FUDGE'' for "Free-form Universal Donated Gaming Engine", but also because the word invoked connotations of an easy to make source of fun. This again was changed when Grey Ghost Press released their 1995 hardcopy version of the game, to "Free-form Universal Do-it-yourself Gaming Engine".

With the publication of the Expanded Edition in 2000, the fad for acronym-based names had long since faded, and the writer and the publisher both felt that the forced acronym had become irrelevant. The game has been referred to officially as just ''Fudge'' ever since, though fans often still refer to it in the old manner as ''FUDGE''.

==Game mechanics==
[[Image:FUDGE 4dF probability.svg|thumb|300px|right|Probability of results when rolling 4dF]]
In ''Fudge'', character Traits such as [[attribute (role-playing games)|Attributes]] and [[skill (role-playing)|Skills]], are rated on a seven-level, ascending [[adjective]] scale: ''Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great,'' and ''Superb.''

''Fudge'' characters can also have Gifts and Faults, which are positive and negative traits that do not fit into the adjective scale.

===Fudge dice===
[[File:White Fudge Dice.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A set of Fudge dice]]
''Fudge'' uses customized "''Fudge'' [[dice]]" which have an equal number of plus, minus and blank sides. A number of these dice are rolled, usually four at a time ("4dF" in Fudge [[dice notation]]), and for every plus side that comes up the result of using the Trait is considered one step higher (e.g. from ''Fair'' to ''Good'') and for every minus side that comes up the result is considered one step lower. The goal is to match or surpass the difficulty level, also on the adjective scale, of the test. Thus, a ''Good'' attribute is considered to be ''Great'' if the player were to roll two plus sides, one minus side, and one blank—the minus side cancels out one of the plus sides and the remaining plus side raises the result by one step. The same ''Good'' attribute would be considered ''Poor'' if you were to roll three minus sides and one blank. The same dice roll can be achieved with six-sided dice, treating a 1 or 2 as [−], a 3-4 as [&amp;nbsp;] and a 5-6 as [+].

There are also several alternative dice systems available that use ten-sided dice, coins, or playing cards.

==Complexity==
The rules of ''Fudge'' are highly customizable and can be adjusted for the level of simplicity or complexity desired by the Game Master and Players. Overall, the system is designed to encourage role-playing over strict adherence to an arbitrary set of rules. In fact, the main ''Fudge'' documents encourage players to "Just Fudge It"; that is, to focus on the story being created rather than on the game rules. For example, one character creation method encourages players to first write prose descriptions of their characters and then translate those into ''Fudge'' Traits.

[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|The unique factorization theorem was proved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''.&lt;ref name="Gauss1801.loc=16"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gauss|Clarke|1986|loc=Art. 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Gauss used the fundamental theorem for proving the [[law of quadratic reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gauss|Clarke|1986|loc=Art. 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[number theory]], the '''fundamental theorem of arithmetic''', also called the '''unique factorization theorem''' or the '''unique-prime-factorization theorem''', states that every [[integer]] greater than 1&lt;ref&gt;Using the [[empty product|empty product rule]] one need not exclude the number 1, and the theorem can be stated as: every positive integer has unique prime factorization.&lt;/ref&gt; either is a [[prime number]] itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers and that, moreover, this representation is unique, [[up to]] (except for) the order of the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hardy|Wright|2008|loc=Thm 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

:1200 = 2{{sup|4}} × 3{{sup|1}} × 5{{sup|2}} = 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 2 = ...

The theorem says two things for this example: first, that 1200 {{em|can}} be represented as a product of primes, and second, that no matter how this is done, there will always be exactly four 2s, one 3, two 5s, and no other primes in the product.

The requirement that the factors be prime is necessary: factorizations containing [[composite number]]s may not be unique (e.g., 12 = 2 × 6 = 3 × 4).

This theorem is one of the main [[Prime number#Primality of one|reasons why 1 is not considered a prime number]]: if 1 were prime, then factorization into primes would not be unique; for example, {{nowrap|1=2 = 2 × 1 = 2 × 1 × 1 = ...}}

==Euclid's original version==

Book VII, propositions 30, 31 and 32, and Book IX, proposition 14 of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' are essentially the statement and proof of the fundamental theorem.

{{Quotation|
If two numbers by multiplying one another make some
number, and any prime number measure the product, it will
also measure one of the original numbers.
|Euclid|[[#CITEREFEuclidHeath1956|Elements Book VII]], Proposition 30}}

(In modern terminology: if a  prime ''p'' divides the product ''ab'', then ''p'' divides either ''a'' or ''b'' or both.) Proposition 30 is referred to as [[Euclid's lemma]], and it is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

{{Quotation|
Any composite number is measured by some prime number.
|Euclid|[[#CITEREFEuclidHeath1956|Elements Book VII]], Proposition 31}}

(In modern terminology: every integer greater than one is divided evenly by some prime number.) Proposition 31 is proved directly by [[Proof by infinite descent|infinite descent]].

{{Quotation|
Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number.
|Euclid|[[#CITEREFEuclidHeath1956|Elements Book VII]], Proposition 32}}

Proposition 32 is derived from proposition 31, and proves that the decomposition is possible.

{{Quotation|
If a number be the least that is measured by prime numbers, it will not be measured by any
other prime number except those originally measuring it.
|Euclid|[[#CITEREFEuclidHeath1956|Elements Book IX]], Proposition 14}}

(In modern terminology: a [[least common multiple]] of several prime numbers is not a multiple of any other prime number.) Book IX, proposition 14 is derived from Book VII, proposition 30, and proves partially that the decomposition is unique – a point critically noted by [[André Weil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Weil|2007|p=5}}: "Even in Euclid, we fail to find a general statement about the uniqueness of the factorization of an integer into primes; surely he may have been aware of it, but all he has is a statement (Eucl.IX.I4) about the l.c.m. of any number of given primes."&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in this proposition the exponents are all equal to one, so nothing is said for the general case.

Article 16 of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]' ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' is an early modern statement and proof employing [[modular arithmetic]].&lt;ref name="Gauss1801.loc=16" /&gt;

==Applications==
===Canonical representation of a positive integer=== &lt;!-- Redirect [[Canonical form]] links here --&gt;

Every positive integer ''n'' &gt; 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers:
:&lt;math&gt;
n
= p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2} \cdots p_k^{n_k}
= \prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{n_i}
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap begin}}''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;{{nowrap end}} are primes and the ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive integers. This representation is commonly extended to all positive integers, including 1, by the convention that the [[empty product]] is equal to 1 (the empty product corresponds to ''k'' = 0).

This representation is called the '''canonical representation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''n'', or the '''standard form'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hardy|Wright|2008|loc=§ 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''n''.  For example,

:999 = 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×37,
:1000 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,
:1001 = 7×11×13.

Note that factors ''p''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 may be inserted without changing the value of ''n'' (e.g., 1000 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×3&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;×5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;br&gt;In fact, any positive integer can be uniquely represented as an [[infinite product]] taken over all the positive prime numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;
n=2^{n_1}3^{n_2}5^{n_3}7^{n_4}\cdots=\prod_{i=1}^\infty p_i^{n_i},
&lt;/math&gt;
where a finite number of the ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive integers, and the rest are zero. Allowing negative exponents provides a canonical form for positive [[rational number]]s.

===Arithmetic operations===
The canonical representations of the product, [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD), and [[least common multiple]] (LCM) of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' can be expressed simply in terms of the canonical representations of ''a'' and ''b'' themselves:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
 a\cdot b &amp;{}={} 2^{a_1+b_1}3^{a_2+b_2}5^{a_3+b_3}7^{a_4+b_4}\cdots
   &amp;&amp;{}={} \prod p_i^{a_i+b_i},\\
 \gcd(a,b) &amp;{}={} 2^{\min(a_1,b_1)}3^{\min(a_2,b_2)}5^{\min(a_3,b_3)}7^{\min(a_4,b_4)}\cdots
   &amp;&amp;{}={} \prod p_i^{\min(a_i,b_i)},\\
 \operatorname{lcm}(a,b) &amp;{}={} 2^{\max(a_1,b_1)}3^{\max(a_2,b_2)}5^{\max(a_3,b_3)}7^{\max(a_4,b_4)}\cdots
   &amp;&amp;{}={} \prod p_i^{\max(a_i,b_i)}.
 \end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

However, [[integer factorization]], especially of large numbers, is much more difficult than computing products, GCDs, or LCMs.  So these formulas have limited use in practice.

===Arithmetic functions===
{{Main article|Arithmetic function}}

Many arithmetic functions are defined using the canonical representation. In particular, the values of [[additive function|additive]] and [[multiplicative function|multiplicative]] functions are determined by their values on the powers of prime numbers.

==Proof==
The proof uses [[Euclid's lemma]] (''Elements'' VII, 30): if a prime ''p'' [[Divisor|divides]] the product of two [[natural number]]s ''a'' and ''b'', then ''p'' divides ''a'' or ''p'' divides ''b''.

===Existence===
We need to show that every integer greater than 1 is either prime or a product of primes.
For the base case, note that 2 is prime.
By [[strong induction]]: assume true for all numbers between 1 and ''n''. If ''n'' is prime, there is nothing more to prove. Otherwise, there are integers ''a'' and ''b'',  where ''n'' = ''ab'' and {{nowrap begin}}1 &lt; ''a'' ≤ ''b'' &lt; ''n''.{{nowrap end}}
By the induction hypothesis,
{{nowrap begin}}''a'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;{{nowrap end}}
and
{{nowrap begin}}''b'' = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;{{nowrap end}} are products of primes. But then
{{nowrap begin}}''n'' = ''ab'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;{{nowrap end}} is a product of primes.

===Uniqueness===
Assume that ''s'' &gt; 1 is the product of prime numbers in two different ways:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s
&amp;=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m \\
&amp;=q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

We must show ''m'' = ''n'' and that the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are a rearrangement of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

As ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; divides ''s'', [[Euclid's lemma]] implies that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; divides one of the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;; relabeling the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; if necessary, say that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; divides ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is prime, so its only divisors are itself and 1. Therefore, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{s}{p_1}
&amp;=p_2 \cdots p_m \\
&amp;=q_2 \cdots q_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Reasoning the same way, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must equal one of the remaining ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Relabeling again if necessary, say ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{s}{p_1 p_2}
&amp;=p_3 \cdots p_m \\
&amp;=q_3 \cdots q_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be done for each of the ''m'' ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s, showing that ''m'' ≤ ''n'' and every ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Applying the same argument with the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;'s and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;'s reversed shows ''n'' ≤ ''m'' (hence  ''m'' = ''n'') and every ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Elementary proof of uniqueness===
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can also be proved without using Euclid's lemma, as follows:

Assume that ''s'' &gt; 1 is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways. If ''s'' were prime then it would factor uniquely as itself, so there must be at least two primes in each factorization of ''s'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s
&amp;=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m \\
&amp;=q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If any ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; then, by cancellation, ''s''/''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''/''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; would be another positive integer, different from s, which is greater than 1 and also has two distinct factorizations. But ''s''/''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is smaller than ''s'', meaning ''s'' would not actually be the smallest such integer. Therefore every ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; must be distinct from every ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Without loss of generality, take ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (if this is not already the case, switch the ''p'' and ''q'' designations.) Consider

:&lt;math&gt;t = (q_1 - p_1)(q_2 \cdots q_n),&lt;/math&gt;

and note that 1 &lt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''t'' &lt; ''s''. Therefore ''t'' must have a unique prime factorization. By rearrangement we see,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
t
&amp;= q_1(q_2 \cdots q_n) - p_1(q_2 \cdots q_n) \\
&amp;= s - p_1(q_2 \cdots q_n) \\
&amp;= p_1((p_2 \cdots p_m) - (q_2 \cdots q_n)).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''u'' = ((''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) - (''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is positive, for if it were negative or zero then so would be its product with ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, but that product equals ''t'' which is positive. So ''u'' is either 1 or factors into primes. In either case, ''t'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''u'' yields a prime factorization of ''t'', which we know to be unique, so ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; appears in the prime factorization of ''t''.

If (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) equaled 1 then the prime factorization of ''t'' would be all ''q'''s, which would preclude ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from appearing. Thus  (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not 1, but is positive, so it factors into primes: (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;). This yields a prime factorization of

:&lt;math&gt;t = (r_1 \cdots r_h)(q_2 \cdots q_n),&lt;/math&gt;

which we know is unique. Now, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; appears in the prime factorization of ''t'', and it is not equal to any ''q'', so it must be one of the ''r'''s. That means ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a factor of (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), so there exists a positive integer ''k'' such that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''k'' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;p_1(k+1) = q_1.&lt;/math&gt;

But that means ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has a proper factorization, so it is not a prime number. This contradiction shows that ''s'' does not actually have two different prime factorizations. As a result, there is no smallest positive integer with multiple prime factorizations, hence all positive integers greater than 1 factor uniquely into primes.

==Generalizations==
The first generalization of the theorem is found in Gauss's second monograph (1832) on [[biquadratic reciprocity]]. This paper introduced what is now called the [[ring theory|ring]] of [[Gaussian integer]]s, the set of all [[complex number]]s ''a'' + ''bi'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers. It is now denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[i].&lt;/math&gt; He showed that this ring has the four units ±1 and ±''i'', that the non-zero, non-unit numbers fall into two classes, primes and composites, and that (except for order), the composites have unique factorization as a product of primes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFGauss1832|Gauss, BQ, §§ 31–34]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in 1844 while working on [[cubic reciprocity]], [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] introduced the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\omega]&lt;/math&gt;, where   &lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\omega^3=1 &lt;/math&gt; is a cube [[root of unity]]. This is the ring of [[Eisenstein integer]]s, and he proved it has the six units &lt;math&gt;\pm 1, \pm\omega, \pm\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; and that it has unique factorization.

However, it was also discovered that unique factorization does not always hold. An example is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt;. In this ring one has&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hardy|Wright|2008|loc=§ 14.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
6=
2\cdot 3=
(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5}).
&lt;/math&gt;

Examples like this caused the notion of "prime" to be modified. In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product, e.g., 2 = ''ab'', then one of ''a'' or ''b'' must be a unit. This is the traditional definition of "prime". It can also be proven that none of these factors obeys Euclid's lemma; e.g.,
2 divides neither (1 + {{sqrt|&amp;minus;5}}) nor (1 &amp;minus; {{sqrt|&amp;minus;5}}) even though it divides their product 6. In [[algebraic number theory]] 2 is called '''irreducible''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; (only divisible by itself or a unit) but not '''prime''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; (if it divides a product it must divide one of the factors). The mention of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; is required because 2 is prime and irreducible in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}.&lt;/math&gt; Using these definitions it can be proven that in any ring a prime must be irreducible. Euclid's classical lemma can be rephrased as "in the ring of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; every irreducible is prime". This is also true in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[i]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\omega],&lt;/math&gt; but not in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}].&lt;/math&gt;

The rings in which factorization into irreducibles is essentially unique are called [[unique factorization domain]]s. Important examples are [[polynomial ring]]s over the integers or over a [[field (mathematics)|field]], [[Euclidean domain]]s and [[principal ideal domain]]s.

In 1843 [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] introduced the concept of [[ideal number]], which was developed further by [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] (1876) into the modern theory of [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideals]], special subsets of rings. Multiplication is defined for ideals, and the rings in which they have unique factorization are called [[Dedekind domain]]s.

There is a version of [[ordinal arithmetic|unique factorization for ordinals]], though it requires some additional conditions to ensure uniqueness.

In Scotland, the first Monday after New Year's Day was traditionally known as '''Hansel Monday''', or '''Handsel Monday''', and gifts ({{lang-sco|Hansels}}) were given at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-han2.htm Michael Quinion, "World Wide Words: Handsel"]. Retrieved 7 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the rural population of Scotland, ''[[wikt:auld|Auld]] Hansel Monday'', is traditionally celebrated on the first Monday after January 12. This custom reflects a reluctance to switch from the old ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]) style calendar to the new ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) calendar.&lt;ref name="World Dict"&gt;[http://www.credoreference.com/entry/hfcwd/handsel_monday. ''Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Handsel Monday," Detroit: Omnigraphics, Inc., 2010]. Retrieved 7 January 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word "handsel" originates from old Saxon word which means “to deliver into the hand”. It refers to small tips and gifts of money given as a token&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/words/1154 Handsel at Scots Language Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130705033754/http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/words/1154 |date=2013-07-05 }}. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; of good luck, particularly at the beginning of something; the modern house-warming gift would be a good example. An 1825 glossary marks Handsel Monday as an occasion "when it is customary to make children and servants a present".&lt;ref&gt;John Trotter Brockett, A glossary of north country words, in use, 1st edition, 1 vol., Newcastle upon Tyne: 1825.&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, tips of small gifts were expected by servants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/handsel%20monday Definition at Merriam-Webster]. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the postman, the deliverers of newspapers, scavengers, and all persons who wait upon the house.

In this respect it is somewhat similar to [[Boxing Day]], which eventually supplanted it.&lt;ref name="World Dict" /&gt; If the handsel was a physical object rather than money, tradition said that the object could not be sharp, or it would "cut" the relationship between the giver and the recipient. The day is known in [[Scottish Gaelic]] as {{lang|gd|Diluain Traoighte}} (drained Monday).

The custom was also known as “handseling a purse”. A new purse would not be given to anyone without placing money in it for good luck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T100054.html The History of Ireland]. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Money received during Handsel Monday is supposed to insure monetary luck all for the rest of the year.

{{quote|It is worth mentioning that one William Hunter, a collier (residing in the parish of [[Tillicoultry]], in [[Clackmannanshire]]), was cured in the year 1738 of an inveterate rheumatism or gout, by drinking freely of new ale, full of harm or yeast. The poor man had been confined to his bed. for a year and a half, having almost entirely lost the use of his limbs. On the evening of '''Handsel Monday''', as it is called, some of his neighbours came to make merry with him. Though he could not rise, yet he always took his share of the ale, as it passed round the company, and in the end he became much intoxicated. The consequence was that he had the use of his limbs next morning, and was able to walk about. He lived more than twenty years after this, and never had the smallest return of his old complaint.|[[Sir John Sinclair|Sinclair]]|''[[Statistical Account of Scotland]]'', 1792, xv., note on p. 201.}}

'''The Houston Galveston Institute''' is a non-profit organization that offers a method of collaborative counseling and postmodern therapy to individuals, families and communities of all socioeconomic backgrounds.  The Institute is strongly associated with [[collaborative language systems]] (or [[Collaborative Therapy]]), a type of [[postmodern]] therapy that works with clients within a cooperative partnership that holds their expertise in high regard, and that encourages them to access their own natural resources to develop solutions to their problems. The Houston Galveston Institute is a sponsor of the International Journal of Collaborative Practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collaborative-practices.com/ |title=International Journal of Collaborative Practices |publisher=Collaborative-practices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The beginnings of the Houston Galveston Institute date back to the 1950s at the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in [[Galveston]], [[Texas]] with the federally funded family therapy project to research the Multiple Impact Theory.  In 1978, the Galveston Family Institute was established by [[Harlene Anderson]], Ph.D., [[Paul Dell]], Ph.D., [[Harold Goolishian]], Ph.D. and [[George Pulliam]], M.S.W. to meet the demands of mental health professionals seeking to increase their understanding of families and further develop their skills in systems-oriented therapy with individuals, couples, families and groups.  From this group, the ideas of Collaborative Language System Theory emerged.  The institute officially became the Houston Galveston Institute in the 1990s when the project expanded beyond Galveston. Other contributors are Diane Gehart, Sue Levin, Diana Carleton, Lynn Hoffmann, [[Tom Andersen]], Vivien Burr, John Cromby, [[Kenneth Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], Lois Holzman, Imelda McCarthy, Susan McDaniel, Sheila McNamee, Robert Neimeyer, David Nightingale, Peggy Penn, Sallyann Roth, Jaakko Seikkula, John Shotter, Lois Shawver, and Michael White.

==Collaborative approach==
This type of approach formed at Houston Galveston Institute takes the unique stance that “problems are not solved, but dissolved in language.” &lt;ref&gt;''The client is the expert''; Anderson &amp; Goolishian. (1992).  In K. Gergen &amp; S. McNamee (Eds.) Therapy as Social Construction. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative therapy]] is now recognized as one of the current schools of [[family therapy]] and is included in graduate school textbooks.  Some of the general philosophic assumptions of the theory are:
* Maintaining Skepticism – A critical attitude about how knowledge is ‘known’
* Eluding Generalizations – Avoid the dominant discourse
* Knowledge as an Interactive Social Process – Dialectic, conversational knowledge
* Privileging Local Knowledge – Persons and communities know themselves
* Language as a Creative Social Process – Language creates our knowledge
* Knowledge and Language as Transforming – Conversations change people
* [[Postmodern]] is only One of Many Narratives – One of many languages
These assumptions are post-modern in nature and inform the clinical practice of the [[Collaborative Therapy]] approach. The following list is of the various impacts that these assumptions have on the therapist and therapeutic relationship. 
* Mutually Inquiring Conversational Partnership – Therapy as a partnership
* Relational Expertise – Client and therapist bring their expertise together
* Not-Knowing – Humility before the client
* Being Public – Therapist is open with their invisible thoughts
* Living with Uncertainty – Enjoy the spontaneity of a conversation
* Mutually Transforming – [[Hermeneutic]] circle, reciprocal effect on client and therapist
* Orienting towards Everyday Ordinary Life – Tap into natural resilience of clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harleneanderson.org/CollaborativeTherapyArticleMarch2009.htm |title=Collaborative Practice |publisher=Harleneanderson.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912150103/http://www.harleneanderson.org/CollaborativeTherapyArticleMarch2009.htm |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Collaborative therapy shares similar [[epistemological]] roots with [[Narrative Therapy]] and [[Solution-focused therapy]].  These therapies are similar, yet distinct.  An article by Gehart &amp; Paré summarizes the differences between the therapies in the following way: “In collaborative language systems, the “dis-solving” of problems through conversation (Anderson &amp; Goolishian, 1988; Goolishian &amp; Anderson, 1992), in narrative therapy, reauthoring one’s story about the problem (White 2004; White &amp; Epston, 1990), and in solution-focused therapy (SFT), building solutions (Berg, 1994; de Shazer, 1994; Lipchik, 2002)” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Sociopolitical activist or conversational partner?

==Current practice==
The Houston Galveston Institute currently is involved in the use of the Collaborative Approach in training, counseling and researching.  The office is located in [[Houston]]’s [[museum district]] and is serving the [[community]] needs while training students from local, national and international programs.  HGI also provides various training programs for mental health professionals who want to develop a collaborative and postmodern approach to therapeutic work with individuals, couples, families, groups, organizations and community.

==International and national affiliates==
The Institute currently offers an [[International Certificate in Collaborative Practices]] program with participation around the world.  The program is sponsored by the Houston Galveston Institute and the [[Taos Institute]].  It is a response to the numerous practitioners around the world who are interested in expanding their knowledge and competency in collaborative practice. The Certificate Program provides practitioners across disciplines—therapy, organization development, education and research—an intensive, in-depth study of collaborative practices based on postmodern-social construction philosophy. The Program includes the study of the theoretical and philosophical assumptions and their application to practice in a variety of contexts and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collaborativecertificate.org/Houston_Galveston_Instit.html |title=Houston Galveston Instit |publisher=Collaborativecertificate.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723103847/http://www.collaborativecertificate.org/Houston_Galveston_Instit.html |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is offered in [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. In 2009, the International Journal of Collaborative Practices was founded in order to publish the collaborative works developing worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collaborative-practices.com/ |title=International Journal of Collaborative Practices |publisher=Collaborative-practices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[philosopher]]s have developed concepts that they have called '''idols''', including:

* The [[Novum Organum#The Idols .28Idola.29|idola]] of [[Francis Bacon]], various obstacles humans face when trying to truly understand nature
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', abstract unchanging philosophical concepts that need to be swept away to allow for true life to emerge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1934">'''Inclusive masculinity''' is an approach to thinking about [[masculinity]] in the context of social changes that have undermined traditional [[hegemonic masculinity]] and its associated [[homophobia]], which each have driven men to avoid certain behaviors in order to avoid being publicly perceived as gay; it holds that there are increasingly societal spaces in which men no longer need to behave in hypermasculine ways in order to be accepted. When this occurs, men can engage in a variety of previously feminine practices without the fear of being perceived gay or weak.&lt;ref name=RobertsIntro&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Roberts|editor1-first=Steven|title=Debating Modern Masculinities: Change, Continuity, Crisis?|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137394842|language=en|last=Roberts|first=Steven|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4, 8–9}}

The theory was published in 2009 by [[Eric Anderson (sociologist)|Eric Anderson]] in a book called "Inclusive Masculinity".&lt;ref name=RobertsIntro/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Eric|title=Inclusive masculinity : the changing nature of masculinities|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415804622|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further elaborated by Mark McCormack in a 2012 book.&lt;ref name=RobertsIntro/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCormack|first1=Mark|title=The declining significance of homophobia how teenage boys are redefining masculinity and heterosexuality|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199778485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Through paintings, installations and social art, Vrijmoet focuses on issues of consciousness, scale, accessibility and ownership. A student of anatomy since childhood, Vrijmoet has for three decades included life drawing in her daily practice. She is currently completing her ''Accident'' series and her ''Non-ordinary Reality'' series. In August, 2010, the Center on Contemporary Art in Seattle published a 42-page catalog for her solo show, ''Kate Vrijmoet: Essential Gestures''.&lt;ref name="CoCABook10"&gt;CoCA (2010), [http://www.cocaseattle.org/books ''Kate Vrijmoet: Essential Gestures''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224003755/http://www.cocaseattle.org/books/ |date=2010-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Vrijmoet's work was featured in a [[South Seattle Community College]] showing, and during a solo show at the [[LANN Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museoluisnoboanaranjo.com/eng/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803161246/http://www.museoluisnoboanaranjo.com/eng/index.php |archivedate=2010-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]].

Her profile was featured in the inaugural issue of the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' Arts Section.&lt;ref name="Huffington10"&gt;Ming Holden (June 18, 2010) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ming-holden/what-does-ecuador-have-to_b_607046.html ''What Does Ecuador Have to Do with Seattle?''] Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; Kate discuses her work in detail in an interview published by the science and culture digest [[3 Quarks Daily]].&lt;ref name="3 Quarks Daily"&gt;Elatia Harris (September 13th, 2010) [http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/09/kate-vrijmoet-a-non-ordinary-trajectory-.html 'Kate Vrijmoet: A Non-ordinary Painting Trajectory']&lt;/ref&gt; In her exhibit book, The Incredible Intensity of Just Being Human[14], she writes, "Art connects us. It tells us we're human, we're like one another, we feel the same emotions. My mission as a human being, and my job as an artist, is to use art to create deep connections among us. Those deep connections already exist, but sometimes convention rewards us for ignoring them. I contend that the greater rewards come from exploring them.".

In 2011 Vrijmoet's installation piece ''"Mother May I…?"'' was exhibited at the Orange County Center on Contemporary Arts (OCCCA),in a show that was endorsed by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]], who coined the term relational aesthetics, or [[Relational art]]. In 2012 this installation was featured in the largest artist-run, not for profit organization in Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Artists Waterfront Coalition's (BWAC) juried show. ''"Mother May I…?,"'' — an interactive audio installment designed to address our fundamental sense of belonging — was awarded "Best Installation" by Charlotta Kotik, curator of the [[Brooklyn Museum]] of Art. Vrijmoet's work has featured in New York City shows juried by curators of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (Anne Strauss), the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] (Nat Trotman), and [[Museum of Modern Art]] (Paulina Pobocha).

In 2013 she began curating a [[Social Practice Art]] exhibit aimed at ending the stigma and silence surrounding mental illness. The Incredible Intensity of Just Being Human has been exhibited at the [[Seattle Center]], and [[Highline College]]. In 2014 she won prestigious grants through [[Artist Trust]] and Seattle Department of Neighborhoods to further fund this exhibit in [[Seattle City Hall]] where civic leaders [[Ed Murray (Washington politician)|Mayor Ed Murray]], [[Randy Revelle]], [[Brady Walkinshaw]], and [[Tina Orwall]] spoke at the opening reception about mental illness. Vrijmoet's project was supported by Seattle Office of Arts and Culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/arts/|title=Office of Arts &amp; Culture – Seattle – Arts – seattle.gov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allied Arts of Seattle|Allied Arts Foundation]].

Also in 2013 she participated in [[Seattle Erotic Art Festival|SEAF]] with her social sculpture "Poor Impulse Control"- an example of [[relational art]], social sculpture, or ironic participation. In this form the artist exploits the role of the viewer as the art object.  The primary role of social sculpture is not one of beauty, but of intervention through discomfort. The audience has an interdependent relationship with the work. Of this social sculpture Vrijmoet writes, "The collapse of the emotional and physical boundaries inherent to the human experience is a recurrent theme in my work. [...] my work directly engages participants communally, even as it remains distinctly personal to each audience member. Although initiated by a single creator, audience participation is fundamental to making my work come to life."

In the catalog essay of her CoCA solo exhibit, "Essential Gestures", Elatia Harris writes of her work, "Any single image from the ''Accident'' series will freeze you where you stand. Motionlessly, you check yourself for parts and think, ''Oh, that's the thing, the thing that happened to me, even if no one sees it''. The Water paintings, on the other hand, will dislocate you – you are pulled, plunged and buoyed, seeing up and through and down."&lt;ref name="CoCABook10"/&gt; Maine writer and art critic, Dan Kany, writes Vrijmoet's work takes a "supremely anti-modernist stance – following the idea that [[Modernism]] doesn't privilege the artist/author over the viewer."&lt;ref name="CoCABook10"/&gt; A show of her ''Accident'' Series Paintings was exhibited in 2013 at [[Columbia Basin College]]'s Esvelt Gallery in [[Eastern Washington]].

In 2014 she published an article The Broader Economic Impact of Donating Your Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katevrijmoet.com/blog/broader-economic-implications-donating-your-art/|title=The broader economic implications of donating your art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that went viral on social media outlets and was viewed more than 2 million times across the globe.&lt;ref name="The broader economic impact of donating your art"&gt;Kate Vrijmoet (March 2014)' Omphaloskepsis&lt;/ref&gt; This article continues to inspire dialog surrounding fundraising in the arts.

In 2015 Vrijmoet participated in The [[Richard Siken]] Project, in which 11 artists respond to The War of the Foxes, through [[Copper Canyon Press]].

'''Lars Endel Roger Vilks Lanat'''  (born 20 June 1946) is a Swedish [[artist]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], and [[activist]] who garnered fame for his drawings of [[Muhammad]], which resulted in at least two failed attempts by Islamic extremists to murder him. He is also known for his sculptures, ''Nimis'' and ''Arx'', made entirely of driftwood, and the small area where the sculptures are located which was proclaimed by Vilks as an independent country, "[[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]]".

==Early life and academic career==
Vilks was born in [[Helsingborg]], Sweden, to a [[Latvia]]n father and a Swedish mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novelart.org/vilks.html Lars Vilks profile], NovelArt.org; accessed 14 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral degree]] in [[art history]] from [[Lund University]] in 1987, and worked at the [[Oslo National Academy of the Arts]] from 1988 to 1997. From 1997 to 2003, he was a [[professor]] in [[art theory]] at the [[Bergen National Academy of the Arts]]. As an art theorist, Vilks is a proponent of the [[institutional theory of art]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Artistic career==
Although an academically trained art theorist, Vilks is a self-taught artist. In the 1970s, he started painting, and in 1984, he embarked on creating the idiosyncratic [[sculpture]]s that have been his hallmark, starting with ''Nimis''. At this time, in the early 1980s, [[postmodernism]] made its definite entry into the Swedish art scene, using inspiration from e.g. the French art philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. [[Conceptual art]]ists took the place of the earlier [[Modernism|modernist]]s on the contemporary art scene. These conceptual artists did not want their art to have any aesthetic or programmatic content, but often focused on the artist's self. Vilks was part of this movement in Sweden. He turned himself in as a piece of art to the spring saloon at [[:sv:Vikingsberg|Vikingsberg, Helsingborg]], and turned his own car into a piece of art at the fall exhibition at [[Skånes konstförening]].&lt;ref name="SvD 100627"&gt;[http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/vikten-av-att-vara-vilks_4918471.svd Vikten av att vara Vilks "The importance of being Vilks"], ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 27 June 2010 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nimis'' and ''Arx''===
[[Image:Nimis torn 2002.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Nimis. Wood sculptures by Vilks at [[Kullaberg]].]]
{{see also|Ladonia (micronation)}}
In 1980 Vilks created two wooden sculptures, ''Nimis'' and ''Arx'', made entirely of drift wood, now located in the [[Kullaberg|Kullaberg nature reserve]] in [[Höganäs Municipality|Höganäs, Skåne]]. In 1996, the small area where the sculptures are located was proclaimed by Vilks as an independent country, "[[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]]". ''Nimis'' was sold to [[Joseph Beuys]] as a means to circumvent the Swedish building code laws concerning unlawful building process. The sculpture of Nimis is now owned by concept artist [[Christo]]; the legal document documenting the sale is on display at the [[Museum of Sketches for Public Art|Swedish Museum of Sketches]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Critical reception and media attention===
Vilks has characterized his own skill in the actual crafts involved in sculpture as quite limited, and although his artistic ideas can be seen as characteristic for his generation of Swedish conceptual artists. One of the few works of Vilks to be incorporated into a collection is the concrete sculpture ''[[Omphalos (sculpture)|Omphalos]]'', measuring 1.6 meters high and weighing one tonne, which is owned by [[Moderna Museet]] after it was first bought by fellow artist [[Ernst Billgren]] for 10 000 Swedish kronor.&lt;ref name="SvD 100627"/&gt;

Vilks' long-standing controversies with different authorities due to his activities in the nature reserve Kullaberg, where ''Nimis'', ''Arx'' and ''Landonien'' are all located, receive significant attention in Swedish media, which has mostly portrayed Vilks' work as specifically designed to be provocative. This attention has turned the area into something of a tourist attraction. In Vilks' activity as an art theorist, he comments on his own artistic activities in the second or third person. His different works of art, his actions, actions by those authorities with whom Vilks has been in conflict, and the media attention, are brought together in a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]''.&lt;ref name="SvD 100627"/&gt; He has described himself as an "equal opportunity offender" in his critical depictions of religion.

==Muhammad drawings controversy==
{{Main|Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy}}
In 2007, Vilks caused an international controversy when he depicted  [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]] in three drawings, designated to be shown at an art exhibition at Tällerud, in July of the same year. Shortly before its opening, the organizers cancelled their invitation with reference to serious security concerns, and despite Vilks' effort no other Swedish art gallery offered to exhibit his drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bosse|last=Brink|title=Teckningar på Muhammed togs bort|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_16316985.asp|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|date=21 July 2007|accessdate=27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, on 18 August, one of his drawings was published in the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper, ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'', as part of an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news

Following this controversy, Vilks has been forced to live under police protection after having received several death threats, including a statement by the [[al-Qaeda]]-affiliated [[Islamic State of Iraq]] which has offered up to $150,000 for his [[assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Scherlund |title=Lars Vilks hotad till livet |url=http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |publisher=[[TV4Nyheterna]] |language=Swedish |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902105232/http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |archivedate= 2 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vilks to get police protection|url=http://www.thelocal.se/8507/20070916|publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]]|date=16 September 2007|accessdate=16 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bounty set over Prophet cartoon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6996553.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=15 September 2007|accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination plot===
In 2009, a failed plot to kill Vilks was hatched. Three U.S. citizens, [[Colleen LaRose]] (known as "[[Jihad Jane]]"), Mohammad Hassas Khalid, and Jamie Paulin Ramirez, participated in the plot. On 9 March 2010, LaRose's federal indictment was unsealed charging her with trying to recruit [[Muslim]]s to murder Vilks.&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{cite news|title=American Colleen LaRose Called Herself Jihad Jane|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/TheLaw/colleen-larose-jihad-jane-indicted-charges-helping-terrorists/story?id=10055608|publisher=''[[ABC News]]''|date=9 May 2010|accessdate=6 January 2014|author=Emily Friedman|author2=Jason Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jihad Jane arrested|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/06/22202049-jihad-jane-gets-10-year-sentence-for-terror-plot-against-cartoonist?lite|publisher=nbcnews.com|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, seven people were arrested in the Republic of Ireland over an alleged plot to assassinate Vilks.

===Violent attacks===
On 11 May 2010, Muslim protesters assaulted Vilks while he was giving a lecture about [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] at [[Uppsala University]]. The attacks started when a film about Islam and homosexuality (the video depicts images of topless men, including one brief image of two fully clothed men kissing, all interspersed with Islamic imagery) was shown and some Islamists began to demand that the film be stopped, claiming it to be gay porn. The film in question was Iranian artist [[Sooreh Hera]]'s ''Allah ho Gaybar''. Vilks' eyeglasses were broken but he did not suffer any serious injuries, and was escorted to safety by security, while a few of the protesters were detained by police. Despite previous death threats, this was the first act of violence against Vilks. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A few days later, on 15 May 2010, Vilks' house in southern Sweden was attacked by arsonists.&lt;ref name=DW /&gt; They smashed the windows and threw in bottles of gasoline.&lt;ref name=DW /&gt; There was a small fire, but the house was not burned to the ground. Vilks was not at home at the time of the attack.&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite news |title=House of Swedish 'Muhammad' cartoonist attacked  |newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=2010-05-15 |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5577216,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Kosovo|Kosovar]]-Swedish brothers were arrested, and July 15 they were sentenced to two and three years, respectively, of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/27806/20100715/ |title=Brothers jailed for Vilks arson attack |publisher=[[The Local]] |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008000004/http://www.thelocal.se/27806/20100715/ |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 24 November 2010, a video produced by the [[Somalia|Somali]] Islamic organization Al-Shaabab was sent out. In the video, a Swedish speaking voice appeals to "all the Somali brothers and sisters" in Sweden, to leave that country and come to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaab. He announces a death threat against Vilks. On 11 December 2010, a [[2010 Stockholm bombings|suicide bomber in Stockholm]] said in a message to media and the Swedish Security Police that "Now will your children, daughters and sisters die the same way our brothers and sisters die. Our actions will speak for themselves. As long as you don't end your war against Islam and degradation against the prophet and your foolish support for the pig Vilks."&lt;ref name="PagesuicideBomber"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Page|first1=Jonathan|title=Sweden suicide bomber was British university graduate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/12/swedish-police-investigate-terrorist-attack|accessdate=12 July 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CentreEvacuated"&gt;{{cite news|title=Four terror suspects arrested in Sweden, Gothenburg arts centre evacuated|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/four-terror-suspects-arrested-in-sweden-as-arts-centre-in-gothenborg-is-evacuated-223391-Sep2011/|accessdate=12 July 2017|publisher=The Journal (Ireland)|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="svd"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matilda E. |last=Hanson |author2=Håkansson, Catarina |title=Man sprängde sig själv i Stockholm |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/man-sprangde-sig-sjalv-i-stockholm_5802915.svd |newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=11 December 2010 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study methodology==
A lost in the mall experiment is a [[memory implantation]] technique used to demonstrate that [[confabulation]]s about events that never took place, such as having been lost in a shopping mall as a child. It can be created through suggestions made to experimental subjects. It was first developed by Jim Coan, an undergraduate student of psychologist [[Elizabeth Loftus]] at the [[University of Washington]] as support for the claim that it is possible to implant entirely false memories in people. It was developed in the context of a debate about the existence of [[repressed memories]] and false memories (see [[False memory syndrome]]).&lt;ref&gt;Loftus EF, Coan J., Pickrell, JE. Manufacturing false memories using bits of reality. In {{cite book|editor1-last=Reder|editor1-first=Lynne M.|title=Implicit Memory and Metacognition|date=1996|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|isbn=9780805818604|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8iYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coan designed the first lost in the mall experiment as an extra-credit assignment for a course in [[cognitive psychology]]. The professor—Loftus—invited her students to design and execute an experiment implanting false memories in subjects. Coan enlisted his mother, sister and brother as subjects. He assembled booklets containing four short narratives describing childhood events, and instructed them to try to remember as much as possible about each of the four events, and to write down those details over the course of six days. Unbeknownst to the participants, one of the narratives was false; it described Coan's brother getting lost in a shopping mall at around the age of 5, then being rescued by an elderly person and reunited with his family. During the experiment, Coan's brother unwittingly invented several additional details of the false narrative. At the conclusion of the experiment during a tape-recorded debriefing when told that one of the narratives was false, Coan's brother could not identify which one was false and expressed disbelief when told.&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J.A., Lost in a Shopping Mall: An Experience with Controversial Research. ETHICS &amp; BEHAVIOR, 7(3), 271-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Coan later refined the study methodology for his senior thesis, in collaboration with Loftus and graduate student Jacqueline Pickrell.&lt;ref name="Loftus 1995 720–725"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loftus |first=E.F. |authorlink=Elizabeth Loftus |author2=Pickrell JE  |year=1995 |title=The formation of false memories |journal=Psychiatric Annals |volume=25 |url= http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/harnad/Papers/Py104/loftusmem1.pdf |format=pdf |pages=720–725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, they adapted the methods Coan had used on his brother in a formal study with 24 participants, 25% of whom reported remembering the false event. The memory for the false event was usually reported to be less clear than the true events, and people generally used more words to describe the true events than the false events. At the end of the study when the participants were told that one of the 4 events was false, some people (5 out of 24) failed to identify the lost in the mall event as the false event and instead picked one of the true events to be false. Loftus calls this study "existence proof" for the phenomenon of false memory creation and suggests that the false memory is formed as a result of the suggested event (being lost in a mall) being incorporated into already existing memories of going to the mall. With the passage of time it becomes harder for people to differentiate between what actually happened and what was imagined and they make memory errors.&lt;ref name="Loftus 1995 720–725"/&gt;

The lost in the mall experiment has been replicated and extended with different ages of subjects.&lt;ref name=pezdek1999&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pezdek |first=K |author2=Hodge, D.  |date=July–August 1999 |title=Planting false childhood memories: The role of event plausibility |journal=Child Development |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=887–895 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00064 |jstor=1132249}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 25 percent of the participants not only "remembered" the implanted memory but also filled in the missing details.&lt;ref name="Kolk191"/&gt;

==Criticism of methodology and conclusions==
The Lost in the Mall technique is generally accepted as a memory implantation study that is useful for investigating the effect of suggestions on memory. However some people have argued that this is not generalizable to memories for traumatic events. An article in the journal ''Child Development'' by Pezdek and Hodges described an extension of the experiment. By using the subjects' family members to do the interviewing, their study was able to replicate Loftus' findings that memories of being lost in the mall could be created and were more likely to occur in young children. However, a much smaller number of children reported false memories of another untrue incident: that of a painful and embarrassing [[enema]].&lt;ref name=pezdek1999/&gt; Another article by Kenneth Pope in the ''American Psychologist'' suggested possible confounding variables in the study as well as questioning whether the technique's ability to generate a false memory could be compared with the ability of a therapist to create a pseudomemory of childhood sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pope |first=K. |year=1996 |title=Memory, Abuse, and Science: Questioning Claims About the False Memory Syndrome Epidemic |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |volume=51 |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=HvMJ8y7hTLwzJKhQcXtBzn5T7hD51pStTy7SkQkzTNz51hB3Shgg!1063769811?docId=96531378 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |pmid=8819364 |issue=9 |pages=957–74 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.51.9.957}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1995, Lynn Crook who had recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, filed an ethics complaint with the American Psychological Association charging Loftus with misrepresenting Crook's successful recovered memory lawsuit in a media interview with ''Psychology Today'' ("Dispatch from the Memory War").
In an article (1999 in the Journal ''Ethics &amp; Behavior'') two women who had recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, Lynn Crook and Martha Dean, questioned Loftus' Lost in the Mall-study, arguing that the methods used were unethical and the results not generalizable to real life memories of trauma.&lt;ref name=crook1999&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crook |first=L. |year=1999 |title=Lost in a Shopping Mall—A Breach of Professional Ethics |journal=Ethics &amp; Behavior |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=39–50 |url=http://users.owt.com/crook/memory/ |accessdate=2008-01-18 |doi= 10.1207/s15327019eb0901_3 |last2=Dean |first2=Martha |pmid=11657487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus responded to Crook and Dean's criticism pointing to the exaggerations, omissions and errors in Crook and Dean's description of the technique and their mistakes about the study's representation in the media. Loftus made it clear that the Lost in the Mall study and other studies using memory implantation techniques in no way tried to claim that all memories of childhood sexual abuse discovered in therapy are false, they merely try to show how relatively easy it is to manipulate human memory. Loftus also accused Crook of writing the article as part of a long series of efforts to discredit her integrity as a researcher and her work.&lt;ref name=Loftusreply&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftus |first=E.F. |authorlink=Elizabeth Loftus |title=Lost in the Mall: Misrepresentations and Misunderstandings |journal=Ethics &amp; Behaviour |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=51–60 |url=http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall07/brunnquelld/psy8542/Session%2015/Loftus%20-Lost%20in%20the%20Mall%20-%20Misrepresentations%20and%20misubders.pdf |doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0901_4 |year=1999 |pmid=11657488 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619082741/http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall07/brunnquelld/psy8542/Session%2015/Loftus%20-Lost%20in%20the%20Mall%20-%20Misrepresentations%20and%20misubders.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Editorial |title=Dispatch from the memory war |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19960501-000001.html |journal=[[Psychology Today]] |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18023">The '''margin of appreciation''' (or ''margin of state discretion'') is a doctrine with a wide scope in [[international human rights law]]. It was developed by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], to judge whether a state party to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] should be sanctioned for [[Derogation|derogations]]. The doctrine allows the Court to reconcile practical differences in implementing the articles of the Convention. Such differences create a limited right, for Contracting Parties, "to derogate from the obligations laid down in the Convention".&lt;ref&gt;''Application No. 176/56'' (Greece v United Kingdom, "Cyprus"), 2 Yearbook of the European Convention 1958-1959, 174-199 at 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine also reinforces the role of the European Convention, as a supervisory framework for human rights. In applying this discretion, European Court judges must take into account differences between domestic laws of the Contracting States as they relate to substance and procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57584 The Sunday Times ''v United Kingdom'', no. 6538/74, § 61, ECHR 1979 A30.]&lt;/ref&gt; The margin of appreciation doctrine contains concepts that are analogous to the principle of [[Subsidiarity#General principle of European Union law|subsidiarity]], which occurs in the unrelated field of [[European Union law]]. The purpose of the margin of appreciation is to balance individual rights with national interests, as well as resolve any potential conflicts. It has been suggested that the European Court should generally refer back to the State's decision, as they are an international court instead of a bill of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023]|title=Roffee, J. A. (2014). No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and origins==
The phrase ''margin of appreciation'' is a literal translation of the French "marge d'appréciation". The latter phrase refers to a notion of administrative law that was developed by the [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'Etat]], but equivalent concepts have also emerged in every other civil jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|reason=Claim requires support and examples|date=June 2017}} At the level of the European Convention on Human Rights, a margin of appreciation refers to some "latitude of deference or error which the Strasbourg organs will allow to national legislative, executive, administrative and judicial bodies".&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Yourow, ''The Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the Dynamics of European Human Rights Jurisprudence'' (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1996) at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an intermediary norm in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. It allows for some compromise between the aspirations of the Convention and the circumstances faced by a Contracting Party. This doctrine of ''administrative'' discretion first gained national levels of prominence, most notably under the German ''[[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]]'' (or Supreme Administrative Court), before it was translated into a doctrine of ''supervisory'' discretion for a regional context.

The concept of a margin of appreciation at the European level emerged through questions surrounding martial law. It was introduced to European Convention jurisprudence in 1956. This occurred through an opinion of the [[European Commission of Human Rights]]{{mdash}}in a ''Cyprus'' case{{mdash}}to permit the United Kingdom, under [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 15 - derogations|Article 15]], to derogate from its obligations in a time of public emergency.&lt;ref&gt;P. van Dijk, et al. (ed.s) ''Theory and Practice of the European Convention on Human Rights (Fourth Edition)'' (Intersentia, Antwerpen, 2006) at 1055-1056.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the hearing for ''[[Lawless v Ireland]]'' (that is, the first formally decided case of the Court) included an oral argument from the Commission President [[Humphrey Waldock|Sir Humphrey Waldock]] that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57518 ''Lawless v Ireland'', no. 332/57, ECHR 1961 A3] (N.B. verbatim record of the hearing on 8 April). Cited in J. Christoffersen, ''Fair Balance: Proportionality, Subsidiarity and Primarity in the European Convention on Human Rights'' (Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009) at 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | "...a Government's discharge of...responsibilities [in maintaining law and order] is essentially a delicate problem of appreciating complex factors and of balancing conflicting considerations of the public interest; and that, once the...Court is satisfied that the Government's appreciation is at least on the margin of powers..., then the interest which the public itself has in effective Government and in the maintenance of order justifies and requires a decision in favour of the legality of the Government's appreciation."}}

Later, the "[[Belgian Linguistic Case (No. 2)]]" of 1968 introduced a margin of appreciation to circumstances that fell outside emergency situations that were identified by Article 15 of the European Convention. This case proved to be critical in establishing a wide scope for the emerging doctrine of discretion. It identified two key elements for establishing a margin of appreciation: a focused consensus standard among 'Convention signatory states', as well as a proportionality principle in the jurisprudence of the European Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Yourow (1996), above n 6, at 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter element consisted of two weighting factors, which are necessary to establish the extent of a particular margin. These factors are the 'nature of the right' in question, as well as 'the aim pursued by the contested measure'.&lt;ref&gt;P. Alston and R. Goodman, ''International Human Rights: Text and Materials (the Successor to International Human Rights in Context)'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013) at 946.&lt;/ref&gt; With an expansive doctrine in view, the European Court also sought to constrain itself by stating that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57525 ''Case Relating to Certain Aspects of the Laws on the Use of Languages in Education in Belgium'' ("Belgian Linguistic Case") (No. 2), no. 1474/62, 1677/62, 1691/62, 1769/63, 1994/63, 2126/64, §10, ECHR 1968 A6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | '...the Court cannot disregard those legal and factual features which characterize the life of the society in the State which...has to answer for the measure in dispute. In so doing, it cannot assume the role of the competent national authorities, for it would thereby lose sight of the subsidiary nature of the international machinery of collective enforcement established for the Convention.'}}

The margin of appreciation doctrine received considerable development in 1976, with the Court decision of ''[[Handyside v United Kingdom]]''. This concerned the publication of a Danish textbook for primary school children, in which sexual behaviour was discussed using explicit terms. It was successfully published in several signatory states, but was met with controversy in the United Kingdom. Handyside, an English publisher, was convicted for violating domestic laws on obscene publications. The case that was brought before the European Court challenged whether the United Kingdom could infringe freedom of expression, under [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 10 - expression|Article 10]], on the ground of protecting moral norms. The fact that the "Little Red Schoolbook" had been received in other European countries formed a basis for this challenge. However, the Court permitted the imposed limitation on freedom of expression and found no violation of the Convention. It held that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57499 ''Handyside v United Kingdom'', no. 5493/72, §48, ECHR 1976 A24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | '...it is not possible to find in the domestic law of the Contracting States a uniform conception of morals. The view taken by their respective laws...varies from time to time and from place to place...By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements as well as on the "necessity" of a "restriction" or "penalty" intended to meet them.'}}

With this judgment, the European Court reinforced its distinction between the supervisory jurisdiction of the Convention framework and domestic forms of discretion. However, it also affirmed that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57499 ''Ibid.'', §49.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | 'The Court...is empowered to give a final ruling on whether a "restriction" or "penalty" is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The domestic margin of appreciation thus goes hand in hand with a European supervision.'}}

In the case of Z v. Finland,{{cn|date=November 2018}} while accepting that individual interests could sometimes be outweighed by the public interest in the investigation and prosecution of crime, the Court emphasized the fundamental importance of protecting the confidentiality of medical data, for the sake of personal privacy and to preserve confidence in the medical profession and health services. It found that that measures including the disclosure of the applicant's medical records without her consent in the course of criminal proceedings against her husband amounted to a violation of Article 8.

==Scope and application==

The European Court decision in ''Handyside v United Kingdom'' framed the margin of appreciation doctrine in terms of a systemic tension in the European Convention framework. It is therefore easy to distort the concept, in a negative sense, 'to circumvent the express requirements of the Convention'.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Feingold, "The Doctrine of Margin of Appreciation and the European Convention on Human Rights" (1977-1978) 53 Notre Dame Law 90 at 105.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the official position of the Court is that a margin of appreciation must be derived from 'a just balance between the protection of the general interest of the community and the respect due to fundamental human rights while attaching particular importance to the latter.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57525 "Belgian Linguistic Case" (No. 2), above n 6, §5.]&lt;/ref&gt; This precedent illustrates some continuity between the original function of a margin of appreciation{{mdash}}as a justified derogation ''simpliciter''{{mdash}}and its present purpose of delimiting rights and freedoms for individuals in relation to state parties. Yet a clear distinction has also been made between this latter ''substantive'' purpose, which evolved over time, as well as the ''structural'' aim of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;G. Letsas, "Two Concepts of the Margin of Appreciation", ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'', 26 (2006) 4, 705-732.&lt;/ref&gt; The structural purpose for a margin of appreciation was to construct 'a geographically and cultural plural notion of implementation'.&lt;ref&gt;F. Mégret, 'Nature of Obligations'; in D. Moeckli et al., ''International Human Rights Law (Second Edition)'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014) at 104.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, the doctrine has continued to subsist in an unstructured set of elements. This is possible, because the foundation concept of a margin is essentially abstract in nature and less connected to the core purposes of the Convention{{mdash}}especially when it is compared with other interpretive principles, such as legality or the effective protection of rights.&lt;ref&gt;S. Greer, ''The European Convention on Human Rights: Achievements, Problems and Prospects'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2006) at 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

As justification for any derogation from the European Convention ultimately rests on the concept of ''democratic necessity'' in a society, margins of appreciation are situation-oriented and the case law regarding this subject frequently lacks consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Arai, "The System of Restrictions"; in P. van Dijk, et al., above n 4, at 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The expanded margin of appreciation doctrine has been used to interpret European Convention guarantees regarding due process (that is, Articles [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights|5]] and [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|6]]) and personal freedoms (that is, [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 8 - privacy|Articles 8-11]]). This infused the doctrine with a sense of ubiquity and has led to its invocation in major legal developments, including challenges surrounding [[discrimination]] as they relate to human rights.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Dudgeon v United Kingdom]]'', [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57473 no. 7525/76, ECHR 1981 A45]; [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-58922 ''ADT v United Kingdom'', no. 35765/97, ECHR 2000-IX]; and, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-60596 ''Goodwin v United Kingdom'', no. 28957/95, ECHR 2002-VI].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the doctrine has also been invoked in such varied questions as the enjoyment of possessions,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-105575 ''Stummer v Austria'', no. 37452/02, ECHR 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; the use of religious symbols &lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-104040 ''Lautsi v Italy'', no. 30814/06, ECHR 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the implementation of environmental policies and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-109072 ''Hardy &amp; Maile v United Kingdom'', no. 31965/07, ECHR 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; The margin of appreciation in each of these categories of cases has differed according to the kind of right in question; for example, where private individuals are more directly involved, less discretion is typically permitted to the discretion of state parties.&lt;ref&gt;R.K.M. Smith, ''Textbook on International Human Rights{{mdash}}Sixth Edition'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014) at 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, this criterion comes under just one of the three criteria{{mdash}}that is, the nature of the right, the aims pursued, as well as the presence or absence of a European consensus{{mdash}}that are used to determine the scope of any given margin.

The margin of appreciation doctrine has gained sufficient prominence, under an emerging principle of subsidiarity, to merit impending incorporation into the Preamble of the European Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/213.htm Protocol No. 15 amending the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (yet to be signed by all High Contracting Parties).]&lt;/ref&gt; This formal acknowledgment indicates awareness, on the part of the [[Council of Europe]], that the evolution of the Convention must include jurisprudence that justifies the application of this doctrine in so many different issues. The margin of appreciation doctrine may also expand further throughout international law.

'''Mentalization-based treatment''' ('''MBT''') is an integrative form of [[psychotherapy]], bringing together aspects of psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, systemic and ecological approaches. MBT was developed and manualised by [[Peter Fonagy]] and Anthony Bateman, designed for individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] (BPD). Some of these individuals suffer from disorganized attachment and failed to develop a robust [[mentalization]] capacity. Fonagy and Bateman define mentalization as the process by which we implicitly and explicitly interpret the actions of oneself and others as meaningful on the basis of intentional mental states. The object of treatment is that patients with BPD increase their mentalization capacity, which should improve [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] regulation, thereby reducing suicidality and self-harm, as well as strengthening interpersonal relationships.

More recently, a range of mentalization-based treatments, using the "mentalizing stance" defined in MBT but directed at children (MBT-C), families (MBT-F)&lt;ref&gt;Asen, E and Fonagy, P (2012) in: ''Handbook of Mentalizing in Mental Health Practice''. Eds: Bateman, AW and Fonagy, P. American Psychiatric Publishing inc. Washington DC, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  and adolescents (MBT-A), and for chaotic multi-problem youth, [[Adaptive mentalization-based integrative treatment|AMBIT (adaptive mentalization-based integrative treatment)]] has been under development by groups mainly gravitating around the [[Anna Freud Centre|Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families]].&lt;ref&gt;Midgley and Vrouva, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment should be distinguished from and has no connection with [[mindfulness-based stress reduction]] (MBSR) therapy developed by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]].

== Goals ==
The major goals of MBT are: (1) better behavioral control, (2) increased affect regulation, (3) more intimate and gratifying relationships and (4) the ability to pursue life goals. This is believed to be accomplished through increasing the patient's capacity for mentalization in order to stabilize the client's sense of self and to enhance stability in emotions and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors= Bateman, A.W., Fonagy, P. |year=2006 |title= Mechanism of change in mentalization based treatment of borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages= 411–430 |pmid= 16470710 |doi= 10.1002/jclp.20241|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/133787/ |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Focus of treatment ==
A distinctive feature of MBT is placing the enhancement of mentalizing itself as focus of treatment. The aim of therapy is not developing insight, but the recovery of mentalizing. Therapy examines mainly the present moment, attending to events of the past only insofar as they affect the individual in the present. Other core aspects of treatment include a stance of curiosity, partnership with the patient rather than an 'expert' type role, monitoring and regulating emotional arousal, and identifying the affect focus. Transference in classical understanding of this term is not included in the MBT model. MBT does encourage consideration of the patient-therapist relationship, but without necessarily generalizing to other relationships, past or present.

== Treatment procedure ==
MBT should be offered to patients twice per week with sessions alternating between [[group therapy]] and individual treatment. During sessions the therapist works to stimulate or nurture mentalizing. Particular techniques are employed to lower or raise emotional arousal as needed, to interrupt non-mentalizing and to foster flexibility in perspective-taking. Activation occurs through the elaboration of current [[Attachment theory|attachment]] relationships, the therapist’s encouragement and regulation of the patient’s attachment bond with the therapist and the therapist’s attempts to create attachment bonds between members of the therapy group.

== Mechanisms of change ==
The safe attachment relationship with the therapist provides a relational context in which it is safe for the patient to explore the mind of the other. Fonagy and Bateman have recently proposed that MBT (and other evidence-based therapies) works by providing ostensive cues that stimulate epistemic trust. The increase in epistemic trust, together with a persistent focus on mentalizing in therapy, appear to facilitate change by leaving people more open to learning outside of therapy, in the social interactions of their day-to-day lives. 

== Efficacy ==
Fonagy, Bateman, and colleagues have done extensive outcome research on MBT for borderline personality disorder. The first randomized, controlled trial was published in 1999, concerning MBT delivered in a partial hospital setting. The results showed real-world clinical effectiveness that compared favorably with existing treatments for BPD. A follow-up study published in 2003 demonstrated that MBT is cost-effective. Encouraging results were also found in an 18-month study, in which subjects were randomly assigned to an outpatient MBT treatment condition versus a structured clinical management (SCM) treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bateman, A.W., Fonagy, P.|title=Randomized Controlled Trial of Outpatient Mentalization-Based Treatment Versus Structured Clinical Management for Borderline Personality Disorder |journal= Am J Psychiatry |year=2009 |volume=166 |issue=12 |pages= 1355–1364 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09040539 |pmid= 19833787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bateman, A.W., Fonagy, P. |title= 8-Year Follow-Up of Patients Treated for Borderline Personality Disorder: Mentalization-Based Treatment Versus Treatment as Usual |journal=Am J Psychiatry |year=2008 |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages= 631–638 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07040636 |pmid= 18347003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bateman, A.W., Fonagy, P. |title= Treatment of borderline personality disorder with psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalization: an 18-month follow-up |journal= Am J Psychiatry |year=2001 |volume=158 |issue=11 |pages= 1932–3 |pmid= 11136631 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.1.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors= Bateman, A.W., Fonagy, P. |title= Effectiveness of partial hospitalization in the treatment of borderline personality disorder: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Am J Psychiatry |year=2001 |volume=156 |issue=10 |pages=1563–9 |pmid= 10518167 |doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1563}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting efficacy of MBT was demonstrated in an 8-year follow-up of patients from the original trial, comparing MBT versus treatment as usual. In that research, patients who had received MBT had less medication use, fewer hospitalizations and longer periods of employment compared to patients who received standard care. Replication studies have been published by other European investigators. Researchers have also demonstrated the effectiveness of MBT for adolescents as well as that of a group-only format of MBT.

In algebraic geometry, the '''moduli stack of formal group laws''' is a [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] classifying [[formal group]] laws and isomorphisms between them. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a "geometric “object" that underlies the [[chromatic homotopy theory|chromatic]] approach to the [[stable homotopy theory]], a branch of algebraic topology.

Currently, it is not known whether &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[derived stack]] or not. Hence, it is typical to work with stratifications. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; be given so that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}(R)&lt;/math&gt; consists of formal group laws over ''R'' of height exactly ''n''. They form a stratification of the moduli stack  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} \to \mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is [[faithfully flat morphism|faithfully flat]]. In fact, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} \overline{\mathbb{F}_p} / \operatorname{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}, f)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}, f)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[profinite group]] called the '''Morava stabilizer group'''. The [[Lubin–Tate theory]] describes how the strata &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^n_{\text{FG}}&lt;/math&gt; fit together.
&lt;!--This moduli stack is closely related to the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]].{{vague}}

In characteristic zero, this moduli stack is very easy to understand: the quotient stack &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}} \times_{\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}} \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;B \mathbb{G}_m&lt;/math&gt;, the [[classifying stack]] of line bundles. This can be thought of as a manifestation of the "thesis" of [[differential graded Lie algebra]]s.

'''Natural capital''' is the world's stock of [[natural resource]]s, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called [[ecosystem services]]. Two of these (clean water and fertile soil) underpin our economy and society and make human life possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is natural capital?|url=http://naturalcapitalforum.com/about/|website=naturalcapitalforum.com|publisher=World Forum on Natural Capital|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Natural Capital|url=http://www.naturalcapitalcoalition.org/why-natural-capital/natural-capital.html|website=www.naturalcapitalcoalition.org|publisher=Natural Capital Coalition|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an extension of the economic notion of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (resources which enable the production of more resources) to goods and services provided by the natural environment. For example, a well-maintained forest or river may provide an indefinitely sustainable flow of new trees or fish, whereas over-use of those resources may lead to a permanent decline in timber availability or fish stocks. Natural capital also provides people with essential services, like water catchment, erosion control and crop pollination by insects, which in turn ensure the long-term viability of other natural resources. Since the continuous supply of services from the available natural capital assets is dependent upon a healthy, functioning environment, the structure and diversity of habitats and ecosystems are important components of natural capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Natural_capital|title=Search - The Encyclopedia of Earth|website=www.eoearth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods, called 'natural capital asset checks', help decision-makers understand how changes in the current and future performance of natural capital assets will impact on human well-being and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK NEAFO Work Package 1: Natural capital asset check – Annex 4: Case studies|url=http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=dNp%2bvIjmXi4%3d&amp;tabid=82|website=uknea.unep-wcmc.org|publisher=UK National Ecosystem Assessment|accessdate=31 December 2015|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
Natural capital is one approach to [[ecosystem valuation]] which revolves around the idea, in contrast to traditional economics, that non-human life produces essential resources. Thus, ecological health is essential to the sustainability of the economy. In ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hawken|first=Paul |author2=Amory Lovins |author3=Hunter Lovins |title=Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author claims that the global economy is within a larger economy of natural resources and ecosystem services that sustain us. In order to continue to reap the benefits of our natural environment, we need to recognize the importance of natural capital within the economy. According to the authors, the "next industrial revolution" depends on the espousal of four central strategies: "the conservation of resources through more effective [[manufacturing]] processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining [[natural resources]]."&lt;ref name=nat&gt;[http://www.socialfunds.com/news/print.cgi?sfArticleId=164 Book Review: Natural Capitalism] from [http://www.socialRoth2014funds.com/ Socialfunds.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be classified as "land" distinct from traditional "capital". The historical distinction between "land" and "capital" defined “land” as naturally occurring with a fixed supply, whereas “capital”, as originally defined referred only to man-made goods. (e.g., [[Georgism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp2.htm] - ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' by [[Henry George]], Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henrygeorge.org/def2.htm|title=Economic Definitions|website=www.henrygeorge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It is however, misleading to view "land" as if its productive capacity is fixed, because natural capital can be improved or degraded by the actions of man over time (see [[Tragedy of the Commons]]). Moreover, natural capital yields benefits and goods, such as timber or food, which can be harvested by humans. These benefits are similar to those realized by owners of infrastructural capital which yields more goods, such as a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples.

The term 'natural capital' was first used in 1973 by [[E.F. Schumacher]] in his book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schumacher|first=E.F |title=Small is Beautiful:  A Study of Economics As If People Mattered|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely identified with [[Herman Daly]], [[Robert Costanza]], the [[Biosphere 2]] project, and the [[Natural Capitalism]] economic model of [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]], and [[Hunter Lovins]]. Recently, it has begun to be used by politicians, notably Ralph Nader, Paul Martin Jr., and agencies of the UK government, including its [[Natural Capital Committee]] and the London Health Observatory. All users of the term currently differentiate natural from man-made or infrastructural capital in some way. Indicators adopted by United Nations Environment Programme's [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) to measure natural biodiversity use the term in a slightly more specific way. According to the OECD, natural capital is “natural assets in their role of providing natural resource inputs and environmental services for economic production” and is “generally considered to comprise three principal categories: natural resources stocks, land, and ecosystems.”

Within the international community the basic principle is not controversial, although much uncertainty exists over how best to value different aspects of ecological health, natural capital and ecosystem services. [[Environmental full-cost accounting|Full-cost accounting]], triple bottom line, measuring well-being and other proposals for accounting reform often include suggestions to measure an "ecological deficit" or "natural deficit" alongside a social and financial deficit. It is difficult to measure such a deficit without some agreement on methods of valuation and auditing of at least the global forms of natural capital (e.g. value of air, water, soil).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Ecologists are teaming up with economists to measure and express values of the wealth of ecosystems as a way of finding solutions to the biodiversity crisis.&lt;ref name="Edwards98"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Edwards |first = P.

==Natural capital declaration==
In June 2012 a 'natural capital declaration' (NCD) was launched at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]] summit held in Brazil. An initiative of the global finance sector, it was signed by 40 [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] to 'integrate natural capital considerations into loans, equity, fixed income and insurance products, as well as in accounting, disclosure and reporting frameworks.' They worked with supporting organisations to develop tools and metrics to integrate natural capital factors into existing business structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Declaration|url=http://www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org/the-declaration/|website=www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, its four key aims are to:
*Increase understanding of business dependency on natural capital assets;
*Support development of tools to integrate natural capital considerations into the decision-making process of all financial products and services;
*Help build a global consensus on integrating natural capital into private sector accounting and decision-making;
*Encourage a consensus on [[integrated reporting]] to include natural capital as one of the key components of an organisation's success.

==Natural Capital Protocol==
In July 2016, the Natural Capital Coalition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/wp-admin/|title=Log In ‹ Natural Capital Coalition — WordPress|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; released the Natural Capital Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/|title=Natural Capital Coalition - Protocol|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol provides a standardised framework for organisations to identify, measure and value their direct and indirect impacts and dependencies on natural capital. The Protocol harmonises existing tools and methodologies, and guides organisations towards the information they need to make strategic and operational decisions that include impacts and dependencies on natural capital.

The Protocol was developed in a unique collaboration between 38 organisations who signed voluntary, pre-competitive contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/development/|title=Natural Capital Coalition - Protocol Development|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol is available on a creative commons license and is free for organisations to apply.

==Internationally agreed standard==
Environmental-economic accounts provide the conceptual framework for integrated statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy, including the impacts of the economy on the environment and the contribution of the environment to the economy. A coherent set of indicators and descriptive statistics can be derived from the accounts that inform a wide range of policies, including, but not limited to, [[green economy]]/[[green growth]], [[natural resource management]] and [[sustainable development]]. The '''System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)''' contains the internationally agreed standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables for producing internationally comparable statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy. The SEEA is a flexible system in the sense that its implementation can be adapted to countries' specific situations and priorities. Coordination of the implementation of the SEEA and on-going work on new methodological developments is managed and supervised by the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting (UNCEEA). The final, official version of the SEEA Central Framework was published in February 2014.

==Criticism==
Whilst measuring the components of natural capital in any region is a relatively straightforward process, both the task and the rationale of putting a monetary valuation on them, or on the value of the goods and services they freely give us, has proved more contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conniff|first1=Richard|title=What’s Wrong with Putting a Price on Nature?|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/ecosystem_services_whats_wrong_with_putting_a_price_on_nature/2583/|website=e360.yale.edu|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=5 January 2016|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the UK, [[The Guardian|Guardian]] columnist, [[George Monbiot]], has been critical of the work of the government's [[Natural Capital Committee]] and of other attempts to place any sort of monetary value on natural capital assets, or on the free [[ecosystem services]] they provide us with. In a speech referring to a report to government which suggested that better protection of the UK's freshwater ecosystems would yield an enhancement in aesthetic value of £700m, he derided attempts 'to compare things which cannot be directly compared'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Put a price on nature? We must stop this neoliberal road to ruin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/jul/24/price-nature-neoliberal-capital-road-ruin|accessdate=5 January 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say:
{{Quote|text=These figures, ladies and gentlemen, are marmalade. They are finely shredded, boiled to a pulp, heavily sweetened ... and still indigestible. In other words they are total gibberish.|author=G. Monbiot}}
Others have defended efforts to integrate the valuation of natural capital into local and national economic decision-making, arguing that it puts the environment on a more balanced footing when weighed against other commercial pressures, and that 'valuation' of those assets is not the same as [[monetisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paddison|first1=Laura|title=Is natural capital a 'neoliberal road to ruin'?- experts discuss|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/natural-capital-neoliberal-road-ruin-george-monbiot-experts-debate|accessdate=5 January 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital (Does putting a value on natural capital mean it will be 'sold off'?)|url=http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/natural-capital.html|website=www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org|publisher=Natural Capital Committee|accessdate=5 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113030316/http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/natural-capital.html|archivedate=13 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most visible approaches to '''peer learning''' comes out of [[cognitive psychology]], and is applied within a "mainstream" [[education]]al framework: "Peer learning is an educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals."&lt;ref name="peer-learning-book"&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum
| isbn = 0805824480
| last = O'Donnell

| title = Cognitive perspectives on peer learning

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it can be compared to the practices that go by the name [[cooperative learning]]. However, other contemporary views on peer learning relax the constraints, and position "'''peer-to-peer learning'''" as a mode of "learning for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything."&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt&gt;Jeff Brazil, May 23, 2011, [http://dmlcentral.net/blog/jeff-brazil/p2pu-learning-everyone-everyone-about-almost-anything P2PU: Learning for Everyone, by Everyone, about almost Anything]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether it takes place in a [[Formal learning|formal]] or [[Informal learning|informal]] learning context, in small groups or [[Social peer-to-peer processes|online]], peer learning manifests aspects of [[self-organization]] that are mostly absent from [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] models of teaching and learning.

==Connections with other practices==
=== Constructivism===
In his 1916 book, [[Democracy and Education]], [[John Dewey]] wrote, “Education is not an affair of 'telling' and being told, but an active and constructive process.” In a later essay, entitled "Experience and Education",&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/ndemers/colloquium/ExperiencEducationDewey.pdf Experience and Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey went into greater detail about the science of child development and developed the basic [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivist]] theory that knowledge is created through experience, rather than passed down from teacher to student through rote memorization.  Soviet psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]], who developed the concept of the [[Zone of Proximal Development]], was another proponent of constructivist learning: his book, ''Thought and Language'', provides evidence that students learn better through collaborative, meaningful problem-solving activities than through solo exercises.

The three distinguishing features of constructivist theory are claims that:&lt;ref name=akhras-and-self&gt;{{Cite book
| chapter=Modeling the process, not the product, of learning
| last=Akhras
| first=F.N.
|author2=Self, J.A.
| editor=S.P. Lajoie

| pages=3–28
| year=2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Learning occurs within a context that is itself part of what is learned
* Knowing and doing cannot be separated
* Learning is a process that is extended over time
These are clearly meaningful propositions in a social context with sustained relationships, where people work on projects or tasks that are collaborative or otherwise shared.

Educational Psychology Professor Alison King explains in "Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning"&lt;ref name=alisonking&gt;Alison King, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1477535?seq=4 Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning]&lt;/ref&gt; that peer learning exercises as simple as having students explain concepts to one another are proof of social constructivism theory at work; the act of teaching another individual demands that students “clarify, elaborate on, and otherwise reconceptualize material.” Joss Winn, Senior Lecturer in Educational Research at University of Lincoln, proposes that schools radically redefine the teacher-student relationship to fit this constructivist theory of knowledge in his December 2011 paper, "Student as Producer".&lt;ref name=winn&gt;Joss Winn, [http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2011/01/28/pedagogy-technology-and-student-as-producer/ Student as Producer]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Rogers]]' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"&lt;ref name=carlrogers&gt;[http://www.panarchy.org/rogers/learning.html Carl Rogers' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"]&lt;/ref&gt; focus on the individual’s experience of effective learning, and eventually conclude that nearly the entire traditional educational structure is at odds with this experience. Self-discovered learning in a group that designates a facilitator is the “new approach” Rogers recommends for education.

In general, peer learning may adapt [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] or [[discovery learning]] methods for the peer-to-peer context: however, peer learning typically manifests constructivist ideas in a more informal way, when [[learning]] and [[collaboration]] are simply applied to solve some real shared problem.

===Critical pedagogy===

[[Critical pedagogy]] engages students and instructors in analyzing and critiquing power structures around them. The most influential scholar in the development of this field was [[Paulo Freire]], whose book [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] described the traditional teaching framework as a “banking system” in which students are thought of as empty vessels to be filled with knowledge and concepts.  Instead, Freire advocated a more equitable relationship between teachers and students, one in which information is questioned and situated in political context, and all participants in the classroom work together to create knowledge.

Freire’s vision for dialogical education, where learning is situated within students’ lived experience, has been commonly deemed idealistic by modern educators.  Yet Paulo Blikstein, Assistant Professor of Education at Stanford University wrote in ''Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation''&lt;ref name=troy&gt;[http://www.blikstein.com/paulo/documents/books/Blikstein-TravelsInTroyWithFreire.pdf Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation]&lt;/ref&gt; that through exploratory building activities, “Not only did students become more autonomous and responsible, they learned to teach one another.”

=== Connectivism ===

[[Yochai Benkler]] explains how the now-ubiquitous computer helps us produce and process knowledge together with others in his book, [[The Wealth of Networks]]. [[George Siemens]] argues in [http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age], that technology has changed the way we learn, explaining how it tends to complicate or expose the limitations of the learning theories of the past.  In practice, the ideas of connectivism developed in and alongside the then-new social formation, "[[massive open online course]]s" or MOOCs.

[[Connectivism]] proposes that the knowledge we can access by virtue of our connections with others is just as valuable as the information carried inside our minds. The learning process, therefore, is not entirely under an individual’s control—learning can happen outside ourselves, as if we are a member of a large organization where many people are continuously updating a shared database.

Rita Kop and Adrian Hill, in their critique of connectivism,&lt;ref name=connectivism-critique&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Connectivism: Learning theory of the future or vestige of the past?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that:
: it does not seem that connectivism’s contributions to the new paradigm warrant it being treated as a separate learning theory in and of its own right.  Connectivism, however, continues to play an important role in the development and emergence of new pedagogies, where control is shifting from the tutor to an increasingly more autonomous learner.

== Perspectives of other modern theorists ==

In a joint paper, Roy Williams, Regina Karousou, and Jenny Mackness argue that educational institutions should consider "emergent learning," in which learning arises from a self-organized group interaction, as a valuable component of education in the Digital Age.  Web 2.0 puts distributed individuals into a group setting where emergent learning can occur. However, deciding how to manage emergence is important; “fail-safe” management drives activity towards pre-determined outcomes, while “safe/fail experiments” steer away from negative outcomes while leaving space open for mistakes and innovation.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{Cite journal

| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams ''et al.'' also distinguish between the term “environment” as controlled, and “ecology” as free/open.

[[Cathy Davidson]] and [[David Theo Goldberg]] write in ''The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age'' about the potential of “participatory learning,” and a new paradigm of education that is focused on mediated interactions between peers.
They argue that if institutions of higher learning could begin to value this type of learning, instead of simply trying to implement “Instructional Technology” in classrooms, they could transform old models of university education. Davidson and Goldberg introduce “Ten Principles for the Future of Learning,”  which include self-learning, horizontal structures, and open source education.  [[Peter Sloterdijk]]'s recent book "You Must Change Your Life" proposes similar ideas in the context of a "General Disciplinics" that would "counteract the atrophy of the educational system" by focusing on forms of learning that takes place through direct participation in the disciplines.&lt;ref name="Sloterdijk-change"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;156)

[[Yochai Benkler]] &amp; [[Helen Nissenbaum]] discuss implications for the realm of moral philosophy in their 2006 essay, 
"Commons-Based Peer Production and Virtue".&lt;ref name="benkler-and-nissenbaum"&gt;{{Cite journal

Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff proposed the label “paragogy” to describe a collection of “best practices of effective peer learning.”&lt;ref name=paragogy-paper&gt;Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff, [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Arided/ParagogyPaper Paragogy: Synergizing individual and organizational learning]&lt;/ref&gt; They published a short book&lt;ref name="paragogy-book"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with several papers in which they discuss five "paragogical principles" that form the core of their proposed [[Learning theory (education)#Informal and post-modern theories|learning theory]].  These were generated by rethinking [[Malcolm Knowles]] principles of [[andragogy]] for a learning context that is co-created by the learners.

==Experiments==

The learning theories and approaches described above are currently being tested in peer-learning communities around the world, often adapting [[educational technology]] to support [[informal learning]], though results in formal learning contexts exist too.  For example, [[Eric Mazur]] and colleagues report on "Ten years of experience and results" with a teaching technique they call "[[Peer Instruction]]":

: Peer Instruction engages students during class through activities that require each student to apply the core concepts being presented, and then to explain those concepts to their fellow students.&lt;ref name=mazur&gt;{{Cite journal

This approach made early use of a variant of the technique that is now known as the "[[flipped classroom]]":

: To free up class time for ConcepTests, and to prepare students better to apply the material during class, students are required to complete the reading on the topics to be covered before class.

[[P2PU|Peer 2 Peer University]], or P2PU, which was founded in 2009 by Philipp Schmidt and others, is an example from the informal learning side.  Speaking about the beginnings of P2PU, Schmidt echoes Siemens’ connectivism ideas and explains that, “The expertise is in the group. That’s the message, that everyone can bring something to the conversation.”&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt /&gt;  In numerous public talks, Schmidt argues that current educational models are "broken" (particularly on the basis of the high cost of university-level training).   He suggests that social assessment mechanisms similar to those applied in open-source software development can be applied to education.&lt;ref name="jps"&gt;{{Cite journal

Jeff Young’s article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, "When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas",&lt;ref name=young&gt;Jeff Young, Chronicle of Higher Education, [http://chronicle.com/article/When-Professors-Print-Their/1185/ When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas]&lt;/ref&gt; sparked a conversation about the necessity of formal degrees in an age when class lectures can be uploaded for free. The MIT Open Teaching initiative, for example, has since 2001 put all of its course materials online.  But [[David A. Wiley]], then Psychology Professor at Utah State, went further, signing certificates for whoever takes his class.  A similar practice has become even more visible in learning projects like [[Udacity]], [[Coursera]], and [[EdX]].  Although these projects attempt to "scale education" by distributing learning materials produced by experts (not classic examples of peer learning), they do frequently feature peer-to-peer discussions in forums or offline.&lt;ref name=anya&gt;Anya Kamenetz, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2012/06/kamenetz Who can Learn Online, And How?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications in development ==

In the forward to a book on the ''Power of peer learning'' by Jean-H. Guilmette, Maureen O'Neil, then president of Canada's International Development Research Centre, states that
: Our experience has proven that [peer learning] is an efficient way to transmit knowledge across a wide range of groups or regions. Peer learning, based on jointly generated evidence, is also an effective means to build capacity and foster scientific excellence. The body of knowledge it generates is a powerful tool for the development of evidence-based policy.&lt;ref name=power-peer&gt;{{Cite book

| publisher = IDRC, Ottawa, ON, CA
| url = http://hdl.handle.net/10625/28624
| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilmette suggests that peer learning is useful in the development context because
:It is my view that managing networks, especially those that are made up of sovereign nations, is fundamentally different from managing companies, organizations, or ministries that fall under a single authority. In essence, the dominant management approach for companies and institutions rests on cybernetics, with the view of keeping communications and accountability simple and clear. Managing methods that are successful in such a context [are] counterproductive when managing networks.

Guilmette cites Anne K. Bernard, who in a report based on extensive interviews, concludes:

: Effective networks act not simply on the basis of optimizing within constraints by attempting to force-fit predicted, linear and regulated programmes of work onto dynamic policy and client communities. Rather, they hone capacities and create mechanisms for the regular feedback and reflected analyses which are needed to deal with the ambiguity of these environments, and to adapt interactively with them.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{Cite book

==Challenges==

[[Marlene Scardamalia|Scardamalia]] and [[Carl Bereiter|Bereiter]] explain in "Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities"&lt;ref name=s-and-b&gt;Scardamalia and Bereiter, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466822 Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities]&lt;/ref&gt; that computers in the classroom have the opportunity to restructure the learning environment, but too often they are simply used to provide a digital version of a normal lesson or exam. They propose that classrooms be exchanged for “[[Knowledge building|knowledge-building communities]]” where students can use computers to connect to and create knowledge in the outside world.  However, as illustrated in citations above, this way of thinking about learning is often at odds with traditional educational praxis.

In "The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning", Kurliha, Miettinen, Nokelainen, and Tirri found a "difference in
learning outcomes based on the tools used."&lt;ref name=k-and-m&gt;J. Kurhila, M. Miettinen, P. Nokelainen, and H. Tirri, [http://cosco.hiit.fi/Articles/hiit-2004-10.pdf The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the variables at work are not well understood, and are the subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=alpine-retreat&gt;Call for participation: Workshop at the Alpine Rendez-Vous 2013 January, 28 - February, 1st 2013 [http://engaged.hnlc.org/story_comments/list/18 It's About Time: Addressing the Many Challenges of Analyzing Multi-Scale Temporal Data]&lt;/ref&gt;   Within a formal education setting, a 1994 study found that students were more responsive to feedback from a teacher than they were to [[Peer feedback#Limitations|peer feedback]].  However, another later study showed that training in assessment techniques had a positive impact on individual student performance.

A classic study&lt;ref name=garbarino&gt;{{cite journal

Although other more recent work has shown that non-monetary rewards or acknowledgement can make a difference in ''performance'' (for certain populations of peer producers),&lt;ref name=barnstar&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the exact motivations for going out of the way to teach or tutor someone else are not clearly understood. As mentioned [[Peer Learning#Connections with Constructivism|above]], learning is often just part of solving a problem, so "peer learning" and "peer teaching" would tend to happen informally when people solve problems in groups.

==Peer learning in practice==
===Research on peer learning===

Research on peer learning may involve [[participant observation]], and may itself be [[Commons-Based Peer Production|peer produced]].  Some of this research falls under the broader umbrella of [[Scholarship of Teaching and Learning]].  [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] is one obvious context in which to study peer learning, since in such settings "learning is observably and accountably embedded in collaborative activity."&lt;ref name=koschmann&gt;{{Cite journal

| title=Revising the paradigms of instructional technology
| journal=Meeting at the Crossroads: 8th Annual Conference of the Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, peer learning can play a role in settings where traditional conceptions of both "teaching" and "learning" do not apply, for instance, in [[peer review|academic peer review]], in [[organizational learning]], in development work, and in public health programmes.  Research in these areas may fall within the area of [[organizational studies|organization science]], [[science, technology and society]] (STS) or other fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13295">{{short description|Legal doctrine that political questions are nonjusticiable}}
{{US fed civ pro}}
In [[United States|American]] [[Constitutional law]], the '''political question''' doctrine is closely linked to the concept of [[justiciability]], as it comes down to a question of whether or not the [[court system]] is an appropriate forum in which to hear the case.  This is because the court system only has authority to hear and decide a legal question, not a political question.  Legal questions are deemed to be justiciable, while political questions are nonjusticiable.&lt;ref name="HuhnWilson"&gt;Huhn, Wilson R.  ''American Constitutional Law Volume 1''. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar explained:

{{Quote|The political question doctrine holds that some questions, in their nature, are fundamentally political, and not legal, and if a question is fundamentally political ... then the court will refuse to hear that case. It will claim that it doesn't have jurisdiction. And it will leave that question to some other aspect of the political process to settle out.|John E. Finn, professor of government, 2006&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs&gt;{{cite news
 |author= John E. Finn
 |title= Civil Liberties and the Bill of Rights
 |work= The Teaching Company
 |quote= Part I: Lecture 4: The Court and Constitutional Interpretation (see page 55 in the guidebook)
 |year= 2016
 |accessdate= 2013-01-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A ruling of nonjusticiability will ultimately prohibit the issue that is bringing the case before the court from being able to be heard in a court of law.  In the typical case where there is a finding of nonjusticiability due to the political question doctrine, the issue presented before the court is usually so specific that the Constitution gives all power to one of the coordinate political branches, or at the opposite end of the spectrum, the issue presented is so vague that the [[United States Constitution]] does not even consider it.  A court can only decide issues based on law.  The Constitution dictates the different legal responsibilities of each respective branch of government.  If there is an issue where the court does not have the Constitution as a guide, there are no legal criteria to use.  When there are no specific constitutional duties involved, the issue is to be decided through the democratic process.  The court will not engage in political disputes.

A constitutional dispute that requires knowledge of a non-legal character or the use of techniques not suitable for a court or explicitly assigned by the Constitution to the [[U.S. Congress]], or the [[President of the United States]], is a political question, which judges customarily refuse to address.

==Origin==
{{or section|date=November 2018}}
The doctrine has its roots in the historic [[US Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803).&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v. Madison'', 5 U.S. 137 (1803).&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, [[Chief Justice John Marshall]] drew a distinction between two different functions of the [[U.S. Secretary of State]]. Marshall stated that when the Secretary of State was performing a purely discretionary matter, such as advising the President on matters of policy, he was not held to any legally identifiable standards.  Therefore, some of the Secretary's actions are unable to be reviewed by a court of law.

The doctrine is grounded in the federal judiciary's desire to avoid inserting itself into conflicts between branches of the [[US federal government|federal government]].  It is justified by the notion that there exist some questions best resolved through the political process, voters approving or correcting the challenged action by voting for or against those involved in the decision.

==Leading authority==
The leading Supreme Court case in the area of political question doctrine is ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="Baker v. Carr 1962"&gt;''Baker v. Carr'', 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the opinion written for Baker, the Court outlined six characteristics of a political question.  These include:
*A "textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or"
*A "lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or"
*The "impossibility for a court's independent resolution without expressing a lack of respect for a coordinate branch of the government; or"
*The "impossibility of deciding the issue without an initial policy decision, which is beyond the discretion of the court; or"
*An "unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or"
*The "potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question."

==Other applications==
While this is a still rather unsettled doctrine, its application has been settled in a few decided areas.  These areas are:

=== The Guarantee Clause ===
The [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Republican government|Guarantee Clause]], Article IV, section 4, requires the federal government to "guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government". The Supreme Court has declared that this Clause does not imply any set of "judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a State's lawful government".&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v. Carr'', 369 U.S. 186, 223 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impeachment ===
Article I, section 2 of the Constitution states that the House "shall have the sole power of Impeachment", and Article I, section 3 provides that the "Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments".&lt;ref&gt;United States Constitution, Article I, Section 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Constitution placed the sole power of impeachment in two political bodies, it is qualified as a political question. As a result, neither the decision of the House to impeach nor a vote of the Senate to remove a President or any other official can be appealed to any court. &lt;ref&gt;[[Nixon v. United States]], 506 U.S. 224 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy and war===
*A court will not usually decide if a treaty has been terminated, because on that issue, "governmental action ... must be regarded as of controlling importance".&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v. Carr'', 369 U.S. 186, 212. (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Given the sensitive problems of holding a war to be illegal, most issues relating to the constitutionality of a war may well be nonjusticiable, a notable example being the 1973 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Schlesinger v. Holtzman]]''.

=== Gerrymandering ===
* In the case of ''[[Davis v. Bandemer]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;''Davis v. Bandemer'', 478 U.S. 109 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that [[gerrymandering]] cases were justiciable under the [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The precedential power of this case is still unclear; to date, the Court still struggles to determine what the [[standard of review]] in gerrymandering cases should be.&lt;ref name="HuhnWilson" /&gt;
* ''[[Vieth v. Jubelirer]]'' (2004) held claims of partisan gerrymandering nonjusticiable because a discernible and manageable standard for adjudicating them had not been established or applied since ''Davis v. Bandemer''. However, [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] stated in his concurring opinion that judicially manageable standards for gerrymandering could be developed in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Vieth v. Jubelirer'', [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 541|541]] [[United States Reports|U.S.]] 267 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Gill v. Whitford]]'' and ''[[Benisek v. Lamone]] (2017)'' were decided without taking a final stance on partisan gerrymandering.&lt;ref&gt;Liptak, Adam (June 18, 2018). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/politics/supreme-court-wisconsin-maryland-gerrymander-vote.html Supreme Court Sidesteps Decision on Partisan Gerrymandering]". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved November 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Private military contractors ===
* In the case of ''Ghane v. Mid-South'' (January 16, 2014),&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.ms.gov/Images/Opinions/CO91632.pdf Narjess Ghane, et al v. Mid-South Institute of Self Defense Shooting; JFS, LLC; John Fred Shaw; Donald Ross Sanders, Jr.; and Jim Cowan (Miss.2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; the Mississippi Supreme Court held that a wrongful death action against a [[private military company]] by the family of a deceased [[United States Navy SEAL]] could proceed under Mississippi law since the plaintiff's claims did not present a non-justiciable political question under ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="Baker v. Carr 1962"/&gt;

==Court cases==
Important cases discussing the political question doctrine:
*''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{Ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}, the origin of the phrase.
* ''[[Luther v. Borden]]'', {{ussc|48|1|1849}} – Guarantee of a republican form of government is a political question to be resolved by the President and the Congress;
* ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'', {{ussc|307|433|1939}} – Mode of amending federal Constitution is a political question;
* ''[[Colegrove v. Green]]'', {{ussc|328|549|1946}} – Apportionment of Congressional districts is a political question [Overruled by Baker v. Carr];
* ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'', {{ussc|369|186|1962}} – Apportionment of state legislatures in which the court ruled that this was not a political question;
* ''[[Powell v. McCormack]]'', {{ussc|395|486|1969}} – Congressional authority to exclude members who have met qualifications to serve is not a political question;
* ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'', {{ussc|444|996|1979}} – Presidential authority to terminate treaties is a political question;
* ''[[INS v. Chadha]]'', {{ussc|462|919|1983}} – Constitutionality of one house legislative veto is not a political question;
* ''[[Nixon v. United States]]'', {{ussc|506|224|1993}} – Senate authority to try impeachments and impeachment are political questions.

==Beyond the United States==
The political question doctrine has also had significance beyond American constitutional law. 

===International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights===

Before [[international courts]], the [[International Court of Justice]] has dealt with the doctrine in its advisory function, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has engaged with the doctrine through the margin of appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odermatt |first1=Jed |title=Patterns of avoidance: political questions before international courts |journal=International Journal of Law in Context |date=2018 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=221-236 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-law-in-context/article/patterns-of-avoidance-political-questions-before-international-courts/301DCDCA0727B014EE7DB72515C7A5CB |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Court of Justice of the European Union===
Within [[European Union law]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] has never addressed the political question doctrine in its jurisprudence explicitly, yet it has been argued that there are traces of the doctrine present in its rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=Graham |title=In Search of the Political Question Doctrine in EU Law |journal=Legal Issues of Economic Integration |date=9 November 2018 |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=329-354 |url=http://www.kluwerlawonline.com/abstract.php?area=Journals&amp;id=LEIE2018020 |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Program on Energy Efficiency in Artisanal Brick Kilns in Latin America to Mitigate Climate Change''' (EELA) is a program of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) which is implemented by Swiss contact in conjunction with its partners in nine countries in [[Latin America]]. The objective is to mitigate [[climate change]] through the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions in Latin America and to improve the quality of life of the population in the areas of intervention.

==The problem==
Artisanal brick producers in Latin America use fuel with high environmental impact in [[kiln]]s with low [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. Wood, tires and plastics, among other fuels, are used to fire bricks, contributing to air pollution and deforestation as well as increasing the causes of climate change. Despite their contribution to the construction industry and the generation of jobs, artisanal brick producers largely operate informally and are generally excluded from social, environmental and economic public policies.

==The approach==
The EELA program is focused on developing management models for artisanal brick producers, and includes activities that range from the adoption of more efficient production processes that require less fuel and emit less greenhouse gases, to the creation of new products that use less raw materials.

==EELA activities==
:* Innovation through the introduction of technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are financially viable for artisanal brick producers.
:* Working in coordination with public bodies to incorporate the artisanal brick production sector within the national climate change mitigation agenda.
:* Taking account of lessons learned within the countries, and promoting the exchange of experiences among them.

==Areas of operation==
EELA began its first phase working with 970 artisanal brick producers in seven areas located in San Juan (Argentina), Cochabamba (Bolivia), Serido (Brazil), Nemocon (Colombia), Cuenca (Ecuador), Leon (Mexico) and Cusco (Peru). In 2012, Nicaragua and Honduras joined the initiative. The experience gained in the pilot areas will serve as a basis to expand EELA’s intervention at a national level.

==Aims==
EELA hopes to reduce the GHG emissions of artisanal brick producers in the countries of operation by 30% and increase their income by 10%.

==Artisanal brick producers in San Jeronimo, Cusco, Peru==
In conjunction with the Ministry of Production, the Regional Directorate of Production and the Municipality of San Jeronimo, EELA works to promote good manufacturing practices to better employ heat as well as provide technical assistance in the following areas:
:* Mixers designed to optimize time and resources
:* Extrusion machinery to use less raw materials and diversify production
:* Fans to make kiln combustion more effective

EELA constructed a downdraft kiln that is more efficient than a traditional kiln and that is affordable for an artisanal brick producer. The kiln is being replicated by brick producers in San Jerónimo, Cuenca (Ecuador) and in Mexico.

==Challenges==
In a second phase, EELA will seek to improve the management models through the use of knowledge gained from its first phase.

The development of a market approach will be used as a strategy to incorporate artisanal brick producers in a comprehensive system and determine how to generate effective and large-scale changes on the basis of the identification of market barriers and stakeholder incentives.

EELA will try to ensure the future sustainability of its activities by adopting a facilitating role that will seek to influence the market and articulate its different stakeholders without becoming one of them. Within this context, EELA will foster the creation of conditions that will allow the artisanal brick producer access to different technological innovations while considering the dynamics of the market itself.--&gt;

==Joint effort==
EELA is supported by a group of partners that includes both public and private entities with experience in the brick sector, in each of the countries in which it operates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3784">'''Prohairesis''' ({{lang-grc|προαίρεσις}}; variously translated as "moral character", "will", "volition", "choice", "intention", or "moral choice"&lt;ref&gt;Keith Seddon, ''Epictetus' Handbook'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fundamental concept in the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy of [[Epictetus]]. It represents the choice involved in giving or withholding assent to impressions ([[Phantasia (philosophy)|phantasiai]]). The use of this Greek word was first introduced into philosophy by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain C.: "The meaning of ''Prohairesis'' in Aristotele's Ethics" in ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 114 (1984) 147-157&lt;/ref&gt; To Epictetus, it is the faculty that distinguishes human beings from all other creatures. The concept of prohairesis plays a cardinal role in the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' and in the ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Manual]]'': the terms "prohairesis", "prohairetic", and "aprohairetic" appear some 168 times.&lt;ref&gt;Cassanmagnago C.: "Il problema della ''prohairesis'' in Epitteto" in ''Rivista di Filosofia Neoscolastica'' LXIX, 232-246 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobbin R.: "''Prohairesis'' in Epictetus" in ''Ancient Philosophy'' XI, 111-135 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation by Epictetus==
According to Epictetus, nothing is properly considered either good, or bad, aside from those things that are within our own power to control, and the only thing fully in our power to control is our own volition (prohairesis) which exercises the faculty of choice that we use to judge our impressions. For example, if a person says something critical to us, that is not bad; or, if something complimentary is said, that is not good, because such things are externals and not in our power to control. By exerting the power of choice, it is possible to maintain [[equanimity]] in the face of either criticism and praise, which is a moral good. On the other hand, when people become troubled by criticism, or elated by praise, that is a moral evil because they have misjudged impressions by thinking that things not in their power (such as criticism or praise) have value, and by doing that they place a measure of control of their own life in the hands of others.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 114-5&lt;/ref&gt; 

The importance of prohairesis for Epictetus is that it exerts a power that allows people to choose how they will react to impressions rationally:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Remember that what is insulting is not the person who abuses or hits you, but the judgment that these things are insulting. So when someone irritates you, realize that it is your own opinion that has irritated you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be carried away by the impression; for if you once gain time and respite, you will find it easier to control yourself.&lt;ref&gt; ''The Handbook of Epictetus'' 20.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

By exerting their prohairesis (will, volition, or choice), people can choose rationally how to react to impressions. Prohairesis is the faculty that distinguishes human beings from all other creatures. Epictetus defines it as:
#a rational faculty able to use the impressions and to which all other human faculties are subordinated (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.23.6-15; II.23.20-29)
#a faculty capable of using impressions and understanding their use (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.8.4-8) 
#a self-theoretical faculty able to evaluate all other human faculties (e.g., ''Discourses'' I.1.1-13; I.17.1-3; I.20.1-6)
#a faculty impossible to be enslaved (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.10.1; I.17.21) and impossible to subordinate (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.10.1; I.17.21; IV.1.161)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">The '''purple economy''' is that part of the [[economy]] which contributes to [[sustainable development]] by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services.

“The purple economy refers to taking account of cultural aspects in economics. It designates an economy that adapts to the human diversity in globalization and that relies on the cultural dimension to give value to goods and services.”&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/jda/archives/docs_article/89661/lactualite-vue-par-jerome-gouadain-promoteur-du-concept-d---economie-mauve---.php Le Journal des Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends, one vertical and one horizontal, feed one another. In fact the growth in the cultural component attached to products is linked to each territory’s cultural vitality.

== Surge in culture ==
The context of the purple economy is that of the growing importance of culture in contemporary society. The factors involved in this include in particular:&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;Diversum, Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé, Nicole Rouvet, [http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse| “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; a global economic and political readjustment in favour of emerging countries, a return to local environments (once again perceived as centres for stability), new forms of claims (following on from the collapse of the great ideologies), growing social demand for quality based on cultural consumption patterns (which go hand in hand with the logic of popularization, individualization and longer life expectancies), innovative approaches (that presuppose a cultural state of mind and interdisciplinarity conducive to [[serendipity]]), and so on.

== Scope ==
The purple economy is multidisciplinary, in that it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. The sensory, experiential economy is one application of this.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt;

It differs from the [[Economics of the arts and literature|cultural economy]], which is sector-based.

In June 2013, the conclusions of a first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy, formed of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society. That document underscored the impact of the phenomenon of culturalization, which now affects the entire economy, with follow-on effects on employment and training. The report differentiates between ''purple jobs'' and ''purplifying professions'': the former are directly linked to the cultural environment by their very purpose (like town planners and developers), while the latter are merely caused to transform under the effect of culturalization (such as positions in human resources or in marketing and communications).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference document published in June 2017&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; mentioned various aspects of the human environment in which economics are likely to produce cultural benefits: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

== Origin ==
The term first appeared in 2011, in France, in a manifest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/05/19/l-economie-mauve-une-nouvelle-alliance-entre-culture-et-economie_1524674_3232.html Le Monde.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; published on [[Le Monde|Le Monde.fr]].

[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/Asso_diversum_10-05-2010_en.pdf Source]&lt;/ref&gt; which organized the first International Purple Economy Forum under the patronage of [[UNESCO]], the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purple-economy.org Website of the International Purple Economy Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to sustainable development ==
[[File:Sustainable economy.gif|thumb|The three components of a sustainable economy]]

The purple economy emphasizes the presence of [[externalities]]: the cultural environment from which agents draw and on which, in return, they leave their own footprints is a [[common good]]. As a result, the purple economy sees culture as an axis for [[sustainable development]].

In fact, culture has been a whole sub-section of sustainability since the beginning. [[Corporate social responsibility]] can even be said to have originated in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted by the United Nations in 1966.

This issue is just one of the different components of [[sustainable development]], alongside concerns relating to the [[natural environment]] ([[green economy]]) and to the [[social environment]] ([[social economy]]). The complementary nature of these aspects of the sustainable economy was reaffirmed in a call&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/06/30/la-reponse-au-rechauffement-est-aussi-culturelle_4664807_3232.html Le Monde Économie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By: [[Pierre Bellon]], Véronique Cayla, [[Bertrand P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3735">'''Quadray coordinates''', also known as '''tetray coordinates''' or '''Chakovian coordinates''', were Invented by Darrel Jarmusch and further developed by David Chako, Tom Ace, Kirby Urner, et al., as another take on simplicial coordinates, a coordinate system using a [[simplex]] or [[tetrahedron]] as its basis polyhedron.&lt;ref&gt;Urner, Kirby. "Teaching Object-Oriented Programming with Visual FoxPro." ''FoxPro Advisor'' (Advisor Media, March, 1999), page 48 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric definition==

The four basis vectors stem from the center of a regular tetrahedron and go to its four corners.  Their coordinate addresses are (1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0), (0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0), (0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0) and (0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1) respectively.  These may be scaled and linearly combined to span conventional ''XYZ'' space, with at least one of the four coordinates unneeded (set to zero) in any given quadrant.

The normalization scheme is somewhat unusual in keeping all coordinates non-negative.  Typical of coordinate systems of this type (a, a, a, a) is an identity vector and may be added to normalize a result.  To negate (1,0,0,0), write (&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0) then add (1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1) to get&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1).

[[File:Quadray.gif|Four basis quadrays to the corners of a regular tetrahedron]]

==Pedagogical significance==

A typical application might set the edges of the basis tetrahedron as unit, with the quadrays considered unit on some other scale.  The tetrahedron itself may also be defined as the unit of volume, although the infrastructure does not demand using this setting.

The four quadrays may be linearly combined to provide integer coordinates for the inverse tetrahedron (0,1,1,1), (1,0,1,1), (1,1,0,1), (1,1,1,0), and for the cube, octahedron, rhombic dodecahedron and cuboctahedron of volumes 3, 4, 6 and 20 respectively, given the starting tetrahedron of unit volume.

For example, given A, B, C, D as (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1) respectively, the vertices of an octahedron with the same edge length and volume four would be A + B, A + C, A + D, B + C, B + D, C + D or all eight permutations of {1,1,0,0}.  The vertices of the volume 20 cuboctahedron are all 12 permutations of {2,1,1,0}.

'''Reactive transport modeling in porous media''' refers to the creation of [[computer models]] integrating [[chemical reaction]] with [[Transport phenomena|transport]] of fluids through the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. Such models predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath. Reactive transport modeling in general can refer to many other processes, including reactive flow of chemicals through tanks, reactors, or membranes; particles and species in the atmosphere; gases exiting a smokestack; and migrating magma.

== Overview ==
Reactive transport models are constructed to understand the composition of natural waters; the origin of [[Ore|economic mineral deposits]]; the formation and dissolution of rocks and [[minerals]] in geologic formations in response to injection of industrial wastes, steam, or [[carbon dioxide]]; and the generation of acidic waters and leaching of [[Heavy metals|metals]] from [[Environmental impact of mining|mine wastes]]. They are often relied upon to predict the migration of contaminant plumes; the mobility of [[radionuclide]]s in [[Deep geological repository|waste repositories]]; and the [[biodegradation]] of chemicals in [[landfill]]s. When applied to the study of contaminants in the environments, they are known as fate and transport models.&lt;ref name="GBRM"&gt;Bethke, C.M., 2008, ''Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of reactive transport modeling ==
Modern reactive transport modeling has arisen from several separate schools of thought.&lt;ref name= "Steefel, DePaolo, and Lichtner"&gt;Steefel, C.I., D.J. DePaolo, and P.C. Lichtner, 2005, Reactive transport modeling: An essential tool and a new research approach for the Earth sciences. ''Earth and Planetary Science Letters'' '''240''', 539-558&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrologists]] primarily concerned with the physical nature of mass transport assumed relatively simple reaction formulations, such as linear distribution coefficients or linear decay terms, which could be added to the [[Convection diffusion equation|advection-dispersion equation]]. By assuming linear, equilibrium [[sorption]], for example, the advection-dispersion equation can be modified by a simple [[retardation factor]] and solved [[Closed-form expression|analytically]]. Such analytical solutions are limited to relatively simple flow systems and reactions.

[[Geochemical modeling|Geochemical models]], on the other hand, have been developed to provide [[Chemical thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] descriptions of multicomponent systems without regard to transport. Reaction path models were created, for instance, to describe the sequence of chemical reactions resulting from [[chemical weathering]] or [[hydrothermal alteration]] in [[Batch reactor|batch systems]], in terms of the overall reaction progress. By adopting the reference frame of a packet of fluid and treating reaction progress as travel time (or distance along a flowpath), however, a batch reaction path model could be thought of as describing advective transport through an [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;Lichtner, P.C., 1988, The quasi-stationary state approximation to coupled mass transport and fluid-rock interaction in a porous medium. ''Geochemica et Cosmochemica Acta'' '''52''', 143-165&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated multi-component reactive transport models considered both reaction and transport.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtner, P.C., 1985, Contiuum model for simultaneous chemical reactions and mass transport in hydrothermal systems. ''Geochemica et Cosmochemica Acta'' '''49''', 779-800&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gharasoo2012"&gt;Gharasoo, M., Centler, F., Regnier, P., Harms, H., Thullner, M., 2012. A reactive transport modelling approach to simulate biogeochemical processes in pore structures with pore-scale heterogeneities. Environmental Modelling &amp; Software 30, 102-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies developed the theoretical basis of reactive transport models, and the numerical tools necessary to solve them, and applied them to problems of reactive contaminant transport&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, G.T. and V.S. Tripathi, 1989, A critical evaluation of recent developments in hydrogeochemical transport models of reactive multi-chemical components. ''Water Resources Research'' '''25''', 93-108&lt;/ref&gt; and flow through reacting hydrothermal systems.&lt;ref name = "Steefel and Lasaga"&gt;Steefel, C.I. and A.C. Lasaga, 1994, A coupled model for transport of multiple chemical species and kinetic precipitation/dissolution reactions with application to reactive flow in single phase hydrothermal systems. ''American Journal of Science'' '''294''', 529-592&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactive transport models have found increased application in recent years with improvements in the power of personal computers and [[#Software programs in common use|modeling software]].&lt;ref name = "Gharasoo2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, P.V. and C.M. Bethke, 2000, Beyond the Kd approach. ''Ground Water'' '''38''', 321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes considered in reactive transport models ==
Reactive transport models couple a large number chemical reactions with mass transport. Certain applications, such as [[geothermal energy]] production and [[ore deposit]] modeling, require the additional calculation of [[heat transfer]]. In modeling [[carbon sequestration]] and [[hydraulic fracturing]], moreover, it may be necessary to describe rock deformation resulting from mineral growth or abnormally high fluid pressure. Description of transport through the [[unsaturated zone]] and [[multiphase flow]] modeling, as applied to transport of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]; non-aqueous phase liquids ([[DNAPL]] or [[LNAPL]]); and [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] requires increasingly complex models which are prone to considerable uncertainty.

In many cases the processes simulated in reactive transport models are highly related. Mineral dissolution and precipitation, for example, can affect the [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the domain, which in turn affect the flow field and groundwater velocity. Heat transport greatly affects the [[viscosity]] of water and its ability to flow. Below are many of the physical and chemical processes which can be simulated with reactive transport models.

== Solving reactive transport models ==
Some of the simplest reactive transport problems can be solved analytically. Where equilibrium sorption is described by a linear distribution coefficient, for example, the sorbing solute's velocity is retarded relative to that of a nonreactive tracer; the relative velocities can be described with a retardation factor. Analytical solutions are exact solutions of the governing equations. 

Complex reactive transport problems are more commonly solved numerically. In this case, the governing equations are approximated so that they can be solved by computer algorithms. The governing equations, including both reaction and transport terms, can be solved simultaneously using a one-step or global implicit simulator. This technique is straightforward conceptually, but computationally very difficult.&lt;ref name ="Steefel and MacQuarrie"&gt;Steefel, C.I. and K.T.B. MacQuarrie, 1996, Approaches to modeling of reactive transport in porous media. In P.C. Lichtner, C.I. Steefel, and E.H. Oelkers (eds.), 1996, Reactive Transport in Porous Media. ''Reviews in Mineralogy'' '''34''', 85-129&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of solving all the relevant equations together, the transport and chemical reaction equations can be solved separately. [[Operator splitting]], as this technique is known, uses appropriate numerical techniques to solve the reaction and transport equations at each time step.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt; Various methods exist, including the sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA), [[Strang splitting]], and sequential iterative approach (SIA).&lt;ref name ="Steefel and MacQuarrie" /&gt; Since the reaction and transport terms are handled separately, separate programs for batch reaction and transport can be linked together. Cross-linkable [[Reentrancy (computing)|re-entrant software]] objects designed for this purpose readily enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aqueous Solutions launches ChemPlugin|url=http://www.researchpark.illinois.edu/news/aqueous-solutions-launches-chemplugin|work=Researchpark.illinois.edu|publisher=Research Park at the University of Illinois|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemplugin.org/|title=ChemPlugin.ORG|publisher=Aqueous Solutions LLC|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Reactive transport modeling requires input from numerous fields, including [[hydrology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[biogeochemistry]], [[microbiology]], [[soil physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]].&lt;ref name= "Steefel, DePaolo, and Lichtner" /&gt; The numerical formulation and solution of reactive transport problems can be especially difficult due to errors arising in the coupling process, beyond those inherent to the individual processes. Valocchi and Malmstead (1992), for example, reported on the potential errors arising from the operator splitting technique.&lt;ref&gt;Valocchi, A.J. and M. Malmstead, 1992, Accuracy of operator splitting for advection-dispersion-reaction problems. ''Water Resources Research'' '''28(5)''', 1471-1476&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the absence of numerical difficulties, the general lack of knowledge available to practitioners creates uncertainty. Field sites are typically [[heterogeneous]], both physically and chemically, and sampling is often sparse. The prevailing assumption of [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fickian]] [[Dispersive mass transfer|dispersion]] is often inadequate. [[Equilibrium constants]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetic rate laws]] for relevant reactions are often poorly known. The complexity of many processes requires expertise in one or more of the above mentioned fields. Many processes, such as long-term nuclear waste storage, cannot be experimentally verified; reactive transport problems can only attempt to predict such long-term behavior. The current descriptions of multi-phase flow and mechanical deformation processes are still being developed.

{{Mental state}}
'''Relaxation''' in [[psychology]], is the [[emotional state]] of a living being, of low tension, in which there is an absence of [[arousal]] that could come from sources such as [[anger]], [[anxiety]], or [[fear]].  According to the [[Oxford dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary (2014). Relaxation,
http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/relaxation?q=relaxation+
&lt;/ref&gt; relaxation is when the body and mind are free from tension and anxiety. Relaxation is a form of mild ecstasy coming from the frontal lobe of the brain in which the backward cortex sends signals to the frontal cortex via a mild sedative. Relaxation can be achieved through [[meditation]], [[autogenics]], and [[progressive muscle relaxation]]. Relaxation helps improve coping with [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. Stress is the leading cause of mental problems and physical problems,&lt;ref&gt;Physical health and mental health, https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/p/physical-health-and-mental-health&lt;/ref&gt; therefore feeling relaxed is beneficial for a person's health. When we are stressed, the [[sympathetic nervous system]] is activated because we are in a [[fight-or-flight response]] mode; over time, this could have negative effects on a human body.

== History ==
The idea of relaxation in psychology was popularized by Dr.Edmund Jacobson in his published book ''[[Progressive relaxation|Progressive Relaxation]]''. It was a technical book intended for doctors and scientists.  His book describes tensing and relaxing specific muscles at a time to achieve overall relaxation in the body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pagnini, F., Manzoni, G. M., Castelnuovo, G., &amp;  Molinari, E. (2013). Brief literature review about relaxation therapy and anxiety.''Body,'' Movement and Dance in Psychology, 8
&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson then published another book called ''You Must Relax ''published in 1934 that was geared towards the general public. According to Jacobson, his research started in 1908 at [[Harvard University]], and later moving on to [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|Cornell]] and [[University of Chicago]]. His research was aimed at improving the general human well being.

In 1932, [[Johannes Schultz (composer)|Johannes Schultz]] and Wolfgang Luthe developed a method of relaxation that emphasized using the power of suggestion, called [[autogenic training]].

In 1975, Herbert Benson and Mirium Z. Klipper published a book called ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'', which gives instructions on tying meditation techniques into daily activities the average person could do.&lt;ref&gt;Lettus, D. (2010) Breathe and Relax. ''Library Journal'', ''135''. pp 30-32.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relaxation techniques ==
{{main|Relaxation technique}}
Although stress levels vary across society, the fact remains that stress can be detrimental to one's health. In order to combat this stress, there have been a variety of methods developed that have been proven to reduce stress and its consequences in everyday life. The majority of techniques can be classified in to either Physical, Mental or Therapeutic techniques.

=== Physical relaxation technique ===
Breathing techniques is one of the easiest ways to reduce stress. It requires little effort and can be done anywhere at any time. Proper breathing techniques that incorporate deep abdominal breathing have been shown to reduce the physical symptoms of depression, anxiety and hypertension as well as everyday emotional symptoms of anger and nervousness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;MacGregor, H.E. (2004, Oct 17). Take a breath to relieve stress specialized breathing techniques beneficial to health, practitioners say. Journal-Gazette. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/411159521&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive muscle relaxation is a relaxation technique that requires an individual to focus on flexing and holding a certain set of muscles and then slowly relaxing those same muscles. As the individual flexes and releases those muscles from top to bottom they will feel a deep sense of relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation is a somewhat adapted version of the Jacobsonian Relaxation Technique developed in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Greenwald, D. (2012, May 24). Innovative Health: De-stress with progressive muscle relaxation technique. Alamogordo Daily News. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1015669126
&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive muscle relaxation is currently used in clinical and non-clinical settings to reduce the effects of anxiety and sleeplessness brought upon by stress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The long-term goal of this relaxation technique is to be able to identify when your body's muscles are suffering the effects of stress and to be able to relax the individual and the individuals muscles when directed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mental technique ===
[[Meditation]] has long been practiced in other regions around the world. However, it is a practice that is fairly new to North America and it is gaining attention quickly for the physical and psychological benefits it provides to your body. Studies have shown that in addition to reducing physiological and psychological stresses placed on your body, individuals who practice meditation have much fewer doctor visits for both physical and psychological illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Take a mental break (meditation can help ease stress). (1996). Benefits Canada, 20(3), 7. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/224308859
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypnosis]] relaxation therapy has recently become another technique used among healthcare professionals to promote relaxation. When performed correctly, hypnosis has the ability to put an individual in a deep state of relaxation. During this state the individual is vulnerable to suggestions stated by the person performing the hypnosis. Not only will the hypnotized individual be stress free and in a deep state of relaxation but it is thought that when the individual is out of hypnosis they will be less susceptible to the effects of stress as suggested by the person who performed the hypnosis on them. In addition to relaxation, hypnosis therapy is being used to treat a variety of conditions. Treatments for conditions using hypnosis that are currently being promoted by The [[Mayo Clinic]] are; smoking addiction therapy, pain control therapy, weight loss, coping with chemotherapy, asthma, and allergy relief.&lt;ref&gt;Carrero, M.D. (2012, Nov 13). Is hypnosis for you? Therapeutic hypnosis has been shown to help patients reduce stress, quit smoking, lose weight and more. Morning Call. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1151633865
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Therapeutic relaxation ===
[[Relaxation technique]]s used in therapy by a certified counselor or therapist could include any of the previous techniques discussed. Professionals in the fields of psychology or counseling will have the ability to administer a variety of these techniques. If they feel it is appropriate they may prescribe medication to assist the patient with relaxation. Although a number of these techniques are simple and can be performed on one's own time, patients may receive better results if they are guided by a professional who is very familiar with the techniques.

==Meditation==
[[Herbert Benson]], a professor at the medical school at [[Harvard University]], has proposed in his book ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'' a mechanism of the body that counters the [[fight-or-flight response]]. The relaxation response reduces the body’s metabolism, heart and breathing rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and calms brain activity. It increases the immune response, helps attention and decision making, and changes gene activities that are the opposite of those associated stress.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The relaxation response is achieved through meditation. Benson's meditation technique involves these four steps:
# A quiet environment to help focus
# A mental device to help keep attention constant (a sound or word said repeatedly)
# A positive attitude to avoid getting upset over failed attempts
# A comfortable position

==Autogenics==
[[Autogenics]] was invented by Dr. [[Johannes Heinrich Schultz]] in the 1920s. The process of autogenics is by relaxing muscles deeply, and by doing so, the mind follows through and relaxes as well. There as six parts to autogenics training:
# Heaviness in parts of the body (arms and legs feel heavy)
# Warmth in parts of the body (arms and legs feel warm)
# Heartbeat (heart is calm)
# Breathing (breathing is calm)
# Warmth in the abdominal area 
# Forehead is cool

==Progressive muscle relaxation==
[[Progressive muscle relaxation]] helps relax your muscles by tensing certain parts of the body (such as the neck), and then releasing the tension in order to feel the muscles relaxing. This technique helps for people with [[anxiety]] because they are always tense throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zandt|first1=Daniel|title=Deep Relaxation Meditation: Guidance &amp; Best Picks|url=http://stillmind.org/deep-relaxation-meditation/|website=Stillmind.org|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
The benefits of relaxation can be found in three main areas of an individual’s health, including; mental, physical and physiological health. Being relaxed can do positive things for someone’s health from just elevating your mood&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wachholtz, A., &amp; Pargament, K. (2005). Is Spirituality a Critical Ingredient of Meditation? Comparing the Effects of Spiritual Meditation, Secular Meditation, and Relaxation on Spiritual, Psychological, Cardiac, and Pain Outcomes. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 28(4), 369-384.
&lt;/ref&gt; to helping with insomnia.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Benson, H. (1993). The Relaxation Respone. ''Mind Body Medicine How to Use Your Mind For Better Health'', 233-25
&lt;/ref&gt; All of these things can help an individual live a happier and healthier life and may increase the longevity of one's life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are not many draw backs of relaxation. It is an easy technique to understand and follow through with. Three categories that relaxation can help with are mental, physical, and physiological.

=== Mental ===
Mental health is very important and needs to be worked on every day. Relaxation can help with many impairments that can occur in one's mental health. There is a higher mood and lower anxiety in those who practice relaxation techniques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those who are relaxed have much slower and clearer thought processes than those who are not relaxed; this can be shown on an EEG.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kenneth R. Jones &amp; Steve Heymen (1988). Using Relaxation: Coping with Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders. ''UNC Center for Functional GI &amp; Motility Disorders''.
&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known that relaxation can help reduce stress. With reducing stress, a person can help reduce the negative things that stress can do to the body.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Coping mechanisms are also improved with relaxation techniques in both mental and physical pain.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Sleep disorders are an area that can produce stress and mental health issues. Relaxation may help reduce insomnia in those who have sleeping disorders. Those with insomnia may even give up sleeping aids just by practicing relaxation techniques.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Being off of unnecessary medication or sleep aids will help health as an over all. Even though relaxation cannot get rid of chronic diseases, it may help dull of the symptoms one may have. Many cancer and AIDS patients are taught relaxation techniques.{{nonspecific|date=November 2016}}

=== Physical ===
Physical health is also something that needs to be worked on daily, whether it is exercise, healthy eating, or relaxation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; states that blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate will all decrease when one is relaxed.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} This means that a person's heart does not beat as fast and their breathing is shallow, helping one's body have time to rest. This will reduce the extra stress that these things can do to the body if they are over worked. Muscle tension will decrease.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If one's muscle tension is decreased they are not burning up extra energy that they may need later in the day. Metabolism can also decrease; this is mostly seen in hibernation and sleep and that gives the body extra time to rest and focus on other aspect that it needs to.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This could be seen as a good or bad thing, depending on the overall quality of health. People who practice relaxation have said to be able to tolerate pain better both mentally and physically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Physiological ===
In regards to the nervous system, relaxation can also play a big role. An individual will go from active and alert, which is the sympathetic, to parasympathetic which is rest and digest.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When they are relaxing, it gives the body time to catch up. A person does not need to worry about running, because they are sitting still and allowing “rest and digest”. Immune systems will increase with increased relaxation&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which is why relaxation can be seen as part of treatment for AIDS and cancer patients.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{Revolution sidebar |expanded=none}}
In political science, a '''revolution''' ([[Latin]]: ''revolutio'', "a turn around") is a fundamental and relatively sudden change in political power and political organization which occurs when the population revolt against the government, typically due to perceived oppression (political, social, economic).&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition (1999), Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds. pp. 754–46&lt;/ref&gt; In book V of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) described two types of political revolution:
# Complete change from one constitution to another
# Modification of an existing constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.5.five.html ''The Politics'' V]. Accessed 2013/4/24&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration and motivating [[ideology]]. Their results include major changes in culture, economy and [[social institution|socio]]-[[political institution]]s, usually in response to perceived overwhelming [[autocracy]] or [[plutocracy]].

Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center on several issues. Early studies of revolutions primarily analyzed events in [[European history]] from a psychological perspective, but more modern examinations include global events and incorporate perspectives from several social sciences, including [[sociology]] and [[political science]]. Several generations of scholarly thought on revolutions have generated many competing theories and contributed much to the current understanding of this complex phenomenon.

Notable revolutions during later centuries include the creation of the [[United States]] through the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775-1783), the [[French Revolution]] (1789-1799), the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 European Revolutions]], The [[Russian Revolutions]] in March and November 1917.  


==Etymology==
The word ''"revolucion"'' is known in [[French language|French]] from the 13th century, and "revolution" in [[English language|English]] by the late fourteenth century, with regard to the revolving motion of celestial bodies. "Revolution" in the sense of representing abrupt change in a [[social order]] is attested by at least 1450.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] vol Q-R p. 617 1979 Sense III states a usage "Alteration, change, mutation" from 1400 but lists it as "rare". "c. 1450, Lydg 1196 ''Secrees'' of Elementys the Revoluciuons, Chaung of tymes and Complexiouns." It's clear that the usage had been established by the early 15th century but only came into common use in the late 17th century in England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=revolution onlineetymology.com ]&lt;/ref&gt; Political usage of the term had been well established by 1688 in the description of the replacement of [[James II of England|James II]] with [[William III of Orange|William III]]. This incident was termed the ''"[[Glorious Revolution]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''[http://chagala.com/russia/pipes.htm A Concise History of the Russian Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511130014/http://chagala.com/russia/pipes.htm |date=2011-05-11 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different typologies of revolutions in social science and literature.

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] differentiated between; 
* [[political revolution]]s, sudden and violent revolutions that seek not only to establish a new political system but to transform an entire society, and; 
* slow but sweeping transformations of the entire society that take several generations to bring about (such as changes in religion).&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Boesche]], ''Tocqueville's Road Map: Methodology, Liberalism, Revolution, and Despotism'', Lexington Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7391-1665-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fLL6Bil2gtcC&amp;pg=PA86 p.86]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several different [[Marxism|Marxist]] typologies &lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} J. Topolski, "''Rewolucje w dziejach nowożytnych i najnowszych (xvii-xx wiek)''", ''Kwartalnik Historyczny'', LXXXIII, 1976, 251-67&lt;/ref&gt; divides revolutions into; 
* pre-capitalist 
* early bourgeois, 
* bourgeois, 
* bourgeois-democratic, 
* early proletarian 
* socialist

[[Charles Tilly]], a modern scholar of revolutions, differentiated between; 
* [[coup d'état]] (a top-down seizure of power) 
* [[civil war]] 
* revolt, and 
* "great revolution" (a revolution that transforms economic and social structures as well as political institutions, such as the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], or [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tilly]], ''''European Revolutions, 1492-1992'', Blackwell Publishing, 1995, {{ISBN|0-631-19903-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IJBNvCsXfnIC&amp;pg=PA16 Google Print, p.16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html Bernard Lewis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429144545/http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html |date=2007-04-29 }}, "Iran in History", Moshe Dayan Center, Tel Aviv University&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Katz]]&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p4&lt;/ref&gt; identified six forms of revolution;
* rural revolution
* urban revolution
* Coup d'état, e.g. Egypt, 1952
* revolution from above, e.g. Mao's [[Great leap forward]] of 1958
* revolution from without, e.g. the allied invasions of Italy, 1944 and Germany, 1945.
* revolution by osmosis, e.g. the gradual Islamization of several countries.

These categories are not mutually exclusive; the [[Russian revolution of 1917]] began with urban revolution to depose the Czar, followed by rural revolution, followed by the [[Bolshevik]] coup in November. Katz also cross-classified revolutions as follows;
* Central; countries, usually [[Great powers]], which play a leading role in a [[Revolutionary wave]]; e.g. the [[USSR]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[Iran]] since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aspiring revolutions, which follow the Central revolution
* subordinate or puppet revolutions
* rival revolutions, e.g. communist Yugoslavia, and China after 1969

A further dimension to Katz's typology&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p12&lt;/ref&gt; is that revolutions are either '''against''' (anti-monarchy, anti-dictatorial, anti-communist, anti-democratic) or '''for''' (pro-fascism, communism, nationalism etc.).In the latter cases, a transition period is often necessary to decide on the direction taken.

Other types of revolution, created for other typologies, include the [[social revolution]]s; [[proletarian revolution|proletarian]] or [[communist revolution]]s (inspired by the ideas of Marxism that aims to replace [[capitalism]] with [[Communism]]); failed or abortive revolutions (revolutions that fail to secure power after temporary victories or large-scale mobilization); or violent vs. [[nonviolent revolution]]s.

The term ''revolution'' has also been used to denote great changes outside the political sphere. Such revolutions are usually recognized as having transformed in society, culture, philosophy, and technology much more than [[political system]]s; they are often known as [[social revolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Irving E. Fang, ''A History of Mass Communication: Six Information Revolutions'', Focal Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-240-80254-3}}, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Some can be global, while others are limited to single countries. One of the classic examples of the usage of the word ''revolution'' in such context is the [[Industrial Revolution]], or the [[Commercial Revolution]]. Note that such revolutions also fit the "slow revolution" definition of Tocqueville.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Warwick E. ''Geographies of Globalization''. Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-31800-9}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-3Vq3aadTYC&amp;pg=PA226 p.226]&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar example is the [[Digital Revolution]].

==Political and socioeconomic revolutions==
Perhaps most often, the word "revolution" is employed to denote a change in social and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"&gt;[[Jack Goldstone]], "Theories of Revolutions: The Third Generation'', ''[[World Politics]]'' 32, 1980:425-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forantorr"&gt;[[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], "Theories of Revolution Revisited: Toward a Fourth Generation", ''[[Sociological Theory (journal)|Sociological Theory]]'' 11, 1993:1-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kroeber"&gt;Clifton B. Kroeber, "Theory and History of Revolution, ''[[Journal of World History]]'' 7.1, 1996: 21-40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Goodwin]] gives two definitions of a revolution. First, a broad one, including
&lt;blockquote&gt;any and all instances in which a state or a political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extraconstitutional and/or violent fashion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Second, a narrow one, in which

&lt;blockquote&gt;revolutions entail not only [[mass mobilization]] and [[regime change]], but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic and/or cultural change, during or soon after the struggle for state power.&lt;ref name="NOWO:9"&gt;Goodwin, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jack Goldstone]] defines a revolution as
&lt;blockquote&gt;an effort to transform the political institutions and the justifications for political authority in society, accompanied by formal or informal mass mobilization and non-institutionalized actions that undermine authorities.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"&gt;Jack Goldstone, "Towards a Fourth Generation of Revolutionary Theory", ''[[Annual Review of Political Science]]'' 4, 2001:139-87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political and socioeconomic revolutions have been studied in many [[social sciences]], particularly [[sociology]], [[political science]]s and [[history]]. Among the leading scholars in that area have been or are [[Crane Brinton]], [[Charles Brockett]], [[Farideh Farhi]], [[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], [[John Mason Hart]], [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], [[Ted Roberts Gurr]], [[Fred Halliday]], [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Tim McDaniel]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffery Paige]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Terence Ranger]], [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[James C. Scott|James Scott]], [[Eric Selbin]], [[Charles Tilly]], [[Ellen Kay Trimberger]], [[Carlos Vistas]], [[John Walton (sociologist)|John Walton]], [[Timothy Wickham-Crowley]], and [[Eric Wolf]].&lt;ref name="NOWO:5"&gt;[[Jeff Goodwin]], ''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991.'' Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of revolutions, like [[Jack Goldstone]], differentiate four current 'generations' of scholarly research dealing with revolutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt; The scholars of the first generation such as [[Gustave Le Bon]], [[Charles A. Ellwood]], or [[Pitirim Sorokin]], were mainly descriptive in their approach, and their explanations of the phenomena of revolutions was usually related to [[social psychology]], such as Le Bon's [[crowd psychology]] theory.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

Second generation theorists sought to develop detailed theories of why and when revolutions arise, grounded in more complex [[social behavior]] theories. They can be divided into three major approaches: psychological, sociological and political.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The works of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], [[Ivo K. Feierbrand]], [[Rosalind L. Feierbrand]], [[James A. Geschwender]], [[David C. Schwartz]], and [[Denton E. Morrison]] fall into the first category. They followed theories of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[frustration-aggression theory]] and saw the cause of revolution in the state of mind of the masses, and while they varied in their approach as to what exactly caused the people to revolt (e.g., modernization, recession, or discrimination), they agreed that the primary cause for revolution was the widespread frustration with socio-political situation.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The second group, composed of academics such as [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Neil Smelser]], [[Bob Jessop]], [[Mark Hart]], [[Edward A. Tiryakian]], and [[Mark Hagopian]], followed in the footsteps of [[Talcott Parsons]] and the [[structural-functionalist]] theory in sociology; they saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of a severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

Finally, the third group, which included writers such as [[Charles Tilly]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[Peter Ammann]], and [[Arthur L. Stinchcombe]] followed the path of [[political sciences]] and looked at [[pluralist theory]] and [[interest group conflict theory]]. Those theories see events as outcomes of a [[power struggle]] between competing [[advocacy group|interest groups]]. In such a model, revolutions happen when two or more groups cannot come to terms within a normal [[decision making]] process traditional for a given [[political system]], and simultaneously have enough resources to employ force in pursuing their goals.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The second generation theorists saw the development of the revolutions as a two-step process; first, some change results in the present situation being different from the past; second, the new situation creates an opportunity for a revolution to occur. In that situation, an event that in the past would not be sufficient to cause a revolution (e.g., a war, a riot, a bad harvest), now is sufficient; however, if authorities are aware of the danger, they can still prevent a revolution through reform or repression.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

Many such early studies of revolutions tended to concentrate on four classic cases: famous and uncontroversial examples that fit virtually all definitions of revolutions, such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and the [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese Revolution (also known as the Chinese Civil War)]] (1927–1949).&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt; In his ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', however, the Harvard historian [[Crane Brinton]] focused on the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', revised ed. (New York, Vintage Books, 1965). First edition, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolutions (see [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]), and differences in definitions and approaches gave rise to new definitions and explanations. The theories of the second generation have been criticized for their limited geographical scope, difficulty in empirical verification, as well as that while they may explain some particular revolutions, they did not explain why revolutions did not occur in other societies in very similar situations.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

The criticism of the second generation led to the rise of a third generation of theories, with writers such as [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffrey Paige]], and others expanding on the old [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[class conflict]] approach, turning their attention to rural agrarian-state conflicts, state conflicts with autonomous elites, and the impact of interstate economic and military competition on domestic political change Particularly Skocpol's ''[[States and Social Revolutions]]'' became one of the most widely recognized works of the third generation; Skocpol defined revolution as "rapid, basic transformations of society's state and class structures [...] accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below", attributing revolutions to a conjunction of multiple conflicts involving state, elites and the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

[[File:West and East Germans at the Brandenburg Gate in 1989.jpg|thumb|left|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and most of the events of the [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe, 1989, were sudden and peaceful.]]
From the late 1980s a new body of scholarly work began questioning the dominance of the third generation's theories. The old theories were also dealt a significant blow by new revolutionary events that could not be easily explain by them. The [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian]] and [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]s of 1979, the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] and the 1989 [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe saw multi-class coalitions topple seemingly powerful regimes amidst popular demonstrations and [[General strike|mass strikes]] in [[nonviolent revolution]]s.

Defining revolutions as mostly European violent state versus people and [[class struggle]]s conflicts was no longer sufficient. The study of revolutions thus evolved in three directions, firstly, some researchers were applying previous or updated [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories of revolutions to events beyond the previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts. Secondly, scholars called for greater attention to conscious [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] in the form of ideology and culture in shaping revolutionary mobilization and objectives. Third, analysts of both revolutions and social movements realized that those phenomena have much in common, and a new 'fourth generation' literature on contentious politics has developed that attempts to combine insights from the study of social movements and revolutions in hopes of understanding both phenomena.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

Further, social science research on revolution, primarily work in political science, has begun to move beyond individual or comparative case studies towards large-N empirical studies assessing the causes and implications of revolution. Initial studies generally rely on the Polity Project’s data on [[democratization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PolityProject|url = http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html|website = www.systemicpeace.org|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such analyses, like those by Enterline,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Regime Changes, Neighborhoods, and Interstate Conflict, 1816-1992|url = http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/42/6/804|journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 804–829|volume = 42|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/0022002798042006006|language = en|first = A. J.|last = Enterline}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeev Maoz|Maoz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Domestic sources of global change|last = Maoz|first = Zeev|publisher = University of Michigan Press|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Ann Arbor, MI|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mansfield and Snyder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electing to Fight: Why Emerging Democracies go to War|last = Mansfield|first = Edward D.|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Snyder|first2 = Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; identify revolutions based on regime changes indicated by a change in the country’s score on Polity’s autocracy to democracy scale. More recently, scholars like Jeff Colgan have argued that Polity, which measures the degree of democratic or autocratic authority in a state's governing institutions based on the openness of executive recruitment, constraints on executive authority, and political competition, is inadequate because it measures democratization, not revolution, and fails to account for regimes which come to power by revolution but fail to change the structure of the state and society sufficiently to yield a notable difference in Polity score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Revolution|url = http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/29/4/444|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|date = 2012-09-01|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 444–467|volume = 29|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0738894212449093|language = en|first = Jeff|last = Colgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Colgan offers a new data set on revolutionary leaders which identifies governments that "transform the existing social, political, and economic relationships of the state by overthrowing or rejecting the principal existing institutions of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Data - Jeff D Colgan|url = https://sites.google.com/site/jeffdcolgan/data|website = sites.google.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This most recent data set has been employed to make empirically-based contributions to the literature on revolution by identifying links between revolution and the likelihood of international disputes.

Revolutions have also been approached from anthropological perspectives. Drawing on Victor Turner’s writings on ritual and performance, [[Bjorn Thomassen]] has argued that revolutions can be understood as "liminal" moments: modern political revolutions very much resemble rituals and can therefore be studied within a process approach.&lt;ref name="Thomassen" /&gt; This would imply not only a focus on political behavior "from below", but also to recognize moments where "high and low" are relativized, made irrelevant or subverted, and where the micro and macro levels fuse together in critical conjunctions.

Economist [[Douglass North]] argued that it is much easier for revolutionaries to alter formal political institutions such as laws and constitutions than to alter informal social conventions. According to North, inconsistencies between rapidly changing formal institutions and slow-changing informal ones can inhibit effective sociopolitical change. Because of this, the long-term effect of revolutionary political restructuring is often more moderate than the ostensible short-term effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Douglass C|title=Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance|date=1992|publisher=ICS Press|location=San Francisco|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While revolutions encompass events ranging from [[Revolutions of 1989|the relatively peaceful revolutions that overthrew communist regimes]] to the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|violent Islamic revolution in Afghanistan]], they exclude ''coups d'état'', civil wars, revolts, and rebellions that make no effort to transform institutions or the justification for authority (such as [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 or the [[American Civil War]]), as well as peaceful transitions to [[democracy]] through institutional arrangements such as [[plebiscite]]s and [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]], as in [[Spain]] after the death of [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

The '''right to be heard''' (also children's participation) is a child rights principle as defined by the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. According to Article 12 of the Convention, children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them and their views have to be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. This right applies equally to children’s participation in social and political matters as well as in judicial and administrative proceedings. As a general principle, the child’s right to be heard reflects the concept of children‘s ‘agency’, viewing children not only as [[social vulnerability|vulnerable persons]] in need of special protection, but also as informed decision makers, rights holders and active members of society.&lt;ref&gt;[[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be heard from Article 12 relates closely to other articles under the Convention, which together form the so-called ‘participatory rights’ of children and underline the understanding of children as citizens who are rights holders. These articles include:
* Article 13 - the child’s right to seek, receive and impart information 
* Article 14 - freedom of thought, conscience and religion 
* Article 15 - freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Fully Revised Edition, New York, 2002, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enabling factors ==

=== Trust === 
Trust is a key element of encouraging a child to express their views. Strategies for building trust with children include: 
* Demonstrate that you care for and respect the child as a person.
* Ask the girl or boy how she or he is, how she or he feels about where they are living and their life situation, ask if there is anything she or he needs. 
* Engage in a gentle conversation with the child about day-to-day matters. 
* Show empathy and express positive feelings. Talk to the child about things that are important to the child and that interest her or him.
* Sense if the child is comfortable talking with you, reassure the child and give the child a feeling of control of what is happening. 
* Make the meeting room child-friendly. 
* Introduce yourself and explain your professional role. 
* Explain the purpose of your meeting and what the meeting is about, why you are there to talk to the child and what will happen afterwards. 
* Allocate sufficient time to speak to the child and to listen.
* Provide quality interpretation and cultural mediation wherever required. 
* Give the child time to reflect about the information you shared, to digest it and to come back for a second or third meeting, if and as required and appropriate. 
* Ask the child if she or he has understood the information and to explain what they understood, and take time to ask the questions you need to ask.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, Communicating With Children, Principles and practices to nurture, inspire, excite, educate and heal, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age-sensitive communication ===
In the cases of younger children or children with impaired cognitive skills, the child’s participation can be through drawing or play, or by observing of the child’s behaviour with family members and care staff. Adapting the language to the age and development of the child helps insure the child can understand the issues at stake and express her or his feelings and views.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, Communicating With Children, Principles and practices to nurture, inspire, excite, educate and heal, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children, Communicating with Children, Helping children in distress, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

National laws usually define age limits for children to have the right to contact social services on their own initiative, to be heard in judicial and administrative procedures, to act as a litigant or party to a case, to appeal against decisions, and to complain and seek redress. The age limits defined under national law differ among countries and, in some cases, also between the various laws applying to different groups of children and contexts. The right of younger children to be heard is often not addressed in the same way as the right of adolescents. Special measures nationally can ensure younger children are not excluded from exercising their right to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 12 (2009). UNHCR Guidelines on Child Asylum Claims.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender considerations for the right to be heard ===
For some children, the gender of the interviewer, interpreter, cultural mediator, guardian or care staff may change their willingness to express themselves. The may depend on the experiences that children have with men and women in their homes and communities, and if in [[Child migration|migration]], during their journey or in places of destination. Traditional gender roles and relations can also play a role. The [[gender identity]] of the child should be respected.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children, Communicating with Children, Helping children in distress, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enabling factors in transnational cases ==
Many children do not want to tell their story to the authorities because they fear it might not be in their interest and might lead to unwanted consequences, such as being returned. Children might have been instructed or even threatened by third persons to only tell parts of their story, and the child might not trust the police and local authorities can protect them. A reception system that respects and upholds the dignity of the child can foster a sense of trust.

== Quality interpretation and cultural mediation ==
[[Interpreters]] can influence the information gathering process in [[transnational child protection]] cases, [[Right of asylum|asylum]] procedures and criminal investigations as they affect how the child’s disclosure is being understood and perceived. Inaccurate translation might compromise the child’s statement to the effect that decisions are taken on the basis of incorrect information. This relates not only to the content translated but also to the style and semantic choices made by the child and how these are rendered by the interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, Heaven, Working with Children and Young People Subject to Immigration Control, Guidelines for best practice, Second Edition, Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to training and recruiting qualified interpreters, the following measures protect the child's right to be heard: 
* Clarify which authority is responsible for providing interpretation.
* Make the participation of an interpreter mandatory whenever a child does not master the official language of the interview.
* Avoid the use of informal interpreters, such as family members, other children, other asylum seekers or staff.
* Use telephone interpretation when a qualified and suitable interpreter is not available locally. 
* Train law enforcement officers, immigration officials and other interviewers as well as the interpreters on how to collaborate in the context of interviews with children. 
* Develop standard procedures to ensure quality and ethical standards of interpretation and confidentiality.
* Train interpreters to act also as cultural mediators.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Let’s Talk, Developing effective communication with children victims of violence and trafficking, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, The Heart of the Matter, Assessing credibility when children apply for asylum in the European Union, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 12, The right of the child to be heard, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hearing a child in investigations and proceedings ==
Child victims of crime have a right to be protected from harm and secondary victimisation during investigations and proceedings. The standards for are described in the UN Guidelines on Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/docs/2005/resolution 2005-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] and the 2011 EU Anti-Trafficking Directive.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The following protect children from harm in investigations and proceedings: 
* Repeat interviews during the investigation, prosecution and trial only when necessary. 
* Use video recorded interviews or similar to avoid the child victim or witness giving evidence in open court and to prevent visual contact between victims, witnesses and defendants. 
* Specifically trained professionals conduct the interviews with child, preferably the same person each time. 
* Conduct interviews in a child-friendly environment.

The Children’s House model  is a good practice for conducting forensic interviews and gathering evidence from child victims of crime.,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/docs/2005/resolution 2005-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] and the 2011 EU Anti-Trafficking Directive.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forensic interviews ==
Interview style and the type of questions asked affect the quality of the interview. They can influence the child’s willingness to disclose information. They can also influence the type and quality of information, and the level of detail, that the child is able and willing to share. Strategies for interviewers and interpreters to lessen this include prioritising open questions and avoiding closed and focused questions, suggestive prompts and leading questions; remaining neutral; be open and empathic; avoid criticism and confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;PROTECT 2nd Expert Meeting, Riga, May 2014, presentation by Ann-Christin Cederborg, University Stockholm.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structural abuse''' is the process by which an individual is dealt with unfairly by a system of harm in ways that the person cannot protect themselves against, cannot deal with, cannot break out of, cannot mobilise against, cannot seek justice for, cannot redress, cannot avoid, cannot reverse and cannot change.

Every system contains at least one level at which structural abuse occurs, when the actions of the system takes over the actions of individuals within that system to create structures by which abuse of others occurs.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Structural abuse should not be confused with [[structural violence]]. Structural violence refers to action committed by a larger society, such as [[racism]] or [[classism]] in an entire society. Structural abuse refers to actions that are not necessarily endorsed by the broader society.

==Classes==
There are three kinds of structural abuse:
# Imposed interference with an individual's personal space-time-energy control; 
# "Normal" interferences with an individual's ability to control relationships and their construction; 
# Missing connections that harness the physical, mental and emotional energies of a person over a protracted period, thus causing damage to both the relationship and the physical and emotional wellbeing of the person being kept waiting.

Structural abuse is indirect, and exploits the victim on an emotional, mental and psychological level. It manifests itself in specific situations within each cultural, social, corporate and family framework.

== Impacts ==

Structural abuse is also called societal abuse. It has four permanent impacts upon the individuals subjected to it:
* Cognitive abuse by which the meaning of the world is changed forever
* Sexual abuse in which a person's identity is changed for life
* Emotional abuse by which the capability to function in a human manner is impaired
* Physical abuse that is imposed upon an individual or group by a personal, social, commercial or cultural system of dominance.

An example of how surface-level structural abuses are accepted by the community is where a political journalist{{Who|date=August 2011}} in Australia presented a review of the day's work within the Australian Parliament in August 2011. During the one-minute presentation, consisting of 18 points, she began eight new points with the word "Now". "Now" is a fixation cue for viewers to forget about the past and the future, but to concentrate only on the "now" time frame. The use of the word was surplus to the data she presented, and even contradictory to it. The regularity of the word "Now", its placement at the front of each point by which the interpretation of each point is shaped, and the later repetitive use of the word by the anchor journalist steering the news program, who does not normally use such a control habit, showed that the word was a verbal dissociative cue by which hypnotic states are induced.

Other examples include:
*  Standing over another in a dominating manner;
*  Calling people unkind{{clarify|this smacks of appeal to pity and pov terminology|date=May 2014}} names;
*  Snatching belongings of another, refusing to return them immediately;
*  Being late for meetings;
*  Talking over other people, thus excluding them from participating in the discussion;
*  Touching another in a sexual manner without their verbal or body language permission;
*  Punching people on the arm as "a gesture of friendship";
*  Torturing newcomers to the organisation as a form of Rites of Passage.

'''Cues indicating a Structurally Abusive Corporate System'''

Structural Abuse Indicators include the inability of an outsider to make contact on a personal level with the people who work within an organisation. Cafe meetings turn discussions into plagiarisable events, while lack of agendas for high performance meetings create heightened levels of feeling threatened which impacts on how such meetings are approached. Being kept on hold with music blaring down the earpiece is structural abuse because by listening for the resumption of the discussion there is no escape from the sound.

'''Structurally abusive political systems'''

Making promises which are not kept is a category of political structural abuse. Unkept promises fixate the expectations that people create from such promises. Expectations that create physical arousal states and a physical, emotional, intellectual and behavioural mindset by which to accommodate the fulfillment of those promises. When those visualisations of the future and its mobilisation of personal responsiveness is not satisfied in a timely or appropriate manner the result is an extended period of physiological arousal which can turn into stress and emotional depression over time. Hence the anger responses of electorates to the unkept promises of politicians, as well as the frustrated responses of victims of abuses of court processes (e.g. "protective" orders) to the [[abuse of discretion]] exhibited by misfeasant court and law enforcement officers who can claim to be acting under authority or color of law.

'''Community Control Functions of Structural Abuse'''

All categories of structural abuse involve the manipulative control of time, energy, focus and connection between people, groups and organisations, in the service of one side, and to the disservice of the other.

Most people call structural abuse "bad manners" or "rudeness", since it generally breaks conventions by which there is mutual control within each situation.

Each instance of structural abuse breaks down the positive relationship between the two parties, creating for those being abused increasingly negative relationships built on expectations of exploitation, snatching of time, waste of effort, missing redress, and feelings of entrapment from which it is hard to escape.

'''Dealing with structural abuse'''

Structural abuse is helped by talking therapies in which those abused find a listener, and then find their voice by which to begin to remove the power of the abusing system to continue to harm their inner identities.

Currently in most countries, there is no formal [[law]] that has been formulated against structural abuse, protecting the victim from such abuse, and enabling him or her to approach the [[court]] for relevant justice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

A '''Structure Chart''' (SC) in [[software engineering]] and [[organizational theory]] is a [[chart]] which shows the breakdown of a system to its lowest manageable levels.&lt;ref name="IRT"&gt;IRS (2008) "Configuration Management" In: ''IRS Resources Part 2. Information Technology Chapter 27. Configuration Management''. Accessed at [https://www.irs.gov/ IRS.GOV] 14 Nov 2008. No longer online Nov 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in [[structured programming]] to arrange program modules into a tree. Each module is represented by a box, which contains the module's name. The tree structure visualizes the relationships between modules.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Martin (author)|James Martin]], Carma L. McClure (1988). ''Structured Techniques: The Basis for Case''. Prentice Hall. p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Sample of Hierarchy chart.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Illustration of simple hierarchy chart.|This hierarchy chart represents data passing between two modules. When the module Pay_Bill is executed, the pseudocode checks if the bill is already paid by searching for the payment receipt (execute Search_Receipt). If the receipt is not found then it will execute the module Give_Money_To_Debt_Collector to finish the job.]]

A structure chart is a [[top-down design|top-down modular design]] tool, constructed of squares representing the different modules in the [[system]], and lines that connect them. The lines represent the connection and or ownership between activities and subactivities as they are used in [[organization chart]]s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Fujita &amp; V. Gruhn (2004). ''New Trends in Software Methodologies, Tools and Techniques''. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[structured analysis]] structure charts, according to Wolber (2009), "are used to specify the high-level design, or architecture, of a [[computer program]]. As a design tool, they aid the programmer in dividing and conquering a large software problem, that is, recursively breaking a problem down into parts that are small enough to be understood by a human brain. The process is called [[top-down design]], or [[functional decomposition]]. Programmers use a structure chart to build a program in a manner similar to how an architect uses a blueprint to build a house. In the design stage, the chart is drawn and used as a way for the client and the various software designers to communicate. During the actual building of the program (implementation), the chart is continually referred to as "the master-plan".&lt;ref name="Wol"&gt;David Wolber (2009) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090219083522/http://www.usfca.edu/~wolberd/cs112/SupplementalNotes/structureChart.doc Structure Charts]:  Supplementary Notes Structure Charts and Bottom-up Implementation: Java Version. Accessed Nov 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A structure chart depicts&lt;ref name="IRT"/&gt;
* the size and complexity of the system, and
* number of readily identifiable functions and modules within each function and
* whether each identifiable function is a manageable entity or should be broken down into smaller components.

A structure chart is also used to [[diagram]] associated elements that comprise a run stream or thread. It is often developed as a [[hierarchical diagram]], but other representations are allowable. The representation must describe the breakdown of the [[configuration system]] into [[subsystem]]s and the lowest manageable level. An accurate and complete structure chart is the key to the determination of the configuration items (CI), and a visual representation of the configuration system and the internal interfaces among its CIs&lt;sup&gt;(define CI clearly)&lt;/sup&gt;. During the configuration control process, the structure chart is used to identify CIs and their associated artifacts that a proposed change may impact.&lt;ref name="IRT"/&gt;

== Structure chart construction ==
[[Image:Structure chart construction.jpg|thumb|320px|A process flow diagram describing the construction of a structure chart by a so-called Subject Matter Experts (SME).&lt;ref name="IRT"/&gt;]] According to Wolber (2009), "a structure chart can be developed starting with the creating of a structure, which places the root of an upside-down tree which forms the structure chart. The next step is to conceptualize the main sub-tasks that must be performed by the program to solve the problem. Next, the programmer focuses on each sub-task individually, and conceptualizes how each can be broken down into even smaller tasks. Eventually, the program is broken down to a point where the leaves of the tree represent simple methods that can be coded with just a few program statements".&lt;ref name= "Wol"/&gt;

In practice, see figure, first it is checked if a Structure Chart has been developed already. If so an expert needs to review it to ensure it represents the current structure and if not, updates the chart where needed..&lt;ref name="IRT"/&gt;

A '''tally stick''' (or simply '''tally'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|tally}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an ancient memory aid device used to record and document numbers, quantities, or even messages. Tally sticks first appear as animal bones carved with notches during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]; a notable example is the [[Ishango Bone]]. Historical reference is made by [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD 23–79) about the best wood to use for tallies, and by [[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324) who mentions the use of the tally in China. Tallies have been used for numerous purposes such as messaging and scheduling, and especially in financial and legal transactions, {{citation needed span|text=to the point of being [[currency]].|date=January 2018}}

==Kinds of tallies==
[[File:SAM PC 1 - Tally sticks 1 - Overview.jpg|thumb|Single and split tallies from the [[Swiss Alps]], 18th to early 20th century ([[Swiss Alpine Museum]])]]
Principally, there are two different kinds of tally sticks: the single tally and the split tally. A common form of the same kind of primitive counting device is seen in various kinds of [[prayer beads]].

===Paleolithic tally sticks===
A number of anthropological artefacts have been conjectured to be tally sticks:

*the [[Ishango bone]] is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, around 18,000 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;BC. It is a dark brown length of bone, the [[fibula]] of a baboon. It has a series of [[tally mark]]s carved in three columns running the length of the tool. It was found in 1960 in Belgian Congo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721075947/http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/%7Eschultz/3M3/history.html |date=21 July 2008 }} University of Western Australia School of Mathematics – accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Lebombo Bone]]'' is a [[baboon]]'s [[fibula]] with 29 distinct notches, discovered within the [[Border Cave]] in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] of [[Swaziland]]. 
*The so-called ''Wolf bone'' &lt;small&gt;([[:cs:Vlčí radius|cs]])&lt;/small&gt; is a prehistoric artefact discovered in 1937 in [[Czechoslovakia]] during excavations at [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Vestonice]], [[Moravia]], led by [[Karel Absolon|Karl Absolon]]. Dated to the [[Aurignacian]], approximately 30,000 years ago, the bone is marked with 55 marks which some believe to be [[tally mark]]s. The head of an ivory [[Venus figurine]] was excavated close to the bone.&lt;ref&gt;*Graham Flegg, ''Numbers: their history and meaning'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-486-42165-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beckmann|first1=Petr|title=A History of {{pi}} (PI)|date=1971|publisher=The Golem Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0-911762-12-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single tally===
The single tally stick was an elongated piece of bone, ivory, wood, or stone which is marked with a system of notches (see: [[Tally marks]]). The single tally stick serves predominantly [[mnemonic]] purposes. Related to the single tally concept are messenger sticks (e.g., Inuit tribes), the knotted cords, ''[[khipu]]s'' or ''quipus'', as used by the [[Inca]]. [[Herodotus]] (c. 485–425 BC) reported  the use of a knotted cord by [[Darius I of Persia]] (c. 521–486 BC).

===Split tally===
The split tally was a technique which became common in medieval Europe, which was constantly short of money (coins) and predominantly illiterate, in order to record bilateral exchange and debts. A stick (squared hazelwood sticks were most common) was marked with a system of notches and then split lengthwise. This way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received one half of the marked stick as proof. Later this technique was refined in various ways and became virtually tamper proof. One of the refinements was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. The longer part was called ''stock'' and was given to the party which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. The shorter portion of the stick was called ''foil'' and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, the absence of those notches would be apparent on the other party's tally stick. The split tally was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the [[Napoleonic Code]] (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333.&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 13 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the [[Danube]] and in [[Switzerland]] the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies.

====Split tally in England====

The most prominent and best recorded use of the split tally stick or "nick-stick"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|year=2003|edition=3|chapter=nick-stick|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shenton|first=Caroline|title=The Day Parliament Burned Down|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199646708|chapter=Chapter 1: Thursday 16 October 1834, 6am: Mr Hume's Motion for a New House}}&lt;/ref&gt; being used as a form of currency&lt;ref name="BBC_Radio_50_Things"&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Things That Made the Modern Economy|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p053g7qj|website=BBC Radio|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was when [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] introduced the tally stick system in medieval England in around 1100. He would accept the tally stick only for taxes, and it was a tool of the [[Exchequer]] for the collection of taxes by local sheriffs (tax farmers "farming the shire"){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} for seven centuries. The split tally of the Exchequer was in continuous use until 1826. In 1834 tally sticks representing six centuries worth of financial records were ordered to be burned in a stove in the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The resulting fire set the chimney ablaze and then spread until [[Burning of Parliament|most of the building was destroyed]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Radio_50_Things" /&gt; This event was described by [[Charles Dickens]] in an 1855 article on administrative reform.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, "Administrative Reform" (June 27, 1855) Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bT5WAAAAcAAJ Speeches literary and social by Charles Dickens]'' (1870) pp.133–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of tally marks of the Exchequer is described in ''[[Dialogue concerning the exchequer|The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer]]'' (see external links below) as follows:
{{quote|The manner of cutting is as follows. At the top of the tally a cut is made, the thickness of the palm of the hand, to represent a thousand pounds; then a hundred pounds by a cut the breadth of a thumb; twenty pounds, the breadth of the little finger; a single pound, the width of a swollen barleycorn; a shilling rather narrower; then a penny is marked by a single cut without removing any wood.|}}
The cuts were made the full width of the stick so that, after splitting, the portion kept by the issuer (the ''stock'') exactly matched the piece (the ''foil'') given as a receipt. Each stick had to have the details of the transaction written on it, in ink, to make it a valid record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clanchy|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Clanchy|title=From Memory to Written Record|year=1979|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford, England|isbn=9780631168577|page=125|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal tallies (debt of the Crown) also played a role in the formation of the [[Bank of England]] at the end of the 17th century. In 1697, the bank issued £1 million worth of stock in exchange for £800,000 worth of tallies at par and £200,000 in bank notes. This new stock was said to be "engrafted". The government promised not only to pay the Bank interest on the tallies subscribed but to redeem them over a period of years. The "engrafted" stock was then cancelled simultaneously with the redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carswell|first1=John|title=The South Sea Bubble|date=1993|publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd|location=England|isbn=978-0-86299-918-6|page=24|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tally sticks feature in the design of the entrance gates to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] at [[Kew]].

The '''timestream''' or '''time stream''' is a [[metaphor]]ical conception of [[time]] as a [[stream]], a flowing body of [[water]]. In ''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'', the term is more narrowly defined as: "the series of all events from past to future, especially when conceived of as one of many such series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=%22brave+new+words%22+time+stream&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s0mfVNv0CpGTNsCVhNgN&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brave%20new%20words%22%20time%20stream&amp;f=false |chapter= Time Stream |title= Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction |editor= Jeff Prucher |location= New York |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2007 |page= 242 |ISBN= 0195305671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timestream is the normal passage or flow of [[time]] and its historical developments, within a given dimension of reality.  The concept of the time stream, and the ability to [[Time travel|travel]] within and around it, are the fundamentals of a [[Genres, subcategories and related topics to science fiction|genre]] of [[science fiction]].

This conception has been widely used in [[mythology]] and in [[fiction]].

This analogy is useful in several ways:

* Streams flow only one way. Time moves only forward.
* Streams flow constantly. Time never stops.
* People can stand in a stream, but will be pulled along by it. People exist within time, but move with it.&lt;ref&gt;Science fiction scholar [[Paul Kincaid]] comments, "The time machine allows not movement in time (we already live in time, and a novelist has always been able to set a story in any future or past era), but transposition in time." {{cite book |author= Kincaid, Paul |chapter= Time travel |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 820 |ISBN= 0-313-32950-8 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Some [[physicist]]s and [[science fiction]] writers have speculated that time is branching—it branches into [[Multiverse|alternate universes]] (see [[many-worlds interpretation]]). Streams can converge and also diverge.

[[Science fiction]] scholar [[Andrew Sawyer]] writes, "The paradoxes of time &amp;mdash; do ''we'' move in time, or does ''it'' move by us? Does it exist or is it merely an illusion of our limited perception? &amp;mdash; are puzzles that exercise both physicists and philosophers..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Sawyer, Andy |authorlink= Andrew Sawyer |chapter= Time |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 818 |ISBN= 0-313-32950-8 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Brian Stableford]] writes of the historical and philosophical concepts of time (and using the terminology of "flow"): {{cquote|Like space, it is a basic aspect of experience; early philosophical treatments of the idea hesitated in a similar fashion over the question of whether time could be said to exist apart from the objects manifesting its effects. The manner of time's experience is, however, markedly different from that of space; time appears to 'flow' unidirectionally from the past into the future, bearing all existence with it, encapsulated in the momentary present.&lt;br /&gt;The controversy as to whether time's flow is the very essence of reality or a mere allusion was already sharp in Classical times, Heraclitus holding to the former view while Parmenides and Zeno were convinced of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stableford |first= Brian M. |chapter= Time |title= Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia |location= New York |publisher= Routledge |year= 2006 |page= 529 |ISBN= 0415974607}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== [[Science fiction]] ===

''[[The Time Stream]]'', a 1946 [[science fiction]] novel by author [[John Taine]] (pseudonym of Eric Temple Bell), is the first novel to see time as a flowing stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Chalker |first=Jack L. |authorlink=Jack L. Chalker |author2=Mark Owings |title= The Science-Fantasy Publishers: A Bibliographic History, 1923-1998 |location= Westminster, MD and Baltimore |publisher= Mirage Press, Ltd. |page=125 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Wonder Stories]]'', in four parts, from December, 1931, to March, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?11643 |author= Anon. |title= Bibliography: The Time Stream |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction scholar [[E. F. Bleiler]] described how Taine employed the metaphor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic concept is that time is a circular stream that runs eternally, with far past blending into far future. It is possible for certain individuals to enter this stream mentally and move in either direction, although this is a dangerous venture, for they may be carried away erratically by the stream. ... In San Francisco nine associates, who have been troubled by occasional memories of [the planet] Eos, band together to explore the time stream. They live out crisis moments in both times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Bleiler, Everett Franklin and Richard J. Bleiler |chapter= Story Descriptions |title= Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years: a Complete Coverage of the Genre Magazines ''Amazing'', ''Astounding'', ''Wonder'', and Others from 1926 through 1936 |location= Kent, Ohio |publisher= Kent State University Press |year= 1998 |page= 426 |ISBN= 0873386043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another mid-century novel which employed the term in its title was ''The Ship That Sailed the Time Stream'' (1965) by [[G. C. Edmondson]] (pseudonym of José Mario Garry Ordoñez Edmondson y Cotton). [[John Clute]] writes that this "and its sequel, ''To Sail the Century Sea'' (1981), are amusingly and graphically told Fantastic-Voyage tales involving a US ship and its inadvertent Time Travels. They remain his most successful books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |last1= Clute |first1= John |authorlink1=John Clute |last2=Nicholls |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Nicholls (writer) |title= Edmondson, G C |year= 2014 |edition= Rev., online |publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St Martin's Griffin]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fiction titles with the term include [[J. Robert King]]'s 1999 novel ''Time Streams'' ({{ISBN|0-7869-1344-4}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?51549 |author= Anon. |title= Publication Listing |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Moorcock]]'s 1993 collection ''[[A Nomad of the Time Streams]]'' ({{ISBN|1-85798-034-4}}), and Charles M. Saplak's short story "Backwater by the Time Stream" (''Manifest Destiny'' #1, Winter 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1046575 |author= Anon. |title= Bibliography: Backwater by the Time Stream |publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] |accessdate= December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the theme of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], in an encyclopedia article which can usefully be applied to the concept of timestreams, [[Brian Stableford]] and [[David Langford]] write, &lt;blockquote&gt;"A parallel world is another universe situated 'alongside' our own, displaced from it along a spatial fourth Dimension (parallel worlds are often referred to in sf as 'other dimensions'). Although whole universes may lie parallel in this sense, most stories focus on parallel Earths. The parallel-world idea forms a useful framework for the notion of Alternate History, and is often used in this way... &lt;br /&gt;The idea that other worlds lie parallel to our own and occasionally connect with it is one of the oldest speculative ideas in literature and legend; examples range from Fairyland to the 'astral plane' of Spiritualists and mystics. There are two basic folkloristic themes connected with the notion; in one, an ordinary human is translocated into a fantasy land where s/he undergoes adventures and may find the love and fulfilment that remain beyond reach on Earth; in the other, a communication or visitation from the other world affects the life of an individual within this world, often injuring or destroying that person. Both patterns are very evident in modern imaginative fiction, shaping whole subgenres... &lt;br /&gt;A common variant of the theme is that of a multiplicity of almost-identical worlds existing in parallel: alternate worlds in which there has been no significant change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |last1= Clute |first1= John |authorlink1=John Clute |last2=Nicholls |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Nicholls (writer) |title= Parallel Worlds |year= 2014 |edition= Rev., online |publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St Martin's Griffin]] |location=New York |quote=  |isbn=0-312-09618-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== [[Fantasy|Fantasy fiction]] ===
Rick Sutcliffe provides a definition in a brief essay on his own fiction: "The timestream is an alternate history device used in Rick Sutcliffe's fiction. It is the medium in which the various alternate earths exist, or, if one prefers, it provides the connections among them, in the manner of [[C. S. Lewis]]' [[Wood between the Worlds|wood between the worlds]] -- a place between."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arjay.bc.ca/Fiction/TimestreamInfo1.htm |author= Sutcliffe, Rick |date= 2013 |title= Timestream Index |publisher= Arjay Enterprises |accessdate= December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not discussing the timestream ''per se'', scholar [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]] discusses a related topic, that of the [[time travel|time slip]]: "Generally protagonists [return] to their starting points but a frequent device is that, after repeated timeslips, the 'traveler' chooses to remain in the other period.  Generally there is an emotional or psychological connection of some kind between the character and the earlier time &amp;mdash; most often love... Unsurprisingly, timeslips are a staple of the subgenre of romance fiction called the Paranormal Romance, exemplified by Diana Gabaldson's ''Outlander'' (1991) and its sequels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Grant, John |chapter= Timeslips |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 821 |ISBN= 0-313-32950-8 |quote= A timeslip occurs when a person inadvertently, and acausally, slides from one era into another...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of the usage of timestream:

* In [[DC Comics]], the timestream is an invisible current that flows through the [[DC Universe]]. It is used as a way for heroes like the [[Linear Men (comics)|Linear Men]], and especially [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]], to travel and correct time fluctuations from time traveling supervillains who seek to alter the correct reality. The timestream was mainly used by Waverider during ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'', [[Death of Superman]], and ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''  events.  The timestream is connected to the [[Speed Force]], so [[speedster (comics)|speedster]]s are able to tap into certain points in it in order to time travel. It is possible [[Per Degaton]], [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]], [[Vandal Savage]], [[Hourman]], [[Max Mercury]], [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]] and [[Epoch (comics)|Epoch]], has also used the same type of time stream for time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicvine.com/the-timestream/4020-55850/ |author= [[Whiskey Media#Comic Vine|Comic Vine]] |date= 2014 |title= The Timestream |publisher= CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate= December 27, 2014 |quote= In the DC Universe, the timestream is a place unaffected by time flows and a place used by the Monitors and time [travelers] in order to travel and correct time fluctuation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Legacy of Kain]] game series, the timestream's nature (as to whether or not it can be changed) plays a vital role throughout the story.
* Similarly, in ''[[Three Days to Never]]'' by [[Tim Powers]], various individuals and groups try to find and control a [[Time travel|time machine]], hoping to travel back in time, make changes to events, and thereby enter a parallel universe in which they might find themselves experiencing a happier life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Santella |first= Andrew |title= Fiction Chronicle  |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= August 20, 2006 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/books/review/20santella.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |page= Sunday Book Review |accessdate= December 27, 2014 |quote= Powers's latest genre-blending thriller (call it an occult/fantasy/espionage/existential adventure with elements of paranoid rant) concerns shadowy groups of international intriguers racing to locate a lost discovery of Albert Einstein's that could quite literally change history. ...

* In the [[Terra Nova (TV series)]], the Terra Nova settlement exists in a different timestream, so that it doesn't affect the future of 2149, from where the settlers arrive. To decide upon where (and ''where'') to start the settlement, a ''timeprobe'' is sent out from 2149 and, when it can't be traced back anywhere on Earth, they sense that it reached a different timestream and begin the settlement in that timestream.
* [[David R. Slavitt]]'s ''Walloomsac'' begins with a description of a river and the stones which it flows over; the narrator is philosophical: "What would be the subject? The water rushing by, looking the same but always different?" Later in the narrative, many lives and changes are discussed.

A '''Toy drive''' is a charity event that collects toys or money for them to be distributed to poor children.

==Overview==
This is usually for the celebration of [[Christmas]]. Volunteers are brought together to sort through toys to wrap and sort for age appropriateness. Appeals are made in shopping centers, schools, and other places for the public to purchase toys and to meet certain goals. Many charities or organizations will orchestrate a seasonal effort on top of their usual practices. Many police departments, fire departments, and military groups are involved in these efforts. One of the most important and famous toy drives is [[Toys For Tots]] which is operated by the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=51PC6-670MkC&amp;pg=PT164&amp;dq=%22toy+drive%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4TAPT7qvLaHjiAKk7pDUDQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ 365 ways to raise funds for your nonprofit], April.

The '''Transportation Equity Network (TEN)''' is a project of the [[Gamaliel Foundation]] and a [[grassroots]] organization with more than 350 [[community organizing|community organizations]] in 41 [[U.S. state|states]] in the [[United States]]. TEN's stated goal is "to create an equity-based transportation system by connecting local transportation campaigns with [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]]-based [[advocacy]]."&lt;ref name="TEN Victories"&gt;{{cite web|title=TEN Victories|url=http://transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=164&amp;Itemid=46|publisher=Transportation Equity Network|year=2010|work=TEN website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Transportation Equity Network was founded in 1997&lt;ref name="TEN Toolkit for Leaders"&gt;{{cite web|title=TEN Toolkit for Leaders|url=http://transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=156:toolkit-for-leaders-and-activists&amp;catid=65:toolkits&amp;Itemid=171|publisher=Transportation Equity Network|year=2010|work=TEN website}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Center for Community Change]] but has since been adopted as a project of the [[Gamaliel Foundation]]. TEN was founded to advocate for [[public transportation]] on a national level, to provide assistance to [[community organizations]] on the local level, and to advocate for [[public transportation]] as a [[civil rights]] issue.

==Notable actions==
In August 2005, TEN celebrated the signing of Safe Accountable Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act-A Legacy for Users ([[SAFETEA-LU]]). TEN had worked with congressional representatives from both parties to ensure that language in the bill reflected TEN's priorities. In many cases, language in the bill matched TEN's language verbatim. The adopted language allowed for construction projects. The changes pushed by TEN required public participation plans to be developed with the involvement of local residents in the metropolitan transportation planning process. Changes in the legislation required greater transparency in the planning process and set aside $1 million each year for transportation equity research. TEN's work helped secure the [[Job Access and Reverse Commute Program]] by making it a formula program with a guaranteed $700 million over six years.&lt;ref name="TEN Toolkit for Leaders"/&gt;

TEN worked in 2005 with then-Senator [[Barack Obama]] to put workforce development language into a [[federal transportation authorization bill]]. This allowed local and state officials to craft [[local hiring]] agreements to create employment and training opportunities in the transportation construction sector. One early success was in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where TEN affiliate [[Metropolitan Congregations United]] brought the [[Missouri Department of Transportation]] to the table and won an agreement that 30% of the workforce on a $500 million highway project would be low-income apprentices and that 1/2 of 1% of the project budget ($2.5 million) would go to job training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamaliel Jobs|url=http://www.gamaliel.org/OurWork/TacklingIssues/Jobs.aspx|publisher=The Gamaliel Foundation|year=2010|work=Gamaliel website}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the Missouri Model. Recently, TEN won a commitment from [[Secretary of Transportation]] [[Ray LaHood]] to encourage state Departments of Transportation to adopt TEN’s “Green Construction Careers (Missouri Model)” of workforce development nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faith Coalition IL News|url=http://www.faithcoalition-il.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=55|publisher=Faith Coalition for the Common Good|year=2010|work=Faith Coalition}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEN also recently worked with Rep. [[Russ Carnahan]] to secure language in the jobs bill that passed the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on December 17, 2009, to give transit authorities local control over spending priorities for up to 10 percent of the bill’s $8.4 billion in emergency public transit funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TWU Transit Blog|url=http://www.twu.org/international/transit|publisher=Transit Workers Union|year=2009|work=TWU Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] lifted up TEN’s “Green Construction Careers (Missouri Model)” in an open letter to President Obama.

TEN and its affiliates also pursue causes on a local level. In April 2010, TEN member [[Metropolitan Congregations United]] (MCU) and allies led a successful campaign in support of a [[ballot initiative]] to reinvest in transit in St. Louis city and [[St. Louis County, Missouri|county]]. Voters overwhelmingly supported the measure, which will provide $75 million a year to restore service cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buses Return in Force Monday|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_26cb84f4-7083-5be3-8e17-ce9a4524b638.html|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|year=2010|work=Stlouistoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bay Area|San Francisco Bay Area]], TEN affiliate GENESIS was among several [[civil rights]] groups that filed a federal civil rights complaint and successfully stopped the use of $70 million in stimulus funds for a rail project that would have violated the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BART Loses Fed Funds for Oakland Airport Tram|url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=fed1e0ec8fcc6ab96be3c641c0a60dcd|publisher=New America Media|year=2010|work=NewAmericaMedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the money will be used to avoid cuts in the region’s other transit lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Civil Rights Review Raises Governance Questions at MTC|url=http://sf.streetsblog.org/2010/08/23/federal-civil-rights-review-raises-governance-questions-at-mtc/|publisher=Streetsblog|year=2010|work=Streetsblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], TEN member [[MORE2]] secured $11 million in local transit funding over 10 years, an increase of $5 million over previous levels. In [[Minnesota]], TEN member [[ISAIAH]] successfully argued that a planned [[light rail]] line (the [[METRO (Minnesota)|METRO]] [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]]) connecting [[Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] should include three additional stops in underserved, low-income communities. Also in Minnesota, after a five-year-long intensive campaign, ISAIAH convinced [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] to dedicate $6.2 million in federal highway money over the next five years to training and apprenticeships in highway construction work to low-wage workers, people of color and women.&lt;ref name="TEN Victories"/&gt; In October 2010, TEN affiliate MORE2 successfully worked to ensure that equity requirements would be included in the new [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|TIGER II]] federal grants.&lt;ref name="Equity Victory in TIGER II Grants"&gt;{{cite web|title=Equity Victory in TIGER II Grants|url=http://www.transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=349:lahood-announces-equity-requirements-for-tiger-ii&amp;catid=63:feature&amp;Itemid=199|publisher=TEN|year=2010|work=TEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and reports==

In January 2007, TEN released a study called ''The Road to Jobs'', which used census] and other government data to the examine the employment of [[African Americans]], [[Hispanics]], and women in the construction field in 18 metropolitan areas. The study found that African-Americans, [[Latinos]] and women] are underrepresented compared to white men in every one of the 18 metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEN releases "Road to Jobs" study on the state of the nation's workforce|url=http://transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=41:ten-releases-qroad-to-jobs-study&amp;catid=64:studies&amp;Itemid=167|publisher=TEN|year=2007|work=TEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEN has since worked to incorporate workforce equity requirements into federal, state, and local transportation legislation.

In September 2008, TEN released a follow-up study called ''The Road to Good Jobs.'' The report built upon the foundation laid in ''The Road to Jobs'' but went further in examining patterns of pay and union membership in construction across the nation's top twenty-five metropolitan areas.&lt;ref name="Equity Victory in TIGER II Grants"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEN Report: Road to Good Jobs|url=http://transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79:ten-report-road-to-good-jobs&amp;catid=64:studies&amp;Itemid=167|publisher=TEN|year=2008|work=TEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, TEN and [[PolicyLink]] released a joint report entitled ''An Engine of Opportunity: A User’s Guide to Advocate for Transportation Equity in the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 Recovery Act]]''. The report was designed as guide to activists, advocates, and journalists on the distribution of billions of dollars in transportation funding. The report also highlighted the key deadlines, reporting requirements and policy targets that were still to come that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Engine of Opportunity|url=http://transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89:engine-of-opportunity&amp;catid=64:studies&amp;Itemid=167|publisher=TEN|year=2009|work=TEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2009, TEN released a study co-authored by [[Transportation for America]] on the effects of service cuts on transit systems across the country. Entitled ''Stranded at the Station: The Impact of the [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|Financial Crisis]] in Public Transportation'', the study looked at the challenges facing 25 communities across the country. Many communities were facing record levels of ridership and simultaneously dealing with crippling budget and service cuts. The authors of the study found that failures on the federal level had compounded these problems and that older Americans and members of racial minorities were disproportionately affected by the cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stranded at the Station|url=http://transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117:the-impact-of-the-financial-crisis-in-public-transportation&amp;catid=64:studies&amp;Itemid=167|publisher=TEN|year=2009|work=TEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, a major study authored by TEN entitled ''More Transit = More Jobs'' was released. The study looked at 20 metropolitan areas and the potential effects of shifting 50% of highway spending to public transit. The report concluded that such a shift would create 1,123,674 new transit jobs over a five-year period in the 20 metropolitan areas. This would mean a net gain of 180,150 jobs over five years. The study was designed to demonstrate the positive impact of spending on public transit compared to spending highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Transit = More Jobs: New Report|url=http://transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=323:more-transit-more-jobs&amp;catid=64:studies&amp;Itemid=167|year=2010|work=TEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current platform==
TEN's current stated platform centers around four issues:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Want: The TEN Platform|url=http://transportationequity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=155&amp;Itemid=29|publisher=Transportation Equity Network|year=2010|work=TEN website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Economic Growth for All Through Fair Access to Transportation-Related Jobs
::* Require that 30% of work hours for infrastructure and transportation projects be performed by low-income workers, ex-offenders, women, the homeless, and minority populations (the “Missouri Model” or “Green Construction Careers Model”).
::* Require that 1% of project budgets be used for the recruitment, training, and retention of under-represented workers in highway construction, transit, and rail projects.
::* Maximize the use of low-income apprentices and union labor.
:2. Access to Opportunity Through Increased Funding for Mass Transit
::* Shift the 80/20 imbalance in federal funding favoring highways over transit to include a significantly higher proportion of transit funding.
::* Allow public transit agencies to use federal mass transit funding for operating expenses.
:3. Accountability in Government Through Increased Community Input into Local and State Planning and Funding Processes
::* Ensure that representation of Metropolitan Planning Organizations and state Departments of Transportation reflect the diverse communities they serve, and ensure that their project goals include achieving equitable results.
:4. Sustainable Development Through Smart AND Equitable Growth
::* Develop mass transit systems both inside and outside urban centers to serve diverse communities.
::* Maximize the development of affordable housing in “transit villages.”
::* Minimize forced relocations from demolition.
::* Minimize the environmental impacts of development through ecologically friendly mass transit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">A '''variational principle''' is a scientific principle used within the [[calculus of variations]], which develops general methods for finding functions which extremize the value of quantities that depend upon those functions. For example, to answer this question: "What is the [[Catenary|shape of a chain]] suspended at both ends?" we can use the variational principle that the shape must minimize the gravitational potential energy.

==Overview==
Any physical law which can be expressed as a variational principle describes a [[self-adjoint operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cornelius |last=Lanczos |author-link=Cornelius Lanczos |orig-year=1st published 1970, [[University of Toronto Press]] |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |publisher=Dover |date=1974 |ISBN=0-8020-1743-6 |edition=4th, paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expressions are also called [[Hermitian]]. Such an expression describes an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under a Hermitian transformation.

==History==
{{main|History of variational principles in physics}}
[[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] attempted to identify such invariants under a group of transformations. In what is referred to in physics as [[Noether's theorem]], the [[Poincaré group]] of transformations (what is now called a [[gauge group]]) for [[general relativity]] defines symmetries under a group of transformations which depend on a variational principle, or [[Action (physics)|action principle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5784">In [[mathematics]], a '''Waldhausen category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' equipped with some additional data, which makes it possible to construct the [[K-theory of a category|K-theory]] [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] of ''C'' using a so-called '''S-construction'''. It's named after [[Friedhelm Waldhausen]], who introduced this notion (under the term '''category with cofibrations and weak equivalences''') to extend the methods of [[algebraic K-theory]] to categories not necessarily of algebraic origin, for example the category of [[topological space]]s.

==Definition==
Let ''C'' be a category, co(''C'') and we(''C'') two classes of [[morphism]]s in ''C'', called cofibrations and weak equivalences respectively. The triple (''C'', co(''C''), we(''C'')) is called a '''Waldhausen category''' if it satisfies the following axioms, motivated by the similar properties for the notions of [[cofibration]]s and [[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)#Topological_spaces|weak homotopy equivalences]] of topological spaces:

* ''C'' has a [[zero object]], denoted by 0;
* [[isomorphism]]s are included in both co(''C'') and we(''C'');
* co(''C'') and we(''C'') are closed under composition;
* for each object ''A'' ∈ ''C'' the unique map 0 → ''A'' is a cofibration, i.e. is an element of co(''C'');
* co(''C'') and we(''C'') are compatible with [[pushout (category theory)|pushouts]] in a certain sense.

For example, if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\, \rightarrowtail\, B&lt;/math&gt; is a cofibration and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\,\to\, C&lt;/math&gt; is any map, then there must exist a pushout &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B\, \cup_A\, C&lt;/math&gt;, and the natural map &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C\, \rightarrowtail\, B\,\cup_A\, C&lt;/math&gt; should be cofibration:

[[Image:Waldhausen cat.png|center]]

==Relations with other notions==
In [[algebraic K-theory]] and [[homotopy theory]] there are several notions of categories equipped with some specified classes of morphisms.  If ''C'' has a structure of an [[exact category]], then by defining we(''C'') to be isomorphisms, co(''C'') to be admissible monomorphisms, one obtains a structure of a Waldhausen category on ''C''. Both kinds of structure may be used to define [[K-theory of a category|K-theory]] of ''C'', using the [[Q-construction]] for an exact structure and [[S-construction]] for a Waldhausen structure. An important fact is that the resulting K-theory spaces are homotopy equivalent.

If ''C'' is a [[model category]] with a zero object, then the full subcategory of cofibrant objects in ''C'' may be given a Waldhausen structure.

== S-construction ==
The '''Waldhausen S-construction''' produces from a Waldhausen category ''C'' a sequence of [[Kan complex]]es &lt;math&gt;S_n(C)&lt;/math&gt;, which forms a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]]. Let &lt;math&gt;K(C)&lt;/math&gt; denote the loop space of the geometric realization &lt;math&gt;|S_*(C)|&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S_*(C)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[group (mathematics)|group]]
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_n K(C) = \pi_{n+1} |S_*(C)|&lt;/math&gt;
is the ''n''-th ''K''-group of ''C''. Thus, it gives a way to define higher ''K''-groups. Another approach for higher ''K''-theory is [[Quillen's Q-construction]].

The construction is due to [[Friedhelm Waldhausen]].

==biWaldhausen categories==

A category ''C'' is equipped with bifibrations if it has cofibrations and its [[opposite category]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;OP&lt;/sup&gt; has so also. In that case, we denote the fibrations of ''C''&lt;sup&gt;OP&lt;/sup&gt; by quot(''C''). 
In that case, ''C'' is a '''biWaldhausen category''' if ''C'' has [[bifibration]]s and weak equivalences such that both (''C'',&amp;nbsp;co(''C''),&amp;nbsp;we) and (''C''&lt;sup&gt;OP&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;quot(''C''),&amp;nbsp;we&lt;sup&gt;OP&lt;/sup&gt;) are Waldhausen categories.

Waldhausen and biWaldhausen categories are linked with [[algebraic K-theory]]. There, many interesting categories are complicial biWaldhausen categories. For example: 
The category &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^b(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; of bounded chain complexes on an exact category &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.
The category &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S_n \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; of functors &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \operatorname{Ar}(\Delta ^n)\, \to\, \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is so.
And given a diagram &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{C}^I&lt;/math&gt; is a nice complicial biWaldhausen category when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is.

'''Womyn-born womyn''' ('''WBW''') is a term developed during [[second-wave feminism]] to designate women who were [[sex assignment|identified as female at birth]], were raised as girls, and identify as [[woman|women]] (or [[womyn]], a deliberately [[Satiric misspelling|alternative spelling]] that challenges the centering of [[male as norm]]).

Events and organizations that have womyn-born-womyn-only policies bar access to anyone who was assigned [[male]] at birth: male children of attendees, [[Trans woman|trans women]], [[gay men]], [[bisexual men]] and [[heterosexual men]]. These [[cisgender]] [[women-only space]]s have raised a number of concerns from transgender groups.

==Second-wave feminism==
The term gained usage and popularity during the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] movement. In 1978, the [[Lesbian Organization of Toronto]] adopted a womyn-born  womyn-only policy in response to a request for admittance by a transgender woman who identified as lesbian. Womyn-born womyn policies held that the nature of the feminine experience over the course of a lifetime could only be experienced by someone who experienced life presenting as a woman.&lt;ref name=raymond1994&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transsexual Empire |last=Raymond|first=Janice|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=978-0807021644|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to create a space for only women, defined not by identity but experience, defined in a way that excluded transgender women.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys1990&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anticlimax: a feminist perspective on the sexual revolution|last=Jeffreys|first=Sheila|publisher=Women's Press|year=1990|isbn=9780704342033|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism is a period in the feminist movement lasting from the 1960s until around the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Gamble2001&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. ''The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism'' (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}} Some feminists of the period such as scholars [[Sheila Jeffreys]], [[Janice Raymond]], and [[Theology|theologist]] [[Mary Daly]] were proponents of womyn-born womyn policies. These policies created controversy and scholarly discussion.

Raymond's ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'' (1979) is often seen as the characterizing work of this movement. It is known for its view of trans women as privileged men who did not previously live in the oppression of the [[patriarchy]], stating, "We know who we are. We know that we are women who are born with female chromosomes and anatomy, and that whether or not we were socialised to be so-called normal women, patriarchy has treated and will treat us like women. Transsexuals have not had this same history."&lt;ref name=raymond1994 /&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|quote=|source=The surgeons and hormone therapists of the transsexual kingdom, in their effort to give birth, can be said to produce feminine persons. They cannot produce women. – Mary Daly&lt;ref name=Daly1990&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Mary|title=Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism|date=1990|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|isbn=978-0807014134|page=68|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=19%}}

Jeffreys was similarly outspoken in her criticisms of trans women, arguing that the feminine characteristics they were adopting are simply those that women must adopt to avoid punishment from the patriarchy. She believed trans women adopt [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] attributes that are enforced by the patriarchy and were political signifiers of the oppression of women.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys1990 /&gt;

[[Judith Butler]], despite being opposed to womyn-born womyn policies, is often used as an argument for them by modern second-wave feminists. Butler's ''Gender Trouble'' (1990) contained discussion of [[performativity]] versus performance, which second-wave feminists used to exclude trans women on account of their performativity through repetition of [[gender norm]]s, which is "real only to the extent that it is performed", which was used as a separator from experience.&lt;ref name=Disch2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Disch|first1=Lisa Jane|last2=Hawkesworth|first2=M.

[[Olivia Records]], a feminist music collective, employed transgender employees, notably [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]].&lt;ref name=Vogel1977&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/1977-lettertooliviarecords.pdf|title=Sister, June 1977 Letter|last=Vogel|first=Lisa|date=1977|website=Eminism Archives|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Michigan Womyn's Music Festival's primary owner in 1977, Lisa Vogel, issued a letter to the music collective along with other second wave feminists:
{{quote|Dear Olivia:

We are writing concerning your decision to employ Sandy Stone as your recording engineer and sound technician. We feel that it was and is irresponsible of you to have presented this person as a woman to the women’s community when in fact he is a post-operative transsexual.

Given the narrow options available to us, it is also likely that many of us would have to work with Stone. Some of us have already done so without the knowledge that this person was not a woman. When we did discover the truth about Stone and tried to discuss this with you, we were told that you considered him very much a woman, a lesbian, and that you trusted him more than middle class, heterosexual women. This was very painful to hear and indicated a great lack of respect and love for women and our struggle. We do not believe that a man without a penis is a woman any more than we would accept a white woman with dyed skin as a Black woman.&lt;ref name=Vogel1977 /&gt;}}

=== Women-only spaces ===
Throughout the final quarter of the twentieth century, [[women's music]] festivals often enacted womyn-born womyn policies. Although [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] people had been present in [[women-only space|"women-only spaces"]] for decades (usually [[closeted]] or [[passing (gender)|passing]]),{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} the term garnered wider attention in response to the exclusion of trans women from the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] (MichFest) after it was described as a gathering for "women born as women and living as women".&lt;ref name=vitello2006&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vitello|first1=Paul|title=The Trouble When Jane Becomes Jack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/fashion/20gender.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 20, 2006|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, a gender survey was taken at MichFest by Nancy Burkholder&lt;ref name=Taormino2000 /&gt; that asked, "Do you think male-to-female transsexuals should be welcome at Michigan?"&lt;ref name=Burkholder1992&gt;{{Cite web|last=Burkholder|first=Nancy|title=MWMF Anti-TS Awareness: 1992 Gender Survey Results|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/documents.html|website=Eminism.org|date=28 April 1993|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of approximately 7500 women present, 633 responded to the inquiry with 73.1% (463) responding "yes" and 22.6% (143) responding "no" (the margin of error was 3.8%). Although admitting that the sample was not "randomly selected", surveyors calculated the results as indicating that "less than 1 in 100,000" attendees would be against the exclusion of transsexual women from the festival; and while the replies about "female-to-male transsexuals" were not tabulated, it was determined that "80% of respondents were against their inclusion".&lt;ref name=Burkholder1992 /&gt; However, the presence of male-to-female transsexual people at MichFest was understood to exist.&lt;ref name=myths2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths and The Truth About the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|url=http://www.thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|website=thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|date=September 2014|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cogswell|first1=Kelly|title=Dyke-Baiting, Trans-Hating, and the MichFest Debacle|url=http://gaycitynews.nyc/dyke-baiting-trans-hating-michfest-debacle/|website=[[Gay City News]]|date=April 29, 2015|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[third-wave feminism]], objections to womyn-born womyn policies increased.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Many women-only music festivals also began to close. The RadFem Collective, which describes its membership as "restricted to 'women born women and living as women'", continues to promote womyn-born womyn policies.&lt;ref name=Kaveney2012&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kaveney|first= Roz|title=Radical feminists are acting like a cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/25/radical-feminism-trans-radfem2012?INTCMP=SRCH|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement for the 2015 conference was rephrased in explanatory form to read "RadFems Resist is a women only, feminist event. Our conference is a space for women to share our experiences as women, to politically self organise for women's liberation and to celebrate womanhood in a safe environment. We welcome all women who were raised and socialized as girls to join us...We are gender abolitionists who have been raised and socialized as girls and women *because of our female bodies* in the context of patriarchy."&lt;ref name=RadFems2015&gt;{{Cite web|title=RadFems Resist 2015|url=http://www.radfemcollective.org/upcoming-events/radfemsresist2015|website=RadFem Collective|date=2015|accessdate= February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 40 years, the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival held its last event in 2015.&lt;ref name=dearsisters2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|title=Dear Sisters, Amazon, Festival family|url=https://www.facebook.com/michfest/posts/10153186431364831|website=[[Facebook]]|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This final gathering followed the withdrawal of support by the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], [[National LGBTQ Task Force]], and ''The TransAdvocate'' [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] website, of a boycott petition against MichFest and its womyn-born womyn intention.&lt;ref name=Ring2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=This Year's Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Will Be the Last|url=https://www.advocate.com/michfest/2015/04/21/years-michigan-womyns-music-festival-will-be-last|website=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other instances where transgender women have been denied access to, or been evicted from, women's spaces; for example, the [[Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter]] and [[Mountain Moving Coffeehouse]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Third-wave feminism ==
The [[feminist sex wars]] signaled a divide in second-wave feminism on issues of sex expression, pornography, sexuality, and gender identity. It led to many trans-affirming feminist views, and more criticism toward the womyn-born womyn culture that thrived in [[radical feminism]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} With the rise of [[third-wave feminism]], the radical feminism that supports womyn-born womyn policies and agendas became less prevalent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Judith Butler]] was characteristic in her approach to third-wave feminist opposition of womyn-born womyn politics. The fluidity in gender, a more modern adaptation in feminist thought, is reflected in her views, "We form ourselves within the vocabularies that we did not choose, and sometimes we have to reject those vocabularies, or actively develop new ones.  For instance, gender assignment is a 'construction' and yet many [[genderqueer]] and trans people refuse those assignments in part or in full.  That refusal opens the way for a more radical form of self-determination, one that happens in solidarity with others who are undergoing a similar struggle."&lt;ref name=TERF2014&gt;{{Cite web|last=Admin|url=http://theterfs.com/2014/05/01/judith-butler-addresses-terfs-and-the-work-of-sheila-jeffreys-and-janice-raymond/|title=Judith Butler addresses TERFs and the work of Sheila Jeffreys and Janice Raymond|website=The TERFs|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in response to claims by Jeffreys and others of the time who believed that those born womyn embodied true patriarchal struggle, while transgender women still benefited from the patriarchy. In a more direct reaction from Butler, she states, "The feminist police comes along to expose the construction and dispute a trans person's sense of their lived reality. I oppose this use of social construction absolutely, and consider it to be a false, misleading, and oppressive use of the theory."&lt;ref name=TERF2014 /&gt; Some prominent figures in the second wave also readjusted views when presented with changing times, such as [[Gloria Steinem]], who previously referred to transgender women as men with mutilated bodies in the late 1970s, and has since revised her beliefs as stated in a 2013 opinion piece: "I believe that transgender people, including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned."&lt;ref name=Steinem2013&gt;{{Cite web|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/10/02/op-ed-working-together-over-time|title=Op-ed: On Working Together Over Time|website=The Advocate|date= 2 October 2013|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfeminism ===
The understanding of gender, gender politics, and [[transfeminism|trans politics]] has changed over the latter half of the twentieth century and  has led to more [[LGBT|LGBTQ]]-led opposition to womyn-born womyn policies and the music festivals that tend to employ them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Kelsie Brynn Jones, a transgender woman and advocate, wrote that "in [radical feminists'] words, a transgender woman is a ''[sic]'' nothing but a 'self loathing gay man' and they claim that trans women are gay men who, rather than stand up and come out as gay, would rather 'hide' by being transgender, as if it makes things more palatable for friends, family and co-workers."&lt;ref name=Jones2014&gt;{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Kelsie Brynn|title=Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism: What Exactly Is It, And Why Does It Hurt|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kelsie-brynn-jones/transexclusionary-radical-terf_b_5632332.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=August 2, 2014|accessdate= February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists for transgender-inclusionary policies often refer to those who promote womyn-born womyn policies as [[Feminist views on transgender topics#The term "TERF"|TERFs]], an acronym meaning "Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists".&lt;ref name=TERF2013&gt;{{Cite web|last=Admin|url=http://theterfs.com/|title= Rad Fem ≠ TERF|website=TheTERFs.com|date=March 2013|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Nancy Burkholder was kicked out of the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival for being transgender.&lt;ref name=Taormino2000&gt;{{Cite web|last=Taormino|first=Tristan|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/trouble-in-utopia-6417677|title=Trouble in Utopia|website=Village Voice|date=September 12, 2000|access-date=2016-03-23|archiveurl=https://archive.is/gdXp|archivedate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With support from the [[Lesbian Avengers]], she and other activists, specifically transgender women, created [[Camp Trans]] in 1992 to stage protests outside of the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival against its womyn-born womyn policy.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Transgender supporters passed out flyers and held workshops across the road from the festival.&lt;ref name=Taormino2000 /&gt; Transgender activist [[Julia Serano]] described the festival as insensitive and ignorant: "[The] idea that the femaleness of my mind, personality, lived experiences, and the rest of my body can somehow be trumped by the mere presence of a penis can only be described as phallocentric."&lt;ref name=Serano2007&gt;{{Cite book|last=Serano|first=Julia|title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|publisher=Seal Press|year=2007|location=|page=|isbn=978-1580051545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist [[Riki Wilchins]] noted that Camp Trans "was the first time that significant numbers of the hard-core lesbian feminist community backed us”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10598">'''Wonderland''' is an integrated [[mathematical model]] used for studying phenomena in [[sustainable development]]. First introduced by 
([[#san94|Sanderson 1994]]), there are now several related versions of the model in use.  Wonderland allows [[economists]], [[policy analysts]] and [[environmentalist]] to study the interactions
between the [[economic]], [[demographic]] and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sectors of an idealized world, thereby enabling them to obtain insights transferable to the real world.

== Introduction ==

'''Wonderland''' is a compact model.
In total, there are only four continuous state variables, one each for the economic and demographic sectors and two for the anthropogenic sector; thus making Wonderland more compact and amenable to analysis than larger, more intricate models like [[World3]].  For this reason it is often used as an initial testing ground for new techniques in the area of policy analysis ([[#lpb03|Lempert, et al., 2003]]).

== Governing equations ==

Denote the four state variables as: &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– population, &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– per capita output, &lt;math&gt;z(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– stock of natural capital and &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– pollution flow per unit of output. Let &lt;math&gt;x,y\in[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;z,p\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, then the state variables evolve in [[discrete time]], according to the following [[recurrence relation]]s ([[#san94|Sanderson, 1994]]).
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x(t+1) &amp;= x(t)\left[1+b\Big(y(t),z(t)\Big) - d\Big(y(t),z(t)\Big)\right],\\
y(t+1) &amp;=y(t)\left(1+\gamma-(\gamma+\eta)\Big[1-z(t)\Big]^{\lambda}\right),\\
z(t+1) &amp;= \frac{g\Big(x(t),y(t),z(t),p(t)\Big)}{1+g\Big(x(t),y(t),z(t),p(t)\Big)},\\
p(t+1) &amp;= p(t)(1-\chi),\\
\ &amp;\ \\
\!\!\!\text{where,} \qquad &amp;\ \\
\ &amp;\ \\
b(y,z)&amp;= \beta_0\left[\beta_1 - \left(\frac{e^{\beta y}}{1+e^{\beta y}}\right)\right],\\
d(y,z)&amp;= \alpha_0\left[\alpha_1 - \left(\frac{e^{\alpha y}}{1+e^{\alpha y}}\right)\right]
         \left[1+\alpha_2(1-z)^{\theta}\right],\\
g(x,y,z,p)&amp;= \frac{z}{1-z}\,e^{\,\delta z^{\rho}-\omega f(x,y,p)}, \ \text{and}\\
f(x,y,p)&amp;=xyp.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Altogether, these equations depend upon 15 parameters.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sector !! Parameter
|-
| Economic || &lt;math&gt;\ \gamma, \ \eta, \ \lambda&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Demographic || &lt;math&gt;\ \chi, \ \delta, \ \rho, \ \omega&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Anthropogenic || &lt;math&gt;\ \alpha, \ \alpha_0, \ \alpha_1, \ \alpha_2, \ \beta, \beta_0, \ \beta_1, \ \theta&lt;/math&gt;
|}

: &lt;math&gt;b(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; represent the [[birth rate]] and [[death rate]] respectively. Both saturate as per capita output rises, in agreement with empirical studies ([[#jec95|Cohen, 1995]]).

The form of &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,p)&lt;/math&gt; follows from the [[I = PAT]] hypothesis.

== System behavior ==

Using the [[Scenario analysis]] technique, Sanderson ([[#san94|1994]]) studied two possible futures for the idealized world described by Wonderland. One future entitled ''Dream'', held out the possibility of unending sustainable growth, while the other termed ''Horror'', ended in environmental collapse and eventual extinction of the population. Subsequent work ([[#gk06|Kohring, 2006]]) showed that the parameters of the model can be bisected into two sets, one which always produces sustainable futures and one which always ends in collapse and extinction. Additionally, the equations of Wonderland exhibit [[chaotic behavior]] ([[#gr96|Gröller, et al., 1996]], [[#wgp97|Wegenkittl, et al., 1997]], [[#hl98|Leeves and Herbert, 1998]]).

== Avoiding collapse ==

In the basic model it is impossible to avoid or recover from the environmental collapse seen in the ''Horror'' scenario without changes to the model itself. Two such changes have been studied: 
pollution ''abatement'' and pollution ''avoidance''.

=== Pollution abatement ===
{{see also|Pollution control|Environmental mitigation}}
Abating the effects of pollution draws funds from other sources to pay for cleaning up the environment ([[#san94|Sanderson, 1994]]).  This decreases the value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; entering into the equations for birth, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and death, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y^{\prime}=y-\phi(1-z)^{\mu}y
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The time evolution of &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is unaffected because those goods and services needed for pollution abatement must also be considered part of the overall output.  The impact of these changes on the environment is expressed by changes to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x,y,p)=xyp - \kappa\frac{e^{\epsilon \phi(1-z)^{\mu}yx}}{1+e^{\epsilon \phi(1-z)^{\mu}yx}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

These changes introduce three new parameters into the model:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sector !! Parameter
|-
| Policy Levers || &lt;math&gt;\ \phi, \ \mu, \ \kappa&lt;/math&gt;
|}

By adjusting the policy levers, it is possible to clean up a polluted environment and recover from the collapse seen in the ''Horror'' scenario.  However, the recovery is only temporary, after a brief time of robust growth the system again collapses, leading to endless cycles of collapse followed by recovery. Abating pollution does not alter the fundamental division of the parameters into the two sets of sustainable and unsustainable futures ([[#gk06|Kohring, 2006]]).

=== Pollution avoidance ===
{{see also|Pollution prevention}}
Pollution avoidance aims to prevent pollution from entering into the environment, by making its production unprofitable. This is modeled by means of a pollution tax ([[#hl98|Herbert and Leeves, 1998]], [[#lpb03|Lempert, et al., 2003]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y(t+1) &amp;= y(t)\left(1+\gamma-\left(\gamma+\eta\right)\Big[1-z(t)\Big]^{\lambda}-\gamma_0\,\frac{\tau}{1-\tau}\right),\\
p(t+1) &amp;= p(t)\left(1-\chi-\chi_0\frac{\tau}{1+\tau}\right).\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The new parameters for the pollution avoidance model are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sector !! Parameter
|-
| Policy Levers || &lt;math&gt;\ \gamma_0, \ \chi_0, \ \tau&lt;/math&gt;
|}

With these changes, it is possible to raise the tax rate, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, such that the system never collapses and the horror scenario is avoided altogether.  Regardless of the other parameters, it is always possible to increase &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in order to avoid collapse thereby enabling unending sustainable growth ([[#gk06|Kohring, 2006]]).

== Variations ==

=== Production function ===

Instead of the relatively simple economic growth equation used for &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; some researchers use a [[Cobb–Douglas]] production function instead ([[#lh02|Leeves and Herbert, 2002]]).

=== Multiple countries ===

The standard form of the Wonderland model contains a single, homogeneous entity.  Herbert et al. ([[#hbll05|2005]]) extended Wonderland to a multi-country model by allowing the different entities to use different sets parameters and assuming the outputs are coupled through trade flows.

=== Differential equations ===

Originally developed in terms of [[discrete time]], [[finite difference equation]]s, it is often recast as a set of continuous time [[differential equations]] ([[#gr96|Gröller, et al., 1996]])
