'''''A Big Fix: Radical Solutions for Australia's Environmental Crisis''''' is a 2005 book by [[Ian Lowe]] which argues that the warnings from [[environmental scientist]]s are urgent and unequivocal. Professor Lowe suggests that resources are being [[resource depletion|used too quickly]], environmental systems are being compromised, and society is being destabilised by the increasing [[gap between rich and poor]]. Lowe proposes several radical solutions. He advocates a fundamental change to our personal values and social institutions and provides a vision of a healthier society – one that is more humane, takes an [[ecocentrism|eco-centric]] approach, adopts longer-term thinking, and respects natural systems.&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;[http://www-prod.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/ras/article/viewFile/108/122 A big fix: Radical solutions for Australia’s environmental crisis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/wa/stories/s1488641.htm Individual action can help save the environment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/climate-change-mans-most-serious-issue-flannery/2005/09/26/1127586787536.html Climate change man's most serious issue: Flannery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecosmagazine.com/?act=view_file&amp;file_id=EC127p32a.pdf Remedial vision]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agar''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ɡ|ɑːr}}, sometimes {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|g|ər}}) or '''agar-agar''' is a jelly-like substance, obtained from [[red algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]|edition=2|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agar is a mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide [[agarose]], and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called [[agaropectin]].&lt;ref name="Williams2000"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, Peter W. |author2=Phillips, Glyn O. |title=Handbook of hydrocolloids |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dXS7qnh-ZOEC&amp;pg=PA28 |chapter=Chapter 2: Agar |publisher=Woodhead |location=Cambridge |year=2000 |page= 91 |isbn=1-85573-501-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It forms the supporting structure in the cell walls of certain species of algae, and is released on boiling. These algae are known as [[agarophyte]]s, and belong to the [[Rhodophyta]] (red algae) phylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Edward Balfour]]| title = Cyclopædia of India and of eastern and southern Asia, commercial, industrial and scientific: products of the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms, useful arts and manufactures| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ItcBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=agar| year = 1871| publisher = Scottish and Adelphi Presses| isbn = | page = 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "oxford"&gt;{{cite book| author = Alan Davidson| title = The Oxford Companion to Food| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JTr-ouCbL2AC| date = 2006-09-21| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-280681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agar has been used as an ingredient in [[dessert]]s throughout Asia, and also as a solid [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] to contain [[Growth medium|culture media]] for [[microbiology|microbiological]] work. Agar can be used as a [[laxative]], an appetite suppressant, a [[vegetarian]] substitute for [[gelatin]], a thickener for [[soup]]s, in [[Fruit preserves#Jelly|fruit preserves]], [[ice cream]], and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in [[brewing]], and for [[sizing]] paper and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Green Balfour| title = Cyclopaedia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, commercial, industrial and scientific...| url = https://books.google.com/?id=5ixCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA13| year = 1857| publisher = | isbn = | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gelling agent in agar is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from ''tengusa'' (''[[Gelidiaceae]]'') and ''[[ogonori]]'' (''[[Gracilaria]]''). For commercial purposes, it is derived primarily from ''ogonori''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shimamura|first1=Natsu|title=Agar|url=http://www.tokyofoundation.org/en/topics/japanese-traditional-foods/vol.-4-agar|website=The Tokyo Foundation|accessdate=19 December 2016|date=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chemical terms, agar is a [[polymer]] made up of subunits of the sugar [[galactose]].

== History ==
[[Image:Agarose polymere.svg|right|thumb|The structure of an agarose polymer.]]

Agar may have been discovered in Japan in 1658 by Mino Tarōzaemon ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|美濃}} {{linktext|太郎}}{{linktext|左衛門}}}}), an innkeeper who, according to legend, was said to have discarded surplus seaweed soup and noticed that it gelled later after a winter night's freezing.&lt;ref name="DifcoMan"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bd.com/ds/technicalCenter/misc/difcobblmanual_2nded_lowres.pdf|title=Difco &amp; BBL Manual|publisher=Becton Dickinson and Company|editors=Mary Jo Zimbro, David A.

Agar was first subjected to chemical analysis in 1859 by the French chemist [[Anselme Payen]], who had obtained agar from the marine algae ''Gelidium corneum''.&lt;ref&gt;Payen, Anselme (1859) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3006f/f523.image.langEN "Sur la gélose et le nids de salangane"] (On agar and swiftlet nests), ''Comptes rendus'' …, '''49''' : 521-530, appended remarks 530-532.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 19th century, agar began to be used heavily as a solid medium for growing various microbes. Agar was first described for use in microbiology in 1882 by the German microbiologist [[Walther Hesse]], an assistant working in [[Robert Koch]]'s laboratory, on the suggestion of his wife [[Fanny Hesse|Fannie Hesse]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Koch (10 April 1882) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015020075001;view=1up;seq=235 "Die Aetiologie der Tuberculose"] (The etiology of tuberculosis), ''Berliner Klinische Wochenschrift'' (Berlin Clinical Weekly), '''19''' :  221-230.  From page 225:  ''"Die Tuberkelbacillen lassen sich auch noch auf anderen Nährsubstraten kultiviren, wenn letztere ähnliche Eigenschaften wie das erstarrte Blutserum besitzen.  So wachsen sie beispielsweise auf einer mit Agar-Agar bereiteten, bei Blutwärme hart bleibenden Gallerte, welche einen Zusatz von Fleischinfus und Pepton erhalten hat."'' (The tubercule bacilli can also be cultivated on other media, if the latter have properties similar to those of congealed blood serum.  Thus they grow, for example, on a gelatinous mass which was prepared with agar-agar, which remains solid at blood temperature, and which has received a supplement of meat broth and peptone.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ln"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labnews.co.uk/features/history-of-the-agar-plate/|title=History of the Agar Plate|date=November 1, 2005|publisher=Laboratory News|author=Smith, A.|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agar quickly supplanted gelatin as the base of microbiological media, due to its higher melting temperature, allowing microbes to be grown at higher temperatures without the media liquefying.&lt;ref name="hesse"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1992|title=Walther and Angelina Hesse–Early Contributors to Bacteriology|url=http://www.asm.org/ccLibraryFiles/FILENAME/0000000227/580892p425.pdf|journal=ASM News|volume=58|issue=8|pages=425–428|author=Hesse, W.|translator=Gröschel, D.H.M.|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its newfound use in microbiology, agar production quickly increased. This production centered on Japan, which produced most of the world's agar until World War II.&lt;ref name=Loban&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lobban|first1=Christopher S.|last2=Wynne|first2=Michael James|title=The Biology of Seaweeds|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520045859|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QG4tqjFPWJ0C&amp;pg=PA734&amp;dq=agar+gelling+malay+japan#v=onepage&amp;q=agar%20gelling%20malay%20japan&amp;f=false|language=en |pages=734–735|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the outbreak of World War II, many nations were forced to establish domestic agar industries in order to continue microbiological research.&lt;ref name=Loban/&gt; Around the time of World War II, approximately 2,500 tons of agar were produced annually.&lt;ref name=Loban/&gt; By the mid-1970s, production worldwide had increased dramatically to approximately 10,000 tons each year.&lt;ref name=Loban/&gt; Since then, production of agar has fluctuated due to unstable and sometimes over-utilized seaweed populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/lab-staple-agar-hit-by-seaweed-shortage-1.18970 |title=Lab staple agar hit by seaweed shortage |publisher=Nature News |author=Ewen Callaway |date=8 December 2015 |accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word "agar" comes from '''agar-agar''', the [[Malay language|Malay]] name for red algae (''[[Gigartina]]'', ''[[Gracilaria]]'') from which the jelly is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Balfour |first=Edward. |title= The cyclopædia of India and of eastern and southern Asia: commercial, industrial and scientific, products of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, useful arts and manufactures |publisher= B. Quaritch |year= 1885 |month= |isbn= |page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''Kanten''' ({{lang-ja|寒天}}) (from the phrase '''''kan'''-zarashi [[Tokoroten|tokoro'''ten''']]'' ({{lang|ja|寒晒心太}}) or “cold-exposed agar”), '''Japanese isinglass''', '''Ceylon moss''' or '''Jaffna moss'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agar-agar.org/en/ Agar-Agar] at Agar-Agar.org&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gracilaria lichenoides'' is specifically referred to as '''agal-agal''' or '''Ceylon agar'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/a/agara012.html |accessdate=22 January 2017 |title=Agar-Agar |publisher=Botanical.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Agar consists of a mixture of two [[polysaccharide]]s: agarose and agaropectin, with agarose making up about 70% of the mixture.&lt;ref name=FAO3/&gt; [[Agarose]] is a linear polymer, made up of repeating units of [[Agarose#Structure|agarobiose]], a disaccharide made up of [[D-galactose]] and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactopyranose.&lt;ref name=FAO1/&gt; Agaropectin is a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules that occur in lesser amounts, and is made up of alternating units of D-galactose and L-galactose heavily modified with acidic side-groups, such as sulfate and pyruvate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hyagar.html Agar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016213723/http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hyagar.html |date=October 16, 2007 }} at lsbu.ac.uk Water Structure and Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAO3&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/AB730E/AB730E03.htm |title=Training manual on Gracilaria culture and seaweed processing in China |chapter=III: Properties, Manufacture, and Application of Seaweed Polysaccharides - Agar, Carageenan, and Algin |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations|date=August 1990 |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAO1&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5822e/x5822e03.htm |title=Production and Utilization of Products from Commercial Seaweeds|chapter=Chapter 1 - Production, Properties and Uses of Agar |author1=Rafael Armisen |author2=Fernando Galatas |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations |date=1987 |editor=McHugh DJ |isbn=92-5-102612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agar exhibits [[hysteresis]], melting at 85&amp;nbsp;°C (358 K, 185&amp;nbsp;°F) and solidifying from 32–40&amp;nbsp;°C (305–313 K, 90–104&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/MicroBio_Agar.shtml |title=All About Agar |publisher=Sciencebuddies.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603081846/http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/MicroBio_Agar.shtml| archivedate= 3 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property lends a suitable balance between easy melting and good gel stability at relatively high temperatures. Since many scientific applications require incubation at temperatures close to human body temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C), agar is more appropriate than other solidifying agents that melt at this temperature, such as gelatin.

==Uses==

=== Culinary ===
[[File:Sago Gulaman.jpg|thumb|''[[Sago]] at [[gulaman]]'' in [[Filipino cuisine]] is made from agar (''[[gulaman]]''), pearl [[sago]], and fruit juice flavored with [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|pandan]]]]
Agar-agar is a natural vegetable [[gelatin]] counterpart. White and semi-[[translucent]], it is sold in packages as washed and dried strips or in powdered form. It can be used to make jellies, [[puddings]], and [[custard]]s. For making jelly, it is boiled in water until the solids dissolve. Sweetener, flavouring, colouring, fruit or vegetables are then added and the liquid is poured into [[molding (process)|molds]] to be served as desserts and vegetable [[aspic]]s, or incorporated with other desserts, such as a jelly layer in a [[cake]].

Agar-agar is approximately 80% fiber, so it can serve as an intestinal regulator. Its bulking quality has been behind fad diets in Asia, for example the ''kanten'' (the Japanese word for agar-agar&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;) diet. Once ingested, ''kanten'' triples in size and absorbs water. This results in the consumers feeling fuller. This diet has recently received some press coverage in the United States as well. The diet has shown promise in obesity studies.&lt;ref name="Maeda"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maeda H, Yamamoto R, Hirao K, Tochikubo O | title=Effects of agar (kanten) diet on obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes | date = January 2005 | journal = Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism |volume=7 |issue=1 |pmid=15642074 | pages = 40–6 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2004.00370.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One use of agar in [[Japanese cuisine]] ([[Wagashi]]) is ''[[anmitsu]]'', a dessert made of small cubes of agar jelly and served in a bowl with various fruits or other ingredients. It is also the main ingredient in ''mizu yōkan'', another popular Japanese food.

In [[Philippine cuisine]], it is used to make the jelly bars in the various [[gulaman]] refreshments or desserts such as ''sago gulaman'', ''buko pandan'', ''agar flan'', ''[[halo-halo]]'', and the black and red ''gulaman'' used in various fruit salads.

In [[Vietnamese cuisine]], jellies made of flavored layers of agar agar, called ''thạch'', are a popular dessert, and are often made in ornate molds for special occasions. In [[Indian cuisine]], agar agar is known as "China grass" and is used for making desserts. In [[Burmese cuisine]], a sweet jelly known as ''kyauk kyaw''  {{IPA-my|tɕaʊʔtɕɔ́|}} is made from agar.

In Russia, it is used in addition or as a replacement to [[pectin]] in jams and marmalades, as a substitute to gelatin for its superior gelling properties, and as a strengthening ingredient in souffles and custards. Another use of agar-agar is in ''ptich'ye moloko'' ([[bird's milk]]), a rich jellified custard (or soft [[meringue]]) used as a cake filling or chocolate-glazed as individual sweets. Agar-agar may also be used as the gelling agent in gel clarification, a culinary technique used to clarify stocks, sauces, and other liquids.

[[Mexico]] has traditional candies made out of Agar gelatin, most of them in colorful, half-circle shapes that resemble a [[melon]] or [[watermelon]] fruit slice, and commonly covered with sugar. They are known in Spanish as ''Dulce de Agar'' (Agar sweets)

Agar-agar is an allowed nonorganic/nonsynthetic additive used as a thickener, gelling agent, texturizer, moisturizer, emulsifier, flavor enhancer, and absorbent in certified organic foods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5096516 Agar-agar Review Sheet], USDA Organic Materials Review, April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microbiology ===
[[Image:Agar Plate.jpg|right|thumb|100mm diameter [[Petri dish]]es containing agar gel for bacterial culture]]
{{Main|Agar plate}}

An agar plate or Petri dish is used to provide a [[growth medium]] using a mix of agar and other nutrients in which microorganisms, including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]], can be cultured and observed under the microscope. Agar is indigestible for many organisms so that microbial growth does not affect the gel used and it remains stable. Agar is typically sold commercially as a powder that can be mixed with water and prepared similarly to gelatin before use as a growth medium. Other ingredients are added to the agar to meet the nutritional needs of the [[microbe]]s. Many specific formulations are available, because some microbes prefer certain environmental conditions over others.  Agar is often dispensed using a sterile [[media dispenser]].

==== Motility assays ====
As a gel, an agar or agarose medium is porous and therefore can be used to measure microorganism motility and mobility. The gel's porosity is directly related to the concentration of agarose in the medium, so various levels of effective viscosity (from the cell's "point of view") can be selected, depending on the experimental objectives.

A common identification assay involves culturing a sample of the organism deep within a block of nutrient agar. Cells will attempt to grow within the gel structure. Motile species will be able to migrate, albeit slowly, throughout the gel and infiltration rates can then be visualized, whereas non-motile species will show growth only along the now-empty path introduced by the invasive initial sample deposition.

Another setup commonly used for measuring chemotaxis and chemokinesis utilizes the under-agarose cell migration assay, whereby a layer of agarose gel is placed between a cell population and a chemoattractant. As a concentration gradient develops from the diffusion of the chemoattractant into the gel, various cell populations requiring different stimulation levels to migrate can then be visualized over time using microphotography as they tunnel upward through the gel against gravity along the gradient.

=== Plant biology ===
[[Image:Physcomitrella growing on agar plates.jpg|thumb|''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' plants growing [[axenic]]ally [[in vitro]] on [[agar plate]]s ([[Petri dish]], 9&amp;nbsp;cm diameter).]]

Research grade agar is used extensively in plant biology as it is supplemented with a nutrient and vitamin mixture that allows for seedling germination in Petri dishes under sterile conditions (given that the seeds are sterilized as well). Nutrient and vitamin supplementation for ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is standard across most experimental conditions. [[Murashige and Skoog medium|Murashige &amp; Skoog]] (MS) nutrient mix and Gamborg's B5 vitamin mix in general are used. A 1.0% agar/0.44% MS+vitamin dH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solution is suitable for growth media between normal growth temps.

When using agar, within any growth medium, it is important to know that the solidification of the agar is pH-dependent. The optimal range for solidification is between 5.4-5.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Se-Kwon|title=Handbook of marine macroalgae : biotechnology and applied phycology|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780470979181|edition=1st imp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the application of KOH is needed to increase the pH to this range. A general guideline is about 600 µl 0.1M KOH per 250 ml GM. This entire mixture can be sterilized using the liquid cycle of an [[autoclave]].

This medium nicely lends itself to the application of specific concentrations of phytohormones etc. to induce specific growth patterns in that one can easily prepare a solution containing the desired amount of hormone, add it to the known volume of GM, and autoclave to both sterilize and evaporate off any solvent that may have been used to dissolve the often-polar hormones.

'''Aktiengesellschaft für Uhrenfabrikation Lenzkirch''' (''Public company for clockmaking Lenzkirch'') was founded in 1851 in the village of [[Lenzkirch]] in [[Baden]] by Eduard Hauser who had trained in France and Switzerland. It is in the tradition of [[Black Forest clockmakers]]. Hauser, the son of a teacher, was born on 21 August 1825 and gained experience of making music boxes with Johann George Schopperle. During this same period he gained a knowledge of metalworking, precision work and the design of musical instruments, as well as a proficiency in the composing of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clockguy.com/SiteRelated/SiteReferencePages/LenzkirchHistory.html|title=Antique Clocks Guy: We bring antique clocks collectors and buyers together. Always the highest quality antique clocks available.|website=Clockguy.com|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm acquired a reputation for building particularly fine [[Pendulum clock|regulators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lenzkirchclocks.com/vienna-regulator-history.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101170910/http://www.lenzkirchclocks.com/vienna-regulator-history.shtml |archive-date=2008-11-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the 1920s it still produced regulators with compensated pendulums and precision movements. The firm was later taken over by [[Junghans]] and the factory closed down in 1932, at which period the market for wall regulators had collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.snclocks.com/545.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109172658/http://snclocks.com/545.htm |archive-date=2010-01-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alstom Coradia LINT''' is a single-unit or two-unit [[Articulated car|articulated]] [[Passenger car (rail)|railcar]] manufactured by [[Alstom]], offered in diesel and hydrogen models. The [[acronym]] ''LINT'' is short for the German ''"leichter innovativer Nahverkehrstriebwagen"'' (light innovative local transport rail vehicle). It was designed by [[Linke-Hofmann-Busch]] (LHB; acquired 1996 by Alstom) and has been distributed as part of Alstom’s [[Coradia (train)|Coradia]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.de.alstom.com/home/DE_HomeLeft/alstom_in_germany_2009/transport_in_germany/regional/coradia_lint/_files/file_61507_92735.pdf www.de.alstom.com] CORADIA LINT Attractive Solutions for your Region - Retrieved on 2010-05-01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The type designation gives the vehicle's length: The one-piece type LINT 27 has a length of {{convert|27.26|m|ftin}} and is also known as ''Baureihe 640'' (DB class 640) of [[Deutsche Bahn]]. The two-part train, LINT 41, is {{convert|41.89|m|ftin}} long. In Germany it is called ''Baureihe 648'' ([[DB Class 648]]).

The Alstom Coradia LINT is part of Alstom Coradia family of [[Inter-city rail|Inter-city trains]] which includes [[multiple unit]] diesel (DMU) or electric (EMU) as well as [[Bilevel rail car|double-decker]] trains. The LINT family offers capacities ranging from 70 to 300 seated passengers. They operate at speeds ranging from {{convert|100|to|180|km/h|abbr=on}}. 

The Coradia trains are manufactured in [[Salzgitter]] in Germany, [[Reichshoffen]] in France and [[Savigliano]] in Italy.

The Italian adaptation is called '''Coradia Minuetto''', and the French version, used in France and [[Luxembourg]], is classed as [[SNCF Class X 73500|Class X 73500]] (A-TER).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmag.transport.alstom.com/eMag/externe/international/Germany/innotrans/2004_en/2/383.asp www.webmag.transport.alstom.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905165412/http://www.webmag.transport.alstom.com/eMag/externe/international/Germany/innotrans/2004_en/2/383.asp |date=2008-09-05 }} CORADIA LINT: A vehicle with many faces - Retrieved on 2010-05-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===LINT 27===
The one-piece [[railcar]]s have {{convert|315|kW|adj=on|lk=on}} engines and a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}}. The train has 52 2nd class seats, eight 1st class 1 seats and 13 [[Folding seat|tip-up seats]]. Up to three cars can run together in [[multiple unit]] form.

The trains are predominantly used on non-electrified light railways in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] amongst other regions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Both the LINT 41 and LINT 54 consist of two parts. The longer carriage length of the LINT 54 allows for an extra set of doors per carriage, whilst the LINT 41 has only one set per carriage. Some transportation companies offer ticket machines in the door area. The two-piece railcars have two {{convert|315|kW|adj=on}} engines.

The trains are mainly used in [[Northern Germany]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. They are also quite popular in other European countries. For example, in [[Denmark]] they are being used by the largest non-state-owned operator, [[Arriva]] (a total of 43 units: 30 delivered in 2004-2005, 11 delivered in 2010–11 and 2 delivered in 2012) as well as by [[Lokalbanen A/S]] and [[Regionstog]] (a total of 42 units delivered in 2006-2007). In the eastern provinces of the [[Netherlands]], they are operated by [[Syntus]] which is now [[Keolis Nederland]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.keolis.nl/over-keolis-nederland/wie-zijn-we&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also used in [[Canada]]. Alstom delivered six new trains to operate on the [[O-Train]] [[Trillium Line]] in [[Ottawa]]. The new trains went into service on 2 March 2015, displacing the previous [[Bombardier Talent]] fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/2015/3/alstom-coradia-lint-commuter-trains-start-commercial-service-in-ottawa/ |title=Alstom Coradia Lint commuter trains start commercial service in Ottawa |date=2016-01-15 |publisher=Alstom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lint 41 has 115 seats, while the Lint 54 can have between 150 and 180 seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alstom.com/Germany/products-and-services/transport/regional-trains/coradia-lint/ www.de.alstom.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012705/http://www.alstom.com/Germany/products-and-services/transport/regional-trains/coradia-lint/ |date=2014-04-19 }} CORADIA LINT Attractive Solutions for your Region  - Retrieved on 2014-04-17&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The LINT 81 is a three carriage set, with two driving vehicles with cabs, and an intermediate vehicle for passenger accommodation only.

In September 2012, Netinera ordered 63 Coradia LINT trains from Alstom, which would be used on services in [[Rheinland-Pfalz]]. The order included some LINT 54 DMUs (160 seats) and 18 Lint 81 (270 seats).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/netinera-orders-63-regional-trains-from-alstom.html|accessdate=24 September 2012|title=Netinera orders 63 regional trains from Alstom  - Railway Gazette|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''batman''' ({{IPA-tr|batˈman}}) was a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]] used in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and among Turkic peoples of the [[Russian Empire]]. It has also been recorded as a unit of [[area]] in [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]-speaking regions of Central Asia.

The ''man'' as a unit of weight is thought to be of at least [[Chaldea]]n origin,&lt;ref name="Hayyim"/&gt; with [[Henry Yule|Sir Henry Yule]] attributing [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] origins to the word.&lt;ref name="OEDmaund"&gt;{{citation |contribution= maund |title= [[Oxford English Dictionary|A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles]] |volume= 6B |year= 1908 |page= 250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''[[maneh (unit)|maneh]]'' (מנה) and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[mina (unit)|mina]]'' (μνᾶ) are thought to be cognate.&lt;ref name="OEDmaund"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Prinsep, James |year= 1840 |title= Useful tables, forming an appendix to the Journal of the Asiatic Society: part the first, Coins, weights, and measures of British India |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LTYGAAAAQAAJ |edition= 2nd |location= Calcutta |publisher= Bishop's College Press |page= 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally equal to one-ninth of the weight of an ''[[artaba]]'' of water,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Doursther |first= Horace |title= Dictionnaire universel des poids et mesures anciens et modernes |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KAibOR651tkC |location= Brussels |publisher= Hayez |year= 1840 |pages= 51–52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately four [[kilogram]]s in modern units. [[Halil İnalcık|İnalcık]] believes the [[Persian language|ancient Persian]] ''patimāna'' may have come from the late [[Syriac language|Assyrian]] word for "mana of the king".&lt;ref name="sizes.com"&gt;{{citation | title = batman | url = http://www.sizes.com/units/batman.htm | publisher = sizes.com | accessdate = 2010-02-11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''man'' or ''batman'' spread throughout Arabia and Persia: it was adopted by the Ottoman Empire, and brought to India by the [[Mughal Empire]]. The first attestation which gives a comparison to European weights was by [[Francesco Balducci Pegolotti|Pegolotti]] in his ''[[Pratica della mercatura]]'', written about 1340. He reported the ''batman'' as the main unit of mass in Ayasluğ ("Altoluogo di Turchia" to Pegolotti; modern [[Selçuk]], in western [[Turkey]]), equivalent to 32&amp;nbsp;[[Genoa|Genoese]] pounds (''libbre'').&lt;ref name="sizes.com"/&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
The batman (or bateman) was first recorded in English in 1599, in [[Babylon]] (probably modern [[Baghdad]]), where it was said to be equal to "7&amp;nbsp;pound and 5&amp;nbsp;ounces English weight".&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; In the central Ottoman system of weights, the batman was equal to six [[Oka (unit)|okas]], as is attested in 1811 in [[Aleppo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Kelly |first= Patrick |authorlink= Patrick Kelly (metrologist) |title= The Universal Cambist, and commercial instructor; being a general treatise on exchange, including the monies, coins, weights and measures of all trading nations and colonies: with an account of their banks and paper currencies |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EEuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |location= London |publisher= Lackingon, Allen, &amp; Co |year= 1811 |page= 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 1821 in Baghdad&lt;ref name="Prinsep"&gt;{{citation |author= Prinsep, James |year= 1840 |title= Useful tables, forming an appendix to the Journal of the Asiatic Society: part the first, Coins, weights, and measures of British India |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LTYGAAAAQAAJ |edition= 2nd |location= Calcutta |publisher= Bishop's College Press |pages= 84–90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1850 in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; At this point, the batman was equal to 16&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] 8&amp;nbsp;[[Ounce|oz]] [[avoirdupois]] (7.484&amp;nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]).&lt;ref name="Prinsep"/&gt;

The ''mann'' ( مَنّ ) had doubtless formed a part of the Arabian system of weights before the arrival of the Ottomans. It was divided into ''[[Awqiyyah|uqiyya]]s'' (the number varying with the location), while ten ''mann'' made one ''[[frazil]]''.&lt;ref name="Prinsep"/&gt; A still larger unit of mass was the ''[[bahar (unit)|bahar]]'', of ten to forty ''frazils''.&lt;ref name="Prinsep"/&gt; The Arabic ''mann'' was smaller than the Ottoman ''batman'' at about 2–3&amp;nbsp;lb av. (1–1½&amp;nbsp;kg), except in [[Basra]] where there were two [[maund]]s in use, both much larger than either the Arabic ''mann'' or the Ottoman ''batman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Kelly |first= Patrick |authorlink= Patrick Kelly (metrologist) |title= The Universal Cambist, and commercial instructor; being a general treatise on exchange, including the monies, coins, weights and measures of all trading nations and colonies: with an account of their banks and paper currencies |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EEuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |location= London |publisher= Lackingon, Allen, &amp; Co |year= 1811 |pages= 46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
The Turkish system of weights and measures was [[Metrification|metrified]] in 1931. The ''oka'' was redefined as exactly one kilogram, while the ''batman'' became ten ''okas'' (10&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="sizes.com"/&gt;

==Central Asia==
The batman was used in Central Asia up until at least the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution= Consistency list for weights, measures, numbers |url= http://www.ai-press.com/SolclWandM.html |first= Sergei M. |last= Soloviev |title= History of Russia From Earliest Times |publisher= Academic International Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Khiva]] in 1740, there were said to be two batmans (as in Persia): the "great batman" of 18&amp;nbsp;[[Russian pound]]s ({{lang|ru|фунт}}, ''funt''; approx. 7.4&amp;nbsp;kg) and the "lesser batman" of 9¼&amp;nbsp;Russian pounds (approx. 3.8&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

In [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], the batman was also a measure of land area, the area that could be sown with one batman (in mass) of seed.&lt;ref name="sizes.com"/&gt;

The two main commercial weights in [[Iran|Persia]] were the ''tabrézy man'' ( من تبریز ), literally the ''man'' of [[Tabriz]], and the ''sháhy man'' ( من شاء ), literally the [[Shah]]'s ''man'', which was twice as large.&lt;ref name="Hayyim"/&gt; The ''sháhy man'' was particularly used in [[Shiraz]] and [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref name="Hayyim"/&gt; [[Patrick Kelly (metrologist)|Kelly]] also distinguishes a ''man'' used for [[copra]] and "provisions" at Gamron (modern [[Bandar-Abbas]]) of 7&amp;nbsp;lb 12&amp;nbsp;oz av. (3.5153&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="Prinsep"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] Statistical Office found a wide range of values for the ''man'' in [[Iran]] in 1966, from 3&amp;nbsp;kg to 53&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{citation |author= Statistical Office of the United Nations |title= World Weights and Measures.

===Afghanistan===
The ''mann'' ({{lang-ps|من}}) was and still is also used as a unit of mass in [[Afghanistan]], but varied widely between different localities. In [[Kandahar]] it was about 8&amp;nbsp;lb av. (3½&amp;nbsp;kg), while in [[Peshawar]] it was 80&amp;nbsp;lb av. (35&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Raverty |first= Henry George |authorlink= Henry George Raverty |title= A dictionary of the Puk'hto, Pus'hto, or language of the Afghans: with remarks on the originality of the language, and its affinity to other oriental tongues |edition= 2nd |url= http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/raverty/ |location= London |publisher= Williams and Norgate |year= 1867 |page= 936}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luftaufnahmen Nordseekueste 2012-05-by-RaBoe-478.jpg|thumb|"[[Red mud]]" storage facility in [[Stade]], [[Germany]]. The aluminium industry generates over a hundred million tons of this waste annually.]]
'''Bauxite [[tailings]]''', [[Red mud|bauxite residue]] or alumina refinery residues (ARR) is a by-product in the production of [[alumina]] (aluminium oxide).  Alumina is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of [[aluminium]] metal and also widely used in the manufacture of ceramics, abrasives and refractories.  The scale of production makes the waste product an important one, and issues with its storage are reviewed and every opportunity is explored to find uses for it.  Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is through the [[Bayer process]]; for every tonne of alumina produced, approximately 1 to 1.5 tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue are also produced.  Annual production of alumina in 2015 was approximately 115 million tonnes resulting in the generation of about 150 million tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/alumina-production/ Annual statistics collected and published by World Aluminium].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
There are over 60 manufacturing operations across the world using the [[Bayer process]] to make [[alumina]] from [[bauxite]] ore.  Bauxite ore is mined, normally in open cast mines, and transferred to an alumina refinery for processing.  To extract the alumina, the soluble part of the bauxite ore is dissolved using sodium hydroxide under conditions of high temperature and pressure.  The insoluble part of the bauxite (the residue) is removed, giving rise to a solution of [[sodium aluminate]], which is then seeded and allowed to cool and [[aluminium hydroxide]] precipitates from the solution. Though some of the aluminium hydroxide is then returned and used to seed the next batch, the remainder is calcined (heated) at over 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to produce aluminium oxide (alumina). The alumina content of the bauxite used is normally about 50% but ores with a much wider range of alumina contents can be used; the aluminium compound may be present as [[gibbsite]] (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[boehmite]] (AlOOH) or [[diaspore]] (AlOOH).  The tailings/residue invariably has a high concentration of [[iron oxide]] which gives the product a characteristic red colour.  A small residual amount of the sodium hydroxide used in the process remains with the tailings, causing the material to have a high pH/alkalinity, normally &gt;12. Various stages in the solid/liquid separation process are introduced to recycle as much sodium hydroxide as possible from the residue back into the Bayer Process in order to make the process as efficient as possible and reduce production costs. This also lowers the final alkalinity of the tailings making it easier to handle.

==Composition==
The main constituents of the residue after the extraction of the aluminium component are unreacted metallic oxides. The percentage of these oxides produced by a particular alumina refinery will depend on the quality and nature of the bauxite ore and the extraction conditions. The table below shows the composition ranges for common chemical constituents, but the values vary widely:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Chemical !! Percentage composition
|-
| Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || 5–60%
|-
| Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || 5–30%
|-
| TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 0.3–15%
|-
| CaO || 2–14%
|-
| SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || 3–50%
|-
| Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O || 1–10%
|}

Mineralogically expressed the components present are:

|-
| [[Calcium carbonate]] || CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || 2–10%
|-
| [[Gibbsite]] || Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || 0–5%
|-
| [[Kaolinite]] || Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;⋅2SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;⋅2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O || 0–5%
|}

The objective is to remove as much of the aluminium containing component as economically possible. In general, the composition of the residue reflects that of the non-aluminium components, with the exception of part of the silicon component: crystalline silica (quartz) will not react but some of the silica present, often termed, reactive silica, will react under the extraction conditions and form sodium aluminium silicate.

==Residue storage areas (RSA)==
Tailings storage methods have changed substantially since the original plants were built. The practice in early years was to pump the tailings slurry, at a concentration of about 20% solids, into lagoons or ponds sometimes created in former bauxite mines or depleted quarries. In other cases, impoundments were constructed with dams or [[levee]]s, whilst for some operations valleys were dammed and the tailings deposited in these holding areas.&lt;ref&gt;K. Evans, E. Nordheim and K. Tsesmelis, "Bauxite Residue Management", Light Metals, 63–66 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also common practice for the tailings to be discharged into rivers, estuaries, or the sea via pipelines or barges; in other instances the residue was shipped out to sea and disposed of in deep ocean trenches many kilometres offshore. All disposal in the sea, estuaries and rivers has now stopped.&lt;ref&gt;G. Power, M. Graefe and C. Klauber, "Bauxite residue issues: Current Management, Disposal and Storage Practices", Hydrometallurgy, 108, 33–45 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As residue storage space ran out and concern increased over wet storage, since the mid-1980s dry stacking has been increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;B. G. Purnell, “Mud Disposal at the Burntisland Alumina Plant”. Light Metals, 157–159. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Pohland and A. J. Tielens, “Design and Operation on Non-decanted Red Mud Ponds in Ludwigshafen”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;E. I. Robinsky, “Current Status of the Sloped Thickened Tailings Disposal System”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Chandler, “The Stacking and Solar Drying Process for disposal of bauxite tailings in Jamaica”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
In this method, tailings are thickened to a high density slurry (48-55% solids or higher), and then deposited in a way that it consolidates and dries.&lt;ref&gt;“Bauxite Residue Management: Best Practice”, published by World Aluminium the European Aluminium available from the International Aluminium Institute, 10 King Charles II Street, London, SW1Y 4AA, UK and on line from http://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/refining/bauxite-residue-management.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing popular storage method is filtration whereby a filter cake (typically &lt;30% solids) is produced. This cake can be washed with either water or steam to reduce alkalinity before being transported and stored as a semi-dried material.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Sutherland, "Solid/Liquid Separation Equipment", Wiley-VCH, Weinheim (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Residue produced in this form is ideal for reuse as it has lower alkalinity, is cheaper to transport, and is easier to handle and process.

==Uses==
Since the [[Bayer process]] was first adopted industrially in 1894, the value of the remaining oxides has been recognised. Attempts have been made to recover the principal components – especially iron. Since mining began, an enormous amount of research effort has been devoted to seeking uses for the residue. Possible applications can be broadly broken down into various categories:
recovery of specific components present in the tailings/residue, e.g. iron, [[titanium]], [[rare-earth element]]s REEs;
use as a major component in manufacture of another product, e.g. [[cement]]; use of the bauxite residue as a component in building or construction material, e.g. concrete, tiles, bricks; soil amelioration or capping; and conversion of the residue to a useful compound, such as through the Virotec process.

The wide compositional range of the residue has resulted in an enormous number of technically feasible applications including: cement manufacture, use in concrete as a supplementary cementious material, iron recovery, titanium recovery, use in building panels, bricks, foamed insulating bricks, tiles, gravel/railway ballast, soil amelioration, calcium and silicon fertiliser, refuse tip capping/site restoration, lanthanides (rare earths) recovery, scandium recovery, gallium recovery, yttrium recovery, treatment of acid mine drainage, adsorbent of heavy metals, dyes, phosphates, fluoride, water treatment chemical, glass ceramics, ceramics, foamed glass, pigments, oil drilling or gas extraction, filler for PVC, wood substitute, geopolymers, catalysts, plasma spray coating of aluminium and copper, manufacture of aluminium titanate-Mullite composites for high temperature resistant coatings, desulfurisation of flue gas, arsenic removal, chromium removal, soil amelioration.&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Parekh and W. M. Goldberger, “An assessment of technology for the possible utilization of Bayer process muds”, published by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA 600/2-76-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that some 2 to 3.5 million tonnes of the bauxite residue produced annually is used in some way:

* Cement – 500,000 to 1,500,000 tonnes;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Pontikes and G. N. Angelopoulos "Bauxite residue in Cement and cementious materials", Resourc. Conserv. Recyl. 73, 53–63 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Pontikes, G. N. Angelopoulos, B. Blanpain,, “Radioactive elements in Bayer’s process bauxite residue and their impact in valorization options”, Transportation of NORM, NORM Measurements and Strategies, Building Materials, Advances in Sci. and Tech, 45, 2176–2181 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Raw material in iron and steel production – 400,000 to 1,500,000 tonnes;
* Landfill capping/roads/soil amelioration – 200,000 to 500,000 tonnes;&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Biswas and D. J. Cooling, “Sustainability Assessment of Red SandTM as a substitute for Virgin Sand and Crushed Limestone”, J. of Ind. Ecology, 17(5) 756–762 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Construction materials (bricks, tiles, ceramics etc.) – 100,000 to 300,000 tonnes;
* Other (refractory, adsorbent, acid mine drainage (Virotec), catalyst etc.) – 100,000 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;H. Genc¸-Fuhrman, J. C. Tjell, D. McConchie, "Adsorption of arsenic from water using activated neutralized red mud", Environ. Sci. Technol. 38 (2004) 2428–2434.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a major initiative was launched in Europe with funds from the European Union to address the [[valorisation]] of bauxite residue. Some 15 Ph.D students have been recruited as part the European Training Network for Zero-Waste Valorisation of Bauxite Residue.&lt;ref&gt;http://etn.redmud.org/project/&lt;/ref&gt; The key focus will be the recovery of iron, aluminium, titanium and rare-earth elements (including [[scandium]]) while valorising the residue into building materials.

'''Bone cements''' have been used very successfully to anchor [[artificial joint]]s ([[hip joint]]s, [[knee joint]]s, [[shoulder joint|shoulder]] and [[elbow joint]]s) for more than half a century. Artificial joints (referred to as prostheses) are anchored with bone cement. The bone cement fills the free space between the prosthesis and the [[bone]] and plays the important role of an elastic zone. This is necessary because the human hip is acted on by approximately 10-12 times the body weight and therefore the bone cement must absorb the forces acting on the hips to ensure that the artificial implant remains in place over the long term.

Bone cement chemically is nothing more than Plexiglas (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate or PMMA). [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] was used clinically for the first time in the 1940s in plastic surgery to close gaps in the skull. Comprehensive clinical tests of the compatibility of bone cements with the body were conducted before their use in [[surgery]]. The excellent tissue compatibility of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] allowed bone cements to be used for anchorage of head prostheses in the 1950s.

Today several million procedures of this type are conducted every year all over the world and more than half of them routinely use bone cements - and the proportion is increasing. Bone cement is considered a reliable anchorage material with its ease of use in clinical practice and particularly because of its proven long survival rate with cemented-in prostheses. [[Hip]] and [[knee]] registers for artificial joint replacements such as those in Sweden and Norway&lt;ref  name="norwegian 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is there still a place for the cemented titanium femoral stem? 10,108 cases from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register|journal=[[Acta Orthopaedica]]|year=2012|volume=83|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.3109/17453674.2011.645194|pmid=22206445|pmc=3278649}}&lt;/ref&gt; clearly demonstrate the advantages of cemented-in anchorage. A similar register for endoprosthesis was introduced in Germany in 2010.&lt;ref name="EPRDWasIst"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eprd.de/wir-ueber-uns/ |title=Wir über uns |work=Endoprothesenregister Deutschland |publisher=EPRD Deutsche Endoprothesenregister GmbH |accessdate=22 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225233324/http://www.eprd.de/wir-ueber-uns/# |archive-date=2016-02-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Bone cements are provided as two-component materials. Bone cements consist of a powder (i.e., pre-polymerized PMMA and or PMMA or [[Methyl methacrylate|MMA]] co-polymer beads and or amorphous powder, radio-opacifer, initiator) and a liquid (MMA monomer, stabilizer, inhibitor). The two components are mixed and a free [[radical polymerization]] occurs of the [[monomer]] when the initiator is mixed with the accelerator.  The bone cement [[viscosity]] changes over time from a runny liquid into a dough like state that can be safely applied and then finally hardens into solid hardened material.&lt;ref name="norwegian 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The effect of the type of cement on early revision of Charnley total hip prostheses. A review of eight thousand five hundred and seventy-nine primary arthroplasties from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register|journal=[[The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery]]|year=1995|volume=77|issue=10|pages=1543–1550|pmid=7593063}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The set time can be tailored to help the physician safely apply the bone cement into the bone bed to either anchor metal or plastic prosthetic device to bone or used alone in the spine to treat osteoporotic compression fractures.

During the [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] free-radical polymerization process, the cement heats up. This polymerization heat reaches temperatures of around 82-86&amp;nbsp;°C in the body. This temperature is higher than the critical level for [[protein]] denaturation in the body. The cause of the low polymerization temperature in the body is the relatively thin cement coating, which should not exceed 5&amp;nbsp;mm, and the temperature dissipation via the large prosthesis surface and the flow of blood.

The individual components of the bone cement are also known in the area of dental filler materials. [[Acrylate]]-based plastics are also used in these applications. While the individual components are not always perfectly safe as pharmaceutical additives and active substances per se, as bone cement the individual substances are either converted or fully enclosed in the cement matrix during the polymerization phase from the increase in viscosity to curing. From current knowledge, cured bone cement can now be classified as safe, as originally demonstrated during the early studies on compatibility with the body conducted in the 1950s.

More recently bone cement has been use in the spine in either [[vertebroplasty]] or [[kyphoplasty]] procedures. The composition of these types of cement is mostly based on calcium phosphate and more recently magnesium phosphate. A novel biodegradable, non-exothermic, self-setting orthopedic cement composition  based on amorphous magnesium phosphate (AMP) was developed. The occurrence of undesirable exothermic reactions was avoided through using AMP as the solid precursor  &lt;ref&gt; Evaluation of amorphous magnesium phosphate (AMP) based non-exothermic orthopedic cements, Biomed. Mater. 11 (2016) 055010, https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-6041/11/5/055010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important information for the use of bone cement==
What is referred to as bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) is described in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Br. J. Anaesth. (2009) 102 (1): 12-22.
doi: 10.1093/bja/aen328&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time it was believed that the incompletely converted monomer released from bone cement was the cause of circulation reactions and [[embolism]]. However, it is now known that this monomer (residual monomer) is [[metabolism|metabolized]] by the respiratory chain and split into [[carbon dioxide]] and water and excreted. Embolisms can always occur during anchorage of artificial joints when material is inserted into the previously cleared femoral canal. The result is intramedullary pressure increase, potentially driving fat into the circulation.

If the patient is known to have any allergies to constituents of the bone cement, according to current knowledge bone cement should not be used to anchor the prosthesis. Anchorage without cement - cement-free implant placement - is the alternative.

New bone cement formulations require characterization according to ASTM F451.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/F451.htm ASTM F451: Standard Specification for Acrylic Bone Cement]&lt;/ref&gt; This standard describes the test methods to assess cure rate, residual monomer, mechanical strength, benzoyl peroxide concentration, and heat evolution during cure.

==Revisions==
Revision is the replacement of a prosthesis. This means that a prosthesis previously implanted in the body is removed and replaced by a new prosthesis. Compared to the initial operation revisions are often more complex and more difficult, because every revision involves the loss of healthy bone substance. Revision operations are also more expensive for a satisfactory result. The most important goal is therefore to avoid revisions by using a good surgical procedure and using products with good (long-term) results.

Unfortunately, it is not always possible to avoid revisions.&lt;ref name="norwegian 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norwegian 1995" /&gt; There can also be different reasons for revisions and there is a distinction between septic or aseptic revision.&lt;ref name="experimental cement strength"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Experimental investigation of the effect of surface roughness on bone-cement-implant shear bond strength|journal=[[Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials]]|year=2013|volume=28|pages=254–262|doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.08.005|pmid=24004958}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is necessary to replace an implant without confirmation of an infection—for example, aseptic—the cement is not necessarily removed completely. However, if the implant has loosened for septic reasons, the cement must be fully removed to clear an infection. In the current state of knowledge it is easier to remove cement than to release a well-anchored cement-free prosthesis from the bone site. Ultimately it is important for the stability of the revised prosthesis to detect possible loosening of the initial implant early to be able to retain as much healthy bone as possible.

A prosthesis fixed with bone cement offers very high primary stability combined with fast remobilization of patients. The cemented-in prosthesis can be fully loaded very soon after the operation because the PMMA gets most of its strength within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="experimental cement strength" /&gt; The necessary rehabilitation is comparatively simple for patients who have had a cemented-in prosthesis implanted. The joints can be loaded again very soon after the operation, but the use of crutches is still required for a reasonable period for safety reasons.

Bone cement has proven particularly useful because specific active substances, e.g. antibiotics, can be added to the powder component. The active substances are released locally after implant placement of the new joint, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the new prosthesis and have been confirmed to reduce the danger of infection. The antibiotics act against bacteria precisely at the site where they are required in the open wound without subjecting the body in general to unnecessarily high antibiotic levels. This makes bone cement a modern drug delivery system that delivers the required drugs directly to the surgical site. The important factor is not how much active substance is in the cement matrix but how much of the active substance is actually released locally. Too much active substance in the bone cement would actually be detrimental, because the mechanical stability of the fixed prosthesis is weakened by a high proportion of active substance in the cement. The local active substance levels of industrially manufactured bone cements that are formed by the use of bone cements that contain active substances are approximate (assuming that there is no incompatibility) and are significantly below the clinical routine dosages for systemic single injections.

The '''Clarkston explosion''' was a disaster that occurred on 21 October 1971 at a [[shopping centre]] in [[Clarkston, East Renfrewshire|Clarkston]], [[Renfrewshire]], [[Scotland]]. The death toll has been stated variously as 21&lt;ref name="glasher"/&gt; and 22.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=The Herald (Scotland) |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/the-day-22-died-as-explosion-blasted-shopping-centre-event-the-clarkston-disaster-date-october-21-1971-1.136179 |title=The day 22 died as explosion blasted shopping centre |date=19 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion followed a build-up of gas in an underground space beneath the Clarkston Toll shopping centre, caused by a [[gas main]] leak later ruled to have been accidental.&lt;ref name="glasher"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Disaster jury says no one was to blame |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HZZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I6UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5007,2094378&amp;dq=clarkston+explosion&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Glasgow Herald]] |date=11 February 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers and shop staff had on 20 October complained of a strong smell of gas in the centre and [[Scottish Gas]] engineers had attended to investigate, but had identified no source for the smell.&lt;ref name="glasher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; The engineers were still in attendance at around 2:50pm on the 21st when the gas ignited and exploded, killing at least 21 people and injuring around 100.&lt;ref name="glasher2"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Formal verdict returned on 21 Clarkston victims |newspaper=Glasgow Herald |date=11 February 1972 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HZZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I6UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4794,2114894&amp;dq=clarkston+explosion&amp;hl=en |first=James |last=Murphy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims included many shop staff and people on shopping trips, and the passengers of a bus that had been passing the scene.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;  The explosion destroyed several shops and a terraced car park. 

An inquiry was held, and a jury on 11 February 1972 returned a verdict that no fault for the explosion lay with any organization or individual. No cause was identified for the ignition of the leaked gas, and the leak itself was deemed the result of an accidental gas main fracture caused by "stress and corrosion".&lt;ref name="glasher2"/&gt;

The victims of the disaster are commemorated in a plaque erected in 2001/2 near the site of the explosion.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; 

There is a further tribute to those who lost their lives situated in the entranceway to the Clarkston Halls.

[[File:Coal burner in Thailand.jpg|330px|thumbnail|right|Coal burner working as a components of asphalt plant in Thailand]]
A '''coal burner''' (or pulverized coal burner) is a mechanical device that burns [[pulverized coal]] (also known as powdered coal or [[coal dust]] since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) into a flame in a controlled manner.
Coal burner is mainly composed of pulverized coal machine, host of combustion machine (including combustion chamber, automatic back and forth motion system, automatic rotation system, the combustion air supply system) control system, ignition system, the crater and others.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Pulverized-coal-burners.jpg|thumb|300px|Main Structure of Pulverized Coal Burner]]
In the worksite, a coal burner works with the coal pulverizer and coal hopper usually. The coal in the hopper is conveyed to the coal pulverizer by screw conveyor.  The coal pulverizer will crush the coal into pulverized coal. In the coal burner, the pulverized coal mixes with air (High-speed air flow is generated by the draft fan on the coal burner), and is ignited by the oil burning igniter.

== Ignition ==
There are mainly two ways to ignite the coal burner. Manual way and automatic way, no matter which way it adopts, the coal burner often needs fuel (oil, gas, etc.) as the combustion medium. The difference is that the high-energy ignition devices which generate sparks replace people's hands.&lt;ref name="Ignition Methods"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ignition System of Pulverized Coal Burner|url=http://www.pulverizedcoalburner.com/ignition-system-of-pulverized-coal-burner/|website=Pulverized Coal Burners|publisher=Bertrand|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Pulverized coal burners have a wide range of uses in industrial production and daily life, such as providing heat for boilers, hot mix [[asphalt plant]], cement kiln, metal furnace, annealing, quenching furnace, precision casting shell burning furnace, melting furnace, forging furnace and other heating furnace or kiln.

== Requirements for coal ==
* Mark of coal: bituminous coal;
* Gross calorific value: ≥5000kcal/kg (≥ 20000kJ/kg); 
* Net calorific value: ≥4200kcal/kg;
* Volatile matter: ≥25%;
* Ash Content: ≤10%; 
* Total moisture: ≤35%; 
* Inherent moisture: ≤14%; 
* Total sulphur: ≤1%; 
* Particle size: ≤20mm.
''Note: These indexes are the lowest requirements for the coal, the better coal will be better at practice.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">The '''convective condensation level''' ('''CCL''') represents the height (or pressure) where an [[air parcel]] becomes [[Saturated fluid|saturated]] when heated from below and lifted [[adiabatic]]ally due to buoyancy.

In the atmosphere, assuming a constant water vapor mixing ratio, the dew point temperature (the temperature where the
relative humidity is 100%) decreases with increasing height because the pressure of the atmosphere decreases with height. The CCL is determined by plotting the dew point (100%RH) verses altitude and locating the intersection with the actual measured temperature sounding. It marks where the [[cloud base]] begins when air is heated from below to the [[convective temperature]], without mechanical lift. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jeff|first1=Haby|title=The difference between the LCL and the CCL|url=http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints/160/|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the CCL is determined, the surface temperature necessary to raise a mass of air to that height can be found by using the [[Lapse_rate#Dry_adiabatic_lapse_rate|Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate]] (DALR) to determine the potential temperature. In the early morning, this temperature is typically larger than the surface temperature, in the mid-afternoon, it may be the same.

Compare this to the [[Lifting condensation level|Lifting Condensation Level]] (LCL) where the air is lifted and cooled without first increasing the surface temperature. The LCL is less than or equal to the CCL depending on the temperature profile.

Both condensation levels indicate the altitude (or pressure) where relative humidity reaches 100%. However, since the actual condensation level depends on the availability of condensation nuclei, clouds typically do not form until the relative humidity is somewhat above 100%.

The [[electrostatics|Coulombic repulsion]] of particles having the same [[electric charge]] can break the bonds that hold solids together.  When done with a narrow laser beam, a small amount of solid explodes into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of [[ion]]ized atomic particles. It may be shown that the Coulomb explosion
occurs in the same critical parameter regime as the [[superradiant phase transition]] i.e. when the destabilizing interactions become overwhelming and dominate over the native oscillatory [[phonon]] solid cluster binding motions which is also characteristic for the [[Synthetic diamond|diamond synthesis]].

With their low mass, outer [[valence electrons]] responsible for [[chemical bond]]ing are easily stripped from atoms, leaving them positively charged.  Given a mutually [[repulsive state]] between atoms whose chemical bonds are broken, the material explodes into a small plasma cloud of energetic ions with higher velocities than seen in thermal emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Non-thermal ablation of expanded [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] with an intense femtosecond-pulse laser |first1= M. |last1= Hashida |first2= H. |last2= Mishima |first3= S. |last3= Tokita |first4= S. |last4= Sakabe |journal= [[Optics Express]] |year= 2009 |volume= 17 |issue= 15 |pages= 13116–13121 |doi= 10.1364/OE.17.013116 |bibcode = 2009OExpr..1713116H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Coulomb explosion is one particular mechanism that permits laser-based machining.

Coulomb explosions for industrial machining are made with ultra-short (picosecond or femtoseconds) laser pulses.  The enormous beam intensities required (10–400 terawatt per square centimeter thresholds, depending on material){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} are only practical to generate, shape, and deliver for very brief instants of time.

A Coulomb explosion is a "cold" alternative to the dominant laser etching technique of thermal [[ablation]], which depends on local heating, melting, and vaporization of molecules and atoms using less-intense beams.  Pulse brevity down only to the nanosecond regime is sufficient to localize thermal ablation &amp;ndash; before the heat is conducted far, the energy input (pulse) has ended.  Nevertheless, thermally ablated materials may seal pores important in catalysis or battery operation, and recrystallize or even burn the substrate, thus changing the physical and chemical properties at the etch site. In contrast, even light foams remain unsealed after ablation by Coulomb explosion.

Coulomb explosion etching can be used in any material to bore holes, remove surface layers, and texture and microstructure surfaces; e.g., to control ink loading in printing presses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= D. |last= Müller |title= Picosecond Lasers for High-Quality Industrial Micromachining |journal= [[Photonics Spectra]] |date=November 2009 |pages= 46–47 |url= http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=40296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[nuclear explosion]] based on the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] of uranium, 167 [[MeV]] is emitted in the form of a coulombic explosion between each prior nuclei of uranium, the repulsive electrostatic energy between the two fission [[fission product|daughter nuclei]],  translates into the [[kinetic energy]] of the [[fission product]]s that results in both the primary driver of the [[blackbody radiation]] that rapidly generates the hot dense plasma/[[nuclear fireball]] formation and thus also both later blast and thermal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medical Consequences of Nuclear Warfare|last=Alt|first=Leonard A.|last2=Forcino|first2=Douglas|last3=Walker|first3=Richard I.|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|others=|year=2000|isbn=9780160591341|editor-last=Cerveny|editor-first=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5706">'''Electrical bonding''' is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting all exposed metallic items not designed to carry electricity in a room or building  as protection from [[electric shock]]. If a failure of electrical insulation occurs, all bonded metal objects in the room will have substantially the same electrical potential, so that an occupant of the room cannot touch two objects with significantly different potentials. Even if the connection to a distant earth ground is lost, the occupant will be protected from dangerous [[potential difference]]s.

==Explanation==
In a building with electricity it is normal for safety reasons to connect all metal objects such as pipes together to  the [[Mains electricity|mains]] earth to form an [[equipotential]] zone. This is done in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] because many buildings are supplied with a [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] supply cable where the neutral and earth conductors are combined. Close to the [[electricity meter]] this conductor is divided into two, the ''earth'' terminal and the wire going to the [[Ground and neutral|neutral]] [[busbar]] in the [[consumer unit]]. If the ground connection to the neutral is lost, all wiring and other objects tied to the neutral will be energized at the line voltage. Examples of articles that may be bonded include metallic water piping systems, gas piping, ducts for central heating and air conditioning systems, and exposed metal parts of buildings such as hand rails, stairs, ladders, platforms and floors. 

A person touching the un-earthed metal casing of an electrical device, while also in contact with a metal object connected to remote earth, is exposed to an [[electric shock]] hazard if the device has a fault. If all metal objects are connected, all the metal objects in the building will be at the same potential. It then will not be possible to get a shock by touching two 'earthed' objects at once.

Bonding is particularly important for bathrooms, swimming pools and fountains. In pools and fountains, any metallic object (other than conductors of the power circuit) over a certain size must be bonded to assure that all conductors are at the same potential.  Since it is buried in the ground, a pool can be a better ground than the electric panel ground. With all the conducting elements bonded, it is less likely that electric current will find a path through a swimmer. In concrete pools even the reinforcing bars of the concrete must be connected to the bonding system to ensure no dangerous potential gradients are produced during a fault.

==How the earth protects==

In a system with a grounded (earthed) neutral, connecting all non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment to earth ground at the main service panel will ensure that current due to faults (such as a "hot" wire touching the frame or chassis of the device) will be diverted to earth. In a [[earthing system|TN]] system where there is a direct connection from the installation earth to the transformer neutral, earthing will allow the branch circuit over-current protection (a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]]) to detect the fault rapidly and interrupt the circuit. 
 
In the case of a [[TT earthing system|TT]] system where the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is high due to the lack of direct connection to the [[transformer]] neutral, an [[Residual-current device|RCD]] must be used to provide disconnection. RCDs are also used in other situations where rapid disconnection of small earth faults (including a human touching a live wire by accident, or damage) is desired.

==Equipotential bonding==
Equipotential bonding involves joining together metalwork that is or may be earthed so that it is at the same [[potential]] (i.e., voltage) everywhere.  Such is commonly used under transformer banks by power companies and under large computer installations. Exact rules for electrical installations vary by country, locality, or supplying power company.
 
Equipotential bonding is done from the Service Panel [[consumer unit]] (also known as a [[fuse box]], [[breaker box]], or [[distribution board]]) to incoming [[water]] and [[gas]] services. It is also done in [[bathrooms]] where all exposed metal that leaves the bathroom including [[metal]] pipes and the earths of electrical circuits must be bonded together to ensure that they are always at the same potential. Isolated metal objects, including metal fittings fed by plastic pipe, are not required to be bonded.
 
In [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]], a house's earth cables must be connected both to an earthing rod driven into the ground and also to the [[plumbing]] or [[gas]] pipe.
In [[Australia]] a house's earth cable must be connected to all reinforcing mesh in any concrete under any bathroom and in any swimming pool.

==Aircraft electrical bonding==
In aircraft, electrical bonding prevents static electricity build-up that can interfere with radio and navigational equipment. Bonding also provides [[lightning]] protection by allowing the current to pass through the airframe with minimum arcing. Bonding prevents dangerous static discharges in aircraft fuel tanks and hoses.&lt;ref name="aircraft"&gt;[http://www.mechanicsupport.com/hose_electrical_bonding.html Mechanic Support, "Aircraft hose and electrical bonding"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30489">'''Energy-efficient driving''' techniques are used by drivers who wish to reduce their fuel consumption, and thus maximize [[fuel efficiency]]. The use of these techniques is called "[[hypermiling]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypermiling Merriam Webster dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple fuel-efficiency techniques can result in reduction in fuel consumption without resorting to radical fuel-saving techniques that can be unlawful and dangerous, such as [[Drafting (aerodynamics)#Tailgating and hypermiling|tailgating larger vehicles]].&lt;ref name="Auto7L-4" /&gt;

==Techniques==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

===Maintenance===
Underinflated tires wear out faster and lose energy to [[rolling resistance]] because of tire deformation. The loss for a car is approximately 1.0% for every {{convert|2|psi|bar kPa|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} drop in pressure of all four tires.&lt;ref name="nrcan.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/transportation/cars-light-trucks/driving/7521&lt;/ref&gt; Improper [[wheel alignment]] and high engine oil [[kinematic viscosity]] also reduce fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name="stretchgas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diken" /&gt;

===Mass and improving aerodynamics===
Drivers can increase fuel efficiency by minimizing transported mass, i.e. the number of people or the amount of cargo, tools, and equipment carried in the vehicle. Removing common unnecessary accessories such as roof racks, brush guards, wind deflectors (or "[[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]]s", when designed for downforce and not enhanced flow separation), running boards, and push bars, as well as using narrower and lower profile tires will improve fuel efficiency by reducing weight, [[aerodynamic drag]], and [[rolling resistance]].&lt;ref name="Auto7L-7" /&gt; Some cars also use a half size spare tire, for weight/cost/space saving purposes. On a typical vehicle, every extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 2%.&lt;ref name="nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt;  Removing roof racks (and accessories) can decrease fuel consumption by up to 20%.&lt;ref name="nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt;

===Maintaining an efficient speed===
[[File:The 55 truck.jpg|thumb|right|A truck restricted to 55 mph]]
Maintaining an efficient speed is an important factor in fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name="Diken" /&gt; Optimal efficiency can be expected while cruising at a steady speed, at minimal throttle and with the transmission in the highest gear (see Choice of gear, below). The optimal speed varies with the type of vehicle, although it is usually reported to be between 35&amp;nbsp;mph (56&amp;nbsp;km/h) and 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/transportation/cars-light-trucks/fuel-efficient-driving-techniques/7513 | title=Fuel-efficient driving techniques| date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Impala" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahn" /&gt; For instance, a 2004 Chevrolet Impala had an optimum at 42&amp;nbsp;mph (70&amp;nbsp;km/h), and was within 15% of that from 29 to 57&amp;nbsp;mph (45 to 95&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="Impala"/&gt; At higher speeds, wind resistance plays an increasing role in reducing energy efficiency.

[[Hybrid vehicle|Hybrids]] typically get their best fuel efficiency below this model-dependent threshold speed. The car will automatically switch between either battery powered mode or engine power with battery recharge. [[Electric car]]s such as the [[Tesla Model S]] may go up to {{convert|728.7|km}} at 39&amp;nbsp;km/h (24&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=NylandDist&gt;Andersen, Ina.

Road capacity affects speed and therefore fuel efficiency as well. Studies have shown speeds just above {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} allow greatest throughput when roads are congested.&lt;ref name="Optimal Congested Throughput" /&gt; Individual drivers can improve their fuel efficiency and that of others by avoiding roads and times where traffic slows to below {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Communities can improve fuel efficiency by adopting [[speed limit]]s&lt;ref name="Int Panis"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X10000739 |title=PM, NOx and CO2 emission reductions from speed management policies in Europe |date=January 2011 |issn=0967-070X |accessdate=March 29, 2014 |subscription=yes |journal=Transport Policy |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=32–37 |doi=10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.05.005 |first1=L.

''[[Congestion pricing]]'' is based on this principle; it raises the price of road access at times of higher usage, to prevent cars from entering traffic and lowering speeds below efficient levels.

Research has shown that mandated speed limits can be modified to improve energy efficiency anywhere from 2% to 18%, depending on compliance with lower speed limits.&lt;ref name=transport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/transport/speed-limits |title=Do lower speed limits on motorways reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions? |publisher=European Environment Agency (EEA) |work=eea.europa.eu |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=March 29, 2014 |author= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329080227/http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/transport/speed-limits |archivedate=March 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of gear (manual transmissions)===
Engine efficiency varies with speed and torque. For driving at a steady speed one cannot choose any [[operating point]] for the engine—rather there is a specific amount of power needed to maintain the chosen speed. A manual transmission lets the driver choose between several points along the powerband. For a [[turbo diesel]] too low a gear will move the engine into a high-rpm, low-torque region in which the efficiency drops off rapidly, and thus best efficiency is achieved near the higher gear.&lt;ref name="tranchant"&gt;[http://s3.amazonaws.com/mark_tranchant/images/tdi-bsfc.png] Typical brake-specific fuel consumption map for a small turbo-diesel.&lt;/ref&gt; In a gasoline engine, efficiency typically drops off more rapidly than in a diesel because of throttling losses.&lt;ref name="Edgar" /&gt; Because cruising at an efficient speed uses much less than the maximum power of the engine, the optimum operating point for cruising at low power is typically at very low engine speed, around or below 1000&amp;nbsp;rpm. This explains the usefulness of very high "overdrive" gears for highway cruising. For instance, a small car might need only {{convert|10|-|15|hp|kW}} to cruise at {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. It is likely to be geared for 2500&amp;nbsp;rpm or so at that speed, yet for maximum efficiency the engine should be running at about 1000&amp;nbsp;rpm to generate that power as efficiently as possible for that engine (although the actual figures will vary by engine and vehicle).

===Acceleration and deceleration (braking)===
Fuel efficiency varies with the vehicle. Fuel efficiency during acceleration generally improves as RPM increases until a point somewhere near peak torque ([[brake specific fuel consumption]]&lt;ref name="tranchant" /&gt;). However, accelerating to a greater than necessary speed without paying attention to what is ahead may require braking and then after that, additional acceleration. Experts recommend accelerating quickly, but smoothly.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg" /&gt;

Generally, fuel efficiency is maximized when acceleration and braking are minimized. So a fuel-efficient strategy is to anticipate what is happening ahead, and drive in such a way so as to minimize acceleration and braking, and maximize coasting time.

The need to brake is sometimes caused by unpredictable events. At higher speeds, there is less time to allow vehicles to slow down by coasting. Kinetic energy is higher, so more energy is lost in braking. At medium speeds, the driver has more time to choose whether to accelerate, coast or decelerate in order to maximize overall fuel efficiency.

While approaching a red signal, drivers may choose to "time a traffic light" by easing off the throttle before the signal. By allowing their vehicle to slow down early and coast, they will give time for the light to turn green before they arrive, preventing energy loss from having to stop.

Due to stop and go traffic, driving during rush hours is fuel inefficient and produces more toxic fumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=David Suzuki's Green Guide|last=Suzuki|first=David|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=978-1-55365-293-9|location=|pages=88|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional brakes dissipate [[kinetic energy]] as heat, which is irrecoverable. [[Regenerative braking]], used by hybrid/electric vehicles, recovers some of the kinetic energy, but some energy is lost in the conversion, and the braking power is limited by the battery's maximum charge rate and efficiency.

===Coasting or gliding===
{{main article|Gliding (vehicle)}}
An alternative to acceleration or braking is [[wikt:coast|coast]]ing, i.e. gliding along without [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]]. Coasting dissipates stored energy ([[kinetic energy]] and [[gravitational potential energy]]) against [[aerodynamic drag]] and [[rolling resistance]] which must always be overcome by the vehicle during travel.  If coasting uphill, stored energy is also expended by [[Wikibooks:Fundamentals of Transportation/Grade#grade resistance|grade resistance]], but this energy is not dissipated since it becomes stored as [[gravitational potential energy]] which might be used later on. Using stored energy (via coasting) for these purposes is more efficient than dissipating it in friction braking.

When coasting with the engine running and manual transmission in neutral, or clutch depressed, there will still be some fuel consumption due to the engine needing to maintain idle engine speed.

Coasting with a vehicle not in gear is prohibited by law in most U.S. states. An example is Maine Revised Statutes Title 29-A, Chapter 19, §2064&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/29-A/title29-Asec2064.html|title=Title 29-A, §2064: No coasting on grade in neutral|website=legislature.maine.gov|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "An operator, when traveling on a downgrade, may not coast with the gears of the vehicle in neutral". Some regulations differ between commercial vehicles not to disengage the clutch for a downgrade, and passenger vehicles to set the transmission to neutral. These regulations point on how drivers operate a vehicle. Not using the engine on longer, precipitous downgrade roads, or excessively using the brake might cause a failure due to overheating brakes.

Turning the engine off instead of idling does save fuel. Traffic lights are in most cases predictable, and it is often possible to anticipate when a light will turn green. A support is the [[Start-stop system]], turning the engine off and on automatically during a stop. Some traffic lights (in Europe and Asia) have timers on them, which assist the driver in using this tactic.

Some hybrids must keep the engine running whenever the vehicle is in motion and the transmission engaged, although they still have an ''auto-stop'' feature which engages when the vehicle stops, avoiding waste. Maximizing use of auto-stop on these vehicles is critical because idling causes a severe drop in instantaneous fuel-mileage efficiency to zero miles per gallon, and this lowers the average (or accumulated) fuel-mileage efficiency.

===Anticipating traffic===
A driver may improve their fuel efficiency by anticipating the movement of other vehicles or sudden changes to the situation the driver is currently in. For example, a driver who stops quickly, or turns without signaling, reduces the options another driver has for maximizing their performance. By always giving road users as much information about their intentions as possible, a driver can help other road users reduce their fuel usage (as well as increase their safety). Similarly, anticipation of road features such as traffic lights can reduce the need for excessive braking and acceleration. Drivers should also anticipate the behaviour of pedestrians or animals in the vicinity, so they can react to a developing situation involving them appropriately.

===Minimizing ancillary losses===
Using air conditioning requires the generation of up to {{convert|5|hp|kW|abbr=on}} of extra power to maintain a given speed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A/C systems cycle on and off, or vary their output, as required by the occupants so they rarely run at full power continuously. Switching off the A/C and rolling down the windows may prevent this loss of energy, though it will increase drag, so that cost savings may be less than is generally anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sae.org/events/aars/presentations/2004-hill.pdf | title=Attend - SAE International - Attend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the passenger heating system slows the rise to [[operating temperature]] for the engine. Either the [[Choke valve|choke]] in a carburetor-equipped car (1970's or earlier) or the fuel injection computer in modern vehicles will add more fuel to the fuel-air mixture until normal operating temperature is reached, decreasing fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name="motherearthnews" /&gt;

===Fuel type===
Using high octane gasoline fuel in a vehicle that does not need it is generally considered an unnecessary expense,&lt;ref name="Faqs.org" /&gt; although Toyota ''has'' measured slight differences in efficiency due to octane number even when knock is not an issue.&lt;ref name="Nakata" /&gt; All vehicles in the United States built since 1996 are equipped with [[OBD-II]] on-board diagnostics and most models will have knock sensors that will automatically adjust the timing if and when pinging is detected, so low octane fuel can be used in an engine designed for high octane, with some reduction in efficiency and performance. If the engine is designed for high octane then higher octane fuel will result in higher efficiency and performance under certain load and mixture conditions. The energy released during combustion of hydrocarbon fuel increases as the molecule chain length decreases, so gasoline fuels with higher ratios of the shorter chain alkanes such as heptane, hexane, pentane, etc. can be used under certain load conditions and combustion chamber geometries to increase engine output which can lead to lower fuel consumption, although these fuels will be more susceptible to predetonation ping in high compression ratio engines. Gasoline direct injection compression ignition engines make more efficient use of the higher combustion energy short chain hydrocarbons{{cn|date=April 2017}} as the fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber during high compression which auto-ignites the fuel, minimizing the amount of time that the fuel is available in the combustion chamber for predetonation.

===Pulse and glide===
{{see also|bang-bang control}}
''Pulse and glide'' (PnG) or ''burn and coast'' driving strategy consists of rapid acceleration to a given speed (the "pulse" or "burn"), followed by a period of coasting or gliding down to a lower speed, at which point the burn-coast sequence is repeated.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/10919/29005 Jeongwoo Lee.

Journal of Automobile Engineering, vol.226, Issue 3, pp.419-429, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Coasting is most efficient when the engine is not running, although some gains can be realized with the engine on (to maintain power to brakes, steering and ancillaries) and the vehicle in neutral.&lt;ref name="Lieben" /&gt; Most modern petrol vehicles cut off the fuel supply completely when coasting (over-running) in gear, although the moving engine adds considerable frictional drag and speed is lost more quickly than with the engine declutched from the drivetrain.

The pulse-and-glide strategy is proven to be an efficient control design both in car-following&lt;ref name="Lieben" /&gt; and free-driving scenarios,&lt;ref name="Lieben_1"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=Dxiw1K8AAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;citation_for_view=Dxiw1K8AAAAJ:cB__R-XWw9UC S.

In the PnG strategy, the control of the engine and the transmission determines the fuel-saving performance, and it is obtained by solving an optimal control problem (OCP).

Some hybrid vehicles are well-suited to performing pulse and glide.&lt;ref name="Lieben_4"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=Dxiw1K8AAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=Dxiw1K8AAAAJ:wkm4DBaukwsC S.

IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, vol.65, Issue 6, pp.4676-4686, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series-parallel hybrid (see [[hybrid vehicle drivetrain]]), the [[internal combustion engine]] and charging system can be shut off for the glide by simply manipulating the accelerator. However based on simulation, more gains in economy are obtained in non-hybrid vehicles.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieben" /&gt;

This control strategy can also be used in vehicle platoon (The platooning of automated vehicles has the potential of significantly enhancing the fuel efficiency of road transportation), and this control method performs much better than conventional linear quadratic controllers.&lt;ref name="Lieben_5"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7744667/ S.

Pulse and glide ratio of combustion engine in hybrid vehicles points on it by gear ratio in its [[consumption map]], battery capacity, battery level, load, depending on acceleration, wind drag and its factor of speed.

===Causes of pulse-and-glide energy saving===
Much of the time, automobile engines operate at only a fraction of their maximal efficiency,&lt;ref&gt;Jansen p.18)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in lower fuel efficiency (or what is the same thing, higher specific fuel consumption (SFC)).&lt;ref name="autospeed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://autospeed.com/A_112611/cms/article.html | title=AutoSpeed - Brake Specific Fuel Consumption}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charts that show the SFC for every feasible combination of torque (or Brake Mean Effective Pressure) and RPM are called [[Brake specific fuel consumption]] maps. Using such a map, one can find the efficiency of the engine at various combinations of [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], [[torque]], etc.&lt;ref name="Lieben" /&gt;
   
During the pulse (acceleration) phase of pulse and glide, the efficiency is near maximal due to the high [[torque]] and much of this energy is stored as [[kinetic energy]] of the moving vehicle.  This efficiently-obtained kinetic energy is then used in the glide phase to overcome rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag. In other words, going between periods of very efficient acceleration and gliding gives an overall efficiency that is usually significantly higher than just cruising at a constant speed. Computer calculations have predicted that in rare cases (at low speeds where the torque required for cruising at steady speed is low) it's possible to double (or even triple) fuel economy.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; More realistic simulations that account for other traffic suggest improvements of 20% are more likely.&lt;ref name="Lieben" /&gt; In other words, in the real world one is unlikely to see fuel efficiency double or triple. Such a failure is due to signals, stop signs, and considerations for other traffic; all of these factors interfering with the pulse and glide technique. But improvements in fuel economy of 20% or so are still feasible.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieben" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Squatriglia, "Hypermilers push the limits of fuel efficiency" in Wired (Internet magazine) 6 October 2008 [https://www.wired.com/cars/energy/news/2008/06/hypermilers09?currentPage=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drafting===
''Drafting'' occurs where a smaller vehicle drives (or coasts) close behind a vehicle ahead of it so that it is shielded from wind. Aside from being illegal in many jurisdictions it is often dangerous.  Scale-model wind tunnel and Real-World tests of a car ten feet behind a semi-truck showed a reduction of over 90% for the wind force (aerodynamic drag). The gain in efficiency is reported to be 20–40%.&lt;ref name="Gaffney"&gt;Dennis Gaffney.

Retrieved 2007-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mythbusters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mythbusters-wiki.discovery.com/page/Big+Rig+Drafting |title=Big Rig Drafting |publisher=Mythbusters-wiki.discovery.com |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604131338/http://mythbusters-wiki.discovery.com/page/Big+Rig+Drafting |archivedate=2008-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy losses===
[[File:Energy flows in car.svg|thumb|450px|Example energy flows for a late-model midsize passenger car: (a) urban driving; (b) highway driving. Source: U.S. Department of Energy&lt;ref name="Fueleconomy.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trb" /&gt;]]

Most of the fuel energy loss in cars occurs in the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] losses of the engine. The next biggest loss is from idling, or when the engine is in ''standby'', which explains the large gains available from shutting off the engine.

In this respect, the data for fuel energy wasted in braking, rolling resistance, and aerodynamic drag are all somewhat misleading, because they do not reflect all the energy that was wasted up to that point in the process of delivering energy to the wheels. The image reports that on non-highway (urban) driving, 6% of the fuel's energy is dissipated in braking; however, by dividing this figure by the energy that actually reaches the axle (13%), one can find that 46% of the energy reaching the axle goes to the brakes. Also, additional energy can potentially be recovered when going down hills, which may not be reflected in these figures.&lt;ref name="trb" /&gt;

===Safety===
There is sometimes a tradeoff between saving fuel and preventing crashes.&lt;ref name="Diken" /&gt;

In the US, the speed at which fuel efficiency is maximized often lies below the speed limit, typically {{convert|35|to|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}; however, traffic flow is often faster than this. The speed differential between cars raises the risk of collision.&lt;ref name="Diken" /&gt;

Drafting increases risk of collision when there is a separation of fewer than three seconds from the preceding vehicle.&lt;ref name="Woodyard" /&gt;

Coasting is another technique for increasing fuel efficiency. Shifting gears and/or restarting the engine increase the time required for an avoidance maneuver that involves acceleration. Therefore, some believe the reduction of control associated with coasting is an unacceptable risk.

These epoxygenases can metabolize EPA to as many as 10 epoxides that differ in the site and/or stereoisomer of the epoxide formed; however, the formed EEQs, while differing in potency, often have similar bioactivities and are commonly considered together.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18952572 | pmc = 2674692 | year = 2009 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A.

==Structure==
EPA is a straight-chain, 20 carbon [[omega-3 fatty acid]] containing cis (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]]) double bounds between carbons 5 and 6, 8 and 9, 11 and 12, 14 and 15, and 17 and 18; each of these double bonds is designated with the notation ''Z'' to indicate its cis configuration in the IUPAC [[Chemical nomenclature]] used here. EPA is therefore 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosapentaenoic acid. Certain cytochrome P450 epoxygenases metabolize EPA by converting one of these double bounds to an epoxide thereby forming one of 5 possible eicosatetraenoic acid epoxide regioisomers (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)). These regioisomers are: 5,6-EEQ (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 8,9-EEQ (i.e. 8,9-epoxy-5''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 11,12-EEQ (i.e. 11,12-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 14,15-EEQ (i.e. 14,15-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid, and 17,18-EEQ (i.e. 17,18-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid. The epoxydases typically make both ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] of each epoxide.  For example, they metabolize EPA at its 17,18 double bond to a mixture of 17''R'',18''S''-EEQ and 17''S'',18''R''-EEQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24345640 | pmc = 3914417 | year = 2014 | author1 = Zhang | first1 = G | title = Stabilized epoxygenated fatty acids regulate inflammation, pain, angiogenesis and cancer | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 53 | pages = 108–23 | last2 = Kodani | first2 = S | last3 = Hammock | first3 = B.

==Production==
Cellular cytochrome P450 epoxygenases metabolize various [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s to epoxide-containng products. They metabolize the omega-6 fatty acids [[arachidonic acid]], which possess four double bonds, to 8 different epoxide isomers which are termed [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s or EETs and [[linoleic acid]], which possess two double bonds, to 4 different epoxide isomers, i.e. two different 9,10-epoxide isomers termed [[vernolic acid]]s or leukotoxins and two different 12,13-epoxides isomers termed [[coronaric acid]]s or isoleukotoxins. They metabolize the [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]], which possesses 6 double bonds, to 12 different [[epoxydocosapentaenoic acid]] (EDPs) isomers. In general, the same epoxygenases that accomplish these metabolic conversions also metabolize the omega-6 fatty acid, EPA, to 10 epoxide isomers, the EEQs.  These epoxygenases fall into several subfamilies including the cytochrome P4501A (i.e.CYP1A), CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, and CYP2J subfamilies, and within the CYP3A subfamily, CYP3A4. In humans, [[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C18]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2E1]], [[CYP2J2]], [[CYP3A4]], and [[CYP2S1]] metabolize EPA to EEQs, in most cases forming principally 17,18-EEQ with smaller amounts of 5,6-EEQ, 8,9-EEQ, 11,12-EEQ, and 14,15-EEQ isomers.&lt;ref name="Arch Biochem Biophys 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18206980 | year = 2008 | author1 = Fer | first1 = M | title = Metabolism of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids by recombinant human cytochromes P450 | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 471 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–25 | last2 = Dréano | first2 = Y | last3 = Lucas | first3 = D | last4 = Corcos | first4 = L | last5 = Salaün | first5 = J.

The EEQ-forming cytochromes are widely distributed in the tissues of humans and other mammals, including blood vessel endothelium, blood vessel [[atheroma]] placques, heart muscle, kidneys, pancreas, intestine, lung, brain, [[monocyte]]s, and [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25655310 | pmc = 4500322 | year = 2015 | author1 = Yang | first1 = L | title = The role of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the cardiovascular system | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–44 | last2 = Mäki-Petäjä | first2 = K | last3 = Cheriyan | first3 = J | last4 = McEniery | first4 = C | last5 = Wilkinson | first5 = I.

==EEQ metabolism==
In cells, EEQs are rapidly metabolized by the same enzyme that similarly metabolizes other epoxy fatty acids including the EETs viz., cytosolic [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] [EC 3.2.2.10.] (also termed sEH or the EPHX2), to form their corresponding [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] [[diol]] dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (diHETEs). The omega-3 fatty acid epoxides, EEQs and EPAs, appear to be preferred over EETs as substates for sEH.&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt; sEH converts 17,18-EEQ isomers to 17,18-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid isomers (17,18-diHETEs), 14,15-EEQ isomers to 14,15-diHETE isomers, 11,12-EEQ isomers to 11,12-diHETE isomers, 8,9-EEQ isomers to 8,9-diHETE isomers, and 5,6-EEQ isomers to 5,6-diHETE isomers.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23701967 | pmc = 3733540 | year = 2013 | author1 = Harris | first1 = T.

D. | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The product diHETEs, like their epoxy precursors, are [[enantiomer]] mixtures; for instance, sEH converts 17,18-EEQ to a mixture of 17(''S''),19(''R'')-diHETE and  17(''R''),18(''S'')-diHETE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  Since the diHETE products are as a rule generally far less active than their epoxide precursors, the sEH pathway of EET metabolism is regarded as a critical EEQ-inactivating pathway.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23011468 | year = 2013 | author1 = Bellien | first1 = J | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid pathway in human health and diseases | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–96 | last2 = Joannides | first2 = R | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318273b007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20869469 | year = 2011 | author1 = Konkel | first1 = A | title = Role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the bioactivation of polyunsaturated fatty acids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Proteins and Proteomics | volume = 1814 | issue = 1 | pages = 210–22 | last2 = Schunck | first2 = W.

Membrane-bound [[Microsomal epoxide hydrolase]] (mEH or Epoxide hydrolase 2 [EC 3.2.2.9.]) can metabolize EEQs to their dihydroxy products but is regarded as not contributing significantly to EEQ inactivation in vivo except possibly in rare tissues where the sEH level is exceptionally low while the mEH level is high.&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25240260 | pmc = 4254344 | year = 2014 | author1 = Wagner | first1 = K | title = The role of long chain fatty acids and their epoxide metabolites in nociceptive signaling | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 113-115 | pages = 2–12 | last2 = Vito | first2 = S | last3 = Inceoglu | first3 = B | last4 = Hammock | first4 = B.

In addition to the sEH pathway, EETs may be acylated into phospholipids in an [[Acylation]]-like reaction.  This pathway may serve to limit the action of EETs or store them for future release.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  EETs are also inactivated by being further metabolized though three other pathways: [[Beta oxidation]], [[Omega oxidation]], and elongation by enzymes involved in [[Fatty acid synthesis]].&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22848834 | pmc = 3405717 | year = 2012 | author1 = Thomson | first1 = S.

==Clinical significance==
EEQS, similar to EDPs, have not be studied nearly as well as the EETs.  In comparison to the many activities attributed to the EETs in animal model studies (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), a limited set of studies indicate that EEQs (and EPAs) mimic EETS in their abilities to dilate arterioles, reduce hypertension, inhibit inflammation (the anti-inflammatory actions of EEQ are less potent than those of the EETs) and thereby reduce occlusion of arteries to protect the heart and prevent and [[stroke]]s (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance]] sections on '''a)''' Regulation of blood pressure, '''b)''' Heart disease, '''c)''' Strokes and seizures, and '''d)''' inflammation); they also mimic EETs in possessing [[analgesia]] properties in relieving certain types of pain (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance#Pain]]).&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;  Often, the EEQs (and EPAs) exhibit greater potency and/or effectiveness than EET in these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25244930 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The pharmacology of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase axis in the vasculature and cardiovascular disease | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1106–40 | doi = 10.1124/pr.113.007781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26975734 | year = 2016 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The factor in EDHF: Cytochrome P450 derived lipid mediators and vascular signaling | journal = Vascular Pharmacology | doi = 10.1016/j.vph.2016.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In human studies potentially relevant to one or more of these activities, consumption of long chain omega-3 fatty acid (i.e. EPA- and DHA-rich) diet produced significant reductions in systolic blood pressure and increased peripheral arteriole blood flow and reactivity in patients at high to intermediate risk for cardiovascular events; an EPA/DHA-rich diet also reduced the risk while high serum levels of DHA and EPA were associated with a low risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18689376 | year = 2008 | author1 = Augood | first1 = C | title = Oily fish consumption, dietary docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid intakes, and associations with neovascular age-related macular degeneration | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 398–406 | last2 = Chakravarthy | first2 = U | last3 = Young | first3 = I | last4 = Vioque | first4 = J | last5 = De Jong | first5 = P.

{{star formation}}

In [[stellar evolution]], an '''FU Orionis star''' (also '''FU Orionis object''', or ''FUor'') is a [[pre–main-sequence star]] which displays an extreme change in magnitude and spectral type.  One example is the star V1057 Cyg, which became 6 magnitudes brighter and went from [[spectral type]] [[dKe]] to F-type [[supergiant]].  These stars are named after their type-star, [[FU Orionis]].

The current model developed primarily by Lee Hartmann and [[Scott Jay Kenyon]] associates the FU Orionis flare with abrupt mass transfer from an [[accretion disc]] onto a young, low mass [[T Tauri star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=T Tauri Stars-Wild as Dust| first=C. | last=Bertout | journal=Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. |volume=27| page=351|bibcode=1989ARA&amp;A..27..351B|doi = 10.1146/annurev.aa.27.090189.002031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=FU Orionis eruptions and early stellar evolution|first=B. |last=Reipurth|bibcode=1990IAUS..137..229R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass accretion rates for these objects are estimated to be around 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass]]es per year.  The rise time of these eruptions is typically on the order of 1 year, but can be much longer. The lifetime of this high-accretion, high-luminosity phase is on the order of decades. However, even with such a relatively short timespan, {{As of|2015|lc=y}} no FU Orionis object had been observed shutting off. By comparing the number of FUor outbursts to the rate of star formation in the solar neighborhood, it is estimated that the average young star undergoes approximately 10–20 FUor eruptions over its lifetime.

The prototypes of this class are: [[FU Orionis]], [[V1057 Cygni]], [[V1515 Cygni]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite simbad|title=V* V1515 Cyg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the embedded [[protostar]] [[V1647 Orionis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite simbad|title=V* V1647 Ori}}&lt;/ref&gt; which erupted in January 2004.

Flexible-fuel technology started being developed only by the end of the 1990s by Brazilian engineers and in March 2003 [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] launched in the market the [[Volkswagen Gol|Gol]] 1.6 Total Flex, the first commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any blend of gasoline and ethanol.&lt;ref name="flex3years"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parana-online.com.br/canal/automoveis/news/170341/|title=Volkswagen lança Golf Total Flex 1.6 |publisher=ParanaOnline |date=2006-03-30 |accessdate=2008-10-18|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tanquinho Celta GM FlexPower 02 SAO 10 2008.jpg|thumb|Typical Brazilian flexible-fuel engine with secondary gasoline reservoir for cold starting the engine at temperatures below 15 °C.]]
The Brazilian flexible fuel car is built with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for starting the engine with pure ethanol in cold weather, used in earlier ethanol-only vehicles, was kept in the first generation of Brazilian flexible-fuel cars, mainly for users of the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below{{convert|15|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Cold101"/&gt; An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 that allowed for the elimination of this secondary gas reservoir tank.&lt;ref name="BioEnergia"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/revista/RBB3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Here comes the 'Flex' vehicles third generation |journal=Revista Brasileira de BioEnergia |publisher=Centro Nacional de Referência em Biomassa (Cenbio) |date=August 2008 |volume=Ano 2 |issue=3 |accessdate=2008-09-23 |language=Portuguese |pages=31–34 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003062358/http://cenbio.iee.usp.br/download/revista/RBB3.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}  (every article is presented in both English and Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazeta"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/economia/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=774927&amp;tit= |title=Bosch investe na segunda geração do motor flex |publisher=Gazeta do Povo |author=Agência Estado |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2008-09-23 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110180712/http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/economia/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&amp;id=774927&amp;tit= |archivedate=2009-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key innovation in the Brazilian flex technology was avoiding the need for an additional dedicated sensor to monitor the ethanol-gasoline mix, which made the first American [[M85 Fuel|M85]] flex fuel vehicles too expensive.&lt;ref name="VejaFlex"/&gt; This was accomplished through the [[oxygen sensor|lambda probe]], used to measure the quality of combustion in conventional engines, is also required to tell the [[engine control unit]] (ECU) which blend of gasoline and alcohol is being burned. This task is accomplished automatically through software developed by Brazilian engineers, called "[[Software Fuel Sensor]]" (SFS), fed with data from the standard sensors already built-in the vehicle. The technology was developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]in 1994, but was further improved and commercially implemented in 2003 by the Italian subsidiary of [[Magneti Marelli]], located in [[Hortolândia]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. A similar fuel injection technology was developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi Automotive Systems]], and it is called "[[Multifuel (Delphi)|Multifuel]]", based on research conducted at its facility in [[Piracicaba]], São Paulo.&lt;ref name="VejaFlex"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/010206/p_096.html |title=A riqueza é o saber|author=João Gabriel de Lima|publisher=[[Veja (magazine)|Revista Veja]]|date=2006-02-01|accessdate=2008-08-19|language=Portuguese}} Print edition No. 1941&lt;/ref&gt; This technology allows the controller to regulate the amount of fuel injected and spark time, as fuel flow needs to be decreased and also self-combustion needs to be avoided when gasoline is used because ethanol engines have compression ratio around 12:1, too high for gasoline.

Brazilian flex engines are being designed with higher [[compression ratio]]s, taking advantage of the higher ethanol blends and maximizing the benefits of the higher oxygen content of ethanol, resulting in lower emissions and improving fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name="TRS08"/&gt; The following table shows the evolution and improvement of the different generations of flex engines developed in Brazil.

The flexibility of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers to choose the fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.doe.gov [http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/alternate/page/faq.html#12 DOE FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAATTF"&gt;http://www.eia.doe.gov [http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/alt_trans_fuel/attf.pdf#page=39 Alternative Fuel Efficiencies in Miles per Gallon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203173839/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/alt_trans_fuel/attf.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a [[rule of thumb]], Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opiniaoweb.com/portal/alcool-ou-gasolina-saiba-qual-escolher-quando-for-abastecer/ |title=Álcool ou Gasolina?

The latest innovation within the Brazilian flexible-fuel technology, is the development of flex-fuel [[motorcycles]]. In 2007 Magneti Marelli presented the first motorcycle with flex technology, adapted on a [[Kasinski]] Seta 125, and based on the [[Software Fuel Sensor]] (SFS) the firm developed for flex-fuel cars in Brazil. Delphi Automotive Systems also presented in 2007 its [[Multifuel (Delphi)|Multifuel]] injection technology for motorcycles.&lt;ref name="Motoflex"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmotors.com.br/wmpublicador/Motos_Conteudo.vxlpub?hnid=38490|author=Aldo Tizzani|title=Magneti Marelli apresenta a moto flexível em combustível|publisher=WebMotors|date=2007-11-07|accessdate=2010-12-14|language=Portuguese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706155358/http://www.webmotors.com.br/wmpublicador/Motos_Conteudo.vxlpub?hnid=38490#|archive-date=2011-07-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the flexibility in the choice of fuels, a main objective of the fuel-flex motorcycles is to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 20 percent, and savings in fuel consumption in the order of 5% to 10% are expected.&lt;ref name="Motoflex"/&gt; [[AME Amazonas Motocicletas]] announced that sales of its motorcycle [[AME GA]] (G stands for gasoline and A for alcohol) were scheduled for 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carros.uol.com.br/ultnot/2008/04/23/ult5498u65.jhtm | author=Aldo Tizzani |title=Moto flex 'imita' carros e deve chegar até dezembro |publisher=UOL Carros | date=2008-04-23 | accessdate=2008-09-07 | language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://duasrodas.blog.br/2008/10/22/moto-bicombustivel-amazonas-ame-ga-300cc-flex/ | author=Alessandro Temperini | title=Moto bicombustível Amazonas AME GA 300cc Flex | publisher=Duas Rodas Blog | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-05-08 | language=Portuguese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428004052/http://duasrodas.blog.br/2008/10/22/moto-bicombustivel-amazonas-ame-ga-300cc-flex/# | archive-date=2009-04-28 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the first flex-fuel motorcycle was actually launched by [[Honda]] in March 2009.

U.S. flex-fuel vehicles are optimized to run on a maximum blend of 15% gasoline with 85% [[anhydrous]] ethanol (called [[E85]] fuel).

==History==
[[File:Ford TT.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ford Model T]] was the first commercial flex-fuel vehicle. The engine was capable of running on [[gasoline]] or [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]], or a mix of both.]]
[[File:Wiki cars1 005.jpg|right|thumb|The 1996 [[Ford Taurus]] was the first flexible-fuel vehicle produced with versions capable of running with either [[ethanol fuel|ethanol (E85)]] or [[methanol fuel|methanol (M85)]] blended with gasoline.]]
The first commercial flexible fuel vehicle was the [[Ford Model T]], produced from 1908 through 1927. It was fitted with a [[carburetor]] with adjustable jetting, allowing use of gasoline or [[ethanol]], or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15233556/|title=Renewable energy has an icon: Henry Ford|publisher=MSNBC|date=2010-10-12|accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2008/07/25/mnmodel125.xml|title= Ford Model T reaches 100|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2008-07-25|accessdate=2008-08-11 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journeytoforever.org/ethanol.html#ethintro|title= Ethanol: Introduction|publisher=Journey to Forever|date=|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use.&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt;  Ethanol was disadvantaged by frequent accusations that ethanol producers collaborated with bootleggers during Prohibition. Oil dominance as a motor fuel was questioned in the U.S. only after the [[1973 oil crisis]], which resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol, [[Methanol fuel|methanol]] and other [[alternative fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=SusEthanol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Methanolstory&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.methanol.org/pdfFrame.cfm?pdf=MethanolStoryRobertaNichols.pdf | author=Roberta J Nichols | title=The Methanol Story: A Sustainable Fuel for the Future | publisher=Methanol Institute | year=2003 | accessdate=2008-08-30 | language= | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211163641/http://www.methanol.org/pdfFrame.cfm?pdf=MethanolStoryRobertaNichols.pdf | archivedate=2008-12-11 | df= }} Also published in the Journal of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research Vol. 62, January–February 2003, pp. 97-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABFW"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Robert C. |last2=Brown |first2=Tristan R. |date=2012 |title=Why Are We Producing Biofuels |url=https://www.amazon.com/Why-are-We-Producing-Biofuels/dp/0984090630 |location=Ames, Iowa |publisher=Brownia |isbn=978-0984090631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the shock caused by the first oil crisis, the U.S. government provided the initial support to develop alternative fuels, and some time later, also as a goal to improve air quality. Liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Methanolstory/&gt; [[California]] led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in [[methanol]]. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) [[Ford Escort (North America)|Escorts]] to [[Los Angeles County]], but only four refueling stations were installed.&lt;ref name=Methanolstory/&gt; The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with [[neat ethanol vehicle]] production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to [[New Zealand]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Methanolstory"/&gt;

As an answer to the lack of refueling infrastructure, Ford began development of a flexible-fuel vehicle in 1982, and between 1985 and 1992, 705 experimental FFVs were built and delivered to California and Canada, including the 1.6L Ford Escort, the 3.0L [[Ford Taurus|Taurus]], and the 5.0L [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|LTD Crown Victoria]]. These vehicles could operate on either gasoline or methanol with only one fuel system. Legislation was passed to encourage the US auto industry to begin production, which started in 1993 for the M85 FFVs at Ford. In 1996, a new FFV Ford Taurus was developed, with models fully capable of running on either methanol or ethanol blended with gasoline.&lt;ref name=Methanolstory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencar.com/perspective/perspective9/ |author=Green Car Journal Editors |title=Cars On Alcohol, Part 9: Corn Based Ethanol in the US |publisher=Green Car |year=1994 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011163845/http://www.greencar.com/perspective/perspective9/ |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ethanol version of the Taurus became the first commercial production of an E85 FFV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/19960123/news00023.html | author=Paul Dever  |title=Alternative Fuel Ford Taurus |publisher=The Auto Channel |date=January 1996 | accessdate=2008-08-14 }} Original source: 1996 North American International Auto Show Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; The momentum of the FFV production programs at the American car companies continued, although by the end of the 1990s, the emphasis shifted to the FFV E85 version, as it is today.&lt;ref name="Methanolstory"/&gt; Ethanol was preferred over methanol because there is a large support from the farming community, and thanks to the government's incentive programs and corn-based ethanol subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencar.com/perspective/perspective13/ |author=Green Car Journal Editors |title=Cars On Alcohol, Part 13: GM Supports FlexFuel |publisher=Green Car |year=1995 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013102410/http://www.greencar.com/perspective/perspective13/ |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for ethanol also comes from the fact that it is a [[biomass]] fuel, which addresses [[climate change]] concerns and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, though nowadays these benefits are questioned and depend on the feedstock used for ethanol production and their [[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|indirect land use change impact]]s.&lt;ref name=SusEthanol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Science08&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1151861|title=Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases Through Emissions from Land-Use Change|author=Timothy Searchinger|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1238–1240 |doi=10.1126/science.1151861|date=2008-02-29|accessdate=2008-05-09|pmid=18258860|display-authors=etal}} Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fargione08"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1152747 |title=Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt |author=Fargione |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1235–1238 |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2008-08-06|language=|doi= 10.1126/science.1152747|last2= Hill|first2= J.|last3= Tilman|first3= D.|last4= Polasky|first4= S.|last5= Hawthorne|first5= P.|pmid= 18258862|display-authors=etal}} Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008.

The E85 blend is used in gasoline engines modified to accept such higher concentrations of ethanol, and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount of ethanol in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank.

The American E85 flex fuel vehicle was developed to run on any mixture of unleaded gasoline and ethanol, anywhere from 0% to 85% ethanol by volume. Both fuels are mixed in the same tank, and E85 is sold already blended. In order to reduce ethanol evaporative emissions and to avoid problems starting the engine during cold weather, the maximum blend of ethanol was set to 85%.&lt;ref name="ColdE85"/&gt; There is also a seasonal reduction of the ethanol content to E70 (called winter E85 blend) in very cold regions,&lt;ref name="E70green"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/02/27/when-is-e85-not-85-percent-ethanol-when-its-e70-with-an-e85-st/ | title= When is E85 not 85 percent ethanol?

===Fuel economy===
Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline.&lt;ref name="EEREFAQ"&gt;http://www.eere.energy.gov [http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/progs/ddown.cgi?afdc/FAQ/5/0/0 Energy.gov site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128202103/http://www.eere.energy.gov/ |date=2016-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EIAATTF"&gt;http://www.eia.doe.gov [http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/alt_trans_fuel/attf.pdf#page=39 Alternative Fuel Efficiencies in Miles per Gallon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203173839/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/alt_trans_fuel/attf.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this lower energy content does not translate directly into a 34% reduction in miles per U.S. gallon, because there are many other variables that affect the performance of a particular fuel in a particular engine, though for E85 the effect becomes significant. E85 will produce lower mileage than gasoline, and actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle. Based on EPA EPA-rated mileage for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline.&lt;ref name=SusEthanol/&gt; When making price comparisons it has to be considered that E85 has octane rating of about 104 and could be used as a substitute for premium gasoline.

Regional retail E85 prices vary widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the Midwest region, where most corn is grown and ethanol produced. As of early November 2010, the US average spread between the price of E85 and gasoline was 13.4%, while in [[Indiana]] was 10.1%, in [[Minnesota]] 20.3%, 18.3% in [[Wisconsin]], just 2% in [[Maryland]], 16.3% in [[California]], and 7% in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=E85price2010/&gt; Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.&lt;ref name=SusEthanol /&gt; (See price comparisons for most states at [http://www.e85prices.com/ e85prices.com])

For the 2011 [[model year]] many of the models available are trucks and [[sport-utility vehicle]]s that get less than {{Convert|20|mpgus|abbr=on}} when filled with gasoline.&lt;ref name=Flex2009/&gt; The following table compares [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], [[carbon footprint]], and [[petroleum]] consumption for several popular gasoline-powered vehicles and their flex-fuel versions:

===Pollution===
The demand for ethanol fuel produced from [[field corn]] in the United States was stimulated by the discovery in the late 90s that [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)]], an [[oxygenate]] additive in gasoline, was contaminating groundwater.&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/feature_articles/2006/mtbe2006/mtbe2006.pdf|title=Eliminating MTBE in Gasoline in 2006|date=2006-02-22|publisher=Environmental Information Administration|accessdate=2008-08-10|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822000011/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/feature_articles/2006/mtbe2006/mtbe2006.pdf|archivedate=2008-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the risks of widespread and costly litigation, and because MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states by 2006, the substitution of MTBE opened a new market for ethanol fuel.&lt;ref name=SusEthanol/&gt; This shift also contributed to a sharp increase in the production and sale of E85 flex vehicles since 2002.&lt;ref name="EEREAP08"/&gt; Ethanol also replaces toxic, air-polluting substances such as [[benzene]], [[toluene]], and [[xylene]]. Numerous states require certain ethanol blends to reduce air pollution. Ethanol produces about 34% less air pollution than gasoline on average.&lt;ref name="Morning2"/&gt; 

As of 2016, ethanol blends in the U.S. reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by about 40 million tons per year. During its entire life cycle, "from field to wheel," ethanol reduces emissions by about 34 percent. Second-generation cellulosic ethanol is even more efficient. A plant built by DuPont in Iowa achieves emission reductions of 90%.&lt;ref name="Morning2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategies to Combating Climate Change Must Include Biofuels - Morning Consult|url=https://morningconsult.com/opinions/strategies-combating-climate-change-must-include-biofuels/|website=Morning Consult|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 survey found that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex.&lt;ref name=EERE08/&gt;&lt;ref name="SusEthanol"/&gt; This is due to the fact that the exterior of flex and non-flex vehicles look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumer's awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers can be aware they are getting an E85 vehicle.&lt;ref name=SusEthanol/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollo"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Inslee, Jay |author2=Bracken Hendricks | title = Apollo's Fire | year = 2007 | pages=153–155, 160–161 | publisher = Island Press, Washington, D.C. | isbn = 978-1-59726-175-3}} ''See Chapter 6.

Some critics have argued that American automakers have been producing E85 flex models motivated by a loophole in the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) requirements, that allows for a fuel economy credit for every flex-fuel vehicle sold, whether or not in practice these vehicles are fueled with E85.&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT082006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/business/31loophole.html?emc=eta1 |title=Dual-Fuel Vehicles Open Mileage Loophole for Carmakers |author1=Alexei Barrionuevo |author2=Micheline Maynard |publisher=The New York Times|date=2006-08-31|accessdate=2008-10-22|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This loophole might allow the car industry to meet the CAFE targets in fuel economy just by spending between {{USD|100}} to {{USD|200}} that it cost to turn a conventional vehicle into a flex-fuel, without investing in new technology to improve fuel economy, and saving them the potential fines for not achieving that standard in a given model year.&lt;ref name="NYT082006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10551762| title= Bumpy ride for biofuels|publisher = The Economist | date=2008-01-18 | accessdate= 2008-09-14|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an example presented by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), the agency responsible for establishing the CAFE standards, the special treatment provided for [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s, "turns a dual fuel vehicle that averages 25 mpg on gasoline or diesel... to attain the 40 mpg value for CAFE purposes."&lt;ref name="NHTSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/cafe/overview.htm |title=CAFE Overview |publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date= |accessdate=2008-09-14 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205030159/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/cafe/overview.htm |archivedate=2006-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current CAFE standards are 27.5 mpg for automobiles and 22.2 mpg for light-duty trucks."&lt;ref name="CAFE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/cafe/FuelEconUpdates/2003/index.htm| title= Automotive Fuel Economy Program Annual Update Calendar Year 2003|publisher = [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date=November 2004 | accessdate= 2008-09-14 |language= }} Table I-1, targets for year 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in May 2009 the [[Obama Administration]] announced a new harmonized national policy that will require an average fuel economy standard of 35.5 mpg in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/05/obama-announces-new-national-fuel-policy-two-harmonized-standards-with-fleet-average-of-355-mpg-250-.html|title=Obama Announces New National Fuel Policy; Two Harmonized Standards, with Fleet Average of 35.5 mpg, 250 gCO2/mile by 2016|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2009-05-19|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flex-fuel CAFE credits are scheduled to end in 2016, but because the 2007 EISA made CAFE credits exchangeable between different classes of automobiles and tradable between companies, and also carmakers are allowed to carry over credits for up to five years, the flex-fuel credits accumulated up to 2016 can be carried over and traded until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/news/are-e85-vehicles-destined-extinction-28278.html|title=Are E85 Vehicles Destined for Extinction?|publisher=HybridCars.com|date=2010-07-21|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAFE standards proposed in 2011 for the period 2017-2025 will allow flexible-fuel vehicles to receive extra credit but only when the carmakers present data proving how much E85 such vehicles have actually consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/information/november_2011-table_of_contents|title=The CAFE Numbers Game: Making Sense of the New Fuel-Economy Regulations|author=Tony Quiroga|publisher=[[Car and Driver]]|date=November 2011|accessdate=2011-10-24|page=20}}'' From the print edition of C&amp;D.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A major restriction hampering sales of E85 flex vehicles or fuelling with E85, is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 to the public, as by 2014 only 2 percent of motor fuel stations offered E85,&lt;ref name=EIA2014/&gt; up from about 1 percent in 2011.&lt;ref name=Flex2009/&gt; {{As of|2015|11}}, there were only 3,218 gasoline fueling stations selling E85 to the public in the entire U.S.,&lt;ref name=E85prices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e85prices.com/ |title=E85 Prices |website=E85Prices.com |accessdate=2015-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701095550/http://www.e85prices.com/ |archivedate=2014-07-01 |df= }} ''{{As of|2015|11|23}}, there were 3,218 stations Selling E85 across 2013 cities in the U.S.''&lt;/ref&gt; while about 156,000 retail motor fuel outlets do not offer the E85 blend.&lt;ref name=EIA2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15311 |title=E85 fueling station availability is increasing|author1=Michael Bredehoeft |author2=Mindi Farber-DeAnda |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]]|date=2014-03-07|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of E85 grew from 1,229 in 2007 to 2,442 in 2011, but only increased by 7% from 2011 to 2013, when the total reached 2,625.&lt;ref name=EIA2014/&gt; There is a great concentration of E85 stations in the [[Corn Belt]] states, and {{as of|2015|11|lc=y}}, the leading state is [[Minnesota]] with 274 stations, followed by [[Michigan]] with 231, [[Illinois]] with 225, [[Iowa]] with 204, [[Indiana]] with 188, [[Texas]] with 181, [[Wisconsin]] with 152, and [[Ohio]] with 126.

Several members of the [[United States Congress]] have called for mandatory production of flexible fuel vehicles.&lt;ref name="E85Act"/&gt; Also the [[E85 and Biodiesel Access Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6734|title=H.R. 6734: E85 and Biodiesel Access Act of 2008|publisher=GovTrack.us|year=2008|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to modify current IRS limits on the [[tax credit]] which today only allows for the amount a dual fuel dispenser exceeds the cost of a conventional dispenser. The E85 and Biodiesel Access Act would increase the credit from 30 percent of the cost of clean fueling property to 50 percent and increase the maximum credit to $100,000. This law would also extend the existing credit which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2009.&lt;ref name="E85Act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e85fuel.com/news/2008/091008_pelosi_release.htm |title=Broad Coalition Encourages Pelosi to Advance E85 Fuel Infrastructure |publisher=National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2008-09-15 |author= Michelle Kautz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2014|12}}, almost half of new vehicles produced by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors are flex-fuel, meaning roughly one-quarter of all new vehicles sold by 2015 are capable of using up to E85. However, obstacles to widespread use of E85 fuel remain.

'''Great Eppleton Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] near [[Hetton-le-Hole]], [[England]]. It is owned and operated by [[E.ON UK]]. Constructed in 1997, it was notable for originally consisting of twin-bladed turbines, as most [[wind turbine]]s have three blades. On 29 September 2009 E.ON announced it would replace these with four new [[REpower]] MM92 turbines giving a [[Intermittent energy source#Terminology|nameplate capacity]] of 8.2 [[Megawatt|MW]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newenergyfocus.com/do/ecco/view_item?listid=1&amp;listcatid=131&amp;listitemid=3048&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp | title=UKWED Operational wind farms | publisher=[[RenewableUK]] | accessdate=2009-11-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102132011/http://www.bwea.com/ukwed/operational.asp | archivedate=2012-11-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/6249325.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wind farm upgrade plan revealed | date=10 January 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[soil science]], [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], '''Hardpan''' or '''Soil pan''' is a dense layer of [[soil]], usually found below the uppermost [[topsoil]] layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Resounding Soils

Some hardpans are formed by deposits in the soil that fuse and bind the soil particles. These deposits can range from dissolved silica to matrices formed from [[iron oxide]]s and [[calcium carbonate]]. Others are man-made, such as hardpan formed by compaction from repeated [[plow]]ing, particularly with [[moldboard plow]]s, or by heavy traffic or pollution.

==Formations==
Soil structure strongly affects its tendency to form a hard pan. One such common soil condition related to hardpan is soil [[pH]]. [[Acid]] soils are most often affected due to the propensity of certain mineral salts, most notably iron and calcium, to form hard complexes with soil particles under acid conditions.

Another major determinant is the soil particle size. [[Clay]] particles are some of the smallest particles commonly found in soils. Due to their structure the spaces between individual clay particles is small and already restricts the passage of water, reducing infiltration&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 ''Abiotic factor''. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment]. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; and hence drainage. Soils with a high clay content are also easily compacted and affected by man-made discharges. Clay particles have a strong negative electrostatic charge and will readily bond to positively charged ions dissolved in the soil-water matrix. Common salts such as [[sodium]] ions contained in wastewater can fulfil this role and lead to a localized hardpan in some soil types. This is a common cause of [[septic system]] failure due to the prevention of proper drainage in field.

==Problems and workarounds==
Hardpan can be a problem in [[farming]] and gardening by impeding [[drainage]] of water and restricting the growth of [[plant]] [[root]]s. In these situations, the hardpan can be broken up by either mechanical means such as digging or plowing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[broadfork]] is a manual [[tool]] specifically designed for this task; a [[spading fork|digging fork]] or a [[spade]] might also be used. The [[chisel plow]] does a similar job with the help of a [[tractor]].

The use of [[soil amendments]] can also be employed to alter the [[soil structure]] and promote the dissolution of the hard pan. It has been observed that increasing the amount of [[soil organic matter]] through the working-in of [[manure]], [[compost]] or [[peat]] can both improve local drainage and promote the proliferation of [[earth worm]]s that can, over time, break relatively thin hardpan layers.

More difficult hardpans may be further improved through the action of both adjusting the [[soil pH]] with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] if the soil is acidic, and with the addition of [[gypsum]]. This combination can help loosen clay particles bound into a hardpan by the actions of hard salts such as [[iron]], [[calcium carbonate]] and [[sodium]], by promoting their mobility through a higher pH while proving a suitable source of exchanging minerals (the gypsum). This works because gypsum salts, although not "soft", are still water permeable and have a larger, more open structure, the results of which do not promote as hard a matrix as was replaced. However, unlike when employing mechanical means, breaking a hardpan through the use of amendments may require action over the course of years, and even then one is by no means assured success. The results are primarily determined by how extensive and / or intractable the hardpan is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">The '''Held–Hou Model''' is a model for the [[Hadley circulation]] of the atmosphere that would exist in the absence of atmospheric turbulence. The model was developed by [[Isaac Held]] and Arthur Hou in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281980%29037%3C0515%3ANASCIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=Nonlinear Axially Symmetric Circulations in a Nearly Inviscid Atmosphere|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The essence of the model is that air rising from the surface at the equator conserves its [[angular momentum]] as it moves poleward. This distribution of wind, in turn, determines the distribution of temperature, which determines the latitudinal extent of the circulation by requiring energy conservation. This stands in contrast to [[George Hadley]]'s original conception of the circulation, which he argued reached the poles. The Hadley circulation has a cooling effect at and near the [[equator]] and a warming effect at higher latitudes within the Hadley Cell. This energy transport can be converted into a mass transport, to determine the strength of the circulation, by normalizing by the appropriate vertical stability. The effects of [[moisture]] and [[seasons]] on the model have been studied. 

Earth's atmosphere violates the underlying assumptions of the model: angular momentum is not conserved and the tropical atmosphere is not energetically closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125144|title=The General Circulation of the Atmosphere}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Held–Hou model is a conceptual model that does not make quantitatively accurate predictions of the sensitivity of the Hadley circulation to changes in atmospheric parameters.

'''''Hevea''''' is a genus of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[Euphorbia|spurge]] family, [[Euphorbiaceae]], with about ten members. It is also one of many names used commercially for the [[Rubberwood|wood]] of the most economically important [[rubber]] tree, ''[[Hevea brasiliensis|H. brasiliensis]]''. The genus is native to tropical South America but is widely cultivated in other tropical countries and naturalized in several of them. It was first described in 1775.

==Characteristics==
French botanist and explorer [[Jean Baptiste Christophore Fusée Aublet]] first described ''Hevea'' as a genus in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/361625#page/252/mode/1up Aublet, Jean Baptiste Christophe Fusée. 1775.

Histoire des Plantes de la Guiane Françoise vol 4, plate 335] line drawing depicting ''H. peruviana,'' synonym of ''H. guianensis,'' accompanying original 1775 description of genus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tropicos.org/Name/40025505 Tropicos, ''Hevea'' Aubl.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''H. brasiliensis'' and ''H. guianensis'' are large trees, often reaching more than {{convert|30|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in height. Most of the other members of the genus are small to medium trees, and ''H. camporum'' is a shrub of around {{convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Trees in this genus are either deciduous or evergreen. Certain species, namely ''H. benthamiana'', ''H. brasiliensis'' and ''H. microphylla'', bear "winter shoots", stubby side shoots with short internodes, scale leaves on the stem and larger leaves near the tip; on these, the leaves are shed leaving the tree bare before new shoots develop.&lt;ref name=Sethura/&gt; The remaining species bear more vigorous side shoots which develop before the old foliage is shed and thus the tree remains green.&lt;ref name=Sethura/&gt; The leaves consist of three, usually elliptical, leaflets which are held horizontally or slightly drooping in most species. The inflorescences have separate male and female flowers, with the females being at the end of the panicles. The fruits are capsules, usually with three seeds, which in all except two species (''H. spruceana'' and ''H. microphylla'') split explosively when ripe to eject the large seeds.&lt;ref name=Sethura/&gt;

==Distribution==
The genus occurs naturally in tropical South America, mostly in the [[Amazon basin]]. To the north of the basin the land rises to the watershed of the [[Guiana Shield]] on the border between Brazil and Venezuela, and the southern foothills of these mountains forms the northerly limit of the genus. It is also present in the upper reaches of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. The genus extends westwards as far as the foothills of the [[Andes]] and southwards to the foothills of the [[Mato Grosso]]. Its easterly limit is the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=Sethura&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sethura, M.R.|author2=Mathew, Ninan T.|title=Natural Rubber: Biology, Cultivation and Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rHXxqRjWuIC&amp;pg=PA50 |year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=978-0-444-59780-9 |pages=50–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most widespread species is ''[[Hevea guianensis|H. guianensis]]'' which occurs over the whole range of the genus.&lt;ref name=Sethura/&gt;

The Pará rubber tree (''[[Hevea brasiliensis|H. brasiliensis]]'') occurs mainly south of the Amazon, as does ''[[Hevea camporum|H. camporum]]'', but the greatest diversity occurs to the north of the river, in the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] region, where all the other species occur. In this area where there are variations in soil and topography and the rainforest experiences conditions of all-year-round humidity, the genus ''Hevea'' has been undergoing a high degree of [[speciation]]. The high humidity encourages the growth of fungal leaf diseases, and the species that are deciduous avoid immediate transfer of fungal spores from old leaves onto new growth.&lt;ref name=Sethura/&gt; The Pará rubber tree has been introduced to and is naturalised in many tropical countries in Asia.&lt;ref name=j&gt;[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=98914 Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Govaerts, R., Frodin, D.G. &amp; Radcliffe-Smith, A. (2000). World Checklist and Bibliography of Euphorbiaceae (and Pandaceae) 1–4: 1–1622. The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
Each species has its own habitat requirements; ''H. brasiliensis'' grows on well-drained soils but tolerates light flooding; ''H. guianensis'', ''[[Hevea pauciflora|H. pauciflora]]'' and ''[[Hevea rigidifolia|H. rigidifolia]]'' grow in well-drained soil, on high river banks and on slopes; and ''H. camporum'' grows on [[savanna]]hs. Other species such as ''[[Hevea benthamiana|H. benthamiana]]'', ''[[Hevea microphylla|H. microphylla]]'' and ''[[Hevea spruceana|H. spruceana]]'' need wetter conditions in locations subject to seasonal flooding for several months each year, and ''[[Hevea nitida|H. nitida]]'' grows both in periodically inundated swamps and in drier locations such as rocky hillsides well above the flood level.&lt;ref name=Sethura/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3307">The '''hypsometric equation''', also known as the thickness equation, relates an [[atmospheric pressure]] ratio to the equivalent thickness of an atmospheric layer under the assumptions of constant [[temperature]] and [[gravity]]. It is derived from the [[hydrostatic equation]] and the [[ideal gas law]].

==Equation==
The hypsometric equation is expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hypsometric_equation|title=Hypsometric equation - AMS Glossary|first=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h = z_2 - z_1 = \frac{R \cdot \overline{T}}{g} \cdot \ln \left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; = thickness of the layer  &lt;nowiki&gt;[m]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = geometric height &lt;nowiki&gt;[m]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = specific [[gas constant]] for dry air,
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; = mean [[temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s &lt;nowiki&gt;[K]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; = [[Standard gravitational acceleration|gravitational acceleration]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[m/s&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; = [[pressure]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

In [[meteorology]], &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[wikt:isobaric|isobaric]] surfaces. In [[altimetry]] with the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] the hypsometric equation is used to compute pressure at a given height in [[isothermal]] layers in the upper and lower [[stratosphere]].

== Derivation ==

The hydrostatic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho \cdot g \cdot z,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[kg/m&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is used to generate the equation for [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], written in [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;dp = - \rho \cdot g \cdot dz.&lt;/math&gt;

This is combined with the [[ideal gas law]]: 

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho \cdot R \cdot T&lt;/math&gt; 

to eliminate &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}p}{p} = \frac{-g}{R \cdot T} \, \mathrm{d}z.&lt;/math&gt;

This is integrated from &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{p(z_1)}^{p(z_2)} \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{p} = \int_{z_1}^{z_2}\frac{-g}{R \cdot T} \, \mathrm{d}z.&lt;/math&gt;

''R'' and ''g'' are constant with ''z'', so they can be brought outside the integral.
If temperature varies linearly with ''z'' (as it is assumed to do in the [[International Standard Atmosphere]]),
it can also be brought outside the integral when replaced with &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt;, the average temperature between &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{p(z_1)}^{p(z_2)} \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{p} = \frac{-g}{R \cdot \overline{T}}\int_{z_1}^{z_2} \, \mathrm{d}z.&lt;/math&gt;

Integration gives

:&lt;math&gt;\ln \left( \frac{p(z_2)}{p(z_1)} \right) = \frac{-g}{R \cdot \overline{T}} (z_2 - z_1), &lt;/math&gt;

simplifying to

:&lt;math&gt;\ln \left( \frac{p_1}{p_2} \right) = \frac{g}{R \cdot \overline{T}} (z_2 - z_1). &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging:

:&lt;math&gt;z_2 - z_1 = \frac{R \cdot \overline{T}}{g} \ln \left( \frac{p_1}{p_2} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

or, eliminating the natural log:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_1}{p_2} = e^{\frac{g}{R \cdot \overline{T}} \cdot (z_2 - z_1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Pierre à trous du Jura 2.jpg|thumb|right]]
A '''Jura hole stone''' (or '''Jura Coral rock''', or '''Jura cavity stone''') is a natural stone found in the [[Jura mountains]] of France.

They are with light beige coloring and many cavities.

They come from the petrified sea deposits that were cause by tectonic shifts between mountains. The bizarre form and many cavities are caused by natural erosion over thousands of years.

These stones are protected : it is forbidden to pick them up. However, some are for sale for aquarium decoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11380">The '''LINUS''' program was an experimental [[fusion power]] project developed by the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) in 1972.&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 3861"/&gt; The goal of the project was to produce a controlled fusion reaction by compressing plasma inside metal liners. The basic concept is today known as [[magnetized target fusion]].

The reactor design was based on the mechanical compression of [[magnetic flux]] (and therefore plasma) inside a molten metal liner. A chamber was filled with molten metal and rotated along one axis. This spinning motion created a cylindrical cavity into which [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] was injected. Once the plasma was contained within the cavity, the liquid metal wall was rapidly compressed, which would raise the temperature and density of the trapped plasma to [[Lawson criterion|fusion conditions]].

The use of a liquid metal liner has many of the advantages over previous experiments that imploded cylindrical metal liners to achieve high-energy-density fusion. The liquid metal liner provided the benefits of recovering the heat energy of the reaction, absorbing neutrons, transferring kinetic energy, and replacing the plasma-facing wall during each cycle.&lt;ref name="NRL Progress June73"/&gt; Additional benefits of a liquid liner include greatly simplified servicing of the reactor, reducing radioactivity, and protecting the permanent sections of the reactor from neutron damage.&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 4029"/&gt; The danger from flying shrapnel was also mitigated with the use of liquid liners.

The concept was revived in the 2000s as the basis for the [[General Fusion]] design, currently being built in [[Canada]].

== Conceptual design ==
In the LINUS concept, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is injected into a molten lead-[[lithium]] liner. The liner is then imploded mechanically, using high pressure helium pistons. The imploding liner acts to compress the magnetically-confined plasma [[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]] to fusion temperature and relatively high density ({{val|e=17|u=ions per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}).&lt;ref name="Megagauss"/&gt; In the subsequent expansion the plasma energy and the fusion energy carried by trapped alpha particles is directly recovered by the liquid metal, making the mechanical cycle self-sustaining. The implosion cycle would be repeated every few seconds. The LINUS reactor can thus be regarded as a fusion engine, except that there is no shaft output; all the energy appears as heat.&lt;ref name="Megagauss"/&gt;

The liquid metal acts as both a compression mechanism and heat transfer mechanism, allowing the energy from the fusion reaction to be captured as heat.&lt;ref name="Megagauss"/&gt; LINUS researchers anticipated that a lithium liner could also be used to breed [[tritium]] fuel for the power plant, and would protect the machine from high-energy neutrons by acting as a regenerative [[Plasma-facing material|first wall]].&lt;ref name="Megagauss"/&gt;

== Experiments ==
Several experimental machines were constructed throughout the LINUS project, to gather data and demonstrate various aspects of the system concept.

=== SUZY II ===
To obtain detailed information about the behavior of the inner surface of solid and liquid metal liners during the final moments of an implosion, and experiment called SUZY II was built at NRL. The experiment was used to compress various metal liners from an initial diameter of {{val|20|-|30|u=cm}} to a final diameter of about {{val|1|u=cm}} using magnetic fields. An overall compression ratio of 28:1 was achieved.&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 4092"/&gt;

One goal of SUZY II was to demonstrate the use of electromagnetic driving techniques to achieve liner implosions. The central feature of SUZY II was a bank of capacitors charged to {{val|60|u=kV}}, which was able to quickly deliver {{val|540|u=kJ}} of energy to be used for generating large magnetic fields. Pressures greater than {{val|20|u=kpsi}} were achieved during the implosions. SUZY II was named after its predecessor, SUZY I, a {{val|50|u=kJ}} capacitor bank.&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 4092"/&gt;

=== LINUS-0 ===
To study the hydrodynamic behavior and magnetic flux compression at the target energy density regimes, a device called LINUS-0 was constructed in 1978. The experiment involved a {{val|30|u=cm}} rotating cylindrical chamber filled with molten metal or water.  A large number of pistons (16 or 32)&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 4092"/&gt; were attached to the chamber, and were in contact with the rotating liquid. During the experiment, all pistons were simultaneously propelled to drive the liquid radially inward. The pistons in the LINUS-0 experiment were driven by the high-explosive agent DATB ({{Chemical formula|C|6|H|5|N|5|O|6}}), also known as [[Polymer-bonded explosive|PBXN]],&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 3537"/&gt; chosen for its high melting point, low particulate matter, and compatibly low cost.

The experimental parameters for LINUS-0 required the cylindrical chamber to rotate at {{val|5000|u=RPM}}, which was accomplished with a [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|454 Chevrolet V8 engine]]. All pistons were required to fire within {{val|50|u=us}} of each other. During data collection, LINUS-0 was fired as often as three times per day.&lt;ref name="Megagauss"/&gt;

=== HELIUS ===
A similar machine, called HELIUS, was constructed to demonstrate magnetic flux compression. HELIUS was a half-scale version of LINUS-0,&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 4092"/&gt; and was designed to use liquid sodium and potassium in the liner chamber. In practice, the use of water was sufficient for the hydrodynamic studies.&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 4388"/&gt; In the HELIUS experiment, the liquid sodium-potassium liners were imploded using high-pressure Helium ({{val|120|u=atm}}) to drive mechanical pistons.&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 4092"/&gt;

== Fate of project ==
Experiments on LINUS-0 and HELIUS were largely unsuccessful due in part to delays incurred in the design, fabrication, and assembly phases. Time wasn't allocated to recover from delays or unexpected challenges, and the machines were eventually disassembled and placed in storage.&lt;ref name="Jaycor"/&gt;

The LINUS project encountered several engineering problems which limited its performance and therefore its attractiveness as an approach to commercial fusion power. These issues included performance of the plasma preparation and injection technique, the ability to achieve reversible compression/expansion cycles, and problems with magnetic flux diffusion into the liner material. Also, the ability to remove the vaporized liner material from the cavity between cycles (within a duration of about {{val|1|u=s}}) was not accomplished.  There were also shortcomings with the design of the inner mechanism which pumped the liquid-metal liner.&lt;ref name="Assessment"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "MTF"/&gt;

One major problem that LINUS encountered was related to hydrodynamic instabilities in the liquid liner. If the liquid wasn't properly compressed, it could result in instabilities in the plasma called [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability|RT instabilities]]. This condition could destroy the fusion reaction by injecting liner material (vaporized lead and lithium) into the plasma. This problem diminished the efficiency of the fusion reactions, and could even cause damage to the reactor.&lt;ref name="NRL Memorandum 4029"/&gt; Synchronizing the timing of the compression system was not possible with the technology of the time, and the proposed design was canceled.&lt;ref name="live.iop"/&gt;

In [[materials science]], '''liquefaction'''&lt;ref&gt;Some authors contend that there is a distinction between '''liquefaction''' and '''liquification''' (which is more commonly considered a misspelling), with the latter term applying only to processes involving heat. Ray Knox, David Stewart, ''The New Madrid Fault Finders Guide'' (1995), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; is a process that generates a [[liquid]] from a [[solid]] or a [[gas]]&lt;ref&gt;"Pharmeceutical Processes: Processes of Liquefaction", ''The Pharmaceutical Era'' (April 20, 1899), Vol. 21, p. 503, stating that "[by] a process of liquefaction is meant any process the effect of which is to cause a solid or gaseous body to assume or pass into the liquid state."&lt;/ref&gt; or that generates a non-liquid [[Phase (matter)|phase]] which behaves in accordance with [[fluid dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Liquefaction", ''The American Heritage Science Dictionary''  (2005), p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It occurs both [[nature|naturally]] and [[artificially]]. As an example of the latter, a "major commercial application of liquefaction is the liquefaction of air to allow separation of the constituents, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and the noble gases."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Cavendish Corporation Staff, ''How It Works: Science and Technology'' (2003), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the conversion of solid coal into a liquid form usable as a substitute for liquid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Speight, ''The Chemistry and Technology of Coal, Third Edition'' (2012), p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liquefaction on roads - North New Brighton centre in Christchurch Feb 2011 quake.jpg|thumb|right|The effects of [[soil liquefaction]], seen after [[2011 Canterbury earthquake]] ]]
In [[geology]], [[soil liquefaction]] refers to the process by which water-saturated, unconsolidated [[sediment]]s are transformed into a substance that acts like a liquid, often in an earthquake.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{cite web|author=USGS|title=About Liquefaction|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/sfgeo/liquefaction/aboutliq.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412163427/http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/sfgeo/liquefaction/aboutliq.html|archivedate=2013-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics and chemistry==
{{main|liquefaction of gases|melting}}
In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], the [[phase transitions]] from [[solid]] and [[gas]] to liquid ([[melting]] and [[condensation]], respectively) may be referred to as liquefaction. The [[melting point]] (sometimes called liquefaction point) is the temperature and pressure at which a solid becomes a liquid.

In commercial and industrial situations, the process of condensing a gas to liquid is sometimes referred to as [[liquefaction of gases]].

=== Coal ===
{{main|Coal liquefaction}}
[[Coal liquefaction]] is the production of [[liquid fuel]]s from [[coal]] using a variety of industrial processes.

===Dissolution ===
{{main|dissolution (chemistry)}}
Liquefaction is also used in commercial and industrial settings to refer to mechanical [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of a solid by [[mixing (process engineering)|mixing]], grinding or blending with a liquid.

====Food preparation====	
{{main|blender}}
In kitchen or laboratory settings, solids may be chopped into smaller parts sometimes in combination with a liquid, for example in food preparation or laboratory use. This may be done with a blender, or [[liquidiser]] in British English.

==Biology ==
{{main|liquefactive necrosis|semen analysis}}
In [[biology]], liquefaction often involves organic tissue turning into a more liquid-like state. For example, [[liquefactive necrosis]] in [[pathology]],&lt;ref name="RobbinsCotran"&gt;Robbins and Cotran: Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th Ed. 2010. Pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; or liquefaction as a parameter in [[semen analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Kavid|title=Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Technology Laboratory and Clinical Perspectives|year=2001|publisher=Taylor and Francis|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuS2CqreU3gC&amp;dq|accessdate=2013-11-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102015431/http://books.google.com/books?id=BuS2CqreU3gC&amp;dq|archivedate=2014-01-02|df=|isbn=9780415448949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page lists '''[[electric bicycle]] brands and manufacturing companies''' past and present, including [[self-balancing unicycle|electric unicycles]]. For bicycle parts, see [[List of bicycle part manufacturing companies]].

Many bicycle brands do not manufacture their own product, but rather import and re-brand bikes manufactured by others, sometimes designing the bike, specifying the equipment, and providing quality control. There are also brands that have, at different times, been manufacturers as well as [[badge engineering|re-branders]]: a company with manufacturing capability may market models made by other (overseas) factories, while simultaneously manufacturing bicycles in-house, for example, high-end models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utne.com/Environment/Keep-on-Biking-American-Made-Bikes-Making-Comeback.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''monolayer''' is a single, closely packed layer of [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ter Minassian-Saraga |first1=L. |date=1994 |title=Thin films including layers: terminology in relation to their preparation and characterization (IUPAC Recommendations 1994) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=1667–1738 (1672) |publisher=[[IUPAC]] |doi=10.1351/pac199466081667 |url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1994/pdf/6608x1667.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; or cells. In some cases it is referred to as a [[self-assembled monolayer]]. Monolayers of layered crystals like [[graphene]] and [[molybdenum disulfide]] are generally called [[2D materials]].

== Chemistry ==
A '''Langmuir monolayer''' or insoluble monolayer is a one-molecule thick layer of an insoluble organic material spread onto an [[aqueous]] sub[[phase (matter)|phase]] in a [[Langmuir–Blodgett trough|Langmuir-Blodgett Trough]]. Traditional compounds used to prepare [[Langmuir (unit)|Langmuir]] monolayers are [[amphiphilic]] materials that possess a [[hydrophilic]] headgroup and a [[hydrophobic]] tail. Since the 1980s a large number of other materials have been employed to produce Langmuir monolayers, some of which are semi-amphiphilic, including polymeric, ceramic or metallic nanoparticles and [[macromolecule]]s such as [[polymer]]s. Langmuir monolayers are extensively studied for the fabrication of [[Langmuir-Blodgett film]] (LB films), which are formed by transferred monolayers on a solid substrate. A [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] monolayer or soluble monolayer is a monolayer formed by a compound that is soluble in one of the phases separated by the [[interface (chemistry)|interface]] on which the monolayer is formed.

=== Formation time ===
The '''monolayer formation time''' or '''monolayer time''' is the length of time required, on average, for a surface to be covered by an adsorbate, such as oxygen sticking to fresh aluminum. If the adsorbate has a unity [[sticking coefficient]], so that every molecule which reaches the surface sticks to it without re-evaporating, then the monolayer time is very roughly:
:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{3 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{Pa} \times \mathrm{s}}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''t'' is the time and ''P'' is the pressure. It takes about 1 second for a surface to be covered at a pressure of 300&amp;nbsp;µPa (2×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr).

=== Monolayer phases and equations of state ===

A Langmuir monolayer can be compressed or expanded by modifying its area with a moving barrier in a Langmuir film balance. If the surface tension of the interface is measured during the compression, a ''compression isotherm'' is obtained. This isotherm shows the variation of surface pressure (&lt;math&gt;\Pi = \gamma^o - \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma^o&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension of the interface before the monolayer is formed) with the area (the inverse of surface concentration &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;). It is analogous with a 3D process in which [[pressure]] varies with [[volume]].

A variety of bidimensional [[phase (matter)|phases]] can be detected, each separated by a [[phase transition]]. During the phase transition, the surface pressure doesn't change, but the area does, just like during normal phase transitions volume changes but pressure doesn't.
The 2D phases, in increasing pressure order:
* Bidimensional gas: there are few molecules per area unit, and they have few interactions, therefore, analogous of the [[equation of state|equations of state]] for 3D gases can be used: ideal gas law &lt;math&gt;\Pi A = RT&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area per mole. As the surface pressure increases, more complex equations are needed (Van der Waals, virial...)
* Expanded liquid
* Compressed liquid
* Solid

If the area is further reduced once the solid phase has been reached, collapse occurs, the monolayer breaks and soluble aggregates and multilayers are formed

Gibbs monolayers also follow equations of state, which can be deduced from [[Gibbs isotherm]].
* For very dilute solutions &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \gamma_o - mC&lt;/math&gt;, through Gibbs isotherm another analogous of ideal gas law is reached &lt;math&gt;\Pi = \Gamma R T&lt;/math&gt;
* For more concentrated solutions and applying Langmuir isotherm &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \Gamma_{\max} \frac{C}{a+C}&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;\Pi = \Gamma_{\max}RT \left(1+\frac{C}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
Monolayers have a multitude of applications both at the air-water and at air-solid interphases.

Nanoparticle monolayers can be used to create functional surfaces that have for instance anti-reflective or superhydrophobic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biolinscientific.com/application/functional-nanoscale-nanoparticle-coatings/|title=Functional Nanoscale and Nanoparticle Coatings - Biolin Scientific|work=Biolin Scientific|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12668-017-0412-4#citeas/|title=Influence of Thermal Separation of Oleic Acid on the Properties of Quantum Dots Solutions and Optoelectronic of Their Langmuir Monolayers - BioNanoScience|work=BioNanoScience|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monolayers are frequently encountered in [[biology]]. A [[micelle]] is a monolayer, and the [[phospholipid]] [[lipid bilayer]] structure of [[cell membrane|biological membrane]]s is technically two monolayers. Langmuir monolayers are commonly used to mimic cell membrane to study the effects of pharmaceuticals or toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biolinscientific.com/zafepress.php?url=%2Fpdf%2FKSV%20NIMA%2FApplication%20Notes%2FKN-AN-01-Biomolecular-interactions-cell-membrane-models.pdf|title=Interactions of biomolecules in cell membrane models|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cell culture]] a monolayer refers to a layer of cells in which no cell is growing on top of another, but all are growing side by side and often touching each other on the same growth surface.

A '''nuclear navy''', or '''nuclear-powered navy''', refers to the portion of a [[navy]] consisting of [[naval ship]]s powered by [[nuclear marine propulsion]]. The concept was revolutionary for [[naval warfare]] when first proposed.  Prior to nuclear power, submarines were powered by diesel engines and could only submerge through the use of batteries.  In order for these submarines to run their [[diesel engine]]s and charge their batteries they would have to surface or snorkel.  The use of nuclear power allowed these submarines to become true submersibles and unlike their conventional counterparts, they became limited only by crew endurance and supplies.

==Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers==
The [[United States Navy]] has by far the most nuclear-powered [[aircraft carrier]]s, with ten [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier|Nimitz-class carriers]] and one [[Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier|Gerald R. Ford-class carrier]] in service. The last conventionally-powered aircraft carrier left the U.S. fleet as of 12 May 2009, when the [[USS_Kitty_Hawk_(CV-63)#Retirement|USS ''Kitty Hawk'' (CV-63)]] was deactivated. France's latest aircraft carrier, the [[French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle|''R91 Charles de Gaulle'']], is nuclear-powered. The United Kingdom rejected nuclear power early in the development of its [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier|''Queen Elizabeth''-class aircraft carrier]]s on cost grounds, as even several decades of fuel use costs less than a nuclear reactor.&lt;ref&gt;Morrocco, John. "U.K. Launches Future Aircraft Carrier Studies" Aviation. ''Week and Space Technology.'' The McGraw-Hill Companies, 1 February 1999. Retrieved on 28 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1949 the [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]] near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] has been one of the lead laboratories in the development of the nuclear navy. The planned [[Vikrant-class aircraft carrier|Indian]] [[INS Vishal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India’s Modi Approves Aircraft Carrier Funding |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/07/indias-modi-approves-aircraft-carrier-funding// |work=The Diplomat |last=Keck |first=Zachary |date=11 July 2014 |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Chinese aircraft carrier programme|Indigenous Chinese Carriers]] also feature Nuclear Propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China plans nuclear-powered aircraft carriers: US expert|url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20141217000096&amp;cid=1101|work=Want China Times|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear-powered submarines==
{{main|Nuclear submarine}}
The United States Navy operates the largest fleet of nuclear submarines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://193.71.199.52/en/international/russia/navy/northern_fleet/vessels/34070.html Bellona Environmental Foundation web site, Nuclear Naval Vessels web page], accessed 22 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the United States Navy, the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom, and France's ''[[Marine Nationale]]'' field an all-nuclear submarine force. By 1989, there were over 400 nuclear-powered submarines operational or being built.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Shultis, R. E. Faw, &lt;cite&gt;Fundamentals of Nuclear Science and Engineering&lt;/cite&gt;, Marcel Dekker, 2002, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 250 of these submarines have now been scrapped and some on order cancelled, due to weapons reduction programs. [[Russia]] and the [[United States]] had over one hundred each, with the United Kingdom and France fewer than twenty each and [[China]] six. The [[Indian Navy]] launched their first indigenous [[Arihant class submarine|''Arihant'' class]] nuclear-powered submarines on 26 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/07/26/india.nuclear.submarine/index.html | work=CNN | title=India launches nuclear submarine - CNN.com | accessdate=20 May 2010 | date=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is also operating one nuclear attack submarine with talks of leasing one more nuclear submarine from Russia. India plans to build six nuclear attack submarines and follow on to the Arihant class of ballistic missile submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/indias-undersea-deterrent|title=India’s Undersea Deterrent|last=Diplomat|first=Saurav Jha, The|website=The Diplomat|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear-powered cruisers==
{{main|Nuclear cruiser}}
The US had several nuclear cruisers.  The cruisers were the [[USS Bainbridge (CGN-25)|USS ''Bainbridge'']], [[USS California (CGN-36)|USS ''California'']], [[USS Long Beach (CGN-9)|USS ''Long Beach'']], [[USS Truxtun (CGN-35)|USS ''Truxtun'']], [[USS South Carolina (CGN-37)|USS ''South Carolina'']], [[USS Virginia (CGN-38)|USS ''Virginia'']], [[USS Texas (CGN-39)|USS ''Texas'']], [[USS Mississippi (CGN-40)|USS ''Mississippi'']], and [[USS Arkansas (CGN-41)|USS ''Arkansas'']]. ''Long Beach'' was deemed too expensive and was decommissioned in 1995 instead of receiving her third nuclear refueling and proposed upgrade. She was sold for scrap in 2012 at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]]. Currently the United States does not have any nuclear [[cruiser]]s.

Russia has four [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirov''-class battlecruisers]], though only one is active, the other three being laid up. The [[Soviet command ship SSV-33|command ship ''SSV-33 Ural'']], based on the Kirov class, is also laid up. Seven civilian [[nuclear icebreaker]]s remain in service: four of six [[Arktika class icebreaker]]s, the two [[Taymyr class nuclear icebreaker|Taymyr-class icebrakers]] ''[[Taymyr (1987 icebreaker)|Taymyr]]'' and ''[[Vaygach (nuclear icebreaker)|Vaygach]]'', and the [[lighter aboard ship|LASH carrier]] and [[container ship]] ''[[Sevmorput]]''.

== United States Navy ==

By 2003 the U.S. Navy had accumulated over 5,400 "reactor years" of accident-free experience, and operated more than 80 nuclear-powered ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/testimony/safety/bowman031029.txt Statement of Admiral F. L. "Skip" Bowman, U.S. Navy Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program before the House Committee on Science 29 October 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;

,p. 217: "[[Chet Holifield]]... member of the JCAE... said 'Of all the men I dealt with in public service, at least one will go down in history: Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, the father of the nuclear Navy.'&lt;/ref&gt;
was an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] by training, and was the primary architect who implemented this daring concept, and believed that it was the natural next phase for the way military vessels could be propelled and powered. The challenge was to reduce the size of a nuclear reactor to fit on board a [[ship]] or [[submarine]], as well as to encase it sufficiently so that [[radiation]] hazards would not be a safety concern.

Soon after [[World War II]], Rickover was assigned to the [[Bureau of Ships]] in September 1947 and received training in nuclear power at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. In February 1949 he received an assignment to the [[Division of Reactor Development]], [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] and then assumed control of the United States Navy's effort as Director of the Naval Reactors Branch in the Bureau of Ships. This dual role allowed him to lead the efforts to develop the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'' (SSN 571)]], which was launched in 1954. As [[Vice Admiral]], from 1958, for three decades Rickover exercised tight control over the [[ship]]s, [[technology]], and [[personnel]] of the nuclear navy, even interviewing every prospective [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] for new nuclear-powered navy vessels.

=== Philip Abelson ===

Leading nuclear physicist [[Philip Abelson]] (1913–2004) turned his attention under the guidance of [[Ross Gunn]] to applying [[nuclear power]] to [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval propulsion]]. Their early efforts at [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) provided an early glimpse at what was to become the nuclear Navy.

=== United States Naval reactors ===
{{main|United States Naval reactor}}

At the present time, many important vessels in the United States Navy are powered by nuclear reactors.  All submarines and aircraft carriers are nuclear-powered.  Several cruisers were nuclear-powered but these have all been retired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ Federation of American Scientists, Military Analysis web site], accessed 22 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

United States naval reactors are given three-character designations consisting of a letter representing the ship type the reactor is designed for, a consecutive generation number, and a letter indicating the reactor's designer. The ship types are "A" for [[aircraft carrier]], "C" for [[cruiser]], "D" for [[destroyer]], and "S" for [[submarine]].  The designers are "W" for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], "G" for [[General Electric]], "C" for [[Combustion Engineering]], and "B" for [[Bechtel]].  Examples are S5W, D1G, A4W, and D2W.

Most information concerning United States naval reactors is not secret—see [[Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information]].

'''Photoelectrochemical oxidation''' (PECO) is the process by which incident light enables a [[semiconductor]] material to promote a [[catalytic oxidation]] reaction. While a [[photoelectrochemical cell]] typically involves both a semiconductor (electrode) and a metal (counter-electrode), at sufficiently small scales, pure semiconductor particles can behave as microscopic photoelectrochemical cells. PECO has been used for the detoxification of air and water, hydrogen production, and other applications.

==Reaction Mechanism==
The process by which a photon initiates a chemical reaction directly is known as [[photolysis]]; if this process is aided by a catalyst, it is called [[photocatalysis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Y. Goswami, Principles of solar engineering, 3rd ed. Boca Raton: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; If a photon has more energy than a material's characteristic band gap, it can free an electron upon absorption by the material. The remaining, positively charged hole and the free electron may recombine, generating heat, or they can take part in photoreactions with nearby species. If the photoreactions with these species result in regeneration of the electron-donating material—i.e., if the material acts as a catalyst for the reactions—then the reactions are deemed photocatalytic. PECO represents a type of photocatalysis whereby semiconductor-based electrochemistry catalyzes an oxidation reaction—for example, the oxidative degradation of an airborne contaminant in air purification systems.

The principal objective of photoelectrocatalysis is to provide low-energy activation pathways for the passage of electronic charge carriers through the electrode electrolyte interface and, in particular, for the photoelectrochemical generation of chemical products.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;H. Tributsch, "Photoelectrocatalysis," in Photocatalysis: Fundamentals and Applications, N. Serpone and E. Pelizzetti, Eds., ed New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1989, pp. 339-383.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to photoelectrochemical oxidation, we may consider, for example, the following system of reactions, which constitute TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed oxidation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;O. Legrini, E. Oliveros, and A. Braun, "Photochemical processes for water treatment," Chemical Reviews, vol. 93, pp. 671-698, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (hv) → TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) +RX → TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + RX&lt;sup&gt;.+&lt;/sup&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) + OH&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; → TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;

This system shows a number of pathways for the production of oxidative species that facilitate the oxidation of the species, RX, in addition to its direct oxidation by the excited TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself. PECO concerns such a process where the electronic charge carriers are able to readily move through the reaction medium, thereby to some extent mitigating recombination reactions that would limit the oxidative process. The “photoelectrochemical cell” in this case could be as simple as a very small particle of the semiconductor catalyst. Here, on the “light” side a species is oxidized, while on the “dark” side a separate species is reduced.&lt;ref name=airdis&gt;D. Y. Goswami, "Photoelectrochemical air disinfection " US Patent 7,063,820 B2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photochemical oxidation (PCO) versus PECO==
The classical macroscopic photoelectrochemical system consists of a semiconductor in electric contact with a counter-electrode. For n-type semiconductor particles of sufficiently small dimension, the particles polarize into anodic and cathodic regions, effectively forming microscopic photoelectrochemical cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The illuminated surface of a particle catalyzes a [[photooxidation]] reaction, while the “dark” site of the particle facilitates a concomitant reduction.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Bard, "Photoelectrochemistry and heterogeneous photo-catalysis at semiconductors," Journal of Photochemistry, vol. 10, pp. 59-75, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoelectrochemical oxidation may be thought of as a special case of photochemical oxidation (PCO). Photochemical oxidation entails the generation of radical species that enable oxidation reactions, with or without the electrochemical interactions involved in semiconductor-catalyzed systems, which occur in photoelectrochemical oxidation. An example of a photochemical oxidation system that is not strictly speaking photoelectrochemical in nature would be the oxidative degradation of organic contaminants by the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Here, direct photolysis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generates the [[hydroxyl]] radicals needed for oxidative degradation without the use of a semiconductor catalyst.

==Applications==
The primary applications for photochemical / photoelectrochemical oxidation include air disinfection / purification, water disinfection / purification, hydrogen production (i.e., through water splitting), and [[environmental remediation]], to name a few. Significant work has been done in the realm of air and water treatment, which is described in more detail below.

===Air purification===
PECO has shown promise for the disinfection (i.e., removal of biological aerosols) and purification (i.e., more generally, removing contaminants) of air in HVAC and other applications. Photocatalytic oxidation has been used to successfully oxidize various organic contaminants, including [[alcohol]]s, [[chlorocarbons]], and BTEX compounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With an effective catalyst, and light source of sufficient intensity and appropriate wavelength, virtually any volatile organic compound can be removed, at least in part, from an air source.

Perhaps more important for HVAC applications in general is the disinfection of air. In many homes and workplaces, allergens can hamper comfort and productivity in sensitive individuals; these materials can be oxidized via a PECO system, provided the residence time in the treatment media is sufficient.&lt;ref name="airdis" /&gt; More troubling are virus and / or bacteria, which can cause infectious diseases if they are allowed to accumulate in indoor air. UV treatment for air disinfection has been proven effective; however, use of an effective photocatalyst (e.g., TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a PECO air cleaning system) with [[UV radiation]] leads to significantly higher reductions in populations of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Block and D. Y. Goswami, "Chemically enhanced sunlight for killing bacteria," American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New York, NY (United States)1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Air treatment in HVAC applications can lead to unseen benefits. In a process referred to HVAC load reduction (HLR), air treatment may minimize the number of air changes required to maintain sufficient indoor air quality, thereby reducing energy use.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy. (2/8/2016). [http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/enverid-systems-hvac-load-reduction enVerid Systems - HVAC Load Reduction].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water purification===
As with air, PECO treatment can be applied to aqueous systems for disinfection / purification purposes. Some of the early work in investigating semiconductor-catalyzed detoxification processes was done on water systems, including that of Kinney and Ivanuski.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;L. C. Kinney and V. R. Ivanuski, "Photolysis mechanisms for pollution abatement," 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of photocatalytic water purification methods as they pertain to environmental remediation can be seen in the field pilot test performed at the Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, Florida, in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;D. Y. Goswami, J. Klausner, G. Mathur, A. Martin, K. Schanze, P. Wyness, et al., "Solar photocatalytic treatment of groundwater at Tyndall AFB: field test results," in Proceedings of the... Annual Conference, American Solar Energy Society, Inc, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed approximately 90 – 100 percent reduction in contaminant concentration (predominately BTEX) with treatment time of approximately 45 minutes.

==History==
An important early effort in the field is that of Goodeve and Kitchener, who were among the first to demonstrate the “photosensitization” of  TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—e.g., as evidenced by the fading of paints incorporating it as a pigment.&lt;ref&gt;C. Goodeve and J. Kitchener, "Photosensitisation by titanium dioxide," Transactions of the Faraday Society, vol. 34, pp. 570-579, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important work is that of Markham and Laidler.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Markham and K. J. Laidler, "A kinetic study of photo-oxidations on the surface of zinc oxide in aqueous suspensions," The Journal of Physical Chemistry, vol. 57, pp. 363-369, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; They demonstrated through several measurements and a process of deduction that the generation of hydrogen peroxide by aqueous suspensions of ZnO under UV irradiation must occur by transferring a freed electron from the semiconductor, forming the perhydroxyl radical. They further indicated that when organic compounds were present, these compounds were oxidized at the semiconductor surface by oxidizing species with increased production of hydrogen peroxide.

Early forays into the realm of macro-scale photoelectrochemical cells began at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]], where researchers measured electrochemical responses of various semiconductors, including TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to light and dark.&lt;ref&gt;B. Parkingson and J. Turner, "The Potential Contribution of Photoelectrochemistry in the Global Energy Future," in Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: Materials, Processes and Architectures, H.-J. Lewerenz and L. Peter, Eds., 1st ed Cambridge, UK: Royal Society of Chemistry, 2013, pp. 1 – 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Boddy demonstrated the evolution of oxygen using rutile-phase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an anode in a cell containing various types of electrolytic solutions under UV irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;P. Boddy, "Oxygen evolution on semiconducting TiO2," Journal of the Electrochemical Society, vol. 115, pp. 199-203, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, n-type TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is shown to liberate the electrons (as free radicals) necessary to split water and generate gaseous oxygen. Subsequent researchers continued to elucidate the potential for semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical water splitting, beginning with the work of Fujishima and Honda.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fujishima and K. Honda, "Electrochemical evidence for the mechanism of the primary stage of photosynthesis," Bulletin of the chemical society of Japan, vol. 44, pp. 1148-1150, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important early study in the photoelectrochemical oxidation of organic contaminants in water was undertaken by Kinney and Ivanuski.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They showed the potential for a variety of metal oxides, including TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to catalyze the oxidation of dissolved organic materials (phenol, benzoic acid, acetic acid, sodium stearate, and sucrose) under illumination by sunlamps. Additional work by Carey et al. showed similar oxidative degradation in the photodechlorination of PCBs in the presence of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Carey, J. Lawrence, and H. M. Tosine, "Photodechlorination of PCB's in the presence of titanium dioxide in aqueous suspensions," Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, vol. 16, pp. 697-701, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant work has been done designing photo reactors that make use of the basic principle behind PECO for detoxification. Many of these reactors use solar radiation as the photon source, although in some cases other light sources may be employed. Pacheco and Tyner developed a simple solar photocatalytic reactor modeled on the well-known parabolic trough concentrator design.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Pacheco and C. E. Tyner, "Enhancement of processes for solar photocatalytic detoxification of water," Sandia National Labs., Albuquerque, NM (USA)1990.&lt;/ref&gt; They distributed the catalyst (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in TCE-contaminated water for treatment. Mehos and Turchi applied a similar reactor to groundwater remediation.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Mehos and C. S. Turchi, "Field testing solar photocatalytic detoxification on TCE‐contaminated groundwater," Environmental progress, vol. 12, pp. 194-199, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate strategy for water treatment is the falling-film reactor, which may use sunlight as the irradiation source in a central receiver-type arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Tyner, C. Haslund, J. Pacheco, and J. T. Holmes, "Rapid destruction of organic chemicals in groundwater using sunlight," Sandia National Labs., Albuquerque, NM (USA)1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goswami was the first to propose a system for photocatalytic air disinfection through the incorporation of photocatalyst material, light source, and filter in existing HVAC systems.&lt;ref&gt;D. Y. Goswami, "Photocatalytic air disinfection," US Patent 5,933,702 A, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was specifically intended to address bio-aerosols in air streams that, if left unchecked, could lead to “sick building syndrome.” Later work by Goswami incorporated PECO processes to treat bio-aerosols and other contaminants (e.g., VOCs) in a similar system for air and water purification.&lt;ref name="airdis" /&gt;

The '''photorefractive effect''' is a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] effect seen in certain [[crystal]]s and other materials that respond to [[light]] by altering their [[refractive index]].&lt;ref name="jaime"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It can also be used to create a [[phase-conjugate mirror]] or an [[Soliton (optics)|optical spatial soliton]].

==Mechanism==
The photorefractive effect occurs in several stages:
#A photorefractive material is illuminated by  [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] beams of light. (In holography, these would be the signal and reference beams). [[Interference (wave propagation)|Interference]] between the beams results in a pattern of dark and light fringes throughout the crystal.
#In regions where a bright fringe is present, [[electron]]s can absorb the light and be photoexcited from an [[impurity level]] into the [[conduction band]] of the material, leaving an [[electron hole]] (a net positive charge). Impurity levels have an [[energy]] intermediate between the energies of the [[valence band]] and conduction band of the material.
#Once in the conduction band, the electrons are free to move and [[diffusion|diffuse]] throughout the crystal. Since the electrons are being excited preferentially in the bright fringes, the net electron diffusion current is towards the dark-fringe regions of the material.
#While in the conduction band, the electrons may with some probability recombine with the holes and return to the impurity levels. The rate at which this recombination takes place determines how far the electrons diffuse, and thus the overall strength of the photorefractive effect in that material. Once back in the impurity level, the electrons are trapped and can no longer move unless re-excited back into the conduction band (by light).
#With the net redistribution of electrons into the dark regions of the material, leaving holes in the bright areas, the resulting charge distribution causes an [[electric field]], known as a ''space charge field'' to be set up in the crystal. Since the electrons and holes are trapped and immobile, the space charge field persists even when the illuminating beams are removed.
#The internal space charge field, via the [[electro-optic effect]], causes the refractive index of the crystal to change in the regions where the field is strongest. This causes a spatially varying refractive index [[diffraction grating|grating]] to occur throughout the crystal. The pattern of the grating that is formed follows the light interference pattern originally imposed on the crystal.
#The refractive index grating can now [[diffraction|diffract]] light shone into the crystal, with the resulting diffraction pattern recreating the original pattern of light stored in the crystal.

==Application==
The photorefractive effect can be used for [[dynamic holography]], and, in particular, for cleaning of coherent beams.  
For example, in the case of a hologram, illuminating the grating with just the reference beam causes the reconstruction of the original signal beam. When two coherent [[laser]] beams (usually obtained by splitting a laser beam by the use of a [[beamsplitter]] into two, and then suitably redirecting by [[mirror]]s) cross inside a [[photorefractive]] [[crystal]], the resultant [[refractive index]] [[grating]] diffracts the laser beams. As a result, one beam gains energy and becomes more intense at the expense of light intensity reduction of the other. This phenomenon is an example of [[two-wave mixing]]. In this configuration, [[Bragg's law|Bragg diffraction condition]] is automatically satisfied.

The pattern stored inside the crystal persists until the pattern is erased; this can be done by flooding the crystal with uniform illumination which will excite the electrons back into the conduction band and allow them to be distributed more uniformly.

Photorefractive materials include [[barium titanate]] (BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[lithium niobate]] (LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[vanadium]] doped [[zinc telluride]] (ZnTe:V), [[organic photorefractive materials]], certain [[photopolymer]]s, and some [[multiple quantum well]] structures.

There were even claims that an amplifier based on photorefractive crystals can have less than the minimum [[quantum noise]] that is typical for optical amplifiers of any kind.{{who|date=September 2012}}

[[British Columbia]] is the only place in the country where it is legal to drive a [[low-speed vehicle]] (LSV) electric car on public roads, although it also requires low speed warning marking and flashing lights. Quebec is allowing LSVs in a three-year pilot project. These cars will not be allowed on the highway, but will be allowed on city streets.

==Government incentives==

[[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#Canada|Purchase incentives for new plug-in electric vehicle]]s (PEVs) were established in [[Ontario]] consisting of a rebate between {{CAD|5,000}} (4&amp;nbsp;kWh battery) to {{CAD|8,500}} (17&amp;nbsp;kWh or more) (~{{USD|5,050}} to {{USD|8,650}}), depending on battery size, for purchasing or leasing a new PEV after July 1, 2010. The rebates will be available to the first 10,000 applicants who qualify.&lt;ref name=Ontario10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2010/06/ontario-paves-the-way-for-electric-vehicles.html|title=Ontario Paves The Way For Electric Vehicles|publisher=Newsroom Ontario|date=2010-06-18|accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OntarioFAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/vehicle/electric/ev-faq.shtml#incentive|title=Which cars are eligible for Ontario's Electric Vehicle Incentive Program?|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Transportation|date=2011-09-21|accessdate=2011-09-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909045313/http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/vehicle/electric/ev-faq.shtml#incentive|archivedate=2011-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province also introduced green-coloured [[Vehicle registration plates of Ontario|licence plates]] for exclusive use of [[plug-in hybrid]]s and [[battery electric vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=Ontario10/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT0709&gt;{{cite news|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/new-incentives-for-electric-cars-in-canada/|title=New Incentives for Electric Cars in Canada|author=John Loric|publisher=New York Times|date=2009-07-15|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GPlates&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2009/11/02/ontario-green-licence-plates642.html|title=Ontario gets new green licence plates|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=2010-06-05|date=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These unique [[green vehicle]] plates allow PEV owners to travel in the province's [[carpool lanes]] until 2015 regardless of the number of passengers in the vehicle. Also, owners are eligible to use [[recharging station]]s at [[GO Transit]] and other provincially owned parking lots.&lt;ref name=Ontario10/&gt;&lt;ref name=GPlates/&gt;

[[Quebec]] began offering rebates of up to {{CAD|8000}} (~ {{USD|8358}}) beginning on January 1, 2012, for the purchase of new [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s equipped with a minimum of 4 [[kWh]] battery, and new [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s are eligible for a {{CAD|1,000}} rebate. All-electric vehicles with high-capacity battery packs were eligible for the full {{CAD|8,000}} rebate, and incentives were reduced for low-range electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Quebec's government earmarked  {{CAD|50 million}}({{USD|52.3 million}}) for the program, and the maximum rebate amount was set to be slowly reduced every year until a maximum of {{CAD|3,000}} in 2015, but the rebates would continue until the fund runs out. There was also a ceiling for the maximum number of eligible vehicles: 10,000 for all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, and 5,000 for conventional hybrids.&lt;ref name=QuebecRebate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/04/11/quebec-offer-plug-in-vehicle-rebates-8000-dollars/|title=

In November 2013, the provincial government announced its decision to earmark in 2014 an additional {{CAD|65 million}} (~ {{USD|45.5 million}}) to fund a three-year extension to the electric-vehicle rebate program. The maximum rebate was kept at {{CAD|8000}}, but a graded scale was introduced in order to spread the incentive over 10,000 or more vehicles.&lt;ref name=Quebec2014&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1088156_will-quebec-join-california-oregon-as-electric-car-pioneers | title=Will Quebec Join California, Oregon As Electric-Car Pioneers? | first=Matthew |last=Klippenstein | work=Green Car Reports | date=2013-11-07 | accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quebec's government also set the goal to deploy 12,500 more electric vehicles in the province by 2017, consisting of 10,200 consumer cars, 325 taxis, and 2,000 government-fleet vehicles.&lt;ref name=Quebec2014/&gt; Also, incentives were issued for "[[green vehicle|greening]]" 525 taxis, aimed to introduce 325 plug-in vehicles (275 plug-in hybrids and 50 all-electrics) and 200 conventional hybrids. The purchase incentives start at  {{CAD|20,000}} for battery-electric taxis,  {{CAD|12,000}} for plug-in hybrids, and  {{CAD|3,000}} for conventional hybrids, with the rebate declining over time. The province planned to also subsidize the deployment of charging stations for taxis.&lt;ref name=Quebec2014/&gt;

In October 2016, the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] passed a new zero emission vehicle legislation that obliges any carmaker who sells in the Canadian province more than 4,500 new vehicles per year over a three-year average, to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% of the total number of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be [[zero emissions vehicle]]s (ZEV) starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A [[Carbon credit|tradable credit system]] was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. The quotas will be determined by Quebec's [[Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (Quebec)|Ministry of Sustainable Development]]. Quebec became the first Canadian province to pass such legislation, joining ten U.S. states, including California, that have similar ZEV laws. Quebec aims to have 100,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by 2020.&lt;ref name=QuebecPEVs/&gt;&lt;ref name=QuebecZEV&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-autos-quebec-idUSL1N1CW1TZ | title=Quebec approves new law to boost sales of zero emission vehicles | first=Allison |last=Lampert | work=[[Reuters]] | date=2016-10-26 | accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the provincial government set the goal in 2011 to have 300,000 plug-in vehicles on the roads by 2020.&lt;ref name=QuebecRebate/&gt;

The Government of [[British Columbia]] announced the ''LiveSmart BC'' program which will start offering rebates of up to  {{CAD|5,000}} per eligible clean energy vehicle commencing on December 1, 2011. The incentives will be available until March 31, 2013 or until available funding is depleted, whichever comes first. Available funds are enough to provide incentives for approximately 1,370 vehicles. Battery electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles and plug-in hybrids with battery capacity of 15.0 kWh and above are eligible for a {{CAD|5,000}} incentive. Also effective December 1, 2011, rebates of up to {{CAD|500}} per qualifying electric vehicle charging equipment will be available to B.C. residents who have purchased a clean energy vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/|title=The Clean Energy Vehicle (CEV) Program|publisher=LiveSmart BC|date=2011-11-05|accessdate=2011-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114150054/http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/|archivedate=2011-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/vehicle_incentives_list.pdf|title=Table 1 –Examples of Clean Energy Vehicles and Incentive Levels|publisher=LiveSmart BC|accessdate=2011-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403123015/http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/vehicle_incentives_list.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PoundTroy.jpg|right|thumb|A pound troy weight.]]
The '''pound''' or '''pound-mass''' is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]] 
used in the [[Imperial units|imperial]], [[United States customary units|United States customary]] and other [[systems of measurement]]. Various definitions have been used; the most common today is the international [[avoirdupois]] pound, which is legally defined as exactly {{val|0.45359237|ul=kilograms}}, and which is divided into 16 avoirdupois [[ounces]].&lt;ref name=NGS/&gt; The international standard symbol for the avoirdupois pound is '''lb''';&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 260.1™-2004, IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Units of Measurement (SI Units, Customary Inch-Pound Units, and Certain Other Units)&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative symbol is '''lb&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;ref name="isbn_978-0135018583"&gt;{{Citation |last=Fletcher |first=Leroy S. |last2=Shoup |first2=Terry E. |year=1978 |title=Introduction to Engineering |publisher=Prentice-Hall |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyohAQAAIAAJ |isbn=978-0135018583 |lccn=77024142 |postscript=.}}{{rp|257}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for most pound definitions), '''#''' ([[number sign|chiefly in the U.S.]]), and '''℔'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=unicode chart 2100-214F|url=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2100.pdf|work=character 2114 of the Unicode 6.0 and 5.0 standards|publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]]|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''″̶'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dictionary of Medical and Surgical Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIVZAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (specifically for the [[apothecaries' system|apothecaries' pound]]).

The unit is descended from the [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Weight|Roman ''libra'']] (hence the abbreviation "lb").  The English word ''pound'' is [[cognate]] with, among others,  [[German language|German]] ''Pfund'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''pond'', and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''pund''.  All ultimately derive from a borrowing into [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] of the  [[Latin language|Latin]] expression ''lībra pondō'' ("a pound by weight"), in which the word ''pondō'' is the [[ablative case]] of the Latin noun ''pondus'' ("weight").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''s.v.'' 'pound'&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the unqualified term ''pound'' reflects the [[Mass versus weight|historical conflation of mass and weight]]. This accounts for the modern distinguishing terms ''pound-mass'' and ''[[pound-force]]''.

==Current use==
The United States and countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] agreed upon common definitions for the pound and the [[yard]]. Since 1 July 1959, the [[International yard and pound|international avoirdupois pound]] (symbol lb) has been defined as exactly {{val|0.45359237|u=kg}}.&lt;ref name="Standards1959"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

An [[avoirdupois]] pound is equal to 16 avoirdupois [[ounce]]s and to exactly 7,000 [[Grain (unit)|grain]]s. The conversion factor between the kilogram and the international pound was therefore chosen to be divisible by 7, and an (international) grain is thus equal to exactly {{val|64.79891|ul=milligrams}}.

In the UK, the process of [[metrication in the United Kingdom|metrication]] and [[European units of measurement directives]] were expected to eliminate the use of the pound and ounce, but in 2007 the European Commission abandoned the requirement for metric-only labelling on packaged goods there, and allowed for dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6988521.stm |title=EU gives up on 'metric Britain |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 May 2015 |date=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will British people ever think in metric?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16245391|publisher=BBC||accessdate=4 May 2015|date=21 December 2011|first1=Jon|last1=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used as a measurement of body weight the UK practice remains to use the [[stone (unit)|stone]] of 14 pounds as the primary measure e.g. "11 stone 4 pounds", rather than "158 pounds" (as done in the US),&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hopkins, Ann Pope, Sandy Pepperell (2013).

==Historic use==
[[File:comparison of pounds.svg|thumb|400px|Comparison of the relative sizes of avoirdupois, troy, Tower, merchant and London pounds.]]
Historically, in different parts of the world, at different points in time, and for different applications, the pound (or its translation) has referred to broadly similar but not identical standards of mass or force.&lt;ref&gt;The pound is often described as a unit of "weight", and the word "weight" can refer to either mass or force depending on context. Historically and in common parlance, "weight" refers to mass, but [[weight]] as used in modern physics is a force.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman ''libra''===
[[File:Gewichtmaße1.jpg|thumb|250px|Various historic pounds from a German textbook dated 1848]]

The libra (Latin for "scales / balance") is an [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|ancient Roman unit]] of mass that was equivalent to approximately 328.9 grams.&lt;ref name="Zupko1977"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zupko |first=Ronald Edward |authorlink=Ronald Edward Zupko |title=British weights &amp; measures: a history from antiquity to the seventeenth century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWUgAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=roman+libra+328.9&amp;q=5076#search_anchor |accessdate=27 November 2011 |year=1977 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinner1967"&gt;{{cite book |author=Frederick George Skinner |title=Weights and measures: their ancient origins and their development in Great Britain up to A.D. 1855 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDcLAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=roman+libra+328&amp;dq=roman+libra+328 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |year=1967 |publisher=H.M.S.O. |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers's encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chambers's encyclopaedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2fQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=roman+libra+328&amp;dq=roman+libra+328 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |volume=14 |year=1967 |publisher=Pergamon Press |page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was divided into 12 ''unciae'' (singular: ''uncia''), or ounces. The ''libra'' is the origin of the abbreviation for pound, "lb".

===In Britain===
A number of different definitions of the pound have historically been used in Britain. Amongst these were the [[#Avoirdupois pound|avoirdupois pound]] and the obsolete [[#Tower pound|Tower]], [[#Merchants' pound|merchant's]] and [[#London pound|London]] pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.clara.net/brianp/weights.html Grains and drams, ounces and pounds, stones and tons. Personal notes.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Troy pound|Troy pounds and ounces]] remain in use only for the weight of certain precious metals, especially in the trade; these are normally quoted just in ounces (e.g. "500 ounces") and, when the type of ounce is not explicitly stated, the troy system is assumed.

Historically, the [[pound sterling]] was a [[#Tower pound|Tower pound]] of silver. In 1528, the standard was changed to the [[#Troy pound|Troy pound]].

{{See also|English units}}

====Avoirdupois pound====
The [[avoirdupois]] pound, also known as the wool pound, first came into general use c. 1300. It was initially equal to 6992 troy grains. The pound avoirdupois was divided into 16 ounces. During the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], the avoirdupois pound was redefined as 7,000 troy grains. Since then, the [[Grain (measure)|grain]] has often been an integral part of the avoirdupois system. By 1758, two Elizabethan Exchequer standard weights for the avoirdupois pound existed, and when measured in troy grains they were found to be of 7,002 grains and 6,999 grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Skinner | first=F.G. | journal=Bulletin of the British Society for the History of Science | title=The English Yard and Pound Weight | year=1952 | doi=10.1017/S0950563600000646 | volume=1 | pages=184–6| issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Standards"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

====Imperial Standard Pound====
In the United Kingdom, weights and measures have been defined by a long series of Acts of Parliament, the intention of which has been to regulate the sale of commodities. Materials traded in the marketplace are quantified according to accepted units and standards in order to avoid fraud. The standards themselves are legally defined so as to facilitate the resolution of disputes brought to the courts; only legally defined measures will be recognised by the courts. Quantifying devices used by traders (weights, weighing machines, containers of volumes, measures of length) are subject to official inspection, and penalties apply if they are fraudulent.

The Weights and Measures Act of 1878 marked a major overhaul of the British system of weights and measures, and the definition of the pound given there remained in force until the 1960s. The pound was defined thus (Section 4) "The ... platinum weight ... deposited in the Standards department of the Board of Trade ... shall continue to be the imperial standard of ... weight ... and the said platinum weight shall continue to be the Imperial Standard for determining the Imperial Standard Pound for the United Kingdom". Paragraph 13 states that the weight ''in vacuo'' of this standard shall be called the Imperial Standard Pound, and that all other weights mentioned in the act and permissible for commerce shall be ascertained from it alone. The First Schedule of the Act gave more details of the standard pound: it is a platinum cylinder nearly {{convert|1.35|in|mm}} high, and {{convert|1.15|in|mm}} diameter, and the edges are carefully rounded off. It has a groove about {{convert|0.34|in|mm}} from the top, to allow the cylinder to be lifted using an ivory fork. It was constructed following the destruction of the Houses of Parliament by fire in 1834, and is stamped P.S. 1844, 1&amp;nbsp;lb (P.S. stands for "Parliamentary Standard"). This definition of the Imperial pound remains unchanged.

====Relationship to the kilogram====
The 1878 Act said that contracts worded in terms of metric units would be deemed by the courts to be made according to the Imperial units defined in the Act, and a table of metric equivalents was supplied so that the Imperial equivalents could be legally calculated. This defined, in UK law, metric units in terms of Imperial ones. The equivalence for the pound was given as 1&amp;nbsp;lb = {{val|453.59265|u=g}} or 0.45359&amp;nbsp;kg, which made the kilogram equivalent to about {{val|2.2046213|u=lb}}. In 1883, it was determined jointly by the Standards Department of the Board of Trade and the Bureau International that {{val|0.4535924277|u=kg}} was a better approximation, and this figure, rounded to {{val|0.45359243|u=kg}} was given legal status by an [[Order in Council]] in May 1898.&lt;ref name=nbs447&gt;{{cite book | title=Weights and measures standards of the United States&amp;nbsp;– A brief history | year=1976 | url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/contents.html | first=L.E. | last=Barbrow | author2=Judson, L.V. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153143/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/contents.html | archivedate=11 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1963, a new [[Weights and Measures Act]] reversed this relationship and the pound was defined for the first time as a mass equal to {{val|0.45359237|u=kg}} to match the definition of the international pound agreed in 1959.

====Troy pound====
{{main|Troy weight}}

A troy pound is equal to 12 [[troy ounce]]s and to 5,760 [[Grain (unit)|grains]], that is exactly {{val|373.2417216}} grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/upload/AppC-12-hb44-final.pdf| author=United States National Bureau of Standards | title=Appendix C of NIST Handbook 44, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices, General Tables of Units of Measurement| page=C-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Source uses U+002D Hyphen-Minus in page number and it should not be changed to n-dash. --&gt; Troy weights were used in England by jewellers. Apothecaries also used the troy pound and ounce, but added the drachms and scruples unit in the [[Apothecaries' system]] of weights.

[[Troy weight]] may take its name from the French market town of [[Troyes]] in France where English merchants traded at least as early as the early 9th century.&lt;ref name="zupko" /&gt;

The troy pound is no longer in general use or a legal unit for trade (it was abolished in the United Kingdom on 6 January 1879 by the Weights and Measures Act of 1878), but the [[troy ounce]], {{frac|1|12}} of a troy pound, is still used for measurements of gems such as opals, and precious metals such as silver, platinum and particularly gold.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/goldRpt/current_report.htm "Status Report of U.S. Government Gold Reserve"], Bureau of the Fiscal Service&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tower pound====
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon pound}}
[[File:The Pound.jpg|thumb|The Tower pound]]
The system called Tower weight was the more general name for King Offa's pound. This dates to 757 AD and was based on the [[silver penny]]. This in turn was struck over Arabic [[dirham]]s (2d). The pound was based on the weight of 120 Arabic silver dirhams, which have been found in [[Offa's Dyke]]. The same coin weight was used throughout the [[Hanseatic League]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;!-- McGreevy - The Basis of Measurement - Picton Publishing (1995) writes about the influence of the Arab half-direm (dihram?). --&gt;

The Tower pound was also called the '''Moneyers' Pound''' (referring to the Saxon moneyers before the Conquest),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tower pound |date=|location=|url=https://sizes.com/units/pound_tower.htm|accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''easterling pound''', which may refer to traders of eastern Germany, or to traders on the shore of the eastern Baltic sea, or dealers of Asiatic goods who settled at the Steelyard wharf;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Facsimile of First Volume of Ms. Archives of the Worshipful Company of Grocers of the City of London A.D. 1345-1463. |date=1886|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQI_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP33 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Rochelle Pound''' by French writers, because it was also in use at Rochelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English manual of banking |date=|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oUBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA191 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An almost identical weight was employed by the Germans for weighing gold and silver.

The mercantile pound (1304) of 6750 troy grains, or 9600 Tower grains, derives from this pound, as 25 shilling-weights or 15 Tower ounces, for general commercial use. Multiple pounds based on the same ounce were quite common. In much of Europe, the apothecaries' and commercial pounds were different numbers of the same ounce.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} &lt;!-- McGreevy notes 6750 troy ounces in the Mercantile pound, but makes no mention of tower grains. --&gt;

The Tower system was referenced to a standard prototype found in the [[Tower of London]] and ran concurrently with the avoirdupois and troy systems until the reign of Henry VIII, when a royal proclamation dated 1526 required that the troy pound to be used for mint purposes instead of the Tower pound.&lt;ref&gt;A proclamation of Henry VIII, 5 November 1526.

New Haven: Yale University Press,1964.[http://www.sizes.com/units/pound_tower.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; No standards of the Tower pound are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Connor and A. D. C.

The Tower pound was equivalent to about 350 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfreegold.co.uk/weights.html |title=Weights used for gold |publisher=Tax Free Gold |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dozenalsociety.org.uk/history/poundhist.html |title=A brief history of the pound |publisher=The Dozenal Society of Great Britain |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Merchants' pound====
The merchants' pound (''mercantile pound'', ''libra mercantoria'', or ''commercial pound'') was considered to be composed of 25 rather than 20 [[Tower pound|Tower]] [[shilling]]s of 12 [[pennyweight|pence]].&lt;ref name=tract&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Ruffhead |editor-first=Owen |editor-link=Owen Ruffhead |title=The Statutes at Large |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKZFAAAAcAAJ |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;I: From Magna Charta&lt;!--sic--&gt; to the End of the Reign of King Henry the Sixth.

====London pound====
The London pound is that of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]], as used in their various trading places.  The London pound is based on 16 ounces, each ounce divided as the tower ounce.  It never became a legal standard in England; the use of this pound waxed and waned with the influence of the Hansa itself.

A London pound was equal to 7,200 troy grains (16 troy ounces) or, equivalently, 10,240 tower grains (16 tower ounces).

===In the United States===
In the United States, the avoirdupois pound as a unit of mass has been officially defined in terms of the kilogram since the [[Mendenhall Order|Mendenhall Order of 1893]]. That Order defined the pound to be {{val|2.20462}} pounds to a kilogram. The following year, this relationship was refined as {{val|2.20462234}} pounds to a kilogram, following a determination of the British pound.&lt;ref name=nbs447 /&gt;

According to a 1959 [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] publication, the United States 1894 pound differed from the international pound by approximately one part in 10 million.&lt;ref name=NGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf|author=United States National Bureau of Standards|title=Notices "Refinement of values for the yard and the pound"|date=1959-06-25|accessdate=2006-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is so insignificant that it can be ignored for almost all practical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf |author=United States National Bureau of Standards |title=Appendix C of NIST Handbook 44, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices, General Tables of Units of Measurement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126000000/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf |archivedate=26 November 2006 |df= }} "In Great Britain, the Yard, the Avoirdupois Pound, the troy pound, and the Apothecaries pound are identical with the units of the same names used in the United States." (The introduction to this appendix makes it clear that the appendix is only for convenience and has no normative value: "In most of the other tables, only a limited number of decimal places are given, therefore making the tables better adopted to the average user.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine litra===
{{main|Byzantine units of measurement#Weight}}
The Byzantines used a series of measurements known as pounds ({{lang-la|libra}}, {{lang-el|λίτρα}}, ''litra''). The most common was the ''logarikē litra'' (λογαρική λίτρα, "pound of account"), established by [[Constantine the Great]] in 309/310. It formed the basis of the Byzantine [[Byzantine coinage|monetary system]], with one ''litra'' of gold equivalent to 72 ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]''. A hundred ''litrai'' were known as a ''kentēnarion'' (κεντηνάριον, "hundredweight"). Its weight seems to have decreased gradually from the original 324 grams to 319. Due to its association with gold, it was also known as the ''chrysaphikē litra'' (χρυσαφική λίτρα, "gold pound") or ''thalassia litra'' (θαλάσσια λίτρα, "maritime pound"), but it could also be used as a measure of land, equalling a fortieth of the ''thalassios [[modios]]''.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{cite book | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'' | chapter = Litra | page = 1238 | last = Schilbach | first = Erich | editor-first = Alexander P. | editor-last = Kazhdan | editor-link = Alexander Kazhdan | year = 1991 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-504652-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''soualia litra'' was specifically used for weighing olive oil or wood, and corresponded to 4/5 of the ''logarikē'', i.e. 256 g. Some outlying regions, especially in later times, adopted various local measures, based on Italian, Arab or Turkish measures. The most important of these was the ''argyrikē litra'' (αργυρική λίτρα, "silver pound") of 333 g, found in [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Cyprus]], and probably of Arab origin.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

===French livre===
{{See also|French units of measurement}}

Since the Middle Ages, various pounds (''livre'') have been used in France. Since the 19th century, a ''livre'' has referred to the ''[[#Metric pounds|metric pound]]'', 500g.

The ''livre esterlin'' was equivalent to about {{convert|367.1|g|gr}} and was used between the late 9th century and the mid-14th century.&lt;ref name="size.com-Francemass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/charts/UTBLFrancemass.htm|accessdate=2006-08-12|title=Pre-metric French units of mass livre and smaller|date=2001-03-16|author=Sizes, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''livre poids de marc'' or ''livre de Paris'' was equivalent to about {{convert|489.5|g|gr}} and was used between the 1350s and the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="size.com-Francemass" /&gt; It was introduced by the government of [[John II of France|John II]].

The ''livre métrique'' was set equal to the kilogram by the decree of ''13 Brumaire an IX'' between 1800 and 1812. This was a form of official metric pound.&lt;ref name="size.com-Francemass" /&gt;

The ''livre [[Mesures usuelles|usuelle]]'' (customary unit) was defined as 500 grams by the decree of 28 March 1812. It was abolished as a unit of mass effective 1 January 1840 by a decree of 4 July 1837,&lt;ref name="size.com-Francemass" /&gt; but is still used informally.

===German and Austrian Pfund===
Originally derived from the Roman libra, the definition varied throughout Germany in the Middle Ages and onward. The measures and weights of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] were reformed in 1761 by Empress [[Maria Theresia of Austria]].&lt;ref name=hille&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hille | first=K.C. | title=Medicinal-Gewicht |page=268 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfI3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA268 | journal=Magazin für Pharmacie und die dahin einschlagenden Wissenschaften | year=1831 | location=Heidelberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unusually heavy Habsburg (civil) pound of 16 ounces was later defined in terms of 560.012 grams. [[Bavaria]]n reforms in 1809 and 1811 adopted essentially the same standard pound. In [[Prussia]], a reform in 1816 defined a uniform civil pound in terms of the Prussian foot and distilled water, resulting in a Prussian pound of 467.711 grams.

Between 1803 and 1815, all German regions west of the [[River Rhine]] were French, organised in the [[Departments of France|departement]]s: [[Roer (department)|Roer]], [[Sarre (department)|Sarre]], [[Rhin-et-Moselle]], and [[Mont-Tonnerre]]. As a result of the Congress of Vienna, these became part of various German states. However, many of these regions retained the metric system and adopted a metric pound of precisely 500 grams. In 1854, the pound of 500 grams also became the official mass standard of the [[Zollverein|German Customs Union]], but local pounds continued to co-exist with the Zollverein pound for some time in some German states. Nowadays, the term ''Pfund'' is still in common use and universally refers to a pound of 500 grams.

===Russian funt===
The Russian pound (Фунт, funt) is an [[obsolete Russian unit of measurement]] of mass. It is equal to 409.51718 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cardarelli, F. |year=2004 |title=Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd |page=122 |isbn=1-85233-682-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KCx8Ww75VkC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, the Russian pound was the basic unit of weight and all other units of weight were formed from it.

===Skålpund===
The Skålpund was a Scandinavian measurement that varied in weight between regions. From the 17th century onward, it was equal to 425.076 grams in Sweden but was abandoned in 1889 when Sweden switched to the metric system.

In Norway, the same name was used for a weight of 498.1 grams. In Denmark, it equalled 471 grams.

In the 19th century, Denmark followed Germany's lead and redefined the pound as 500 grams.

===Jersey pound===
A Jersey pound is an obsolete unit of mass used on the island of [[Jersey]] from the 14th century to the 19th century. It was equivalent to about 7,561 grains (490 grams). It may have been derived from the [[#French livre|French livre poids de marc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/pound_jersey.htm|title=Jersey pound|author=Sizes, Inc. |accessdate=2006-08-12 |date=2003-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trone pound===
The trone pound is one of a number of [[obsolete Scottish units of measurement]]. It was equivalent to between 21 and 28 avoirdupois ounces (about 600-800 grams).

===Metric pounds===
In many countries, upon the introduction of a [[metric system]], the pound (or its translation) became an informal term for 500 grams. In [[German language|German]], the term is ''Pfund'', in [[French language|French]] ''livre'', in Dutch ''pond'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''libra'', in [[Italian language|Italian]] ''libbra'', and in [[Danish (language)|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''pund''.

Though not from the same linguistic origin, the Chinese ''jīn'' ({{lang|zh|斤}}, also known as "[[catty]]") has a modern definition of exactly 500 grams, divided into 10 ''liǎng'' ({{lang|zh|两}}). Traditionally about 605 grams, the ''jin'' has been in use for more than two thousand years, serving the same purpose as "pound" for the common-use measure of weight.

Hundreds of older pounds were replaced in this way. Examples of the older pounds are one of around 459 to 460 grams in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America; one of 498.1 grams in Norway; and several different ones in what is now Germany.

Although the use of the pound as an informal term persists in these countries to a varying degree, scales and measuring devices are denominated only in grams and kilograms. A pound of product must be determined by weighing the product in grams as the use of the ''pound'' is not [[European units of measurement directives|sanctioned]] for trade within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1980L0181:20090527:EN:PDF| author = The Council of the European Communities | title = Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to Unit of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC | date=2009-05-27 | accessdate=2009-09-14

Smoothbore cannon and carronades are designated by the weight in imperial pounds of round solid iron shot of diameter to fit the barrel. A cannon that fires a six-pound ball, for example, is called a ''six-pounder''. Standard sizes are 6, 12, 18, 24, 32 and 42 pounds; 68-pounders also exist, and other nonstandard weapons use the same scheme. See [[Carronade#Ordnance|carronade]].

A similar definition, using [[lead]] balls, exists for determining the [[gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] of [[shotgun]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4740">A '''pyrotechnic heat source''', also called '''heat pellet''', is a [[pyrotechnic device]] based on a [[pyrotechnic composition]] with a suitable [[igniter]]. Its role is to produce controlled amount of heat. Pyrotechnic heat sources are usually based on [[thermite]]-like (or sometimes [[delay composition]]-like) fuel-[[oxidizer]] compositions with slow burn rate, high production of heat at desired temperature, and low to zero production of gases.

Pyrotechnic heat sources can be activated by multiple means. [[Electric match]] and [[percussion cap]] are the most common ones.

Pyrotechnic heat sources are often used for activation of [[thermal battery|thermal batteries]], where they serve to melt the electrolyte. &lt;!-- rest of paragraph lifted from "thermal battery" --&gt; There are two main types of design.  One uses a fuze strip (containing [[barium chromate]] and powdered [[zirconium]] metal in a ceramic paper) along the edge of the heat pellets to initiate burning. The fuze strip is typically fired by an [[electric match|electrical igniter]] or [[squib (explosive)|squib]] by application of electric current. The second design uses a center hole in the battery stack into which the high-energy electrical igniter fires a mixture of hot gases and [[incandescent]] particles. The center-hole design allows much faster activation times (tens of milliseconds) vs. hundreds of milliseconds for the edge-strip design. Battery activation can also be accomplished by a [[percussion primer]], similar to a [[shotgun shell]]. It is desired that the pyrotechnic source be gasless. The standard heat source typically consist of mixtures of iron powder and [[potassium perchlorate]] in weight ratios of typically 88/12, 86/14, and 84/16. The higher the potassium perchorate level, the higher the heat output (nominally 200, 259, and 297 calories/gram, respectively). The size and thickness of the iron-perchlorate pellets has little influence on their burn rate, however the effect of density, composition, and particle size have significant effect on the burn rate and can be used for its adjusting for desired heat output profile.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, J.W.; Walters, R.R.; Guidotti, R.A.; Jacobson, A.K. "Burn-rate studies with iron/potassium perchlorate heat pellets" IEEE 35th InternationalPower Sources Symposium, 1992., 
22-25 Jun 1992 Page(s):211 - 214 {{doi|10.1109/IPSS.1992.282041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another composition in use is [[zirconium]] with [[barium chromate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADD014469 A High Temperature Molten Salt Thermal Electrochemical Cell]. Oai.dtic.mil (1990-02-12). Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Another mixture is 46.67 wt.% of [[titanium]], 23.33% of amorphous [[boron]], and about 30% [[barium chromate]]. Yet another one is 45 wt.% [[tungsten]], 40.5% [[barium chromate]], 14.5% [[potassium perchlorate]], and 1% [[vinyl alcohol acetate]] resin binder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patents.com/Heat-transfer-initiator/US20020035945/en-US/ Heat transfer initiator - US20020035945]. Patents.com. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions producing [[intermetallic]] components, e.g. [[zirconium]] with [[boron]], can be used when entirely gasless operation, non-[[hygroscopic]] behavior, and independence on environmental pressure are desired. &lt;ref name="surechem1"&gt;[http://www.surechem.org/index.php?Action=document&amp;docId=239155&amp;db=USPTO&amp;tab=summ&amp;lang=&amp;db_query=38%3A35%3ACN1C(%3DO)CN%3DC(c2ccccc2)c2cc(Cl)ccc12%3A8%3A6%3Asmiles%3A2%3A0%3A&amp;markupType=all SureChem]. SureChem. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heat paper''' can be prepared by impregnating paper or a fiberglass tape with a [[slurry]] of the mixture of fuel and oxidizer.&lt;ref name="surechem1"/&gt;

A pyrotechnic heat source can be a direct part of a pyrotechnic composition e.g. in [[chemical oxygen generator]]s a heat source composition with large surplus of oxidizer is used; the heat produced by burning the composition is used for [[thermal decomposition]] of the oxidizer. Relatively cold-burning compositions are used for production of [[colored smoke]] or for dispersion of aerosol of e.g. [[pesticide]]s or [[CS gas]], providing the heat of [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of the desired compound.

A phase moderating component of the composition, which forms together with the combustion products a mixture with at least one distinct temperature of [[phase transition]], may be used for stabilizing the burning temperature as a form of [[phase change material]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2006046245 (WO/2006/046245) HEAT SOURCES FOR THERMAL BATTERIES].

The ogham stone is much earlier; based on the [[Primitive Irish]] grammar, it is placed in AD 550–600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/ratas_1.html|title=CISP - RATAS/1|website=www.ucl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ogham Stone.jpg|thumb|The ogham stone]]

The stone is of fine purple sandstone (145 × 34 × 20 cm), with the inscription &lt;small&gt;[A]NM SILLANN MAQ VATTILLOGG&lt;/small&gt; ("name of Sílán son of Fáithloga").&lt;ref&gt;https://ogham.celt.dias.ie/stone.php?lang=en&amp;site=Ratass&amp;stone=Ratass&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in 1975 during a cleanup; it had been built into the sides of a 19th-century burial vault.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.megalithicireland.com/Ratass%20Church,%20Tralee,%20Kerry.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Remember Chek Jawa''''' is a 47-minute [[documentary film|documentary]] made on [[digital video]] by freelance [[cinematography|cinematographer]] Eric Lin Youwei.  It documents a biodiversity survey conducted in 2001, by a small group of volunteer [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s, headed by botanist Joseph Lai, months before the [[Singapore government]]'s reclamation project at [[Chek Jawa]], [[Pulai Ubin]]. Chek Jawa is an inter-tidal area of about 1 square kilometre which supports a vast amount of plant and animal lives encompassing six [[ecosystem]]s.

The volunteers' efforts were rewarded when the government agreed, in December 2001, to defer use of the Chek Jawa land for the next ten years.

The documentary is available as a [[DVD]] under Objectifs Films, available in the libraries under the [[National Library Board]], Singapore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">A '''severance''' can in law mean the act of severing a piece of land from a larger tract of land.  The severed parcel of land becomes a separate [[Lot (real estate)|lot]] (parcel).  Second, it can refer to, in jurisdictions that have the form of [[Concurrent estate|co-ownership]], the ending of a [[joint tenancy]] by act or event other than death.  Third, it can be defined in a [[definition]]s clause or table in ways including the removal of a party from an agreement, or a permitted ending of the agreement (e.g. [[break clause]]) &amp;mdash; in an employment contract/negotiations especially common as to [[severance pay]] and other terms of severance &amp;mdash; or part of the agreement in which case it may be either capable of forming the heart of a new agreement, that is being superseded or instead varied to be non-binding (avoided) as to future conduct (see [[voidable contract]]) and the parties should ensure which meaning is meant in this third range of senses.

==Transfer of part==
In many [[jurisdictions]], [[land use]] laws require that severances of land occur in an orderly fashion by way of [[Subdivision (land)|plans of subdivision]], (estate plans) when multiple lots are being created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canadian Municipal and Planning Law |last=Makuch |first=Stanley |author2=Craik, Neil |author3=Leisk, Signe B.  |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Thomson Carswell |location=Toronto |isbn=0-459-24135-4 |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a registered (or other standardised land system) colouring and other conventions may apply to such title plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-plans-title-plan/land-registry-plans-title-plan-practice-guide-40-supplement-5|title=HM Land Registry plans: title plan (practice guide 40, supplement 5)|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid complications, some jurisdictions allow severances of a minor nature to proceed without a plan of subdivision, as long as other criteria are met. In many cases this will only be permitted when reverting a previous combination of the land, in England and Wales, [[amalgamation (land)]]. In England and Wales in unregistered land (around 15% of the total) any such severance (transfer of part) triggers compulsory registration of that new parcel (see [[registered land in English law]]. In Canada, approval of qualifying minor severances are often referred to as "consents", and the authority to grant consents is usually given to local [[land use planning|planning]] bodies such as [[Committee of adjustment|committees of adjustment]] or land division committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canadian Law of Planning and Zoning |last=Rogers |first=Ian |author2=Butler, Alison Scott  |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Thomson Carswell |location=Toronto |isbn=0-459-31270-7 |pages=5–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colloquialism|Colloquially]] in Canada and the US the term "severance"/"severed lot" is often used to solely refer to such minor land divisions rather than to divisions undertaken by way of the more complicated subdivision process.  Officially and commonly the terms "severed land" and "new parcel/plot/tract/piece of land" are used, synonymously in England and Wales with "severed land" removing all ambiguity.

'''Sodium bifluoride''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the formula NaHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[sodium]] cation (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[bifluoride|bifluoride anion]] (HF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). It is a white, water-soluble solid that decomposes upon heating .&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Dale L.; Handbook of Inorganic Compounds; CRC Press (2011); page 381; [https://books.google.com/books?id=SFD30BvPBhoC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=hafnium+tetrafluoride+melting+point&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uoNkiFpKNw&amp;sig=uV_38I5KXwkGBwhcxbALUAnCOnI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WZ2yUdikLq_A4APSkYH4Cw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=sodium%20bifluoride&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium bifluoride is non-flammable, [[hygroscopic]], and has a pungent smell.&lt;ref name = "product safety data sheet"/&gt;  Sodium bifluoride has a number of applications in industry.

==Reactions==
Sodium bifluoride dissociates to [[hydrofluoric acid]] and sodium fluoride:
:NaHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   {{eqm}}  HF  +  NaF
The reverse of this reaction is employed to remove HF from elemental fluorine (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by electrolysis.&lt;ref name=Aigueperse&gt;{{citation | first1 = Jean | last1 = Aigueperse | first2 = Paul | last2 = Mollard | first3 = Didier | last3 = Devilliers | first4= Marius | last4 = Chemla | first5 =  Robert | last5 = Faron | first6 = Renée | last6 = Romano | first7 = Jean Pierre | last7 = Cuer | contribution = Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic | editor-last = Ullmann | title = Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2005 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | place = Weinheim|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a11_307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This equilibrium is manifested when the salt is dissolved and when the solid is heated. Characteristic of other bifluorides, it reacts with [[acid]]s to give HF.  Illustrative is its reaction with [[bisulfate]] to form [[sodium sulfate]] and hydrogen fluoride.

[[Strong base]]s deprotonate bilfluoride.  For example, [[calcium hydroxide]] gives [[calcium fluoride]].&lt;ref name = "allreactions"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.allreactions.com/index.php/group-1a/natrium/sodium-bifluoride|title =Sodium Bifluoride NaHF2|accessdate =June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Sodium bifluoride is produced by [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralizing]] waste [[hydrogen fluoride]], which results from the production of superphosphate fertilizers. Typical bases are sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide.  The process occurs in two steps, illustrated with the hydroxide:&lt;ref name=Aigueperse/&gt;
:HF  +  NaOH  →   NaF  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 
:HF  +  NaF  →   NaHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Sodium bifluoride reacts with water or moist skin to produce [[hydrofluoric acid]]. It also gives off hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen gas when it is heated to a [[gas]]eous state. The chemical can decompose upon contact with [[strong acid]]s, [[strong base]]s, [[metal]], water, or glass.&lt;ref name = "product safety data sheet"/&gt; Sodium bifluoride also engages in violent reactions with [[chromyl chloride]], [[nitric acid]], [[red phosphorus]], [[sodium peroxide]], [[diethyl sulfoxide]], and [[diethylzinc]].&lt;ref name = "wiley guide"&gt;{{Citation|author = Richard P. Pohanish |author2=Stanley A. Greene|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4ewS-AqdCM0C&amp;pg=PA952&amp;dq=%22sodium+bifluoride%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IBvPUaOkH8O80gG1oIH4BQ&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sodium%20bifluoride%22&amp;f=false|title = Wiley Guide to Chemical Incompatibilities|date = August 25, 2009|accessdate = June 29, 2013|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The main role of sodium bifluoride is as a precursor to [[sodium fluoride]], millions of tons of which are produced annually.&lt;ref name=Aigueperse/&gt;

===Cleaning agents and laundry sours===
The compound also has applications in cleaning, capitalizing on the affinity of fluoride for iron and silicon oxides.  For example, formulations of sodium bifluoride are used for cleaning [[brick]], [[stone]], [[ceramic]]s, and [[masonry]]. It is also used to [[Glass etching|etch]] [[glass]].&lt;ref name = "product safety data sheet"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.solvaynorthamerica.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/PS_SodiumBifluoride.pdf|title = Product Safety Data Sheet|accessdate = June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application of sodium bifluoride is in the [[chemical industry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solvaychemicals.us/SiteCollectionDocuments/sds/P19043-USA.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other applications of the compound involve the [[galvanizing|galvanization]] of [[bathtub|baths]] and [[pest (organism)|pest]] control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/inorganic/SODIUM%20BIFLUORIDE.htm|title = Sodium Bifluoride |date = October 14, 2010|accessdate = June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium bifluoride's biological applications include the preservation of [[zoology|zoological]] and [[anatomy|anatomical]] samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/9059|title = Sodium Bifluorite, Solid |date = 2012|accessdate = June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other applications of sodium bifluoride include neutralizers of [[laundry]]-rinse.&lt;ref name=Aigueperse/&gt;

===Other uses===
Sodium bifluoride has a role in the process that is used to [[metal plating|plate]] metal [[Tin can|cans]].

Sodium bifluoride also aids in the precipitation of [[calcium]] ions during the process of [[nickel]] [[electroplating]]. The compound also aids in increasing the corrosion of resistance of some [[magnesium]] [[alloy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor = Alain Tressaud |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8w4yU7B9I0kC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=%22sodium+bifluoride%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IBvPUaOkH8O80gG1oIH4BQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sodium%20bifluoride%22&amp;f=false|title = Functionalized Inorganic Fluorides: Synthesis, Characterization and Properties of Nanostructured Solids|date = April 9, 2010|accessdate = July 1, 2013|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Sodium bifluoride is [[corrosive]] and an [[Irritation|irritant]] upon contact with [[skin]] and can cause [[blistering]] and inflammation. It is extremely dangerous to ingest. If the compound is exposed to the eyes, [[blindness]] and [[cornea]]l damage can result. Ingestion of sodium bifluoride dust can cause burning, coughing, and sneezing, as a result of irritating the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Exposure of the compound to the eyes can cause redness, itching, and watering. In severe cases, exposure to sodium bifluoride can result in [[death]].&lt;ref name = "msds"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9924965|title = Material Safety Data Sheet Sodium bifluoride MSDS|date = October 9, 2005|accessdate = June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can take between 0 and 24 hours for the effects of sodium bifluoride poisoning to be noticeable.&lt;ref name = "product safety data sheet"/&gt;
	
Exposure to sodium bifluoride repeatedly or over a long time can result in [[skeletal fluorosis|fluorosis]]. Sodium bifluoride is not known to be [[carcinogen]]ic.&lt;ref name = "product safety data sheet"/&gt;
	
=== Biological and environmental role ===

[[Image:Tektronix 4014.jpg|right|frame|The [[Tektronix 4014]] uses a storage tube for its display.]]
'''Storage tubes''' are a class of [[cathode-ray tube]]s (CRTs) that are designed to hold an image for a long period of time, typically as long as power is supplied to the tube.

A specialized type of storage tube, the [[Williams tube]], was used as a [[main memory]] system on a number of early [[computer]]s, from the late 1940s into the early 1950s. They were replaced with other technologies, notably [[core memory]], starting in the 1950s.

Storage tubes made a comeback in the 1960s and 1970s for use in [[computer graphics]], most notably the [[Tektronix 4010]] series. Today they are obsolete, their functions provided by low-cost memory devices and liquid crystal displays.

==Operation==

===Background===
A conventional CRT consists of an [[electron gun]] at the back of the tube that is aimed at a thin layer of [[phosphor]] at the front of the tube. Depending on the role, the beam of [[electron]]s emitted by the gun is steered around the display using magnetic ([[television]]) or electrostatic ([[oscilloscope]]) means. When the electrons strike the phosphor, the phosphor "lights up" at that location for a time, and then fades away. The length of time the spot remains is a function of the phosphor chemistry.

At very low energies, electrons from the gun will strike the phosphor and nothing will happen. As the energy is increased, it will reach a critical point, &lt;math&gt;V_{cr1}&lt;/math&gt;, that will activate the phosphor and cause it to give off light. As the voltage increases beyond {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr1&lt;/sub&gt;}} the brightness of the spot will increase. This allows the CRT to display images with varying intensity, like a television image.

Above {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr1&lt;/sub&gt;}} another effect also starts, [[secondary emission]]. When any insulating material is struck by electrons over a certain critical energy, electrons within the material are forced out of it through collisions, increasing the number of free electrons. This effect is used in [[electron multiplier]]s as found in [[night vision]] systems and similar devices. In the case of a CRT this effect is generally undesirable; the new electrons generally fall back to the display and cause the surrounding phosphor to light up, which appears as a lowering of the focus of the image.

The rate of secondary emission is also a function of the electron beam energy, but follows a different rate curve. As the electron energy is increased, the rate increases until it reaches a critical threshold, {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr2&lt;/sub&gt;}} when the number of secondary emissions is greater than the number supplied by the gun. In this case the localized image rapidly fades as energy is removed by the secondary electrons.

In any CRT, images are displayed by striking the screen with electron energies between these two values, {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Below {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr1&lt;/sub&gt;}} no image is formed, and above {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr2&lt;/sub&gt;}} any image rapidly fades.

Another side effect, initially a curiosity, is that electrons will stick to the phosphor in lit up areas. As the light emission fades, these electrons are likewise released back into the tube. The charge is generally far too small to have a visual effect, and was generally ignored in the case of displays.

===Storage===
These two effects were both utilized in the construction of a storage tube. Storage was accomplished by striking any suitably long-lived phosphor with electrons with energies just above {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and erased by striking them with electrons above {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. There were any number of varieties of mechanical layouts used to improve focus or cause the image to be refreshed either internally to the tube or through off board storage.

The easiest example to understand are the early computer memory systems as typified by the [[Williams tube]]. These consisted of World War II surplus radar display CRTs connected to a computer. The X and Y deflection plates were connected to amplifiers that converted memory locations into X and Y positions on the screen, in most cases such that positions along the X axis represented individual bits within a word, while Y locations were different words.

To write a value to memory, the address was amplified and sent to the Y deflection plates, such that the beam would be fixed to a horizontal line on the screen. A timer then set the X deflection plate to increasing voltages, causing the beam to be scanned across the selected line. The gun was set to a default energy close to {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the bits from the computer fed to the gun to modulate the voltage up and down such that 0's would be below {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and 1's above it. By the time the beam reached the other side of the line, a pattern of short dashes was drawn for each 1, while 0's were empty locations.

To read the values back out, the deflections plates were set to the same values, but the gun energy set to a value above {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. As the beam scanned the line, the phosphor was pushed well beyond the secondary emission threshold. If the beam was located over a blank area, a certain number of electrons would be released, but if it was over a lit area, the number would be increased by the number of electrons stuck to that area. In the Williams tube these values were read by measuring the [[capacitor|capacitance]] of a metal plate just in front of the display side of the tube. As the reading process also erased any stored values, the signal had to be regenerated through associated circuitry. A CRT with two electron guns, one for reading and one for writing, made this process trivial.

===Imaging systems===
The earliest [[computer graphics]] systems, like those of the [[TX-2]] and [[DEC PDP-1]], required the entire attention of the computer to maintain. A list of [[vector graphics|vector]]s stored in [[main memory]] was periodically read out to the display to refresh it before the image faded. This generally occurred frequently enough that there was little time to do anything else, and interactive systems like ''[[Spacewar!]]'' were tour-de-force programming efforts.

For practical use, graphical displays were developed that contained their own memory and an associated very simple computer which offloaded the refreshing task from the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]. This was not inexpensive; the [[IBM 2250]] graphics terminal used with the [[IBM S/360]] cost $280,000 in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/topic/graphics/ComputerDisplayReview_Mar70.pdf "Computer Display Review"], Keydata Corp., March 1970, pp. V.1980, V.1964&lt;/ref&gt;

A storage tube could replace most or all of the localized hardware by storing the vectors directly within the display, instead of an associated local computer. Commands that previously caused the terminal to erase its memory and thus clear the display could be emulated by scanning the entire screen at an energy above {{mvar|V&lt;sub&gt;cr2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In most systems, this caused the entire screen to quickly "flash" before clearing to a blank state. The two main advantages were:

*Very low [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] needs&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; compared to [[vector graphics]] displays, thus allowing much longer cable distances between computer and terminal
*No need for display-local [[random-access memory|RAM]] (as in modern terminals), which was prohibitively expensive at the time.

Generally speaking, storage tubes could be divided into two categories. In the more common category, they were only capable of storing "[[Binary numeral system|binary]]" images; any given point on the screen was either illuminated or dark. The [[Tektronix]] [[DVBST|Direct-View Bistable Storage Tube]] was perhaps the best example in this category. Other storage tubes were able to store [[greyscale]]/[[halftone]]d images; the tradeoff was usually a much-reduced storage time.

Some pioneering storage tube displays were [[MIT]] [[Project MAC]]'s ARDS (Advanced Remote Display Station), the Computek 400 Series Display terminals (a commercial derivative),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which both used a Tektronix type 611 storage display unit, and Tektronix's [[Tektronix 4014|4014]] terminal, the latter becoming a [[de facto]] computer terminal standard some time after its introduction (later being emulated by other systems due to this status).

The first generalized computer assisted instruction system, [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO I]], c. 1960 on [[ILLIAC I]], used a storage tube as its computer graphics display.  [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO II]] and [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO III]] also used storage tubes as displays.

A '''super-spreader''' is a host—an organism [[infection|infected]] with a [[pathogen|disease]]—that infects, disproportionally, more secondary contacts than other hosts who are, also, infected with the same disease.  A sick human can be a super-spreader; they would be more likely to infect others than most people with the disease.  Super-spreaders are thus of high concern in [[epidemiology]] (the study of the spread of diseases).

Some cases of super-spreading conform to the [[20/80 rule]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galvani | first1 = Alison P. | last2 = May | first2 = Robert M. | title = Epidemiology: Dimensions of superspreading | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 438 | issue = | pages = 293–295 | pmid = 16292292 | doi=10.1038/438293a}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, approximately, 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmissions, although super-spreading can still be said to occur when super-spreaders account for a higher or lower percentage of transmissions.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lloyd-Smith | first1 = JO | last2 = Schreiber | first2 = SJ | last3 = Kopp | first3 = PE | last4 = Getz | first4 = WM | year = 2005 | title = Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 438 | issue = | pages = 355–359 | doi = 10.1038/nature04153 | pmid=16292310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[epidemic]]s with super-spreading, the majority of individuals infect relatively few [[contact tracing|secondary contacts]].

Super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors including a decline in [[herd immunity]], [[nosocomial infection]]s, [[virulence]], [[viral load]], [[misdiagnosis]], [[Droplet infection|airflow dynamics]], [[immune suppression]], and [[co-infection]] with another [[pathogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = Richard A. | year = 2011 | title = Superspreaders in Infectious Disease | url = | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 510–513 | pmid = 21737332 | doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining a super-spreading event==
Although loose definitions of super-spreading exist, some effort has been made at defining what qualifies as a super-spreading event (SSE) more explicit. Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) define a protocol to identify a super-spreading event as follows:&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;
# estimate the effective reproductive number, ''R'', for the disease and population in question;
# construct a [[Poisson distribution]] with mean ''R'', representing the expected range of ''Z'' due to [[stochasticity]] without individual variation;
# define an SSE as any infected person who infects more than ''Z&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt; others'', where ''Z&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the nth percentile of the Poisson(''R'') distribution.

This protocol defines a 99th-percentile SSE as a case which causes more infections than would occur in 99% of infectious histories in a homogeneous population.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;

During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Beijing, China, epidemiologists defined a super-spreader as an individual with transmission of SARS to at least eight contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Shen, F. Ning, W. Zhou, L.He, C. Lin, D. Chin, Z. Zhus, A. Schuchat. Superspreading events, Beijing, 2003. Emerging Infectious Diseases. Vol. 10, No. 2. Feb. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Super-spreaders may or may not show any symptoms of the disease.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Richard A.|title=Super-spreaders in infectious diseases|journal=International Journal of Infectious Diseases|date=August 2011|volume=15|issue=8|pages=e510-e513|doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020|pmid=21737332| quote=The minority of individuals who infect disproportionately more susceptible contacts, as compared to most individuals who infect few or no others, became known as super-spreaders, and their existence is deeply rooted in history: between 1900 and 1907, Typhoid Mary infected 51 individuals, three of whom died, even though she only had an asymptomatic infection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cory|first=David C. Wiley, Amy C.|title=Encyclopedia of School Health|date=2013|publisher=SAGE|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=9781412996006 |quote=Historically, one of the most famous examples of super-spreading was that of Mary Mallon, better known as Typhoid Mary, who infected many contacts, several of whom died, through food she prepared and consequently contaminated, even thought she did not show symptoms. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors in transmission==
[[Image:Herd_immunity.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|How an infection spreads in a community with immunized and non-immunized members.]]
Super-spreaders have been identified who excrete a higher than normal number of pathogens during the time they are infectious. This causes their contacts to be exposed to higher viral/bacterial loads than would be seen in the contacts of non-superspreaders with the same duration of exposure.&lt;ref name="Kenneth J. Rothman 2008. page 561"&gt;Kenneth J. Rothman, Sander Greenland, and Timothy L. Lash. Modern Epidemiology, 3rd Edition. 2008. page 561. Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins. Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic reproductive number===
The [[basic reproduction number]] R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[statistical mean|average]] number of secondary infections caused by a typical infective person in a totally susceptible population.&lt;ref name=nature1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galvani|first=Alison P.|author2=Robert M. |title=Epidemiology: Dimensions of super-spreading|journal=Nature|date=17 November 2005|volume=438|issue=7066|pages=239–295|doi=10.1038/438293a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/438293a.html|accessdate=18 April 2014|pmid=16292292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reproductive number is found by multiplying the average number of contacts by the average probability that a susceptible individual will become infected, which is called the shedding potential. &lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Number of contacts X Shedding potential &lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Individual reproductive number===
The individual reproductive number represents the number of secondary infections caused by a specific individual during the time that individual is infectious. Some individuals have significantly higher than average individual reproductive numbers and are known as super-spreaders. Through [[contact tracing]], epidemiologists have identified super-spreaders in measles, tuberculosis, rubella, monkeypox, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever and SARS.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Smith JO 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Serres | first1 = G | last2 = Markowski | first2 = F | last3 = Toth | first3 = E | last4 = Landry | first4 = M | last5 = Auger | first5 = D | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Largest measles epidemic in North America in a decade–Quebec, Canada, 2011: contribution of susceptibility, serendipity, and superspreading events | url = | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 207 | issue = | pages = 990–998 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/jis923 | pmid=23264672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Co-infections with other pathogens===
Men with HIV who were co-infected with at least one other sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea, hepatitis C, and herpes simplex 2 virus, were found to have an eight-fold higher HIV shedding rate than men without co-infection. This shedding rate was calculated in men with similar HIV viral loads. Once treatment for the co-infection had been completed, the HIV shedding rate returned to levels comparable to men without co-infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = M.S.

===Lack of herd immunity===
[[Herd immunity]], or herd effect, refers to the indirect protection that immunized community members provide to non-immunized members in preventing the spread of contagious disease. The greater the number of immunized individuals, the less likely an outbreak can occur because there are fewer susceptible contacts. In epidemiology, herd immunity is known as a ''dependent happening'' because it influences transmission over time. As a pathogen that confers immunity to the survivors moves through a susceptible population, the number of susceptible contacts declines. Even if susceptible individuals remain, their contacts are likely to be immunized, preventing any further spread of the infection.&lt;ref name="Kenneth J. Rothman 2008. page 561"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine P 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fine | first1 = P | year = 1993 | title = Herd immunity: history, theory, practice | url = | journal = Epidemiol Rev | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 265–302 | pmid = 8174658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of immune individuals in a population above which a disease may no longer persist is the ''herd immunity threshold''. Its value varies with the virulence of the disease, the efficacy of the vaccine, and the contact parameter for the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR |title=Priorities in Health: Disease Control Priorities Companion Volume |publisher=World Bank Publications |year=2006  |chapter=Chapter 4: Cost-Effective Strategies for the Excess Burden of Disease in Developing Countries&lt;br/&gt;Section: Vaccine-preventable Diseases |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10258/#A151 |isbn=0-8213-6260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say that an outbreak can't occur, but it will be limited.

== Super-spreaders during outbreaks ==

===SARS outbreak 2003===
[[File:Guangdong in China (+all claims hatched).svg|thumb|Guangdong Province in Southeastern China where the first outbreak of SARS occurred in 2003.]]
The first cases of [[SARS]] occurred in mid-November 2002 in the [[Guangdong]] Province of China. This was followed by an outbreak in [[Hong Kong]] in February, 2003. A Guangdong Province doctor, Liu Jianlun, who had treated SARS cases there, had contracted the virus and was symptomatic. Despite his symptoms, he traveled to Hong Kong to attend a family wedding. He stayed on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel in [[Kowloon]], infecting 16 other hotel guests also staying on that floor (pictured above). The guests then traveled to Canada, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam, spreading SARS to those locations and transmitting what became a global epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v81n8/v81n8a14.pdf |title=How SARS changed the world in less than six months|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405125444/http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v81n8/v81n8a14.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case during this same outbreak, a 54-year-old male was admitted to a hospital with coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure and type two diabetes. He had been in contact with a patient known to have SARS. Shortly after his admission he developed fever, cough, myalgia and sore throat. The admitting physician suspected SARS. The patient was transferred to another hospital for treatment of his coronary artery disease. While there, his SARS symptoms became more pronounced. Later, it was discovered he had transmitted SARS to 33 other patients in just two days. He was transferred back to the original hospital where he died of SARS.

The SARS pandemic was eventually contained, but not before it caused 8,273 cases and 775 deaths. Within two weeks of the original outbreak in Guangdong Province, SARS had spread to 37 countries.&lt;ref name=ncbi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=Zhuang|author2=Fang Ning |title=Superspreading SARS Events, Beijing 2003|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=February 2004|volume=10|issue=2|pages=256–260|doi=10.3201/eid1002.030732|pmid=15030693|pmc=3322930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles outbreak 1989===
[[File:Measles vaccination coverage world.svg|thumb|Rates of measles vaccination worldwide]]
Measles is a highly contagious, air-borne virus that reappears even among vaccinated populations. In one Finnish town in 1989, an explosive school-based outbreak resulted in 51 cases, several of whom had been previously vaccinated. One child alone, infected 22 others. It was noted during this outbreak that when vaccinated siblings shared a bedroom with an infected sibling, seven out of nine became infected as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paunio | first1 = Mikko | last2 = Peltola | first2 = Heikki | last3 = Davidkin | first3 = Irja | last4 = Virtanen | first4 = Martti | last5 = Heinonen | first5 = Olli P. | last6 = Valle | first6 = Martti | year = 1998 | title = Explosive School-based Measles Outbreak Intense Exposure May Have Resulted in High Risk, Even among Revaccinees | url = | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 148 | issue = | pages = 1103–10 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typhoid fever===
[[File:Riverside Hospital North Brother Island crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island, where Mary Mallon, aka Typhoid Mary, was involuntarily quarantined. 2006.]]
[[Typhoid fever]] is a human-specific disease caused by the bacterium   ''[[Salmonella typhi]]''. It is highly contagious and becoming resistant to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roger Highfield|title=Typhoid is with us to stay|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=28 November 2006|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3345526/Typhoid-is-with-us-to-stay.html|accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; S. typhi is susceptible to creating [[asymptomatic carrier]]s. The most famous carriers are [[Mary Mallon]], known as Typhoid Mary, from New York City, and Mr. N. the Milker, from Folkstone, England.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, PP. Mr. N. the Milker and Dr. Koch's concept of the healthy carrier. ''The Lancet''. 1999; 353:1354-1356.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were active around the same time. Mallon infected 51 people from 1902 to 1909. Mr. N. infected more than 200 people over 14 years from 1901 to 1915. At the request of health officials, Mr. N. gave up working in food service. Mallon refused to give up working in food service and eventually was involuntarily quarantined at [[North and South Brother Islands, East River|Brothers Island]] in New York, where she stayed until she died in November 1938, aged 69.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, J. Typhoid Mary. ''The Lancet''. 1999; 353:1714&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found that ''Salmonella typhi'' persists in infected mice macrophages that have cycled from an inflammatory state to a non-inflammatory state. The bacteria remain and reproduce without causing further symptoms in the mice, and that this explains why carriers are asymptomatic.&lt;ref&gt;TM, Ng, DM Monack.

'''Tagging''' of [[postage stamp]]s means that the stamps are printed on [[luminescence|luminescent]] paper or with luminescent ink to facilitate [[automated mail processing]]. Both [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]] are used. The same stamp may have been printed with and without these luminescent features, the two varieties are referred to as ''tagged'' and ''untagged'', respectively.

== Technology ==

[[Letter (message)|Letter]]s and [[postcard]]s fed into an automated mail processing plant are illuminated with [[ultraviolet light]]. The reaction of the luminescent features of the stamps on this illumination is used to position the mail items such that the stamps can be [[Cancellation (mail)|cancelled]], and that the significant parts of the address such as [[postcode]]s may be read and the mail be sorted accordingly.

The luminescent features of the stamps are generally invisible or barely visible to the human eye in normal illumination. They can, however, be identified under ultraviolet light similar to the way it is done in the postal machinery. In general, fluorescent features can be identified with UV light of a longer wavelength than needed for phosphorescent features (see below).

The luminescent substance ("taggant") can be printed over the whole surface of the stamp, the main design, the margins only, single bands or bars or other patterns, or can be added the paper itself.

The tagging pattern can also be varied to enable sorting of mail according to the service class.

== Methods and detection ==

=== Fluorescence ===

Upon absorption of light, fluorescent materials emit light upon of a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed radiation, but cease to do so once immediately, when the illumination is stopped. The tagging of stamps uses substances that absorb ultraviolet light of wavelengths between 300&amp;nbsp;nm and 450&amp;nbsp;nm ("[[Black light]]", UVA, long-wave UV) and emit light in the visible spectrum. Under UV illumination they usually glow a greenish or yellowish colour.

It must not be confused with the "whitening" of paper&lt;ref name = "bookreports9-1"/&gt; which is achieved by adding [[optical brightener]]s that usually re-emit light in the blue region of the spectrum, making the paper appear whiter by compensating a perceived deficit in reflected colours of these wavelengths.

=== Phosphorescence ===

Phosphorescent materials release the absorbed energy only slowly, so that they exhibit an "afterglow". Materials for stamp tagging absorb ultraviolet light of wavelengths between 180&amp;nbsp;nm and 300&amp;nbsp;nm (UVC, short-wave UV) and emit light of a greenish or reddish colour depending on the substances used.

=== Detection equipment ===
[[File:Portable black light fluorescent lamp.jpg | thumb|right | Black light fluorescent lamp]]
Fluorescent stamps can be detected with a black light [[fluorescent tube]]. Phosphorescent stamps can be detected using a shortwave UV lamp. The effects of both processes can be recorded photographically. Lamps for both ranges of wavelengths as well as combinations of both are available. Care must be taken when using UV lamps, since their light can damage the eyes.&lt;ref name = "hiding"/&gt;

== Application in various countries ==
[[File:Winnipeg Tag FDC 6.jpg|thumb|upright|Official letter concerning the 
introduction of the first tagged Canadian stamps]]
=== Canada ===
The first tagged stamps of Canada were issued in 1962 with vertical phosphorescent bands. In 1972, fluorescent ''general tagging'' was introduced, initially as vertical bars, now normally on all four sides of the stamp.&lt;ref name = "esg-glossary-t"/&gt;

=== Germany ===

[[Deutsche Bundespost]] started issuing stamps on fluorescent ''Lumogen'' paper in 1960 in connection with trials for automated mail processing in the Darmstadt area. Fluorescent paper was generally used for stamps of Deutsche Bundespost and [[Deutsche Bundespost Berlin]] from 1961 on.&lt;ref name = "Briefverteildienst"/&gt; [[Deutsche Post AG]] continues to use this technology. [[Deutsche Post of the GDR]] did not use luminescent tagging on stamps.

=== United Kingdom ===

Luminescent tagging has been added to [[postage stamps of the United Kingdom]] since the [[Wilding series|Wilding issues]] of 1959 in the shape of vertical bands. Stamps of the current [[Machin series]] have been printed with one or two such "phosphor bands",.&lt;ref name = "gbmachins"/&gt; those for second-class mail bear only one such band, those for first-class mail bear two.  The positions of the bands may vary, stamps from [[Postage stamp booklet|booklet]]s may have shortened, notched, or inset bands that do not extend onto neighbouring [[Gutter (philately)|gutters]] to avoid the use of the latter instead of stamps for franking.&lt;ref name ="m_tag"/&gt; Due to the presence of optical brighteners in many printing papers, phosphorescent materials were chosen for stamp tagging in the UK.&lt;ref name = "clinch1981"/&gt;

=== United States of America ===

The US Post Office Department started experiments with fluorescent compounds in the early 1960s. An 8 c air mail stamp issued in 1963 was the first stamp printed for trials with new cancelling machines.&lt;ref name = "machinesorbust4"/&gt; The 5&amp;nbsp;c City Delivery issue of 1963 was the first commemorative issue produced with tagging.&lt;ref name = "lecture"/&gt;

Precancelled stamps and service-inscribed stamps are not usually tagged because they need not be routed through the cancelling equipment.

== Other uses ==

Since luminescent ink or luminescent paper are only delivered to specialist printers, tagging also serves as an anti-counterfeiting measure, similar to the practice on [[banknote]]s.

== Alternatives ==

When [[Deutsche Post of the GDR]] expanded automated mail processing in the 1980s, they did not use luminescent tagging, but used sideways illumination to identify the shadows of the stamp perforation in order to position mail items in cancelling and sorting machinery. Red light was used for this purpose, giving a good contrast to ordinary writing ink colours and enabling machine reading of postcodes. Some issues of [[Postal card]]s were printed entirely in orange to facilitate the latter process. However, the colours of the [[imprinted stamp]]s was later changed to those of the usual [[definitive stamp|definitives]] of the corresponding value, and simulated perforations were added around the stamp design to help locate the stamp position.

The '''Tanfield Group''', formerly Comeleon, has changed its main focus from automotive components and imaging equipment to electric vehicle manufacturing and specialist engineering. As Comeleon, the company made 3D images for mobile phones and other devices, but saw the bottom drop out of its key handset market in 2003. In 2004, Comeleon was absorbed by the Tanfield Group. The company has since expanded to include [[electric vehicle]]s and [[aerial work platform]]s.

The group is made up of the following companies:

* Aerial Access
* Jumbotugs
* Norquip
* SEV Materials Handling 
* [[Smith Electric Vehicles]]
* Snorkel International
* UpRight Powered Access
* [[Tanfield Engineering Systems Ltd]]

==Snorkel==
On 28 June 2007, the company acquired Snorkel International as another division of its Aerial Work Platform (AWP) market share&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plataformas Elevatórias|url=https://www.grupoapc.com.br/as-vantagens-na-utilizacao-e-locacao-de-plataformas-elevatorias-articuladas/|website=Grupo APC|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The geographical fit and little overlap in product range complements Tanfields initiative to expand into the global marketplace with a wide variety of products to offer their customers.

== TX4E ==
[[London Taxis International]], which manufactures the iconic London black taxi in Coventry, has signed a development agreement with electric vehicle manufacturer Tanfield to develop an all-electric  urban taxi.  The all-electric version of the [[TX4]] black cab - to be branded the TX4E - will have a top speed of {{Convert|50|mph|abbr=on}} and a range in excess of {{Convert|100|mi|km}} on one battery charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&amp;orgId=101846&amp;topicId=103840033&amp;docId=l:780159195 Black taxi firm plans zero emission electric vehicle]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smith Electric Vehicles==
Smith Electric Vehicles was formed in England in 1920. Originally specialising in [[trolleybus|trolly busses]] under the name Northern Coachbuilders Ltd. Over the next 80 years the company developed a plethora of vehicles including [[milk float]]s.

Tanfield Group Plc acquired the company in October 2004, for £2.2m and 1&amp;nbsp;million new ordinary shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=200410071554088443D |title=Tanfield Group PLC: Acquisition - replacement &amp;#124; Company Announcements |publisher=Investegate |date=2010-05-20 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanfield immediately re-started R&amp;D work to develop new electric delivery vehicles. Including the [[Smith Electric Vehicles#Newton|Newton]] and [[Smith Electric Vehicles#Edison|Edison]] .

Tanfield announced the formation of Smith Electric Vehicles US Corp (Smith US) in February 2009 and the company opened for business later that year. It has since grown to become America’s leading manufacturer of electric trucks.

In March 2010 Smith US made a £37m conditional offer, equating to 50p per Tanfield share, plus a "free" share in Smith US if it subsequently undergoes an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] and joins the [[stock market]] in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/82f4bf9c-2c97-11df-8abb-00144feabdc0.html |title=/ Companies / Automobiles - Tanfield to sell electric vehicle operation |publisher=Ft.com |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On 3 July 2008 it was announced in the press that the London Stock Exchange was launching a probe after a collapse in the share price. The company was criticised by analysts for poor standards of disclosure and weak financial controls.  The shares reached a high of 203.5p (valuing the Company at over £700 million) in July 2007 and fell to 5.53 pence (a value of £20 million). In April 2008, its annual results disappointed the City and raised questions about its disclosure standards and the high level of cash burn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/2792635/LSE-launches-probe-after-electric-vehicle-firm-Tanfield-sees-shares-collapse.html : LSE launches probe after electric vehicle firm Tanfield sees shares collapse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tanio'' oil spill occurred March 7, 1980 when the ''Tanio,'' an oil tanker of Madagascan origin traveling from [[Wilhelmshaven]] to [[Civitavecchia]] split in two 60&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of [[Brittany]], [[France]] in rough weather, spilling about 13,500 tons of cargo oil into the [[English Channel]] and killing 8 sailors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedre.fr/fr/accident/tanio/tanio.php&lt;/ref&gt;
The stern section of the boat was towed to Le Havre by a British cargo ship despite the strong wind. The bow, however, sunk, leaking 5,000 tons of oil. After the spill, strong winds moved the oil toward the Breton coast.&lt;ref name=itopf&gt;http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/case-histories/tlist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup operations==
Oil began to wash a shore on the Breton beaches on March 9 and contaminated about 200&amp;nbsp;km of the coastline, overlapping 45% of the area that have been contaminated by the ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]'' spill in 1978. In contrast to the ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]'' spill, in which only one quarter of lost oil washed ashore, most of the spilled oil came onshore due to weather conditions.&lt;ref name=amoco&gt;Gundlach, E.R., Berné, S., D'Ozouville, L. and Topinka, AJ. (1981). ''Shoreline OIl Two Years After Amoco Cadiz: New Complications From Tanio.'' International Oil Spill Conference Proceedings 1981 1981:1, 525-534&lt;/ref&gt;
Because tourism is an important industry in Brittany, measures were quickly taken to clean up the spilled oil. This proved difficult because the contamination was mainly [[heavy fuel oil]] (n° 6) and therefore, extremely viscous, especially in cold, cloudy weather, which limited the use of tractor drawn vacuum trucks in cleaning up the beaches. Additionally, the large tidal range (9m), severe weather, and the varied coastline prevented the effective use of booms. Ultimately, bulldozers and other heavy-machinery were used to remove oil from beaches.&lt;ref name=itopf /&gt;

==Response==
After the initial event, the [[Prefecture Maritime of the Atlantic]] organized procedures with the French Navy’s Operation Centre. Distress calls were quickly answered, and a French Navy helicopter rescued 31 sailors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1980/03/08/trente-et-un-marins-sauves-par-les-helicopteres-de-la-marine nationale_2814741_1819218.html?xtmc=tanio&amp;xtcr=132&lt;/ref&gt;

In the two departments where the oil was spilled, the Department of [[Finistère]] and the Department of Cotes-du-Nord, now known as [[Côtes-d'Armor]] implemented [[Plan Polmar]], the French national oil spill response plan, was implemented. Thus, national army personnel played a role in the cleanup. Furthermore, The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) advised and monitored the situation for the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) Fund. All together, damage and cleanup costs were over $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;Brac, C. (1981). ''Operation Tanio. La Nouvelle Revue Maritime.'' July, 363, 10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The oil spilled from the Tanio was of low toxicity; thus, environmental effects were somewhat mitigated. Nevertheless, about 1,700 dead birds were found, oyster beds were contaminated, and the seaweed harvest was disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, S. 1980. ''Pollution du littoral Breton par les hydrocarbures du Tanio en Mars et Avril 1980: cartographie et impact sur les sediments intertidaux.'' Centre Oceanologique de Bretagne, Brest, France&lt;/ref&gt;
Further contamination was mainly due to a speedy and thorough cleanup process. Within two months of the disaster, cleanup had switched removing oil with skimmers and pumps to the use of high-pressure hoses in rocky areas. In addition, cleanup was not restricted to tourist areas and collection areas, but also included efforts to clean removed or isolated areas, as well as locations where a relatively quick natural cleanup could be expected.&lt;ref name=amoco /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''William F. Gettle''' (c. 1887 - December 22, 1941) was an American businessman and [[millionaire]]. He gained some notoriety when he was kidnapped in 1934.

Gettle was originally from Oklahoma, and moved to [[Bakersfield, California]], in the 1920s, where he worked for J.C. Penny and invested in oil fields. The 1920 United States Census showed he was living in [[Kern, California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=0&amp;gsln=Gettle&amp;f7=CA&amp;gss=genfact&amp;db=1920usfedcen&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the kidnapping, Gettle weighed 500 pounds,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747420,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; and he and his handicapped wife Fleeta had four children, all of whom were under 10 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;"Gettle Gets Threat To Blast His Home." ''Gettysburg Times''. June 26, 1934 p. 2. Web. June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Added $40,000 Demanded of Gettle's Wife." ''The Baltimore Sun''. May 12, 1934. p 1-2. Web. October 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; One of their neighbors was comedian [[Joe E. Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Gehring, Wes D. ''Joe E. Brown: Film Comedian and Baseball Buffoon''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Co., 2006. p 108&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', he was worth around $3,500,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Kidnap Victim's Fortune Estimated at $3,500,000". ''Los Angeles Times''. May 11, 1934. p 1. Web. October 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping==
Gettle threw a house-warming party on the evening of May 9, 1934, and was drinking with "a friend named Wolf" in the pool house when two men entered and escorted them out at gunpoint. Gettle was forced into a waiting automobile, and Wolf was left at the scene, tied up but otherwise unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747420,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

William Gettle was held, tied up and gagged, in the bedroom of a rented house at 4256 Rosemont Street in [[La Crescenta, California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.lacanadaonline.com/2007-08-23/news/lco-brenner823_1_kidnappers-sentences-prosecutor&lt;/ref&gt; He later told police that his kidnappers dressed in bed sheets when talking to him so as not to reveal to him their identities.&lt;ref&gt;"Gettle Freed, Police Arrest Five Kidnappers." ''Pittsburgh Press''. May 14, 1934. p 2. Web. June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He also told his rescuers that he "'was not mistreated in any way' by his kidnappers."&lt;ref&gt;"Gettle Says Kidnappers Did Not 'Mistreat' Him." ''Associated Press'' via ''The New York Times''. May 15, 1934. p 3. Web. October 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A ransom of $60,000 was demanded for Gettle's safe release in a note sent to his lawyer; another letter was sent to Fleta Gettle, asking for an additional $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Added $40,000 Demanded of Gettle's Wife." ''The Baltimore Sun''. May 12, 1934. p 1-2. Web. October 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Two police officers, Chester Burris and H.P. Gearhardt, were credited with breaking the case after installing a dictograph in the house of a bank robbery suspect. Overhearing a conversation about Gettle's kidnapping, they were able to trace his whereabouts to the house on Rosemount.&lt;ref&gt;"Gettle Freed, Police Arrest Five Kidnappers." ''Pittsburgh Press''. May 14, 1934. p 2. Web. June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A raid was conducted on the house on the night of May 15, 1934. Gettle was recovered the same day as the victim of another high-profile kidnapping case, six-year-old [[June Robles]].

Three men were arrested in connection with the kidnapping, and were eventually convicted after entering guilty pleas in court. They were James Kirk, Larry Kerrigan and Roy Williams.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;d=CDS19340518.2.1.15&amp;cl=&amp;srpos=0&amp;st=1&amp;e=--------20--1-----all&lt;/ref&gt; They were all given prison terms in [[San Quentin]]. Two women, Loretta Woody and Mona Gallighen, were also arraigned. They were eventually sent to a reformatory in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Kidnap Victim Gets Threat." ''Sarasota Herald''. December 19, 1934. p 6. Web. June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Clyde Stoddard, the owner of the sedan found in the garage of the Rosemont house, was detained for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;"Prison Terms Begun By Trio In Gettle Case."''Reading Eagle''. May 17, 1934. p 1. Web. June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, just days after his return to safety, Gettle received two letters which threatened to blow up his home unless he paid the senders $6,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Gettle Gets Threat To Blast His Home." ''Gettysburg Times''. June 26, 1934 p 2. Web. June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The threat was explained in the letters as 'atonement' for Gettle's testimony against Woody and Gallighen. He received another note, threatening another kidnapping, shortly before Christmas that same year.&lt;ref&gt;"Kidnap Victim Gets Threat." ''Sarasota Herald''. December 20, 1934. p 6. Web. June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Fourteen months after William's return, Fleeta Gettle died at the age of 34 on July 2, 1935. William F. Gettle died of "[[Cirrhosis|chronic liver trouble]]" at age 54 in his home in [[Beverly Hills]] on December 22, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0,9171,931998,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;
