'''Advanced Placement [[Chemistry]]''' ('''AP Chemistry''' or '''AP Chem''') is a course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] as a part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]] to give [[United States|American]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] high school students the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities and earn [[college]]-level credit. AP Chemistry has the distinction of having the lowest known test participation rate, with 49.5% of AP Chemistry students taking the exam in one study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=Research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement program: Taking stock and looking forward |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F2158244016682996 |journal=SAGE Open|date=2017|volume=7|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.1177/2158244016682996|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, smaller study found that 52.7% of students enrolled in AP Chemistry took their course's AP test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadler|first1=Philip M.|last2=Sonnert|first2=Gerhard|last3=Hazari|first3=Zahra|last4=Tai|first4=Robert|title=The role of Advanced high school coursework in increasing STEM career interest|journal=Science Educator|volume=23|issue=1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The course==
AP Chemistry is a course geared toward students with interests in chemical and [[physical science]]s, as well as any of the biological sciences. The course aims to prepare students to take the AP Chemistry exam toward the end of the academic year. AP Chemistry topics include [[atomic theory]], [[chemical bonding]], [[phases of matter]], [[solution (chemistry)|solutions]], [[chemical reactions|types of reactions]], [[chemical equilibrium]], [[reaction kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], and [[thermodynamics]].

==Prerequisites==
The College Board recommends successful completion of High School Chemistry and [[Algebra II]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_chem.html AP Chemistry at collegeboard.com]&lt;/ref&gt; however, requirement of this may differ from school to school. AP Chemistry usually requires knowledge of [[Algebra II]]; however, some schools allow students to take Algebra II concurrently with this class. The requirement of regular or honors level High School Chemistry may also be waived, but usually requires completion of a special assignment or exam.

The exam covers most of the introductory chemistry topics (except organic chemistry), including:
* Reactions
** [[Chemical equilibrium]]
** [[Chemical kinetics]]
** [[Stoichiometry]]
** [[Thermodynamics]]

==The exam==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}

The annual AP Chemistry examination, which is typically administered in May, is divided into two major sections (multiple-choice questions and free response essays).

=== Old test (2013 and earlier) ===

The old test was composed of two sections: a multiple-choice section consisting of 75 questions with five answer choices each, and a free-response section consisting of six essay prompts that required the authoring of chemical equations, solution of problems, and development of thoughtful essays in response to [[hypothetical]] scenarios.

* '''Section I''', the multiple-choice portion, did ''not'' allow the use of a [[calculator]], nor did it provide any additional reference material, other than a periodic table. Each question contained five answer choices. 90 minutes were allotted for the completion of Section I. Section I covered the breadth of the curriculum.
* '''Section II''', the free response section, was divided into two sections: Part A, requiring the completion of three problems, and Part B, also containing three problems.  Part A, lasting 55 minutes, allowed the use of calculators, while Part B, lasting 40 minutes, did not. The first problem in Part A concerned equilibrium related to solubility, [[acids]] and [[base (chemistry)|bases]], or pressure/concentration.  The first question of Part B was a chemical equation question in which 3 scenarios were presented and the student was required to work all 3 scenarios, authoring a balanced net ionic chemical equation for each scenario and answering questions about the equations and scenarios. If time permitted, students may have edited their responses from Part A during the time allotted for responding to Part B, though without the use of a calculator. The student needed to have completed all six questions.

While the use of calculators was prohibited during Section I and Section II Part B, a periodic table, a list of selected standard reduction potentials, and two pages of equations and conventions are available for use during the entirety of Section II.

=== New test (2014 and later) ===
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}

The 2014 AP Chemistry exam was the first administration of a redesigned test as a result of a redesigning of the AP Chemistry course.  The exam format is now different from the previous years, with 60 multiple choice questions (now with only four answer choices per question), 3 long free response questions, and 4 short free response questions. The new exam has a focus on longer, more in depth, lab-based questions. The penalty for incorrect answers on the multiple choice section was also removed.  More detailed information can be found at the related link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exam Content|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/exam/exam_information/1998.html|work=The AP Chemistry Exam|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agricultural soil science''' is a branch of [[soil science]] that deals with the study of [[edaphology|edaphic]] conditions as they relate to the [[food production|production of food]] and [[fiber]].  In this context, it is also a constituent of the field of [[agronomy]] and is thus also described as '''soil agronomy'''.

==History==

Prior to the development of [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]] in the 19th century, agricultural soil science (or [[edaphology]]) was the only branch of soil science. The bias of early soil science toward viewing soils only in terms of their agricultural potential continues to define the soil science profession in both academic and popular settings {{As of|2006|lc=on}}. (Baveye, 2006)

==Current status==

Agricultural soil science follows the holistic method. Soil is investigated in relation to and as integral part of terrestrial ecosystems but is also recognized as a [[soil management|manageable]] [[natural resource]].

Agricultural soil science studies the chemical, physical, biological, and mineralogical composition of soils as they relate to agriculture. Agricultural soil scientists develop methods that will improve the use of soil and increase the production of food and fiber crops. Emphasis continues to grow on the importance of soil sustainability.  Soil degradation such as erosion, compaction, lowered fertility, and contamination continue to be serious concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ImAnAgronomist.net I'm An Agronomist!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001231943/http://www.imanagronomist.net/ |date=October 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They conduct research in [[irrigation]] and [[drainage]], [[tillage]], [[soil classification]], [[nutrition|plant nutrition]], [[fertility (soil)|soil fertility]], and other areas.

Although maximizing plant (and thus animal) production is a valid goal, sometimes it may come at high cost which can be readily evident (e.g. massive [[crop disease]] stemming from [[monoculture]]) or long-term (e.g. impact of chemical fertilizers and pesticides on human health). An agricultural soil scientist may come up with a plan that can maximize production using sustainable methods and solutions, and in order to do that he must look into a number of science fields including [[agricultural science]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[meteorology]] and [[geology]].

==Kind of soil and their variables==

Some soil variables of special interest to agricultural soil science are:

*[[Soil texture]] or soil composition: Soils are composed of solid particles of various sizes. In decreasing order, these particles are [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]]. Every soil can be classified according to the relative percentage of sand, silt and clay it contains.
*[[Aeration#Aeration of soil|Aeration]] and [[Porosity#Porosity of soil|porosity]]: [[Atmosphere of Earth|Atmospheric air]] contains elements such as [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[carbon]] and others. These elements are prerequisites for life on Earth. Particularly, all [[Cell (biology)|cells]] (including root cells) require oxygen to function and if conditions become [[anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] they fail to [[cellular respiration|respire]] and [[metabolism|metabolize]]. Aeration in this context refers to the mechanisms by which air is delivered to the soil. In natural ecosystems soil aeration is chiefly accomplished through the vibrant activity of the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]]. Humans commonly aerate the soil by tilling and plowing, yet such practice may cause [[Soil#Degradation|degradation]]. Porosity refers to the air-holding capacity of the soil. See also [[characterisation of pore space in soil]].
*Drainage: In soils of bad drainage the water delivered through rain or irrigation may pool and stagnate. As a result, prevail [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] conditions and plant roots suffocate. Stagnant water also favors plant-attacking water [[mold]]s. In soils of excess drainage, on the other hand, plants don't get to absorb adequate water and [[Leaching (agriculture)|nutrients are washed]] from the porous medium to end up in [[groundwater]] reserves.
*[[Water content]]: Without soil moisture there is no [[transpiration]], no growth and plants [[Wilting|wilt]]. Technically, plant cells lose their pressure (see [[osmotic pressure]] and [[turgor pressure]]). Plants contribute directly to soil moisture. For instance, they create a leafy cover that minimizes the evaporative effects of solar radiation. But even when plants or parts of plants die, the decaying plant matter produces a thick organic cover that protects the soil from evaporation, [[erosion]] and [[soil compaction|compaction]]. For more on this subject see [[mulch]].
*[[Water potential]]: Water potential describes the tendency of the water to flow from one area of the soil to another. While water delivered to the soil surface normally flows downward due to gravity, at some point it meets increased pressure which causes a reverse upward flow. This effect is known as water suction.
*[[Soil horizon|Horizonation]]: Typically found in advanced and mature soils, horizonation refers to the creation of soil layers with differing characteristics. It affects almost all soil variables.
*[[Fertility (soil)|Fertility]]: A fertile soil is one rich in [[nutrient]]s and [[organic matter]]. Modern agricultural methods have rendered much of the arable land infertile. In such cases, soil can no longer support on its own plants with high nutritional demand and thus needs an external source of nutrients. However, there are cases where human activity is thought to be responsible for transforming rather normal soils into super-fertile ones (see [[terra preta]]).
*[[Biota (ecology)|Biota]] and [[soil biota]]: Organisms interact with the soil and contribute to its quality in innumerable ways. Sometimes the nature of interaction may be unclear, yet a rule is becoming evident: The amount and diversity of the biota is "proportional" to the quality of the soil. [[Clade]]s of interest include [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[nematode]]s, [[annelid]]s and [[arthropod]]s.
*Soil acidity or [[soil pH]] and [[cation-exchange capacity]]: Root cells act as [[Proton pump|hydrogen pumps]] and the surrounding concentration of hydrogen ions affects their ability to absorb nutrients. pH is a measure of this concentration. Each plant species achieves maximum growth in a particular pH range, yet the vast majority of edible plants can grow in soil pH between 5.0 and 7.5.

==Soil Fertility==

Agricultural soil scientists study ways to make [[soil]]s more [[soil fertility|productive]]. They classify soils and test them to determine whether they contain nutrients vital to plant growth. Such nutritional substances include compounds of [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]]. If a certain soil is deficient in these substances, [[fertilizer]]s may provide them. Agricultural soil scientists investigate the movement of [[Plant nutrition|nutrients]] through the soil, and the amount of nutrients absorbed by a plant's [[root]]s. Agricultural soil scientists also examine the development of roots and their relation to the soil. Some agricultural soil scientists try to understand the structure and function of soils in relation to soil fertility. They grasp the structure of soil as porous solid. The solid frames of soil consist of mineral derived from the rocks and organic matter originated from the dead bodies of various organisms. The pore space of the soil is essential for the soil to become productive. Small pores serve as water reservoir supplying water to plants and other organisms in the soil during the rain-less period. The water in the small pores of soils is not pure water; they call it soil solution. In soil solution, various plant nutrients derived from minerals and organic matters in the soil are there. This is measured through the [[cation exchange capacity]]. Large pores serve as water drainage pipe to allow the excessive water pass through the soil, during the heavy rains. They also serve as air tank to supply oxygen to plant roots  and other living beings in the soil. In short, agricultural soil scientists see the soil as a vessel, the most precious one for us, containing all of the substances needed by the plants and other living beings on earth.

==Soil Preservation==

In addition, agricultural soil scientists develop methods to preserve the agricultural productivity of soil and to decrease the effects on productivity of [[erosion]] by wind and water. For example, a technique called [[contour plowing]] may be used to prevent soil erosion and conserve rainfall. Researchers in agricultural soil science also seek ways to use the soil more effectively in addressing associated challenges. Such challenges include the beneficial reuse of human and animal wastes using agricultural crops; agricultural [[soil management]] aspects of preventing [[water pollution]] and the build-up in agricultural soil of chemical [[pesticide]]s.

==Employment of Agricultural Soil Scientists==

Most agricultural soil scientists are consultants, researchers, or teachers. Many work in the [[developed world]] as farm advisors,  [[agricultural experiment station]]s, federal, state or local government agencies, industrial firms, or universities. Within the USA they may be trained through the [[USDA]]'s [[Cooperative Extension Service]] offices, although other countries may use universities, [[:Category:Research institutes by country|research institutes]] or research agencies. Elsewhere, agricultural soil scientists may serve in international organizations such as the [[Agency for International Development]] and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations.

==Quotations==

{{quote|[The key objective of the soil science discipline is that of] finding ways to meet growing [[human need]]s for food and fiber while maintaining [[environmental change|environmental stability]] and [[Conservation biology|conserving resources]] for future generations|[[John W. Doran]], 2002 [[Soil Science Society of America|SSSA]] President, 2002}}

{{quote|Many people have the vague notion that soil science is merely a phase of [[agronomy]] and deals only with practical [[soil management]] for field crops. Whether we like it or not this is the image many have of us|[[Charles E. Kellog]], 1961}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3253">In [[analytical chemistry]], '''ashing''' or '''ash content determination''' is the process of [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]] for preconcentration of trace substances prior to a chemical analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=ashing|file=A00468}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[chromatography]], or optical analysis, such as [[spectroscopy]]. 

==Overview==
[[File:Crucible tong.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A crucible and tongs, on a green mat.]]

The residues after a sample is completely [[combustion|burnt]] - in contrast to the [[ash]] remaining after incomplete combustion - consist mostly of metal [[oxide]]s.  Ash is one of the components in the [[proximate]] analysis of biological materials, consisting mainly of salty, [[inorganic]] constituents. It includes metal [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s which are important for processes requiring [[ion]]s such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Sodium), K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Potassium), and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Calcium). It also includes trace [[mineral]]s which are required for unique molecules, such as [[chlorophyll]] and [[hemoglobin]].

A [[crucible]] can be used to determine the percentage of ash contained in an otherwise burnable sample of material such as [[coal]], [[wood]], [[oil]], rubber or plastics.  The [[ISO]] mandates ash content determination for most foodstuffs. Examples include 
*[[ISO 2171]]: ''Cereals, pulses and by-products — Determination of ash yield by incineration'';
*[[ISO 3593]]: ''Starch — Determination of ash'';
*[[ISO 928]]: ''Spices and condiments - Determination of total ash''; and 
*[[ISO 936]]: ''Meat and meat products - Determination of total ash''.

==Example==
===Apparatus===
Some necessary apparatus include:
*crucible (or similar porcelain or metal dishes)
*muffled [[furnace]]
*[[hot plate]]
*the sample
===Procedure===
A crucible and its lid are pre-weighed after thorough drying.  The sample is added to the completely dry crucible and lid and together they are weighed to determine the mass of the sample by difference. The sample is placed in the hot furnace long enough so that complete combustion of the sample occurs. The crucible, lid and ash then are re-weighed.
===Analysis===
The analysis of [[honey]] shows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sugaralliance.org/desktopdefault.aspx?page_id=97 Sugar Alliance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203012446/http://www.sugaralliance.org/desktopdefault.aspx?page_id=97 |date=December 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Typical honey analysis
* [[Fructose]]: 38%
* [[Glucose]]: 31%
* [[Sucrose]]: 1%
* [[Water]]: 17%
* [[Sugar|Other sugars]]: 9%  ([[maltose]], [[melezitose]])
* Ash: 0.17%

In this example the ash would include all the [[dietary mineral|minerals]] in honey.

* [[Carbonates]]: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[soda ash]]), K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[potash]])
* [[Bicarbonate]]s, e.g. NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]])
* [[Sulfate]]s: sulfate ash according to [[Ph. Eur.]]

Atheronals are biologically relevant [[oxysterols]] formed in the reaction of cholesterol with [[ozone]]. Atheronal A is the major product of ozonolysis which is 3β-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al. Atheronal B is formed by the intramolecular aldol reaction of Atheronal A, which is 3β-hydroxy-5β-hydroxy-B-norcholestane-6β-carboxaldehyde.

'''Auto insurance risk selection''' is the process by which [[vehicle insurance|vehicle insurers]] determine whether or not to insure an individual and what insurance premium to charge.  Depending on the jurisdiction, the insurance premium can be either mandated by the government or determined by the [[insurance company]] in accordance to a framework of regulations set by the government.  Often, the insurer will have more freedom to set the price on physical damage coverages than on mandatory liability coverages.

When the premium is not mandated by the government, it is usually derived from the calculations of an [[actuary]] based on statistical data.  The premium can vary depending on many factors that are believed to affect the expected cost of future [[insurance claim|claims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ratemaking | url = http://www.casact.org/admissions/syllabus/ch3.pdf | format = PDF | last = McClenahan | first = Charles | publisher = Casualty Actuarial Society | accessdate = 2006-05-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060514222824/http://www.casact.org/admissions/syllabus/ch3.pdf| archivedate= 14 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those factors can include the car characteristics, the coverage selected ([[deductible]], limit, covered perils), the profile of the driver ([[Ageing|age]], [[gender]], driving history) and the usage of the car (commute to work or not, predicted annual distance driven).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  What determines the price of my policy? | url = http://www.iii.org/individuals/auto/b/whatdetermines/ | publisher = Insurance Information Institute | accessdate = 2006-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Are Auto Insurance Rates Calculated? |url=http://insurance.countrywide.com/auto/ratescalculated.aspx |publisher=Countrywide Insurance Services |accessdate=2006-05-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208131220/http://insurance.countrywide.com/auto/ratescalculated.aspx |archivedate=8 February 2006 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IVS 1 - Market Value Basis of Valuation, Seventh Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wasistmeinautowert.de/ |title=Cars-value factors |accessdate=27 October 2016 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lZHq6vls?url=https://www.wasistmeinautowert.de/ |archivedate=27 October 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dijksterhuis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dijksterhuis |first1=Chris |last2=Lewis-Evans |first2=Ben |last3=Jelijs |first3=Bart |last4=Tucha |first4=Oliver |last5=de Waard |first5=Dick |last6=Brookhuis |first6=Karel |title=In-car usage-based insurance feedback strategies.

==History==
Conventional methods &lt;ref&gt;{{US patent application|20040153362}} Bauer, Alan Rex; Burns, Kurtis Tavis; Esposito, Michael Vincent; Huber, David Charles JR.; O'Malley, Patrick Lawrence; "Monitoring system for determining and communicating a cost of insurance", January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; for determining costs of [[automobile insurance|motor vehicle insurance]] involve gathering relevant historical data from a personal interview with, or a written application completed by, the applicant for the insurance and by referencing the applicant's public motor vehicle driving record that is maintained by a governmental agency, such as a Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Such data results in a classification of the applicant to a broad actuarial class for which insurance rates are assigned based upon the empirical experience of the insurer. Many factors are deemed relevant to such classification in a particular actuarial class or risk level, such as age, sex, marital status, location of residence and driving record.

The current system of insurance creates groupings of vehicles and drivers ([[actuarial class]]es) based on the following types of classifications.

*Vehicle: Age; manufacturer, model; and value.
*Driver: Age; sex; marital status; driving record (based on government reports), violations (citations); at fault accidents; and place of residence.
*Coverage: Types of losses covered, liability, uninsured or underinsured motorist, comprehensive, and collision; liability limits; and deductibles.

The classifications, such as age, are further broken into actuarial classes, such as 21- to 24-year-olds, to develop a unique vehicle insurance cost based on the specific combination of attributes for a particular risk. For example, the following information would produce a unique vehicle insurance cost:

*Vehicle: Age - 7 years old; manufacturer, model - Ford, Explorer XLT; value $18,000
*Driver: Age - 38 years old; gender - male; marital status - single; driving record (based on government reports) violations - 1 point (speeding); at fault accidents - 3 points (one at fault accident); place of residence 33619 ([[zip code]])
*Coverage: Types of losses covered; liability - yes; uninsured or underinsured - no; motorist comprehensive - yes; collision - yes; [[liability limits]] - $100,000/$300,000/$50,000; [[deductible]]s - $500/$500.

A change to any of this information might result in a different [[insurance premium|premium]] being charged if the change resulted in a different actuarial class or risk level for that variable. For instance, a change in the drivers' age from 38 to 39 may not result in a different actuarial class because 38- and 39-year-old people may be in the same actuarial class. However, a change in driver age from 38 to 45 may result in a different premium because the records of the insurer indicate a difference in risk associated with those ages and, therefore, the age difference results in a change in actuarial class or [[assigned risk]] level.

Current insurance rating systems also provide discounts and surcharges for some types of use of the vehicle, equipment on the vehicle and type of driver. Common surcharges and discounts include:

*Surcharges: Business use.
*Discounts: Safety equipment on the vehicle [[airbags]], and [[antilock brakes]]; theft control devices passive systems (e.g. [[The Club (automotive)|The Club]]), and alarm system; and driver type - good student, and safe driver (accident free); group - senior drivers fleet drivers .

==Usage Based Insurance==
{{main|Usage-based insurance}}
[[File:Aioi patent.JPG|thumb|300 px|Telematics Insurance System from AIOI patent application {{cite patent|WO|2005083605}}]]Conventional rating systems are primarily based on past realized losses and the past record of other drivers with similar characteristics. More recently, electronic systems have been introduced whereby the actual driving performance of a given driver is monitored and communicated directly to the insurance company.  The insurance company then assigns the driver to a risk class based on the monitored driving behavior.  An individual, therefore, can be put into different risk classes from month to month depending upon how they drive.  For example, a driver who drives long distance at high speed in one month might be placed into a high risk class for that month and pay a large premium.  If the same driver drives for short distances at low speed the next month, however, then he or she might be placed into a lower risk class and charged a lower premium.

The '''Botanical Garden and Zoo of Asunción''' ({{lang|es|Jardín Botánico y Zoológico de Asunción}}) is a [[botanical garden]] and [[zoo]] located in [[Asunción]], capital of the [[Paraguay|Republic of Paraguay]].

The Botanical Garden and Zoo is one of the principal open spaces of the city of Asunción, set in natural forest covering {{convert|110|ha|acres}} to the north of the city. The zoo is home to nearly seventy species of wildlife including birds, mammals and reptiles, mostly representing the [[fauna]] of [[South America]]. The botanical garden is home to native species, exhibiting in particular the variety and beauty of its lush trees.

==History==
This sprawling property was the former country house and estate of [[Carlos Antonio Lopez]], president of Paraguay between 1842 and 1862. Lopez ordered the construction of "Casa Lopez" as his home in the 1840s. Besides its historical value, the main building is very representative of the era in which it was built, in terms of technology, architecture and decoration, and is registered in the "Catalogue of Buildings and Sites of Urban Planning, architectural , Historical and Artistic Heritage of the city of Asunción",and specially protected by Law 946/82 "Protection of Cultural Property".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1896, Lopez's descendants sold the estate to the Agricultural Bank, by then in state ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= R. Andrew |last=Nickson |title=Historical Dictionary of Paraguay |url={{Google books|-Ji-CQAAQBAJ|page=406|plainurl=true}} |work=Historical Dictionaries of the Americas |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |edition=3| date=17 June 2015 |page=402 |isbn=9780810879645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden was created as such in 1914 by German scientists [[Karl August Gustav Fiebrig|Karl Freibig]] and his wife, Anna Gertz. Fiebrig was professor of botany and zoology at the [[Universidad Nacional de Asunción|University of Asunción]], having settled in Paraguay in 1910 following plant and insect collecting trips to Paraguay for European museums between 1904 and 1909.&lt;ref name=JS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000002560 |title=Fiebrig, Karl August Gustav (1879-1951) |publisher=[[JSTOR]] |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiebrig founded a school of Agriculture in 1916.&lt;ref name="IAI_biog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.iai.spk-berlin.de/fileadmin/documents/b7/cv_fiebrig_es.pdf |language=es|title=Karl August Gustav FIEBRIG (1869 – 1951)|publisher=[[Ibero-American Institute]]|date=16 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiebrig also founded a "Cotton Institute" which helped fund the garden complex.&lt;ref name="IAI_florist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.iai.spk-berlin.de/Fiebrig.132+M52087573ab0.0.html |title=Yboty rendá: la "floristería" de 600ha de Carlos Fiebrig |language=gn,es|trans-title=The Flower: the 600ha "florist" of Karl Fiebrig |publisher=[[Ibero-American Institute]] |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zoo was subsequently established by the same scientists, with a very advanced approach for the time, housing the animals in a setting as close as possible to their natural habitat. Gertz is credited with much of the [[landscape design]] of the gardens, though some projects were truncated following her death in May 1920. She was buried in the gardens.&lt;ref name="MDA_Zoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mca.gov.py/zoo.htm |title=Jardín Botánico y Zoológico de Asunción |language=es |trans-title=Botanical garden and Zoo of Asunción |publisher=Municipalidad de Asunción |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709071944/http://www.mca.gov.py/zoo.htm |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiebrig continued as director of the garden and zoo, and remarried in 1925. In addition to his professorship, in 1934, was also made director of the Paraguayan Department of Agriculture. In 1936, in the aftermath of the [[Chaco War]], a wave of xenophobic sentiment forced Fiebrig to leave Paraguay with his second wife and family.&lt;ref name="IAI_biog"/&gt; Responsibility for the estate passed from the state to its present owner, the Municipality of Asunción.&lt;ref name="MDA_Zoo"/&gt;

Historically, the estate covered more than {{convert|600|ha|acres}}, and had over 1&amp;nbsp;km frontage along the bank of the [[Paraguay River]], a port, a railway station and 60&amp;nbsp;km of road network.&lt;ref name="IAI_florist"/&gt; In the last 50 years,&lt;!--since when?--&gt; there have been several incursions, such as the riverside {{lang|es|Empresa de Servicios Sanitarios del Paraguay}} (ESSAP) ''Viñas Cué'' water treatment plant, the Copaco transmission station (built at the time of dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner|Stroessner]]), the Asunción Golf Club, laid out by Fiebrig, and several other divisions due to illegal occupations.&lt;!--POV? --&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Since 2013 the garden and zoo's director has been Maris Llorens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Última Hora (Paraguay)|Última Hora]] |url=http://www.ultimahora.com/maris-llorens-nueva-directora-del-zoologico-asuncion-n700360.html |title=Maris Llorens, nueva directora del Zoológico de Asunción |trans-title=Maris Llorens, new director of the zoo in Asuncion|language=es |date=30 June 2013 |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities and collections==
The facilities include:
* Botanical Garden: Originally called a botanical garden just because of the exuberant natural flora. Its trees are now over 150 years old and provide visitors with welcome shade.
* Nursery: cultivating more than 500 species of plants, many of them medical, used for educational interpretation about the properties of herbs.&lt;ref name="MDA_Botanic"/&gt; 
* Zoo: It has about 64 species of animals, mammals, birds, reptiles and others.&lt;ref name="MDA_Mant"/&gt; Its iconic exhibit is the ''[[Catagonus wagneri|Tagua]]'', a species of [[peccary]] that inhabits the Paraguayan [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]], initially believed extinct, which was rediscovered in the 1980s.
* Natural History Museum: located in a former farmhouse of Carlos Antonio Lopez's estate.
* Golf: For 50 years, the municipality of Asunción has ceded part of its space to various institutions, one of them being Asunción Golf Club. Whilst still part of the Botanical Garden premises, it is managed completely independently.

===Botanical Garden and Nursery===
The nursery is located behind the Upper House and contains over 500 species specialising in medicinal plants. It is open to the public and works in cooperation with the Botanic Garden and Conservatory of the City of Geneva, Switzerland.

Established for over 10 years, it has undertaken investigations into the cultivation, distribution and introduction of plants, specifically native, but also medicinal plants introduced by Paraguayan settlers.

The work of the Conservatory is to preserve the culture of the knowledge of medicinal plants in Paraguay. "The Paraguayan people consume herbs and know the use of at least 50 species. The work of the nursery is to investigate cultivation, harvesting and propagation and to use that knowledge for education".

Among its collections are:

* The medicinal plant nursery, being a place of agricultural research, education and training of its cultivation, with about 500 cultivated species.
* Agronomic nursery plants, with culture and selection for improved Paraguayan crop plants.

On 4 May 2006 the gardens launched the exhibition ''Ethnobotany 2006'' "Our plants, our people" ("{{lang|es|Nuestras Plantas, Nuestra Gente}}"), under the Paraguayan Ethnobotany Project (EPY) (which lasted for about ten years), with the support of the [[Conservatory and Botanical Garden of the City of Geneva]] and under the auspices of the organization ''Tesãi Reka Paraguay'' (TRP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The project helped improve the botanical garden and created a large Paraguayan medicinal plant collection and the Center for Conservation and Environmental Education (CCEAM) located in the Botanical Garden, which develops numerous educational activities.

'''Brook Glacier''' ({{Coord|78|42|S|85|09|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] that flows westward between [[Mount Strybing]], [[Mount Allen (Antarctica)|Mount Allen]] and [[Krusha Peak]] on the west side of [[Owen Ridge]] in southern [[Sentinel Range]], [[Ellsworth Mountains]] in [[Antarctica]], and joins [[Bender Glacier]] east of [[Chaplin Peak]]. It was named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] (2006) after [[Edward J. Brook]], Professor of Geosciences, [[Oregon State University]]; [[United States Antarctic Program|U.S. Antarctic Project]] investigator of Antarctic paleoclimate in numerous field seasons from 1988; Chair, U.S. National Ice Core Working Group for use of Antarctic ice cores for research purposes, 2004–05.

{{About|the number of individual electrons or holes per volume|the electric charge per volume|charge density|the number of possible states per energy range|density of states}}
'''Charge carrier density''', also known as '''carrier concentration''', denotes the number of charge carriers per [[volume]]. In [[SI units]], it is measured in m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. As with any [[density]], it can depend on position.

The carrier density is obtained by [[integral|integrating]] the charge density over the energy that the charges are allowed to have.

Charge carrier density is a [[particle density (particle count)|particle density]], so [[integral|integrating]] it over a volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; gives the number of charge carriers &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in that volume

&lt;math&gt;N=\int_V n(\mathbf r) \,\mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;.

where
:&lt;math&gt;n(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt; is the position-dependent charge carrier density.

If the density does not depend on position and is instead equal to a constant &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; this equation simplifies to

&lt;math&gt;N=V\cdot n_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Charge carrier densities involve equations concerning the [[electrical conductivity]] and related phenomena like the [[thermal conductivity]].

==Semiconductors==
The carrier density is important for [[semiconductors]], where it is an important quantity for the process of [[Doping (semiconductor)|chemical doping]]. Using [[band theory]], the electron density,&lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; is number of electrons per unit volume in the conduction band. For holes, &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is the number of holes per unit volume in the valance band. To calculate this number for electrons, we start with the idea that the total density of conduction-band electrons, &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt;, is just adding up the conduction electron density across the different energies in the band, from the bottom of the band &lt;math&gt;E_c&lt;/math&gt; to the top of the band &lt;math&gt;E_{top}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;n_0 = \int\limits_{E_c}^{E_{top}}N(E) dE&lt;/math&gt;

Because electrons are [[fermion]]s, the density of conduction electrons at any particular energy,&lt;math&gt;N(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the product of the [[density of states]],&lt;math&gt;g(E)&lt;/math&gt; or how many conducting states are possible, with the [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]],&lt;math&gt;f(E)&lt;/math&gt; which tells us the portion of those states which will actually have electrons in them.

:&lt;math&gt;N(E)=g(E)f(E)&lt;/math&gt;

In order to simplify the calculation, instead of treating the electrons as Fermions, according to the Fermi-dirac distribution, we instead treat them as a classical non-interacting gas, which is given by the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. This approximation has negligible effects when the magnitude &lt;math&gt;|E-E_f| \gg k_B T&lt;/math&gt;, which is true for semiconductors near room temperature. This approximation is invalid at very low temperatures or an extremely small band-gap.

:&lt;math&gt; f(E)=\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{E-E_f}{kT}}} \approx e^{\frac{-(E-E_f)}{k_B T}}&lt;/math&gt;

The three-dimensional [[density of states]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;g(E) = \frac {1}{2\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m^*}{\hbar^2}\right)^\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{E - E_0}&lt;/math&gt;

After combination and simplification, these expressions lead to:

:&lt;math&gt;n_0= 2 (\frac{ m^* k T}{2 \pi \hbar^2})^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; e^{\frac{-(E_c - E_f)}{k_B T}}&lt;/math&gt;

A similar expression can be derived for holes. The carrier concentration can be calculated by treating electrons moving back and forth across the [[bandgap]] just like the equilibrium of a [[reversible reaction]] from chemistry, leading to an  [[Mass action law (electronics)|electronic mass action law]]. The mass aciton law defines a quantity &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; called the intrinsic carrier concentraion, which for undoped materials:

:&lt;math&gt;n_i=n_0=p_0&lt;/math&gt;

The following table lists a few values of the intrinsic carrier concentration for [[intrinsic semiconductor]]s. The carrier concentrations will change if these materials are doped.

==Metals==
The carrier density is also applicable to [[metals]], where it can be calculated from the simple [[Drude model]]. In this case, the carrier density (in this context, also called the free electron density) can be calculated by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Solid State Physics|author=Ashcroft, Mermin|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; n=\frac{N_A Z \rho_m}{m_a}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;N_A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]], Z is the number of [[valence electron]]s, &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the material, and &lt;math&gt;m_a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[atomic mass]].

==Measurement==

The density of charge carriers can be determined in many cases using the [[Hall effect]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents|author = [[Edwin Hall]]|journal = American Journal of Mathematics|volume = 2|year = 1879|pages = 287–92|url = http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|accessdate = 2008-02-28|doi = 10.2307/2369245|issue = 3|jstor = 2369245 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727010116/http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|archivedate=2011-07-27 |ref = hallpdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; , the voltage of which depends inversely on the density.

'''Charles Frederick Hoffmann''' (1838–1913) was a German-American topographer working in [[California]] [[United States|U.S.]] from 1860 to 1880.

==Life==
Hoffmann was born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], 1838. After receiving an education in engineering, he emigrated to America. In 1857 he was topographer for Frederick Lander's survey to the Rocky Mountains. He came to California in 1858. He was recruited by [[Josiah Whitney]] to join the [[California Geological Survey]] because of his valuable skill as a topographer. Hoffmann is largely responsible for introducing [[topography]] to the United States. He helped explore the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of California, from 1860 through 1870, and 1873 through 1874. As a member of the Survey, Hoffmann created the official maps from the expeditions made by the survey team. Hoffmann achieved a number of [[first ascent]]s in the Sierra Nevada:
*[[Mount Brewer]]
*[[Mount Dana]]
*[[Mount Silliman]]
*[[Tower Peak]]

In 1870 he married Lucy Mayotta Browne. In 1871 and 1872 he was Professor of Topographical Engineering at [[Harvard University]]. Later, he was a mining engineer at [[Virginia City, Nevada]], [[San Francisco, California]], and [[Mexico]].
Charles Hoffmann died 1913 in [[Oakland, California]].

==Legacy==
[[Mount Hoffmann]], a high peak in central [[Yosemite National Park]], is named after him.

{{Notability|date=October 2012}}

'''eOn''' was a [[distributed computing]] project for the [[BOINC]] client, which uses [[theoretical chemistry]] techniques to solve problems in [[condensed matter physics]] and [[materials science]].  It was a project of the [[Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences]] at the [[University of Texas]].

Traditional [[molecular dynamics]] can accurately model events that occur within a fraction of a [[millisecond]].  In order to model events that take place on much longer timescales, Eon combines [[transition state theory]] with [[Phonon|kinetic]] [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]].  The result is a combination of [[classical mechanics]] and quantum methods like [[density functional theory]].

Since the generation of new work units depended on the results of previous units, the project could only give each [[Host (network)|host]] a few units at a time.

On May 26, 2014, it was announced that eOn would be retiring from [[BOINC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/dev/forum_thread.php?id=9281|title=Announcement that the eOn project has been discontinued|website=BOINC Forums|accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''elementary charge''', usually denoted by {{math|'''''e'''''}} or sometimes {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the [[electric charge]] carried by a single [[proton]], or equivalently, the magnitude of the electric charge carried by a single [[electron]], which has charge {{math|−'''''e'''''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the symbol ''e'' has many other meanings. Somewhat confusingly, in [[atomic physics]], ''e'' sometimes denotes the electron charge, i.e. the ''negative'' of the elementary charge.&lt;/ref&gt; This elementary charge is a fundamental [[physical constant]]. To avoid confusion over its sign, ''e'' is sometimes called the '''elementary positive charge'''. This charge has a measured value of approximately {{physconst|e}} ([[coulomb]]s) and after the [[2019 redefinition of SI base units|20 May 2019]], its value will be ''exactly'' {{val|1.602176634|e=−19|u=C}} by definition of the [[coulomb]]. In [[centimeter gram second system of units|cgs]] units, it is {{val|4.80320425|(10)|e=-10|u=[[statcoulomb]]s}}.&lt;ref&gt;This is derived from the [[NIST]] value and uncertainty, using the fact that one coulomb is ''exactly'' {{val|2997924580}} statcoulombs. (The conversion factor is ten times the numerical [[speed of light]] in meters/second.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnitude of the elementary charge was first measured in [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert A. Millikan]]'s [[oil drop experiment]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/millikanoildrop.html Robert Millikan: The Oil-Drop Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[natural unit]] systems, such as the system of [[atomic units]], ''e'' functions as the [[units of measurement|unit]] of electric charge, that is ''e'' is equal to 1&amp;nbsp;e in those unit systems. The use of elementary charge as a unit was promoted by [[George Johnstone Stoney]] in 1874 for the first system of [[natural units]], called [[Stoney units]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he proposed the name ''electron'' for this unit. At the time, the particle we now call the [[electron]] was not yet discovered and the difference between the particle ''electron'' and the unit of charge ''electron'' was still blurred. Later, the name ''electron'' was assigned to the particle and the unit of charge ''e'' lost its name. However, the unit of energy [[electronvolt]] reminds us that the elementary charge was once called ''electron''.

The maximum capacity of each pixel in a [[charge-coupled device]] image sensor, known as the ''well depth'', is typically given in units of electrons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccd.com/ccd103.html Apogee CCD University – Pixel Binning]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly around 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; {{subatomic particle|electron}} per pixel.

In [[high-energy physics]] (HEP)   [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]] are used, and the charge unit is a dependent one, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\hbar c}&lt;/math&gt;, so that  {{mvar|e}} =  0.30282212088 {{radic|''ħc''}}.

== Quantization ==
''Charge quantization'' is the principle that the charge of any object is an [[integer]] multiple of the elementary charge. Thus, an object's charge can be exactly 0&amp;nbsp;''e'', or exactly 1&amp;nbsp;''e'', −1&amp;nbsp;''e'', 2&amp;nbsp;''e'', etc., but not, say, {{sfrac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;''e'', or −3.8&amp;nbsp;''e'', etc. (There may be exceptions to this statement, depending on how "object" is defined; see below.)

This is the reason for the terminology "elementary charge": it is meant to imply that it is an indivisible unit of charge.

=== Charges less than an elementary charge ===

There are two known sorts of exceptions to the indivisibility of the elementary charge: [[quark]]s and [[quasiparticle]]s.

*[[Quark]]s, first posited in the 1960s, have quantized charge, but the charge is quantized into multiples of {{sfrac|1|3}}&amp;thinsp;''e''. However, quarks cannot be seen as isolated particles; they exist only in groupings, and stable groupings of quarks (such as a [[proton]], which consists of three quarks) all have charges that are integer multiples of ''e''. For this reason, either 1&amp;nbsp;''e'' or {{sfrac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;''e'' can be justifiably considered to be "the [[quantum]] of charge", depending on the context. This charge commensurability, "charge quantization", has partially [[Grand Unified Theory#Motivation|motivated Grand unified Theories]].
*[[Quasiparticle]]s are not particles as such, but rather an [[emergence|emergent]] entity in a complex material system that behaves like a particle. In 1982 [[Robert B. Laughlin|Robert Laughlin]] explained the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] by postulating the existence of fractionally-charged [[quasiparticle]]s. This theory is now widely accepted, but this is not considered to be a violation of the principle of charge quantization, since quasiparticles are not [[elementary particles]].

===What is the quantum of charge?===

All known [[elementary particle]]s, including quarks, have charges that are integer multiples of {{sfrac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;''e''. Therefore, one can say that the "[[quantum]] of charge" is {{sfrac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;''e''. In this case, one says that the "elementary charge" is three times as large as the "quantum of charge".

On the other hand, all ''isolatable'' particles have charges that are integer multiples of ''e''. (Quarks cannot be isolated: they only exist in collective states like protons that have total charges that are integer multiples of ''e''.) Therefore, one can say that the "quantum of charge" is ''e'', with the proviso that quarks are not to be included. In this case, "elementary charge" would be synonymous with the "quantum of charge".

In fact, both terminologies are used.&lt;ref&gt;''Q is for Quantum'', by John R. Gribbin, Mary Gribbin, Jonathan Gribbin, page 296, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zBsDkgI1uQsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA296 Web link]&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, phrases like "the quantum of charge" or "the indivisible unit of charge" can be ambiguous, unless further specification is given. On the other hand, the term "elementary charge" is unambiguous: it refers to a quantity of charge equal to that of a proton.

== Experimental measurements of the elementary charge ==

=== In terms of the Avogadro constant and Faraday constant ===

If the [[Avogadro constant]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[Faraday constant]] ''F'' are independently known, the value of the elementary charge can be deduced, using the formula
::&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{F}{N_{\mathrm{A}}} &lt;/math&gt;
(In other words, the charge of one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of electrons, divided by the number of electrons in a mole, equals the charge of a single electron.)

This method is ''not'' how the ''most accurate'' values are measured today: Nevertheless, it is a legitimate and still quite accurate method, and experimental methodologies are described below:

The value of the Avogadro constant ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; was first approximated by [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] who, in 1865, estimated the average diameter of the molecules in air by a method that is equivalent to calculating the number of particles in a given volume of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = J. | last = Loschmidt | authorlink = Johann Josef Loschmidt | title = Zur Grösse der Luftmoleküle | journal = Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 395–413 | year =1865}} [http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Loschmidt-1865.html English translation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207130125/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Loschmidt-1865.html |date=February 7, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the value of ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; can be measured at very high accuracy by taking an extremely pure crystal (often [[silicon]]), measuring how far apart the atoms are spaced using [[X-ray diffraction]] or another method, and accurately measuring the density of the crystal. From this information, one can deduce the mass (''m'') of a single atom; and since the [[molar mass]] (''M'') is known, the number of atoms in a mole can be calculated: ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''M''/''m''.&lt;ref name=CODATA /&gt;

The value of ''F'' can be measured directly using [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis]]. Faraday's laws of electrolysis are quantitative relationships based on the electrochemical researches published by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ehl, Rosemary Gene |author2=Ihde, Aaron | title = Faraday's Electrochemical Laws and the Determination of Equivalent Weights | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | year = 1954 | volume = 31 | issue = May | pages = 226–232 | doi = 10.1021/ed031p226 |bibcode = 1954JChEd..31..226E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[electrolysis]] experiment, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the electrons passing through the anode-to-cathode wire and the ions that plate onto or off of the anode or cathode. Measuring the mass change of the anode or cathode, and the total charge passing through the wire (which can be measured as the time-integral of [[electric current]]), and also taking into account the molar mass of the ions, one can deduce ''F''.&lt;ref name=CODATA&gt;{{CODATA2006|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit to the precision of the method is the measurement of ''F'': the best experimental value has a relative uncertainty of 1.6&amp;nbsp;ppm, about thirty times higher than other modern methods of measuring or calculating the elementary charge.&lt;ref name=CODATA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CODATA1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil-drop experiment ===
{{main|Oil-drop experiment}}
A famous method for measuring ''e'' is Millikan's oil-drop experiment. A small drop of oil in an electric field would move at a rate that balanced the forces of [[gravity]], [[viscosity]] (of traveling through the air), and [[electric force]]. The forces due to gravity and viscosity could be calculated based on the size and velocity of the oil drop, so electric force could be deduced. Since electric force, in turn, is the product of the electric charge and the known electric field, the electric charge of the oil drop could be accurately computed. By measuring the charges of many different oil drops, it can be seen that the charges are all integer multiples of a single small charge, namely ''e''.

The necessity of measuring the size of the oil droplets can be eliminated by using tiny plastic spheres of a uniform size. The force due to viscosity can be eliminated by adjusting the strength of the electric field so that the sphere hovers motionless.

=== Shot noise ===
{{main|Shot noise}}

Any [[electric current]] will be associated with [[electronic noise|noise]] from a variety of sources, one of which is [[shot noise]]. Shot noise exists because a current is not a smooth continual flow; instead, a current is made up of discrete electrons that pass by one at a time. By carefully analyzing the noise of a current, the charge of an electron can be calculated. This method, first proposed by [[Walter H. Schottky]], can determine a value of ''e'' of which the accuracy is limited to a few percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv | first1 = Carlo | last1 = Beenakker | first2 = Christian | last2 = Schönenberger | title = Quantum Shot Noise. Fluctuations in the flow of electrons signal the transition from particle to wave behavior | eprint = cond-mat/0605025 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was used in the first direct observation of [[Laughlin wavefunction|Laughlin]] [[quasiparticle]]s, implicated in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Nature | volume = 389 | issue = 162–164 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1038/38241 | title = Direct observation of a fractional charge | first1 = R. | last1 = de-Picciotto | first2 = M. | last2 = Reznikov | first3 = M. | last3 = Heiblum | first4 = V. | last4 = Umansky | first5 = G. | last5 = Bunin | first6 = D. | last6 = Mahalu | pages = 162 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;|bibcode = 1997Natur.389..162D }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Josephson and von Klitzing constants===
Another accurate method for measuring the elementary charge is by inferring it from measurements of two effects in [[quantum mechanics]]: The [[Josephson effect]], voltage oscillations that arise in certain [[superconducting]] structures; and the [[quantum Hall effect]], a quantum effect of electrons at low temperatures, strong magnetic fields, and confinement into two dimensions. The [[Josephson constant]] is
:&lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{J} = \frac{2e}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
(where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]). It can be measured directly using the [[Josephson effect]].

The [[von Klitzing constant]] is
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{K} = \frac{h}{e^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be measured directly using the [[quantum Hall effect]].

From these two constants, the elementary charge can be deduced:
:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{2}{R_\mathrm{K} K_\mathrm{J}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===CODATA method===
In the most recent [[CODATA]] adjustments,&lt;ref name=CODATA /&gt; the elementary charge is not an independently defined quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;e^2 = \frac{2h \alpha}{\mu_0 c} = 2h \alpha \epsilon_0 c&lt;/math&gt;
where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''α'' is the [[fine-structure constant]], ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]], ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant]], and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]] in the value of ''e'' is currently determined almost entirely by the uncertainty in the Planck constant.

The most precise values of the Planck constant come from [[Kibble balance]] experiments, which are used to measure the product ''K''{{su|p=2|b=J}}''R''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;. The most precise values of the fine structure constant come from comparisons of the measured and calculated value of the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the electron.&lt;ref name=CODATA /&gt;

'''Forensic materials engineering''', a branch of [[forensic engineering]], focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking  defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or the source of a specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for material identification may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined by the nature of the material in question, be it [[metal]], [[glass]], [[ceramic]], [[polymer]] or [[composite material|composite]]. An important aspect is the analysis of [[trace evidence]] such as [[skid mark]]s on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other. Provided the traces can be analysed successfully, then an accident or crime can often be reconstructed. Another aim will be to determine the cause of a broken component using the technique of [[fractography]].

==Metals and alloys==
[[Image:Crankshaft fatigue.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|[[Crankshaft]] [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] fracture]]
Metal and alloy surfaces can be analyzed in a number of ways, including by [[spectroscopy]] and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]] used during [[scanning electron microscopy]]. The nature and composition of the metal can normally be established by sectioning and polishing the bulk, and examining the flat section using [[optical microscopy]] after [[etching]] solutions have been used to provide contrast in the section between alloy constituents. Such solutions (often an [[acid]]) attack the surface preferentially, so isolating features or inclusions of one composition, enabling them to be seen much more clearly than in the polished but untreated surface. [[Metallography]] is a routine technique for examining the [[microstructure]] of metals, but can also be applied to ceramics, glasses and polymers. [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] can often be critical in  determining failures modes by examining fracture surfaces. The origin of a crack can be found and the way it grew assessed, to distinguish, for example, [[Mechanical overload (engineering)|overload]] failure from [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]. Often however, fatigue fractures are easy to distinguish from overload failures by the lack of ductility, and the existence of a fast crack growth region and the slow crack growth area on the fracture surface. [[Crankshaft]] fatigue for example is a common failure mode for engine parts. The example shows just two such zones, the slow crack at the base, the fast at the top.

==Ceramics and glasses==
[[Image:Glass fracture.jpg|left|thumb|200px| Brittle fracture in [[glass]]]]
Hard products like [[ceramic]] pottery and [[glass]] [[windscreen]]s can be studied using the same [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] methods used for metals, especially [[ESEM]] conducted at low vacuum. Fracture surfaces are especially valuable sources of information because surface features like hachures can enable the origin or origins of the cracks to be found. Analysis of the surface features is carried out using [[fractography]].

The position of the origin can then be matched with likely loads on the product to show how an accident occurred, for example. Inspection of bullet holes can often show the direction of travel and energy of the impact, and the way common glass products like bottles can be analysed to show whether deliberately or accidentally broken in a crime or accident. Defects such as foreign particles will often occur near or at the origin of the critical crack, and can be readily identified by [[ESEM]].

==Polymers and composites==
[[Image:Chlorine attack1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[chlorine]] attack of [[acetal resin]] plumbing joint]]
[[Thermoplastics]], [[thermosets]], and [[Composite material|composites]] can be analyzed using [[FTIR]] and [[UV spectroscopy]] as well as [[NMR]] and [[ESEM]]. Failed samples can either be dissolved in a suitable solvent and examined directly (UV, IR and NMR sepctroscopy) or as a thin film cast from solvent or cut using [[microtomy]] from the solid product. The slicing method is preferable since there are no complications from solvent absorption, and the integrity of the sample is partly preserved. Fractured products can be examined using [[fractography]], an especially useful method for all fractured components using [[macrophotography]] and [[optical microscopy]]. Although polymers usually possess quite different properties to metals and ceramics, they are just as susceptible to failure from [[mechanical overload (engineering)|mechanical overload]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[stress corrosion cracking]] if products are poorly designed or manufactured. Many plastics are susceptible to attack by active chemicals like [[chlorine]], present at low levels in potable water supplies, especially if the [[injection moulding]]s are faulty.

[[ESEM]] is especially useful for providing [[elemental analysis]] from viewed parts of the sample being investigated. It is effectively a technique of [[microanalysis]] and valuable for examination of [[trace evidence]]. On the other hand, colour rendition is absent, and there is no information provided about the way in which those elements are bonded to one another. Specimens will be exposed to a vacuum, so any volatiles may be removed, and surfaces may be contaminated by substances used to attach the sample to the mount.

==Elastomers==
[[Image:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ozone cracking in [[Natural rubber]] tubing]]
Rubber products are often safety-critical parts of machines, so that failure can often cause accidents or loss of function. Failed products can be examined with many of the generic polymer methods, although it is more difficult if the sample is [[vulcanized]] or [[cross-linked]]. [[Attenuated total reflectance]] [[infra-red spectroscopy]] is useful because the product is usually flexible so can be pressed against the [[selenium]] crystal used for analysis. Simple swelling tests can also help to identify the specific [[elastomer]] used in a product. Often the best technique is [[ESEM]] using the X-ray elemental analysis facility on the microscope. Although the method only provides [[elemental analysis]], it can provide clues as to the identity of the elastomer being examined. Thus the presence of substantial amounts of [[chlorine]] indicates [[polychloroprene]] while the presence of [[nitrogen]] indicates [[nitrile rubber]]. The method is also useful in confirming [[ozone cracking]] by the large amounts of [[oxygen]] present on cracked surfaces. Ozone attacks susceptible elastomers such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]] and associated [[copolymer]]s. Such elastomers possess double bonds in their main chains, the group which is attacked during [[ozonolysis]].

The problem occurs when small concentrations of [[ozone]] gas are present near to exposed elastomer surfaces, such as [[O-ring]]s and [[diaphragm seal]]s. The product must be in tension, but only very low strains are sufficient to cause degradation.

==Origin==

===Pioneer research===
{{Main article| Francesco Redi}}
In 1664 an Italian polymath [[Francesco Redi]] wrote his first monumental work ''Osservazioni intorno alle vipere'' (Observations about the Viper) in which he first elucidated the scientific basis of [[snakebite]] and venom of the viper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Francesco Redi |editor=Knoefel PK  |title= Francesco Redi on Vipers |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5w8VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg|accessdate= 2013-04-18 |origyear=   |year= 1988  |publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden, the Netherlands  |pages=11–17 |isbn= 9004089489}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the venom is produced from the [[fang]], it is not poisonous when swallowed, and dangerous only when it enters the  [[blood circulation|bloodstream]].&lt;ref name=hab&gt;{{cite journal |author= Habermehl GG|title= Francesco Redi—life and work|url= |year= 1994 |volume=32  |issue=4  |pages=411–417|pmid=8052995 |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(94)90292-5 |journal=Toxicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even showed how to stop or slow down the venom action in the blood by tight [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] before the wound. This work is heralded as the foundation of [[toxinology]] and the beginning of experimental [[toxicology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hayes AN, Gilbert SG |title= Historical milestones and discoveries that shaped the toxicology sciences| journal= EXS|year=2009| volume=99 |issue=1 |pages= 1–35|pmid= 19157056 |doi=10.1007/978-3-7643-8336-7_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation===

In 1962 a group of scientists and clinicians who have made significant contributions to toxinology joined forces to establish a working society. The Society had its first international meeting in 1966 in [[Atlantic City]], USA. [[Findlay E. Russell]] was the first president of the Society.&lt;ref name=meb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Russell FE|title= History of the International Society on Toxinology and Toxicon. I. The formative years, 1954–1965| journal= Toxicon|year=1987| volume=25|issue=1 |pages=3–21 |pmid= 3551198|doi=10.1016/0041-0101(87)90148-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation and Membership==

The Society aims to advance knowledge on the properties of toxins and antitoxins and to bring together scholars interested in the field. Full membership is open to those who have published meritorious [[original research|original investigations]] in toxinology, while persons who do not qualify for membership but are interested in the field of toxinology are eligible for associate membership. There is also student membership. World Congresses of the Society and Symposia of the IST-Sections (European, Pan-American, Asia-Pacific) are regularly organised to promote communication and exchange of results in toxinology research. The officers of the Society, the President and Secretary-Treasurer, are assisted by a Council and they all are elected by the members.&lt;ref name=meb/&gt;

==Award==
{{Main article|Redi Award}}
IST sponsors the ''[[Redi Award]]'' to honour scientists who have contributed distinguished work in the field of toxinology. This is the most prestigious award in the world in toxinology. The award is given at each World Congress of IST (generally held every three years) since 1967.&lt;ref name=hab /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= International Society on Toxinology |title=IST Redi Awards |url= http://www.toxinology.org/IST_RediAward.htm |date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiative==

At the Asia-Pacific Section Congress in [[Vietnam]] in December 2008, a proposal by Prof David Warrell (recipient of the Redi Award 2012) that ''The Global Snakebite Initiative be formally endorsed as an official initiative of the IST'' was passed, and confirmed unanimously at the IST World Congress in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], in March 2009. The Global Snakebite Initiative is the follow-up of the [[World Health Organization]] programme on snakebite as one of the [[Neglected Tropical Diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= WHO |title= Neglected tropical diseases: Snakebite |url= http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/snakebites/en/ |date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

''[[Toxicon]]'' is the official journal of the Society, started in 1963, and is now published monthly by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Rosenberg P|title= Happy 25th birthday ''Toxicon''| journal= Toxicon|year=1987| volume=25|issue=1 |pages=1–2 |pmid= |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(87)90147-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= NCBI NLM Catalogue |title= Toxicon|url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/1307333|date=  | accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Standard Classification of Education''' ('''ISCED''') is a statistical framework for organizing information on [[education]] maintained by the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]]. It is a member of the international family of economic and social classifications of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/ United Nations Statistics Division: ''UN Classifications Registry''], retrieved 30-03-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISCED was designed in the early 2009 to serve ‘as an instrument suitable for assembling, compiling and presenting statistics of education both within individual countries and internationally’.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016. ''International Standard Classification of Education: ISCED 2001'. http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/isced97-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first version, known as ISCED 2001, was approved by the International Conference on Education (Geneva, 1975), and was subsequently endorsed by UNESCO’s 19th General Conference in 1976.

The second version, known as ISCED 1997, was approved by the UNESCO General Conference at its 29th session in November 1997 as part of efforts to increase the international comparability of education statistics. It covered primarily two cross-classification variables: ''levels'' (7) and ''fields'' of education (25). The UNESCO Institute for Statistics led the development of a third version, which was adopted by UNESCO’s 36th General Conference in November 2011 and which will replace ISCED 1997 in international data collections in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf Revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)], retrieved 05-04-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.

During the review and revision, which led to the adoption of ISCED 2011, UNESCO Member States agreed that the fields of education should be examined in a separate process. This review is now underway with the view to establishing an independent but related classification called the ISCED Fields of Education and Training.

Related materials from the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] and also [[Eurostat]] provide further information and statistical guidance for the classification of sub-fields of education as a companion to ISCED.&lt;ref&gt;European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training and Eurostat. 1999.

! Level
! Description
! Principal characteristics
|-
|  0
| Pre-primary education
| Initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment and to develop their cognitive, physical, social and emotional skills. Designed for children from age 3 to the start of primary education.
|-
|  1
| [[Primary education]] or first stage of [[basic education]]
| Normally starting between the ages of 5 – 7, designed to give a sound basic education in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects.
|-
|  2
| [[Lower secondary school|Lower secondary education]] or second stage of [[basic education]]
| Designed to complete basic education, usually on a more subject-oriented pattern. It builds upon the learning outcomes from primary education (ISCED level 1) and aims to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development.
|-
|  3
| [[Upper secondary school|Upper secondary education]]
| More specialized education typically beginning at age 15 or 16 years and/or completes secondary education in preparation for tertiary education, or to provide skills relevant to employment, or both.
|-
|  4
| Post-secondary non-tertiary education
| Programmes that straddle the boundary between upper- and post-secondary education from an international point of view. ISCED level 4 programmes, considering their content, cannot be regarded as tertiary programmes. They are often not significantly more advanced than programmes at ISCED level 3 but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed a programme at level 3.
|-
|  5
| First stage of tertiary education  
| Tertiary programmes having an educational content more advanced than those offered at ISCED levels 3 and 4. These programmes may be academically based or practically oriented / occupationally specific. Entry to these programmes normally requires the successful completion of ISCED level 3A or 3B or a similar qualification at ISCED level 4A. All degrees and qualifications are cross-classified by type of programmes, position in national degree or qualification structures and cumulative duration at tertiary.
|-
|  6
| Second stage of tertiary education 
| Tertiary programmes leading to the award of an advanced research qualification, e.g. [[Ph.D.]] These programmes are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only. It typically requires the submission of a thesis or dissertation of publishable quality which is the product of original research and represents a significant contribution to knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10553">In [[mathematics]], the '''Lindelöf hypothesis''' is a conjecture by Finnish mathematician [[Ernst Leonard Lindelöf]] (see {{harvtxt|Lindelöf|1908}}) about the rate of growth of the [[Riemann zeta function]] on the critical line. This hypothesis is implied by the [[Riemann hypothesis]].  It says that, for any ''ε'' &gt; 0,

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\frac12 + it\right) =O(t^\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

as ''t'' tends to infinity (see [[O notation]]). Since ''ε'' can be replaced by a smaller value, we can also write the conjecture as, for any positive ''ε'',

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta\left(\frac12 + it\right) =o(t^\varepsilon).&lt;/math&gt;

==The &amp;mu; function==
If σ is real, then μ(σ) is defined to be the [[infimum]] of all real numbers ''a'' such that ''ζ''(''σ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iT'') = O(''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;). It is trivial to check that ''μ''(''σ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for ''σ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, and the [[functional equation]] of the zeta function implies that μ(''σ'') = ''μ''(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''σ'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''σ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/2. The [[Phragmen–Lindelöf theorem]] implies that μ is a [[convex function]]. The Lindelöf hypothesis states μ(1/2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, which together with the above properties of ''μ'' implies that ''μ''(''σ'') is 0 for ''σ''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1/2 and 1/2&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;σ for ''σ''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1/2.

Lindelöf's convexity result together with ''μ''(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''μ''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 implies that 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''μ''(1/2)&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1/4.  The upper bound of 1/4 was lowered by [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood|Littlewood]] to 1/6 by applying [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]]'s method of estimating [[exponential sum]]s to the [[approximate functional equation]]. It has since been lowered to slightly less than 1/6 by several authors using  long and technical proofs, as in the following table:

==Relation to the Riemann hypothesis==
{{harvtxt|Backlund|year=1918&amp;ndash;1919}} (1918&amp;ndash;1919) showed that the Lindelöf hypothesis is equivalent to the following statement about the zeros of the zeta function: for every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, the number of zeros with real part at least 1/2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ε'' and imaginary part between ''T'' and ''T''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is o(log(''T'')) as ''T'' tends to infinity. The Riemann hypothesis implies that there are no zeros at all in this region and so implies the Lindelöf hypothesis. The number of zeros with imaginary part between ''T'' and ''T''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is known to be O(log(''T'')), so the Lindelöf hypothesis seems only slightly stronger than what has already been proved, but in spite of this it has resisted all attempts to prove it.

==Means of powers (or moments) of the zeta function==
The Lindelöf hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T|\zeta(1/2+it)|^{2k}\,dt = O(T^{\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

for all positive integers ''k'' and all positive real numbers ε. This has been proved for  ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 or&amp;nbsp;2, but the case ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 seems much harder and is still an open problem.

There is a much more precise conjecture about the asymptotic behavior of the integral: it is believed that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^T|\zeta(1/2+it)|^{2k} \, dt = T\sum_{j=0}^{k^2}c_{k,j}\log(T)^{k^2-j} + o(T)&lt;/math&gt;

for some constants ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. This has been proved by Littlewood for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and by {{harvtxt|Heath-Brown|1979}} for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 
(extending a  result of {{harvtxt|Ingham|1926}} who found the leading term).

{{harvtxt|Conrey|Ghosh|1998}} suggested the value 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{42}{9!}\prod_ p \left((1-p^{-1})^4(1+4p^{-1}+p^{-2})\right)&lt;/math&gt; 
for the leading coefficient when ''k'' is 6, and {{harvtxt|Keating|Snaith|2000}} used [[random matrix theory]] to suggest some conjectures for the values of the coefficients for higher&amp;nbsp;''k''. The leading coefficients are conjectured to be the product of an elementary factor, a certain product over primes, and the number of ''n'' by ''n'' [[Young tableaux]] given by the sequence
:1, 1, 2, 42, 24024, 701149020, &amp;hellip; {{OEIS|id=A039622}}.

==Other consequences==
Denoting by ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; the ''n''-th prime number, a result by [[Albert Ingham]], shows that the Lindelöf hypothesis implies that, for any ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0,

:&lt;math&gt;p_{n+1}-p_n\ll p_n^{1/2+\varepsilon}\,&lt;/math&gt;

if ''n'' is [[sufficiently large]]. However, this result is much worse than that of the large [[prime gap]] conjecture.

It derives its name from Princess Daphne, the heroine of ''[[Dragon's Lair]]''.

== Network Emulator ==
* [[NS-2]]

[[Packet_Tracer|Cisco Packet Tracer]]

Router Sim

==Operating system emulators==
; [[Unix]]
* [[Cygwin]]: For [[Microsoft Windows]], provides a [[POSIX]] environment and system libraries (contained in cygwin.dll).  This does '''not''' allow one to run unaltered Linux/Unix binaries.  However, it allows use of the gcc compiler collection to compile software written for these operating systems from source code.

:In addition to the POSIX system, Cygwin includes a [[Package manager]] that connects to a repository with 9000+ software packages. Users can optionally use Cygwin ports repository which includes &gt;2300 (86x64) to &gt;2700 (86x32) additional software packages not included in the RedHat-hosted repository, including many GUI applications.

:The repository contains a wide range of software, including [[Bash (Unix shell)|BASH]] (command shell and scripting environment comparable to the Windows Powershell), the [[GNU compilier collection]] (gcc) with the complete tool chain.  In addition, the 'usual and customary' programming languages installed with a [[Linux distribution]], including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Tcl/Tk]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] are available, along with multiple development libraries.

:In addition to BASH, the [[GNU Utilities]] (e.g. [[Find utilities]], such as [[Locate (Unix)|Locate]], [[Find (Unix)|Find]], [[Grep]]) are installed by default.  Hundreds of other software packages are included, many with non-POSIX Windows implementation, such as database management systems ([[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]]), web servers (e.g. [[Apache httpd]]), firewalls, text processing utilities and console mode applications.  In addition, there is a (reasonably stable) X.org/X11 implementation with GTK and Qt libraries.  Based on these, graphic desktop managers, including GNOME, LXDE, LXQt, KDE and others (e.g. x2go) with associated graphic user applications with variable stability and functionality.

; [[Windows]]
* [[Wine (software)|WINE]]: Available for most [[POSIX]] compliant ([[Unix]]-like) operating systems, such as [[Linux]], [[BSD]], and Mac [[OSX]] ([[Darling (software)|Darling]] and  Darwine projects).  It provides a Win32 API and clean-room implementation of the associated functionality.  In contrast to Cygwin, WINE enables the installation and use of unaltered Windows software.  Considerable effort has been put into support for video games, including 3rd party extensions (e.g. Play on Linux) which provide custom Windows configurations known to work with a very large list of videogames. In addition, desktop productivity software, including MS Office, is supported.  Because of the lack of dependence on the Windows registry, inclusion of statically linked libraries, and (at least in part) historic development from open source projects, [[portable applications]], such as the [[PortableApps]] platform and the 300+ available software applications which can be downloaded with it, work with little or no issues.

==Classification of interstellar radio messages (IRMs)==
There are eleven realized IRM projects:

* [[The Morse Message (1962)|The Morse Message (1962)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/you-never-get-a-seventh-chance-to-make-a-first-impression-an-awkward-history-of-our-space-transmissions/ An Awkward History of Our Space Transmissions]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arecibo message]] (1974), one transmission to [[Messier 13]]
* [[Cosmic Call]] 1 (1999), four transmissions to nearby Sun-like stars
* [[Teen Age Message]] (2001), six transmissions
* [[Cosmic Call]] 2 (2003), five transmissions
* [[A Message From Earth]] (2008), one transmission to the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]]
* [[Across the Universe (message)|Across the Universe]] (2008)
* [[Hello From Earth]] (HFE, 2009) one transmission to the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]]
* Wow! Reply (2012), three transmissions to Hipparcos 34511, Hipparcos 33277 and Hipparcos 43587 in reply to the [[Wow! signal]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/08/15/158827877/will-e-t-hear-us-reply-to-wow-signal-gets-beamed-into-space-today/ Reply To 'WOW! Signal' Gets Beamed Into Space]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lone Signal]] (2013)
* [[A simple response to an elemental message|A Simple Response to an Elemental Message]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Simple Response|url=http://blogs.esa.int/rocketscience/2016/07/28/a-simple-response|website=European Space Agency official website|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2016)

The [[Across the Universe (message)|Across the Universe]] message, [[A simple response to an elemental message|A Simple Response to an Elemental Message]] and [[Hello From Earth]] are not always considered serious. The first two of them were sent to Polaris, which is 431 light years distant from us and whose planetary system, even if it exists, may not be suited for life, because it is a supergiant star, spectral type F7Ib which is only 70 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wielen, R.; Jahreiß, H.; Dettbarn, C.; Lenhardt, H.; Schwan, H.|title=Polaris: Astrometric orbit, position, and proper motion|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2000|volume=360|page=399|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0002406.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2017|arxiv=astro-ph/0002406|bibcode=2000A&amp;A...360..399W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, both transmission rates were very high, about 128 kbit/s, for such moderate transmitter power (about 18&amp;nbsp;kW). The main defect of the "Hello From Earth" is an insufficient scientific and technical justification, since no famous [[SETI]] scientist made statements with validation of HFE's design. As it follows from [https://web.archive.org/web/20100211005300/http://www.hellofromearth.net/gliese581d/links/index.htm]: ''"After the final message was collected on Monday 24 August 2009, messages were exported as a text file and sent to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where they were encoded into binary, packaged and tested before transmission"'', but nobody explained why he hopes that such encoded and packaged text will be understood and conceived by possible extraterrestrials.

Some use the term ''[[Active SETI]] Project'', but [[Alexander Zaitsev (scientist)|Alexander Zaitsev]], who was a scientific head of composing and transmissions of [[Cosmic Call]] 1999 &amp; 2003, and [[Teen Age Message]] 2001, and a scientific consultant of [[A Message From Earth]], emphasized that he considers above IRMs as the METI (''[[Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] Projects'').

These seven messages have targeted stars between 20 and 69 light-years from the Earth. The exception is the Arecibo message, which targeted [[globular cluster M13]], approximately 24,000 light-years away. The first message to reach its destination will be [[A Message From Earth]], which should reach the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]] in [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] in 2029.

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [[Geoffrey Marcy]], [[Seth Shostak]], [[Frank Drake]], [[Elon Musk]] and [[David Brin]]) at a convention of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], discussed [[Active SETI]] and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the [[Cosmos]] was a good idea;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150213"&gt;{{cite news |author=Borenstein, Seth (of [[AP News]]) |title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19994">In [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], the mass [[moment of inertia]], usually denoted by {{mvar|I}}, measures the extent to which an object resists rotational acceleration about a particular axis, and is the rotational analogue to mass. Mass moments of inertia have [[physical unit|units]] of [[dimensional analysis|dimension]] ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;([mass] × [length]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It should not be confused with the [[second moment of area]], which is used in beam calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the rotational inertia, and sometimes as the angular mass.

For simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment of inertia in an exact [[closed-form expression]]. Typically this occurs when the [[mass density]] is constant, but in some cases the density can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be straightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with more complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. When calculating moments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function and exploit the [[parallel axis theorem|parallel axis]] and [[perpendicular axis theorem]]s.

This article mainly considers symmetric mass distributions, with constant density throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through the [[center of mass]] unless otherwise specified.

==Moments of inertia==

Following are scalar moments of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia is a tensor, see below.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Description || Figure || Moment(s) of inertia
|-
| Point mass ''M'' at a distance ''r'' from the axis of rotation.

A point mass does not have a moment of inertia around its own axis, but using the [[parallel axis theorem]] a moment of inertia around a distant axis of rotation is achieved.

|align="center"|[[File:PointInertia.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt; I = M r^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Two point masses, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[reduced mass]] ''μ'' and separated by a distance ''x'', about an axis passing through the center of mass of the system and perpendicular to the line joining the two particles.
|align="center"|[[File:MOIaboutCOMaxis2.svg|frameless|upright]]
|&lt;math&gt; I = \frac{ m_1 m_2 }{ m_1 \! + \! m_2 } x^2 = \mu x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] of length ''L'' and mass ''m'', rotating about its center.

This expression assumes that the rod is an infinitely thin (but rigid) wire. This is a special case of the thin rectangular plate with axis of rotation at the center of the plate, with ''w'' = ''L'' and ''h'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia rod center.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{center} = \frac{1}{12} m L^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="serway"/&gt;
|-
| [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] of length ''L'' and mass ''m'', rotating about one end.

This expression assumes that the rod is an infinitely thin (but rigid) wire. This is also a special case of the thin rectangular plate with axis of rotation at the end of the plate, with ''h'' = ''L'' and ''w'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia rod end.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{end} = \frac{1}{3} m L^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="serway"/&gt;
|-
| Thin circular loop of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This is a special case of a [[torus]] for ''a'' = 0 (see below), as well as of a thick-walled cylindrical tube with open ends, with ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia hoop.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_z = m r^2\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{1}{2} m r^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Thin, solid [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This is a special case of the solid cylinder, with ''h'' = 0. That &lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{I_z}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a consequence of the [[perpendicular axis theorem]].

|align="center"| [[File:moment of inertia disc.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_z = \frac{1}{2}m r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{1}{4} m r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Thin [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] shell with open ends, of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This expression assumes that the shell thickness is negligible. It is a special case of the thick-walled cylindrical tube for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Also, a point mass ''m'' at the end of a rod of length ''r'' has this same moment of inertia and the value ''r'' is called the [[radius of gyration]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- There is no such thing as an illegal set of axes. They may be invalid for some purposes but the x, y and z may just be labels. The right-hand rule has no bearing here.
the x-y-z axis for the solid cylinder does not follow the right-hand rule and is an illegal set of axis. --&gt;
&lt;!--'force at centre of mass always subjects to transational motion. but force at axis ofrotation is not 100% giving rise to transational motion.' - Gibberish! Hopefully, someone can translate this into something meaningful (and get spelling correct).--&gt;

== List of 3D inertia tensors ==

This list of [[Moment of inertia#The inertia tensor|moment of inertia tensor]]s is given for [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] of each object.

To obtain the scalar moments of inertia '''I''' above, the tensor moment of inertia '''I''' is projected along some axis defined by a [[unit vector]] '''n''' according to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{n}\equiv n_i I_{ij} n_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the dots indicate [[tensor contraction]] and the [[Einstein summation convention]] is used. In the above table, '''n''' would be the unit [[Cartesian coordinate system#Representing a vector in the standard basis|Cartesian basis]] '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain ''I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively.

'''Lucien Cayeux''' (26 March 1864&amp;ndash;1 November 1944) was a [[France|French]] [[sedimentary]] [[petrography|petrographer]].

In 1902, he joined the ''l'Ecole des Mines'' and become a professor of geology. In 1912, he was named as professor of geology at the [[Collège de France]]. He was admitted to the [[Académie des Sciences]] in 1928.

He is noted for his study of sediments with the [[Polarization (waves)|polarizing]] [[microscope]], and was one of the pioneers in this field.

The [[wrinkle ridge]] [[Dorsum Cayeux]] on the moon is named after him.

==''Applications of Metamaterials''==

''Applications of Metamaterials'' is the second volume of the ''Metamaterials Handbook''. This book derives its organization for discussion of its topics from the previous volume. Theory, modeling, and basic properties of [[metamaterial]]s that were explored in the first volume, are now shown how they work when applied. Devices based on electromagnetic metamaterials continue to expand understanding of  [[principle]]s and modeling begun in the first volume. The applications for metamaterials are shown to be wide-ranging, encompassing [[electronics]], [[telecommunication]]s, sensing, medical instrumentation, and data storage. This book also discusses the key domains of where metamaterials have already been developed.

The material in this book is obtained from highly regarded sources, such as many scientific, [[peer review]]ed, journal articles.&lt;ref name=Columbia-U2&gt;

'''Mining engineering''' is an [[engineering]] discipline that applies science and technology to the extraction of [[mineral]]s from the earth. Mining engineering is associated with many other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[mineral processing]] and [[metallurgy]], [[geotechnical engineering]] and [[surveying]]. A mining engineer may manage any phase of mining operations – from exploration and discovery of the mineral resource, through [[feasibility study]], mine design, development of plans, [[production (economics)|production]] and operations to [[mine closure]].

With the process of [[Mineral extraction]], some amount of [[waste]] and uneconomic material are generated which are the primary source of [[pollution]] in the vicinity of mines. Mining activities by their nature cause a disturbance of the [[natural environment]] in and around which the [[minerals]] are located. [[Mining]] engineers must therefore be concerned not only with the production and processing of mineral [[commodities]], but also with the mitigation of damage to the environment both during and after mining as a result of the change in the mining area.

==History of mining engineering==
From [[prehistoric]] times to the present, [[mining]] has played a significant role in the existence of the [[human race]]. Since the beginning of civilization people have used [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[ceramic]]s and, later, [[metal]]s found on or close to the [[Earth|Earth's]] surface. These were used to manufacture early [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s. For example, high quality [[flint]] found in northern [[France]] and southern [[England]] were used to set [[fire]] and break rock.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Howard L. ''SME Mining Engineering Handbook'', Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration Inc, 1992, p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Flint mines have been found in [[chalk]] areas where seams of the stone were followed underground by shafts and galleries. The oldest known mine on archaeological record is the "Lion Cave" in [[Swaziland]]. At this site, which [[radiocarbon dating]] indicates to be about 43,000 years old, [[paleolithic]] humans mined mineral [[hematite]], which contained [[iron]] and was ground to produce the red [[pigment]] [[ochre]].&lt;ref&gt;Swaziland Natural Trust Commission, "Cultural Resources – Malolotja Archaeology, Lion Cavern," Retrieved Aug. 27, 2007, {{cite web|url=http://www.sntc.org.sz/cultural/malarch.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221001/http://www.sntc.org.sz/cultural/malarch.asp |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peace Parks Foundation, "Major Features: Cultural Importance." Republic of South Africa: Author. Retrieved Aug. 27, 2007, [http://www.peaceparks.org/story.php?mid=168&amp;pid=148].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] were innovators of [[mining]] engineering. They developed large scale mining methods, such as the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] for [[hydraulic mining]]. The exposed rock was then attacked by [[fire-setting]] where fires were used to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The [[thermal shock]] cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed. In some mines the Romans utilized water-powered machinery such as [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s. These were used extensively in the [[copper]] mines at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs, lifting water about {{convert|80|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/raw_mining.htm ''The Romans in Britain: mining''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720073131/http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/raw_mining.htm |date=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[gun powder|Black powder]] was first used in mining in [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (present-day [[Slovakia]]) in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;Heiss, A.G. &amp; Oeggl, K. (2008). Analysis of the fuel wood used in Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age copper mining sites of the Schwaz and Brixlegg area (Tyrol, Austria). ''Vegetation History and Archaeobotany'' 17(2):211–221, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-007-0096-8].&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins, which was much faster than fire-setting. The [[Industrial Revolution]] saw further advances in mining technologies, including improved explosives and [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] pumps, lifts, and drills as long as they remained safe.

==Education==
[[File:Coloradosm.png|1,200 × 800 px|thumb|Students outside [[Colorado School of Mines]] campus]]
There are many ways to become a [[Mining Engineer]] but all include a university degree in [[Mining Engineering]]. Primarily, training includes a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (B.Eng. or B.E.), [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc. or B.S.), [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech.) or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (B.A.Sc.) in Mining Engineering. Depending on the country and jurisdiction, to be licensed as a mining engineer a [[Master's]] degree; [[Master of Engineering]] (M.Eng.), [[Master of Science]] (M.Sc or M.S.) or [[Master of Applied Science]] (M.A.Sc.) maybe required.
There are also mining engineers who have come from other disciplines e.g. from engineering fields like [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Civil Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Geomatics Engineering]], [[Environmental Engineering]] or from science fields like [[Geology]], [[Geophysics]], [[Physics]], [[Geomatics]], [[Earth Science]], [[Mathematics]], However, this path requires taking a [[graduate diploma|graduate]] degree such as M.Eng, M.S., M.Sc. or M.A.Sc. in Mining Engineering after graduating from a different [[quantitative research|quantitative]] [[undergraduate]] program in order to be qualified as a mining engineer.

The fundamental subjects of mining engineering study usually include:
*[[Mathematics]]; [[Calculus]], [[Algebra]], [[Differential Equations]], [[Numerical Analysis]]
*[[Geoscience]]; [[Geochemistry]], [[Geophysics]], [[Mineralogy]], [[Geomatics]]
*[[Mechanics]]; [[Rock mechanics]], [[Soil Mechanics]], [[Geomechanics]]

Some Mining Engineers go on to pursue [[Doctorate]] degree programs such as [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D., DPhil), [[Doctor of Engineering]] (D.Eng., Eng.D.) these programs involve a very significant original research component and are usually seen as entry points into [[Academia]].

==Salary and statistics==
Mining salaries are usually determined by the level of skill required, where the position is, and what kind of organization the engineer is working for.{{cn|date=May 2017}} When comparing salaries from one region to another, cost of living and other factors need to be taken into consideration.

Mining engineers in [[India]] earn relatively high salaries in comparison to many other professions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://careerminer.infomine.com/geologist-and-mining-engineer-salaries-in-india/ |title=Geologist and Mining Engineer salaries in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average salary of $15,250. However, in comparison to mining engineer salaries in other regions, such as Canada, the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, Indian salaries are low.  In the [[United States]], there are an estimated 6,150 employed mining engineers, with a mean yearly salary of U.S. $103,710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172151.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2017 – 17-2151 Mining and Geological Engineers, Including Mining Safety Engineers |date=May 20, 2018 |work=Occupational Employment Statistics |publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] |accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-mining==
[[File:The Prospector NC Wyeth.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Prospector'' by [[N. C. Wyeth]], 1906]]
Mineral exploration is the process of finding [[ore]]s (commercially viable concentrations of minerals) to [[mining|mine]]. Mineral exploration is a much more intensive, organized and professional form of mineral [[prospecting]] and, though it frequently uses the services of prospecting, the process of mineral exploration on the whole is much more involved.

The foremost stage of mining starts with the process of finding and exploration of the mineral deposit. In the initial process of mineral exploration, however, the role of [[geologists]] and [[surveying|surveyors]] is prominent in the [[pre-feasibility study]] of the future mining operation. Mineral exploration and estimation of reserve through various prospecting methods are done to determine the method and type of mining in addition to profitability condition.

===Mineral discovery===
Once a mineral discovery has been made, and has been determined to be of sufficient economic quality to mine, mining engineers will then work on developing a plan to mine this effectively and efficiently.

The discovery can be made from research of mineral maps, academic geological reports or local, state, and national geological reports. Other sources of information include property assays, well drilling logs, and local word of mouth. Mineral research may also include satellite and airborne photographs. Unless the mineral exploration is done on public property, the owners of the property may play a significant role in the exploration process, and may be the original discoverer of the mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Wiliam C, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Geologic Prospecting and Exploration," pgs. 221–225, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mineral determination===
After a prospective mineral is located, the mining geologist and/or mining engineer then determines the ore properties. This may involve chemical analysis of the ore to determine the composition of the sample. Once the mineral properties are identified, the next step is determining the quantity of the ore. This involves determining the extent of the deposit as well as the purity of the ore.&lt;ref&gt;Gumble, Gordon E, Et al. SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Sample Preparation and Assaying", pgs 327–332, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geologist drills additional core samples to find the limits of the deposit or seam and calculates the quantity of valuable material present in the deposit.

===Feasibility study===
{{Main|Mining feasibility study}}
Once the mineral identification and reserve amount is reasonably determined, the next step is to determine the [[feasibility study|feasibility]] of recovering the mineral deposit. A preliminary study shortly after the discovery of the deposit examines the market conditions such as the supply and demand of the mineral, the amount of ore needed to be moved to recover a certain quantity of that mineral as well as analysis of the cost associated with the operation. This pre-feasibility study determines whether the mining project is likely to be profitable; if it is then a more in-depth analysis of the deposit is undertaken. After the full extent of the ore body is known and has been examined by engineers, the feasibility study examines the cost of initial capital investment, methods of extraction, the cost of operation, an estimated length of time to payback, the gross revenue and net [[profit margin]], any possible resale price of the land, the total life of the reserve, the total value of the reserve, investment in future projects, and the property owner or owners' contract. In addition, environmental impact, reclamation, possible legal ramifications and all government permitting are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Gentry Donald W., SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Mine Evaluation and Investment Analysis", pgs 387–389, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, T. Alan and Stanley C. Suboleski, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Costs and Cost Estimation", pgs 405–408, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steps of analysis determine whether the mine company should proceed with the extraction of the minerals or whether the project should be abandoned. The mining company may decide to sell the rights to the reserve to a third party rather than develop it themselves, or the decision to proceed with extraction may be postponed indefinitely until market conditions become favorable.

==Mining operation==
Mining engineers working in an established mine may work as an engineer for operations improvement, further [[mineral exploration]], and operation capitalization by determining where in the mine to add equipment and personnel. The engineer may also work in supervision and management, or as an equipment and mineral salesperson. In addition to engineering and operations, the &lt;nowiki&gt;mining engineer&lt;/nowiki&gt; may work as an environmental, health and safety manager or design engineer.

The act of mining required different methods of extraction depending on the [[mineralogy]], [[geology]], and location of the resources. Characteristics such as [[mineral hardness]], the mineral [[stratum|stratification]], and access to that mineral will determine the method of extraction.

Generally, mining is either done from the surface or underground. Mining can also occur with both surface and underground operations taking place on the same reserve. Mining activity varies as to what method is employed to remove the mineral.

===Surface mining===
[[Surface mining]] comprises 90% of the world's mineral tonnage output. Also called [[Open-pit mining|open pit mining]], surface mining is removing minerals in formations that are at or near the surface. Ore retrieval is done by material removal from the land in its natural state. Surface mining often alters the land characteristics, shape, [[topography]], and geological make-up.

Surface mining involves quarrying which is excavating minerals by means of machinery such as cutting, cleaving, and breaking. [[Explosives]] are usually used to facilitate breakage. Hard rocks such as limestone, sand, gravel, and slate are generally quarried into a series of benches.

Strip mining is done on softer minerals such as clays and phosphate are removed through use of mechanical shovels, track dozers, and front end loaders. Softer Coal seams can also be extracted this way.

With [[placer mining]], minerals can also be removed from the bottoms of lakes, rivers, streams, and even the ocean by dredge mining. In addition, [[in-situ]] mining can be done from the surface using dissolving agents on the ore body and retrieving the ore via pumping. The pumped material is then set to leach for further processing. Hydraulic mining is utilized in forms of water jets to wash away either overburden or the ore itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Bohnet, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 2, C1992, "Surface Mining: Comparison of Methods", pgs 1529–1538, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining process===
Blasting:&lt;br&gt;
[[Explosive]]s are used to break up a rock formation and aid in the collection of [[ore]] in a process called [[Rock blasting|blasting]].  Blasting utilizes the heat and immense pressure of the detonated explosives to shatter and fracture a rock mass. The type of explosives used in mining are [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosives]] which vary in composition and performance properties.  The mining engineer is responsible for the selection and proper placement of these explosives, in order to maximize efficiency and safety.  Blasting occurs in many phases of the mining process, such as development of infrastructure as well as production of the ore.

Leaching:&lt;br&gt;
[[Leaching (metallurgy)|Leaching]] is the loss or extraction of certain materials from a carrier into a liquid (usually, but not always a solvent). Mostly used in rare-earth metals extraction.

Flotation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Froth flotation#Mining|Flotation]] (also spelled floatation) involves phenomena related to the relative buoyancy of minerals.It is the most widely used metal separate method.

Electrostatic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Electrostatic separator|Separating]] minerals by electro-characteristic differences.

Gravity separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Gravity separation]] is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical.

Magnetic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Magnetic separation]] is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. 

Hydraulic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Hydraulic separation]] is a process that using the density difference to separate minerals. Before hydraulic separation, minerals were crushed into uniform size; because minerals have uniform size and different density will have different settling velocities in water, and that can be used to separate target minerals.

==Mining health and safety==
{{globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}
{{Main|Mine Safety and Health Administration}}
Legal attention to Mining Health and Safety began in the late 19th century and in the subsequent 20th century progressed to a comprehensive and stringent codification of enforcement and mandatory health and safety regulation. A mining engineer in whatever role they occupy must follow all federal, state, and local mine safety laws.

===United States===
{{Main|Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977}}
The United States Congress, through the passage of the Federal [[Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977]], known as the Miner's Act, created the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) under the [[US Department of Labor]].

This comprehensive Act provides miners with rights against retaliation for reporting violations, consolidated regulation of coal mines with metallic and nonmetallic mines, and created the independent [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission]] to review MSHA's reported violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/MSHAINF2.HTM|title=History of Mine Safety and Health Legislation|author=|date=|website=www.msha.gov|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act as codified in Code of Federal Regulations § 30 (CFR § 30) covers all miners at an active mine. When a mining engineer works at an active mine he or she is subject to the same rights, violations, mandatory health and safety regulations, and mandatory training as any other worker at the mine. The mining engineer can be legally identified as a "miner."&lt;ref&gt;20 CFR § 46.2(g)(1)(i)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act establishes the rights of miners. The miner may report at any time a hazardous condition and request an inspection. The miners may elect a miners' representative to participate during an inspection, pre-inspection meeting, and post-inspection conference. The miners and miners' representative shall be paid for their time during all inspections and investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, § 103(f) and (g)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining and the environment==
===United States===
{{globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}

Land reclamation is regulated for surface and underground mines according to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The law creates as a part of the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Surface Mining (OSM). OSM states on their website, “OSM is charged with balancing the nation’s need for continued domestic coal production with protection of the environment.”

The law requires that states set up their own Reclamation Departments and legislate laws related to reclamation for coal mining operations. The states may impose additional regulations and regulate other minerals in addition to coal for land reclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmre.gov/AboutUs.htm|title=Your Page Was Not Found on the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Website|author=|date=|website=www.osmre.gov|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies and practices==
Skilled [[software]] engineers use technologies and practices from a variety of fields to improve their productivity in creating software and to improve the quality of the delivered product.

=== Software applications ===
[[Software]] engineers build [[software]] ([[Application software|applications]], [[operating systems]], [[system software]]) that people use.

Applications influence software engineering by pressuring developers to solve problems in new ways. For example, consumer software emphasizes low cost, medical software emphasizes high quality, and Internet commerce software emphasizes rapid development.

Introduction to electronic circuit design. Upper Saddle River NJ: Prentice Hall/Pearson Education. pp. 661. {{isbn|0-201-36183-3}}. http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-201-36183-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Araki, M., PID Control, http://www.eolss.net/ebooks/Sample%20Chapters/C18/E6-43-03-03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Horowitz &amp; W. Hill The Art of Electronics Cambridge University Press (1980) Chapter 3, relating to operational amplifiers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parasitic oscillation is undesirable for several reasons.   The oscillations may be coupled into other circuits or radiate as [[radio wave]]s, causing [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) to other devices.  In audio systems, parasitic oscillations can sometimes be heard as annoying sounds in the speakers or earphones.  The oscillations waste power and may cause undesirable heating. For example, an audio power amplifier that goes into parasitic oscillation may generate enough power to damage connected [[Loudspeaker|speakers]]. A circuit that is oscillating will not amplify linearly, so desired signals passing through the stage will be distorted. In digital circuits, parasitic oscillations may only occur on particular logic transitions and may result in erratic operation of subsequent stages; for example, a counter stage may see many spurious pulses and count erratically.

==Causes of parasitic oscillation==
Parasitic oscillation in an amplifier stage occurs when part of the output energy is coupled into the input, with the correct phase and amplitude to provide positive feedback at some frequency.  The coupling can occur directly between input and output wiring with stray [[capacitance]] or mutual [[inductance]] between input and output. In some solid-state or vacuum electron devices there is sufficient internal capacitance to provide a feedback path.  Since the [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] is common to both input and output, output current flowing through the impedance of the ground connection can also couple signals back to the input.

Similarly, impedance in the power supply can couple input to output and cause oscillation. 
When a common power supply is used for several stages of amplification, the supply voltage  may vary with the changing current in the output stage. The power supply voltage changes will appear in the input stage as positive feedback. An example is a [[transistor radio]] which plays well with a fresh battery, but squeals or "[[Motorboating (electronics)|motorboats]]" when the battery is old. 

In audio systems, if a microphone is placed close to a loudspeaker, parasitic oscillations may occur. This is caused by positive feedback, from amplifier's output to loudspeaker to sound waves, and back via the microphone to the amplifier input. See [[Audio feedback]].

==Conditions for parasitic oscillations==
Feedback [[control theory]] developed to address the problem of parasitic oscillation in [[Servomechanism|servo]] control systems &amp;ndash; the system oscillated rather than performing their intended function, for example velocity control in engines. The [[Barkhausen stability criterion]] gives the necessary condition for oscillation; the [[loop gain]] around the feedback loop, which is equal to the amplifier [[gain (electronics)|gain]] multiplied by the [[transfer function]] of the inadvertent feedback path, must be equal to one, and the [[phase shift]] around the loop must be zero or a multiple of 360° (2π [[radian]]s). 

In practice, feedback may occur over a range of frequencies (for example the operating range of an amplifier); at various frequencies, the phase of the amplifier may be different. If there is one frequency where the feedback is positive and the amplitude condition is also fulfilled &amp;ndash; the system will oscillate at that frequency.

These conditions can be expressed in mathematical terms using the [[Nyquist plot]].  Another method used in control loop theory uses [[Bode plot]]s of gain and phase vs. frequency.  Using Bode plots, a design engineer checks whether there is a frequency where both conditions for oscillations are met: the phase is zero ([[positive feedback]]) and the loop gain is 1 or greater.

When parasitic oscillations occur, the designer can use the various tools of control loop engineering to correct the situation &amp;ndash; to reduce the gain or to change the phase at problematic frequencies.

==Mitigation==
Several measures are used to prevent parasitic oscillation. Amplifier circuits are laid out so that input and output wiring are not adjacent, preventing capacitive or inductive coupling. A metal shield may be placed over sensitive portions of the circuit. [[Decoupling capacitor|Bypass capacitors]] may be put at power supply connections, to provide a low-impedance path for [[Alternating current|AC]] signals and prevent interstage coupling through the power supply. Where [[printed circuit board]]s are used, high- and low-power stages are separated and ground return traces are arranged so that heavy currents don't flow in mutually shared portions of the ground trace. In some cases the problem may only be solved by introduction of another feedback ''neutralization'' network, calculated and adjusted to eliminate the negative feedback within the passband of the amplifying device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3842">'''Polymer engineering''' is generally an [[engineering]] field that designs, analyses, or modifies polymer materials. Polymer engineering covers aspects of the [[petrochemical industry]], [[polymerization]], structure and characterization of polymers, properties of polymers, [[compounding]] and processing of polymers and description of major polymers, structure property relations and applications.

==Materials==
The basic division of polymers into [[thermoplastics]], [[elastomers]] and [[thermosets]] helps define their areas of application. The latter group of materials includes [[phenolic resin]]s, [[polyester]]s and [[epoxy resin]]s, all of which are used widely in [[composite material]]s when reinforced with stiff fibres such as [[fibreglass]] and [[aramid]]s. Since [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] stabilises the [[thermoset polymer matrix]] of these materials, they have physical properties more similar to traditional engineering materials like [[steel]]. However, their very much lower densities compared with metals makes them ideal for lightweight structures. In addition, they suffer less from [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], so are ideal for [[safety-critical]] parts which are stressed regularly in service.

Thermoplastics have relatively low [[Young's modulus|tensile moduli]], but also have lower densities and properties such as [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] which make them ideal for [[consumer product]]s and [[medical product]]s. They include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]], [[acetal resin]], [[polycarbonate]] and [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], all of which are widely used materials.

[[Elastomer]]s are polymers which have very low moduli and show reversible extension when strained, a valuable property for vibration absorption and damping. They may either be thermoplastic (in which case they are known as [[Thermoplastic elastomer]]s) or crosslinked, as in most conventional rubber products such as [[tyres]]. Typical rubbers used conventionally include [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]], [[polychloroprene]], [[polybutadiene]], [[styrene-butadiene]] and fluorinated rubbers.

==Applications==
[[Image:USAF B-2 Spirit.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].]]
[[File:Cyclist itt cyfac(2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|A time-trial [[carbon fibre]] composite bicycle with aerodynamic wheels and aero bars]]
Typical uses of composites are [[monocoque]] structures for [[aerospace]] and [[automobile]]s, as well as more mundane products like [[fishing rod]]s and [[bicycle]]s. The [[stealth bomber]] was the first all-composite aircraft, but many passenger aircraft like the [[Airbus]] and the [[Boeing 787]] use an increasing proportion of composites in their fuselages, such as hydrophobic [[melamine foam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.polytechinc.com/news/08232013-recognized-by-theboeingcompany&lt;/ref&gt; The quite different physical properties of composites gives designers a much greater freedom in shaping parts, which is why composite products often look different to conventional products. On the other hand, some products such as [[drive shaft]]s, [[helicopter]] rotor blades, and [[propeller]]s look identical to metal precursors owing to the basic functional needs of such components.

China: Wadsworth Group.&lt;/ref&gt;  The processes of predicted outcome value directly link to continued relationship development and communication as well as stronger attraction and intimacy within the relationship.

Predicted outcome value theory proposes that initial interaction behaviors serve two related functions in individuals' attempts to maximize future relational outcomes. First, communication is directed at reducing uncertainty (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975) about new acquaintances to determine likely outcome-values for the relational future. Second, communication proceeds in a manner predicted to result in the most positive outcomes. In a broad sense, these outcome value predictions would lead to communicative attempts to terminate or curtail the conversation, to continue the entry-level conversation, or to escalate the conversation and relationship beyond this level. Attempts to continue or escalate would result from positive predicted outcome values, while attempts to terminate or curtail would result from negative predictions. Given this, predicted outcome value theory proposes that several specific behaviors associated with conversational termination-escalation should be related to predicted outcome value levels.
Among these, Sunnafrank (1986) posits that predicted outcome value is positively related to amount of verbal communication, intimacy level of communication content, nonverbal affiliative expressiveness, and liking.&lt;ref name="Sunnafrank, Michael 1988"&gt;Sunnafrank, Michael (1988). "Predicted Outcome Value in Initial Conversations." Communication Research Reports, Vol 5. No 2, 169-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key propositions of predicted outcome value theory==

1. Attraction increases as the predicted outcome value increases&lt;br /&gt;
2. Prediction of positive future outcomes leads to future [[interactions]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Prediction of negative future outcomes ends future interactions&lt;br /&gt;
4. People focus and discuss topics in conversations that facilitate positive predicted outcomes&lt;ref name=Berger1&gt;Berger, C., Roloff, M., &amp; Roskos-Ewoldsen, D. (2010). The handbook of communication science. (2nd Edition). London: Sage Publication, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related==
Predicted outcome value theory is an alternative to [[uncertainty reduction theory]], which [[Charles Berger (academic)|Charles R. Berger]] and Richard J. Calabrese introduced in 1975. Uncertainty reduction theory states that the driving force in initial interactions is to collect information to predict [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behaviors]] for future relationship development.

Sunnafrank challenges [[uncertainty]] reduction theory with his predicted outcome value theory in that initial interactions are not solely about reducing uncertainty within the relationship but motivated by the predicted outcome value. Sunnafrank ascertains that initial interactions only lead to continued relationship development after the person has determined future rewards and costs of that relationship.

==Theory developer==
Michael Sunnafrank is a Professor in the Department of Communication, College of Liberal Arts at the [[University of Minnesota, Duluth]]. He joined the faculty at UMD in 1990 after fourteen years of teaching and research at [[Michigan State University]], [[University of California Davis]], [[Arizona State University]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. He was awarded his PhD and master's degrees by Michigan State University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.d.umn.edu/comm/facultystaff/msunnafrank.php&lt;/ref&gt;
Sunnafrank continues to work on research testing predicted outcome value theory.

==Empirical support for predicted outcome value theory==
Sunnafrank's (1986) study examined a potential initial acquaintance association between perceived similarity and attraction may be present, though undetected, in previous interpersonal goals research and finds support for interpersonal goals claims regarding the perceived similarity/attraction relationship.
The findings extended Sunnafrank (1983, 1984, 1985) and Sunnafrank and Miller's (1981) claim that attitude similarity and attraction are unassociated in beginning communicative relationships. While their research supports this claim for attitude similarity revealed in pre-acquaintance, it also shows that this claim generalizes to more normally occurring perceptions of attitude similarity produced during initial relational stages. The results strongly suggested that traditional beliefs about, and theoretical interpretations of, the attitude similarity/attraction association are incorrect, at least regarding the initial acquaintance period.&lt;ref&gt;Sunnafrank, Michael (Spring 1986). "Communicative Influences on Perceived Similarity and Attraction: An Expansion of the Interpersonal
Goals Perspective." ''The Western Journal of Speech Communication,'' 50, 158-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study, "Predicted Outcome Value in Initial Conversations", provided the initial test of several predicted outcome value theory (Sunnafrank, 1986) propositions. Findings supported all hypotheses tested, and demonstrated that during initial conversations predicted outcome value is strongly and positively related to the amount of verbal communication, intimacy of communication content, nonverbal affiliation, liking and perceived similarity.&lt;ref name="Sunnafrank, Michael 1988"/&gt;

More recent research was designed to investigate positive and negative predictors of possible relationships by focusing on decisions to engage in future dates. [[Interpersonal attraction]], [[homophily]], and nonverbal immediacy have been linked to the predicted outcome value of relationships during initial encounters. This study investigates how these variables influence date decisions in a six-minute speed-dating experience. Results indicated [[interpersonal attraction]] and nonverbal immediacy significantly predict predicted outcome value, but not future date decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Marian L. Horan, Sean M. Furler, Lisa A. (2008). "Dating in the fast lane: How communication predicts speed-dating success." ''[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]'', Vol. 25, No. 5, 749-768.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featured research and theory development==

Michael Sunnafrank and Artemio Ramirez Jr., assistant professor of communication at [[Ohio State University]], conducted research which was published in the ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'' in 2004 and also featured on [[ABC news]]. Sunnafrank and Ramirez studied 164 college freshmen over a nine-week period to determine the predicted outcome value of relationship development between strangers.&lt;ref name =Sunnafrank&gt;Sunnafrank, M. &amp; Ramirez, A., (2004). "At First Sight: Persistent Relational Effects of Get-Acquainted Conversations.” ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'', Vol. 21. pp. 361-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study involved pairing two students of the same [[sex]] together the first day of class and introducing one another and then engaging in [[conversation]] for either three, six, or 10 minutes.  Afterwards, researchers asked each student to predict the outcome of the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] by describing it as a nodding [[acquaintance]], casual acquaintance, acquaintance, close acquaintance, friend, and close friend.   The students also completed extensive questionnaires about the other person to determine how much they liked one another (Sunnafrank &amp; Ramirez, 2004).

Over the nine-week period, Sunnafrank and Ramirez (2004) facilitated a classroom environment that allowed the students to continue to get to know one another. At the end of the nine weeks, those students who predicted positive outcomes developed strong relationships and their [[behavior]] indicated such as those students sat together in class and communicated on a regular basis. The strongest effect of the study existed in the relationships where there was a predicted negative outcome.  If students decided after the initial [[interaction]] that they did not want the relationship to progress then the students acted accordingly by restricting conversation, avoiding [[eye contact]], and avoiding each other period.
 
Ramirez points out that there is power in first impressions. “People want to quickly determine if a person they just met is someone they are going to want to hang out with, or date, or spend more time with in the future. We don’t want to waste our time.”&lt;ref name =Grabmeier&gt;Grabmeier, J. (2004). "First 10 minutes after meeting may guide future of relationship". Research Communications. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University. http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/1stimpre.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One important point to consider about this study is that Sunnafrank says that college freshmen can be “aggressive” in pursuing new friendships and relationships within social circles and that behavior tends to change over time. “In most situations in life, our time is pretty much claimed by work and family matters, so even when you meet people you really like, chances are not much is going to happen.  As life goes on and social networks become solidified, acting on that first impression becomes less likely.”&lt;ref name =Dye&gt;Dye, L. (2004). "First impressions really matter". ABCNEWS.COM. http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=69942&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnafrank concluded that other events throughout the course of relationships can change the predicted outcome value, which he calls “surprising events,” such as betraying one another’s trust by “back stabbing” and that not all relationships turn out as originally predicted. However, in this study, it is apparent that initial impressions and interactions can determine the outcome of the relationship, which is the predicted outcome value theory. While the college freshmen had numerous opportunities to develop their relationships over the nine-week period, the first impressions made lasting impacts.

It is the last traditional microscope manufacturer and has survived from the one thriving British Microscope Industry serviced by well known manufacturers such as [[Vickers]], [[W. Watson and Son|W.Watson and Son]], Baker, Charles Perry, Cooke, [[Troughton &amp; Simms]] and many others who have ceased to produce microscopes.

== History ==

=== Early History ===
W.R.Prior &amp; Co.Ltd&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/people/cp110203/w-r-prior-and-company-limited|title=W. R. Prior and Company Limited Listing|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Science Museum Collection|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. was founded by Walter Robert Prior in 1919. Many records and a collection of microscopes from the early days of the Company were lost in a fire in 1988 but some illustrated catalogues have survived which give an indication of the range of quality instruments produced by W.R.Prior over the years for the highly competitive market of the time.

W.R.Prior &amp; Co.Ltd offices were originally located at 9,10,11 Eagle Street, [[Holborn]], London and later at 28a Devonshire Street, London  W.1. Little is known about the Company during this time and no records or catalogues exist as to when and why they began to produce microscopes under the Prior name.

A W.R.Prior catalogue of microscopes and accessories dated February 1950 gives the location of the office as Devonshire Street and the factory as Bishop’s Stortford, Herts. England.(13 Northgate End) where manufacturing was carried out from 1942-1957).

=== War Time ===
The Eagle Street factory was destroyed during the London [[The Blitz|Blitz]] and the Company relocated to 13 Northgate End,[[Bishop's Stortford|Bishop Stortford]].Herts. The building occupied was a garage and work commenced producing  optical gun sights, tank periscopes, and range finders for the Ministry of Defence. No microscopes were produced during the war.

The first post war abridged catalogue includes a wood block illustration of a student “C” limb microscope with the limb engraved with the Eagle Street address.

=== Post War ===
On 10 January 1947 Walter Robert Prior died&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37938/page/1809/data.pdf|title=Newspaper Listing|last=|first=|date=|work=London Gazette|website=|archive-url=www.thegazette.co.uk|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the early age of 55.

1953 brought the start of manufacturing micromanipulators for Prior and later the micropositioner was developed. Both of these are still made to this day.

The Company relocated to a new factory at London Road, Bishop Stortford in 1956 and continued to produce and develop new microscopes. Because of the need for new universities and colleges during the post war period there was a demand for microscopes and accessories and Prior was innovative in developing instruments for this market while maintaining the pre-war quality and finish. The '''Science Master Microscope,''' introduced in 1957, was in great demand for use in schools. The established '''Prior Monocular Dissecting Microscope''' was widely supplied for educational use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co119795/dissecting-microscope-in-wooden-box-made-by-w-r-simple-dissecting-microscopes|title=Dissecting microscope in wooden box, made by W. R.|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Science Museum Collection|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The robustness and simplicity of these instruments gave many years of trouble free use.

For the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] in London 1962, Prior supplied a '''Modular [[Inverted microscope|Inverted Microscope]]''' housed in a temperature controlled cabine for cell culture examination. The provision of a cine camera enabled continuous or time lapse cine-photography to be carried out.The '''Cinemicroscope''' was also adaptable for still photography or closed circuit television. This microscope was certainly  advanced of its time and one of the fore-runners of the modern inverted microscope-now such an essential tool in cell biology and tissue culture work. A unique '''Prior Tissue Culture Chamber''' was also supplied and enabled work to be carried out when using an inverted or standard erect microscope.

=== 1970 - Present Day ===
In 1978 W.R.Prior &amp; Co.Ltd. was acquired by The Gwyndann Group of Companies and the name of the company was changed in 1979 to that of Prior Scientific Instruments Ltd.

In 1981 Prior Scientific Instruments Ltd. merged with James Swift and Son Ltd. James Swift &amp; Son was founded in 1854 and had an international reputation for producing advanced student and research polarising microscopes.The unique Swift Point Counter complimented the polarising microscope range and was sold worldwide. The James Swift factory was initially at Basingstoke, Hants. this was closed after a year and the company joined Prior Scientifc Instruments at London Road, Bishop’s Stortford.

In 1981 Prior launched a new modular series of stereomicroscopes-the S2000 series. The intention was that this instrument would replace and upgrade the Stereomaster microscope. The design had been based on that of an operating microscope featuring a long working distance it also had a tumbler rotating magnification system and a common objective. The design was a complete deviation from that of the previous Prior Greenough type microscope.

Fire at the Bishop Stortford factory in 1988 meant the company had to relocate to its present site in [[Fulbourn|Fulbourn, Cambridge, England,]] offering precision mechanical engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Jung-Hoon|date=April 2009|title=Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity|url=http://web.mit.edu/annualreports/pres09/2009.04.18.pdf|journal=Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity Report|volume=|pages=|via=Jung-Hoon Chun, Director, Professor of Mechanical Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;, optics, electronics and precision assembly.

Expanding its operation further the company opened a new office in 1991, Prior Scientific Inc, based in [[Rockland, Massachusetts|Rockland]] near Boston USA, in 2008 Prior GMBH in [[Jena]], Germany, in 2010 Prior KK in [[Tokyo|Tokyo, Japan]] and in 2018 Prior China in [[Suzhou|Suzhou China]].

The company continues to manufacture in the UK and has renewed emphasis on OEM projects, the company looks forward to celebrating its 100 year anniversary in 2019.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5049">In [[Optics|optical]] testing a '''Ronchi test''' is a method of determining the surface shape ([[Figuring|figure]]) of a mirror used in [[Optical telescope|telescopes]] and other [[Optics|optical]] devices.

==Description==
In 1923 [[Italian people|Italian]] [[physicist]] [[Vasco Ronchi]] published a description of the [[eponymous]] Ronchi test,&lt;ref&gt;V. Ronchi (1923) "Le frange di combinazioni nello studio delle superficie e dei sistemi ottici" [Combination fringes in the study of surfaces and optical systems], ''Rivista d'Ottica e Meccanica di precisione'' [Journal of Optics and Precision Mechanics], vol. 2, pages 9-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasco Ronchi (1927) "Due nuovi metodi per lo studio delle superficie e dei sistemi ottici" (Two new methods for the study of surfaces and optical systems), ''Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa - Classe di Scienze, Series 1'', vol. 15, pages 1-50.  [Note: This citation is somewhat misleading.  Ronchi first published this article in 1923, but it was included in volume 15 of ''Annali della Scuola...'', which wasn't issued until 1927.]  Available on-line (in Italian):  http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/ASNSP/ASNSP_1927_1_15_/ASNSP_1927_1_15__A1_0/ASNSP_1927_1_15__A1_0.pdf  .&lt;/ref&gt; which is a variation of the [[Foucault knife-edge test]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Foucault|L. Foucault]] (1858) [https://books.google.com/books?id=v3MbAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA958#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Description des procédés employés pour reconnaitre la configuration des surfaces optiques"] (Description of the methods used to recognize the configuration of optical surfaces), ''Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des Sciences de Paris'', vol. 47, pages 958-959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Foucault (1859) [https://books.google.com/books?id=m6Y3AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Mémoire sur la construction des télescopes en verre argenté"] (Memoir on the construction of reflecting telescopes), ''Annales de l'Observatoire impériale de Paris'', vol. 5, pages 197-237.&lt;/ref&gt; and which uses simple equipment to test the quality of optics, especially [[concave mirror]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Anderson and Russell W. Porter (1929) "Ronchi's method of optical testing," ''Astrophysical Journal'', vol. 70, pages 175-181.  Available on-line at:  http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1929ApJ....70..175A/0000175.000.html  .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masud Mansuripur (July 1997) "The Ronchi test," ''Optics &amp; Photonics News'', vol. 8, pages 42-46.  Available on-line at:  http://www.mmresearch.com/articles/article1/index.htm .&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.atm-workshop.com/ronchi-test.html]. A "Ronchi tester" consists of:
 
*A light source
*A [[Diffuser (optics)|diffuser]]
*A [[Ronchi grating]]

A Ronchi grating consists of alternate dark and clear stripes.  One design is a small frame with several evenly spaced fine wires attached.

Light is emitted through the Ronchi grating (or a single slit), reflected by the mirror being tested, then passes through the Ronchi grating again and is observed by the person doing the test.  The observer's eye is placed close to the centre of curvature of the mirror under test looking at the mirror through the grating.  The Ronchi grating is a short distance (less than 2&amp;nbsp;cm) closer to the mirror.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The observer sees the mirror covered in a pattern of stripes that reveal the shape of the mirror. The pattern is compared to a mathematically generated diagram (usually done on a computer today) of what it should look like for a given figure.  Inputs to the program are line frequency of the Ronchi grating, focal length and diameter of the mirror, and the figure required.  If the mirror is spherical, the pattern consists of straight lines.

==Applications==
The Ronchi test is used in the testing of mirrors for [[reflecting telescope]]s especially in the field of [[amateur telescope making]]. It is much faster to set up than the standard [[Foucault knife-edge test]].

The Ronchi test differs from the knife-edge test, requiring a specialized target (the Ronchi grating, which amounts to a periodic series of knife edges) and being more difficult to interpret. This procedure offers a quick evaluation of the mirror's shape and condition.  It readily identifies a 'turned edge' (rolled down outer diameter of the mirror), a common fault that can develop in [[Objective (optics)|objective]] mirror making.

The figure quality of a convex lens may be visually tested using a similar principle.  The grating is moved around the focal point of the lens while viewing the virtual image through the opposite side.  Distortions in the lens surface figure then appear as asymmetries in the periodic grating image.

A '''strangelet''' is a [[hypothetical particle]] consisting of a [[bound state]] of roughly equal numbers of [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]] [[quark]]s. An equivalent description is that a strangelet is a small fragment of [[strange matter]], small enough to be considered a particle. The size of an object composed of strange matter could, theoretically, range from a few [[Fermi (unit)|femtometers]] across (with the mass of a light nucleus) to arbitrarily large. Once the size becomes macroscopic (on the order of metres across), such an object is usually called a [[strange star]]. The term "strangelet" originates with Edward Farhi and [[Robert Jaffe|R. L. Jaffe]].&lt;ref name = 'Farhi and Jaffe'&gt;E. Farhi and R. Jaffe, "Strange Matter", [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v30/i11/p2379_1 Phys. Rev. D30, 2379 (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; Strangelets have been suggested as a [[dark matter]] candidate.&lt;ref name='Witten'/&gt;

==Theoretical possibility==

===Strange matter hypothesis===
The known particles with strange quarks are unstable because the strange quark is heavier than the up and down quarks, so strange particles, such as the [[Lambda baryon|Lambda particle]], which contains an up, down, and strange quark, always lose their strangeness, by decaying via the [[weak interaction]] to lighter particles containing only up and down quarks. But states with a larger number of quarks might not suffer from this instability. This is the "strange matter hypothesis" of Bodmer &lt;ref name='Bodmer'&gt;A. Bodmer "Collapsed Nuclei" [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v4/i6/p1601_1 Phys. Rev. D4, 1601 (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Witten|Witten]].&lt;ref name='Witten'&gt;E. Witten, "Cosmic Separation Of Phases" [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v30/i2/p272_1 Phys. Rev. D30, 272 (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, when a large enough number of quarks are collected together, the lowest energy state is one which has roughly equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks, namely a strangelet. This stability would occur because of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; having three types of quarks, rather than two as in normal nuclear matter, allows more quarks to be placed in lower energy levels.

===Relationship with nuclei===
A nucleus is a collection of a large number of up and down quarks, confined into triplets ([[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s). According to the strange matter hypothesis, strangelets are more stable than nuclei, so nuclei are expected to decay into strangelets. But this process may be extremely slow because there is a large energy barrier to overcome: as the weak interaction starts making a nucleus into a strangelet, the first few strange quarks form strange baryons, such as the Lambda, which are heavy. Only if many conversions occur almost simultaneously will the number of strange quarks reach the critical proportion required to achieve a lower energy state. This is very unlikely to happen, so even if the strange matter hypothesis were correct, nuclei would never be seen to decay to strangelets because their lifetime would be longer than the age of the universe. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Size===
The stability of strangelets depends on their size. This is because of (a) surface tension at the interface between quark matter and vacuum (which affects small strangelets more than big ones), and (b) screening of charges, which allows small strangelets to be charged, with a neutralizing cloud of electrons/positrons around them, but requires large strangelets, like any large piece of matter, to be electrically neutral in their interior. The charge screening distance tends to be of the order of a few femtometers, so only the outer few femtometers of a strangelet can carry charge.&lt;ref&gt;H. Heiselberg, "Screening in quark droplets", [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v48/i3/p1418_1 Phys. Rev. D48, 1418 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface tension of strange matter is unknown. If it is smaller than a critical value (a few MeV per square femtometer&lt;ref name='screen'&gt;M. Alford, K. Rajagopal, S. Reddy, A. Steiner, "The Stability of Strange Star Crusts and Strangelets", Phys. Rev. D73 114016 (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604134 arXiv:hep-ph/0604134]&lt;/ref&gt;) then large strangelets are unstable and will tend to fission into smaller strangelets (strange stars would still be stabilized by gravity). If it is larger than the critical value, then strangelets become more stable as they get bigger.

==Natural or artificial occurrence==
Although nuclei do not decay to strangelets, there are other ways to create strangelets, so if the strange matter hypothesis is correct there should be strangelets in the universe. There are at least three ways they might be created in nature:

* Cosmogonically, i.e. in the early universe when the [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] confinement phase transition occurred. It is possible that strangelets were created along with the neutrons and protons that form ordinary matter.
* High-energy processes. The universe is full of very high-energy particles ([[cosmic ray]]s). It is possible that when these collide with each other or with neutron stars they may provide enough energy to overcome the energy barrier and create strangelets from nuclear matter. Some identified exotic cosmic ray events, like the [[Price's event]] with very low charge-to-mass ratio could have already registered strangelets.&lt;ref&gt;Shibaji Banerjee, Sanjay K. Ghosh, Sibaji Raha, and Debapriyo Syam, "Can Cosmic Strangelets Reach the Earth?", [http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1384 Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1384 – Published 14 August 2000, https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0006286]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cosmic ray impacts. In addition to head-on collisions of cosmic rays, [[ultra high energy cosmic ray]]s impacting on [[Earth's atmosphere]] may create strangelets.

These scenarios offer possibilities for observing strangelets. If there are strangelets flying around the universe, then occasionally a strangelet should hit Earth, where it would appear as an exotic type of cosmic ray. If strangelets can be produced in high-energy collisions, then we might make them at heavy-ion colliders.

===Accelerator production===
At heavy ion accelerators like the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC), nuclei are collided at relativistic speeds, creating strange and antistrange quarks that could conceivably lead to strangelet production. The experimental signature of a strangelet would be its very high ratio of mass to charge, which would cause its trajectory in a magnetic field to be very nearly, but not quite, straight. The [[STAR detector|STAR collaboration]] has searched for strangelets produced at the RHIC,&lt;ref&gt;STAR Collaboration, "Strangelet search at RHIC", [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0511047 arXiv:nucl-ex/0511047]&lt;/ref&gt; but none were found. The [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) is even less likely to produce strangelets,&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"&gt;Ellis J, Giudice G, Mangano ML, Tkachev I, Wiedemann U (LHC Safety Assessment Group) (5 September 2008). "[http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0954-3899/35/11/115004/g8_11_115004.pdf?request-id=1973667e-34da-47a4-b75a-08624558a81b Review of the Safety of LHC Collisions]" (PDF, 586 [[KiB]]).

[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1111112?ln=fr CERN record].&lt;/ref&gt; but searches are planned&lt;ref&gt;A. Angelis ''et al.'', "Model of Centauro and strangelet production in heavy ion collisions", Phys. Atom. Nucl. 67:396-405 (2004) {{arXiv|nucl-th/0301003}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the LHC [[ALICE: A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]] detector.

===Space-based detection===
The [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (AMS), an instrument that is mounted on the [[International Space Station]], could detect strangelets.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sandweiss, "Overview of strangelet searches and Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer: When will we stop searching?" [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0954-3899/30/1/004 J. Phys. G30:S51-S59 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible seismic detection===
In May 2002, a group of researchers at [[Southern Methodist University]] reported the possibility that strangelets may have been responsible for seismic events recorded on October 22 and November 24 in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;D. Anderson ''et al.'', "Two seismic events with the properties for the passage of strange quark matter through the earth" [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205089 arXiv:astro-ph/0205089]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors later retracted their claim, after finding that the clock of one of the seismic stations had a large error during the relevant period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0505584 E.T. Herrin ''et al.'', "Seismic Search for Strange Quark Nuggets"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization#International Monitoring System|International Monitoring System]] being set up to verify the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) after entry into force may be useful as a sort of "strangelet observatory" using the entire Earth as its detector. The IMS will be designed to detect anomalous seismic disturbances down to {{convert|1|ktonTNT|lk=on}} energy release or less, and could be able to track strangelets passing through Earth in real time if properly exploited.

===Impacts on Solar System bodies===
It has been suggested that strangelets of subplanetary i.e. heavy meteorite mass, would puncture planets and other solar system objects, leading to impact (exit) craters which show characteristic features.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Labun, Jeremey Birrell, Johann Rafelski, "Solar System Signatures of Impacts by Compact Ultra Dense Objects",{{arxiv|1104.4572}}[http://inspirehep.net/record/897105]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
If the strange matter hypothesis is correct ''and'' a stable negatively-charged strangelet with a surface tension larger than the aforementioned critical value exists, then a larger strangelet would be more stable than a smaller one. One speculation that has resulted from the idea is that a strangelet coming into contact with a lump of ordinary matter could convert the ordinary matter to strange matter.&lt;ref name='DDH'/&gt;&lt;ref name='BJSW'/&gt;&lt;!-- original suggestion may have been Glashow and De Rujula in Nature--&gt; This "[[ice-nine]]"-like disaster scenario is as follows: one strangelet hits a nucleus, catalyzing its immediate conversion to strange matter. This liberates energy, producing a larger, more stable strangelet, which in turn hits another nucleus, catalyzing its conversion to strange matter. In the end, all the nuclei of all the atoms of Earth are converted, and Earth is reduced to a hot, large lump of strange matter. 

This is not a concern for strangelets in cosmic rays because they are produced far from Earth and have had time to decay to their ground state, which is predicted by most models to be positively charged, so they are electrostatically repelled by nuclei, and would rarely merge with them.&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Intermediate mass strangelets are positively charged", Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 (2000) 4687-4690 (2000) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0008217 arXiv:hep-ph/0008217]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen "Strangelets in Cosmic Rays", for Proceedings of 11th Marcel Grossmann Meeting, Germany, Jul 2006, [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612784 arXiv:astro-ph/0612784]&lt;/ref&gt; But high-energy collisions could produce negatively charged strangelet states which live long enough to interact with the nuclei of ordinary matter.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schaffner-Bielich, C. Greiner, A. Diener, H. Stoecker, "Detectability of strange matter in heavy ion experiments", Phys. Rev. C55:3038-3046 (1997), [https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/9611052 arXiv:nucl-th/9611052]&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger of catalyzed conversion by strangelets produced in heavy-ion colliders has received some media attention,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/Others/Others-Doc-Science&amp;Forteana/+Doc-Science-Astronomy&amp;Cosmology&amp;EarthScience/CouldScientistsCreateABlackHole.htm New Scientist, 28 August 1999: "A Black Hole Ate My Planet"] &lt;!-- ORIGINALLY: http://www.kressworks.com/Science/A_black_hole_ate_my_planet.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[End Day|''Horizon: End Days'']], an episode of the [[BBC]] [[television series]] [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|''Horizon'']]&lt;/ref&gt; and concerns of this type were raised&lt;ref name='DDH'&gt;A. Dar, A. De Rujula, U. Heinz, "Will relativistic heavy ion colliders destroy our planet?", Phys. Lett. B470:142-148 (1999) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9910471 arXiv:hep-ph/9910471]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Wagner, "Black holes at Brookhaven?" and reply by F. Wilzcek, Letters to the Editor, Scientific American July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; at the commencement of the RHIC experiment at Brookhaven, which could potentially have created strangelets. A detailed analysis&lt;ref name='BJSW'&gt;W. Busza, R. Jaffe, J. Sandweiss, F. Wilczek, "Review of speculative 'disaster scenarios' at RHIC", Rev. Mod. Phys.72:1125-1140 (2000) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9910333 arXiv:hep-ph/9910333]&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the RHIC collisions were comparable to ones which naturally occur as cosmic rays traverse the solar system, so we would already have seen such a disaster if it were possible. RHIC has been operating since 2000 without incident. Similar concerns have been raised about the operation of the LHC at [[CERN]]&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Dennis Overbye, Asking a Judge to Save the World, and Maybe a Whole Lot More, NY Times, 29 March 2008 [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/science/29collider.html?ref=us]&lt;/ref&gt; but such fears are dismissed as far-fetched by scientists.&lt;ref name='NYT'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/en/LHC/Safety-en.html|title=Safety at the LHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Blaizot ''et al.'', "Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC", [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search?sysno=002372601cer CERN library record] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907004852/http://doc.cern.ch/yellowrep/2003/2003-001/p1.pdf CERN Yellow Reports Server (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a [[neutron star]], the conversion scenario seems much more plausible. A neutron star is in a sense a giant nucleus (20&amp;nbsp;km across), held together by gravity, but it is electrically neutral and so does not electrostatically repel strangelets. If a strangelet hit a neutron star, it could convert a small region of it, and that region would grow to consume the entire star, creating a [[quark star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Astrophys. J.|volume=310|page=261|date=1986|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1986ApJ...310..261A|doi=10.1086/164679|title=Strange stars|last1=Alcock|first1=Charles|last2=Farhi|first2=Edward|last3=Olinto|first3=Angela|bibcode = 1986ApJ...310..261A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate about the strange matter hypothesis==
The strange matter hypothesis remains unproven. No direct search for strangelets in cosmic rays or particle accelerators has seen a strangelet (see references in earlier sections). If any of the objects such as neutron stars could be shown to have a surface made of strange matter, this would indicate that strange matter is stable at zero pressure, which would vindicate the strange matter hypothesis. However there is no strong evidence for strange matter surfaces on neutron stars (see below).

Another argument against the hypothesis is that if it were true, all neutron stars should be made of strange matter, and otherwise none should be.&lt;ref&gt;J. Friedman and R. Caldwell, "Evidence against a strange ground state for baryons", Phys. Lett. B264, 143-148 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Even if there were only a few strange stars initially, violent events such as collisions would soon create many strangelets flying around the universe. Because a single strangelet will convert a neutron star to strange matter, by now all neutron stars would have been converted. This argument is still debated,&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Strangelets as cosmic rays beyond the GZK-cutoff", Phys. Rev. Lett. 90:121102 (2003) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211597 arXiv:stro-ph/0211597]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Balberg, "Comment on 'strangelets as cosmic rays beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff'", Phys. Rev. Lett. 92:119001 (2004), [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403503 arXiv:astro-ph/0403503]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Reply to Comment on Strangelets as Cosmic Rays beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Cutoff", Phys. Rev.Lett. 92:119002 (2004), [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403515 arXiv:astro-ph/0403515]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Strangelet propagation and cosmic ray flux", Phys. Rev. D71, 014026 (2005) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411538 arXiv:astro-ph/0411538]&lt;/ref&gt; but if it is correct then showing that one neutron star has a conventional nuclear matter crust would disprove the strange matter hypothesis.

Because of its importance for the strange matter hypothesis, there is an ongoing effort to determine whether the surfaces of neutron stars are made of strange matter or nuclear matter. The evidence currently favors nuclear matter. This comes from the phenomenology of [[X-ray burst]]s, which is well explained in terms of a nuclear matter crust,&lt;ref&gt;A. Heger, A. Cumming, D. Galloway, S. Woosley, "Models of Type I X-ray Bursts from GS 1826-24: A Probe of rp-Process Hydrogen Burning", [https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1195 arXiv:0711.1195]&lt;/ref&gt; and from measurement of seismic vibrations in [[magnetar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A. Watts and S. Reddy, "Magnetar oscillations pose challenges for strange stars", MNRAS, 379, L63 (2007) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609364 arXiv:astro-ph/0609364]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60578">'''Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics''' or '''stochastics''' ('''STS''') is an exact theory of [[Stochastic differential equation|stochastic (partial) differential equations]] (SDEs), the class of mathematical models with the widest applicability covering, in particular, all continuous time [[dynamical system]]s, with and without noise. The main utility of the theory from the physical point of view is a rigorous theoretical explanation of the ubiquitous spontaneous long-range dynamical behavior that manifests itself across disciplines via such phenomena as [[Pink noise|1/f]], [[Flicker noise|flicker]], and [[crackling noise|crackling]] noises and the power-law statistics, or [[Zipf's law]], of instantonic processes like earthquakes and neuroavalanches. From the mathematical point of view, STS is interesting because it bridges the two major parts of mathematical physics – the [[dynamical systems theory]] and [[Topological quantum field theories|topological field theories]]. Besides these and related disciplines such as [[algebraic topology]] and [[Quantum field theory|supersymmetric field theories]], STS is also connected with the traditional theory of [[stochastic differential equation]]s and the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators.

The main idea of the theory is to study, instead of trajectories, the SDE-defined temporal evolution of [[differential form]]s. This evolution has an intrinsic BRST or topological supersymmetry representing the preservation of topology and/or the concept of proximity in the [[phase space]] by continuous time dynamics. The theory identifies a model as [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], in the generalized, stochastic sense, if its ground state is not supersymmetric, i.e., if the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. Accordingly, the emergent long-range behavior that always accompanies dynamical chaos and its derivatives such as [[turbulence]] and [[self-organized criticality]] can be understood as a consequence of the [[Goldstone theorem]].

== Parisi–Sourlas approach to Langevin SDEs ==
In the context of supersymmetric approach to stochastic dynamics, the term Langevin SDEs denotes SDEs with Euclidean phase space, &lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;, gradient flow vector field, and additive [[Gaussian process|Gaussian]] [[white noise]],

&lt;math display="block"&gt; \dot x(t) = - \partial U(x(t))+(2\Theta)^{1/2} \xi(t),&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt; x\in X &lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt; \xi \in \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;is the noise variable, &lt;math&gt; \Theta &lt;/math&gt; is the noise intensity, and &lt;math&gt; \partial U(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which in coordinates &lt;math&gt; (\partial U(x))^i \equiv \delta^{ij}\partial_jU(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \partial_i U(x) \equiv \partial U(x)/\partial x^i&lt;/math&gt;, is the gradient flow vector field with &lt;math&gt; U(x)&lt;/math&gt; being the Langevin function often interpreted as the energy of the purely dissipative stochastic dynamical system.

The Parisi-Sourlas method is a way of construction of the [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] representation of the Langevin SDE. It can be thought of as a [[BRST quantization|BRST]] gauge fixing procedure that uses the Langevin SDE as a gauge condition. Namely, one considers the following functional integral,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \left\langle\int \dots \int J \left(\prod\nolimits_\tau \delta(\dot x(\tau) - {\mathcal F}(x(\tau)))\right)Dx \right\rangle_\text{noise} ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; denotes the r.h.s. of the Langevin SDE, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \langle \cdot \rangle_\text{noise} \equiv \int \dots \int \cdot P(\xi) D\xi &lt;/math&gt; is the operation of stochastic averaging with &lt;math&gt; P(\xi) \propto e^{- \int_{t'}^t d\tau \xi^2(\tau)/2} &lt;/math&gt; being the normalized distribution of noise configurations,

&lt;math&gt; 
\textstyle J = \operatorname{Det} \frac{\delta(\dot x (\tau) - {\mathcal F} (x(\tau)))}{\delta x (\tau')}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the Jacobian of the corresponding functional derivative, and the path integration is over all closed paths, &lt;math&gt; x(t)=x(t') &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; t'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; t&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;are the initial and final moments of temporal evolution.

=== Topological interpretation ===
Topological aspects of the Parisi-Sourlas construction can be briefly outlined in the following manner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The delta-functional, i.e., the collection of the infinite number of delta-functions, ensures that only solutions of the Langevin SDE contribute to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of BRST procedure, these solutions can be viewed as [[Gribov copies]]. Each solution contributes either positive or negative unity: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \textstyle \left\langle I_N(\xi)\right\rangle_\text{noise}
&lt;/math&gt;with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi) = \sum_\text{solutions} \operatorname{sign}J
&lt;/math&gt;  being the index of the so-called Nicolai map, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \xi = (\dot x + \partial U)/(2\Theta)^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;, which in this case is the map from the space of closed paths in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
X
&lt;/math&gt; to the space of noise configurations, a map that provides a noise configuration at which a given closed path is a solution of the Langevin SDE. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi)
&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as a realization of [[Poincaré–Hopf theorem]] on the infinite-dimensional space of close paths with the Langevin SDE playing the role of the vector field and with the solutions of Langevin SDE playing the role of the critical points with index &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{sign}J
&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
I_N(\xi)
&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the noise configuration because it is of topological character. The same it true for its stochastic average, &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt;, which is not the partition function of the model but, instead, its [[Witten index]].

=== Path integral representation ===
With the help of a standard field theoretic technique that involves introduction of additional field called Lagrange multiplier, &lt;math&gt; B&lt;/math&gt;, and a pair of fermionic fields called [[Faddeev–Popov ghost]]s,  &lt;math&gt; \chi, \bar\chi&lt;/math&gt;, the Witten index can be given the following form,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W} = \int\dots\int_{p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\Psi)}D\Phi,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; denotes collection of all the fields, p.b.c. stands for periodic boundary conditions, the so-called gauge fermion, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Psi = \int_{t'}^td\tau (\imath_{\dot x} - \bar d)(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \imath_{\dot x} = i \bar\chi_j\dot x^j &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \textstyle \bar d = - i \bar\chi_j\delta^{jk}(\partial_kU + \Theta  i B_k)&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[BRST quantization|BRST symmetry]] defined via its action on arbitrary functional &lt;math&gt;A(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; (Q, A(\Phi)) = \textstyle \int _{t'}^td\tau(\chi^i(\tau)\delta/\delta x^i(\tau) + B_i(\tau)\delta/\delta \bar\chi_i(\tau)) A(\Phi) &lt;/math&gt;. In the [[BRST quantization|BRST]] formalism, the Q-exact pieces like, &lt;math&gt;(Q,\Psi)&lt;/math&gt;, serve as gauge fixing tools. Therefore, the path integral expression for &lt;math&gt; \mathcal W&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a model whose action contains nothing else but the gauge fixing term. This is a definitive feature of [[topological quantum field theory|Witten-type topological field theories]] and in this particular case of BRST procedure approach to SDEs, the BRST symmetry can be also recognized as the topological supersymmetry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A common way to explain the BRST procedure is to say that the BRST symmetry generates the fermionic version of the gauge transformations, whereas its overall effect on the path integral is to limit the integration only to configurations that satisfy a specified gauge condition. This interpretation also applies to Parisi-Sourlas approach with the deformations of the trajectory and the Langevin SDE playing the roles of the gauge transformations and the gauge condition respectively.

=== Operator representation ===
Physical fermions in the high-energy physics and condensed matter models have antiperiodic boundary conditions in time. The unconventional periodic boundary conditions for fermions in the path integral expression for the Witten index is the origin of the topological character of this object. These boundary conditions reveal themselves in the operator representation of the Witten index as the alternating sign operator,&lt;math display="block"&gt;
{\mathcal W}  = \operatorname{Tr}(-1)^{\hat n} \hat {\mathcal M}_{tt'},
&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hat n &lt;/math&gt;  is the operator of the number of ghosts/fermions and the finite-time stochastic evolution operator (SEO), &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat{\mathcal M }_{tt'} = e^{- (t-t')\hat H }&lt;/math&gt;, where, &lt;math display="block"&gt; \hat H = \hat L_{-\partial U} - \Theta \hat \triangle= [\hat d, \hat{\bar d}],&lt;/math&gt;is the infinitesimal SEO with &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{L} &lt;/math&gt; being the Lie derivative along the subscript vector field, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat \triangle&lt;/math&gt; being the Laplacian, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{d} = \chi^i \partial/\partial x^i &lt;/math&gt; being the [[exterior derivative]], which is the operator representative of the TS, and  &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} = - (i\hat{\bar\chi}_i) \delta^{ij} ( \partial_jU + \Theta (i\hat B_j)) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;i {\hat B}_j = \partial/ \partial x^j&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;i{\hat{\bar \chi}}_j = \partial/ \partial \chi^j&lt;/math&gt; are bosonic and fermionic momenta, and with square brackets denoting bi-graded commutator, i.e., it is an anticommutator if both operators are fermionic (contain odd total number of &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt;'s and &lt;math&gt; \hat {\bar \chi} &lt;/math&gt;'s) and a commutator otherwise. The exterior derivative and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} &lt;/math&gt; are [[supercharge]]s. They are [[nilpotent]], e.g., &lt;math&gt;\hat d^2=0&lt;/math&gt;, and commutative with the SEO. In other words, Langevin SDEs possess N=2 supersymmetry. The fact that &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d} &lt;/math&gt; is a supercharge is accidental. For SDEs of arbitrary form, this is not true.

=== Hilbert space ===
The wavefunctions are functions not only of the bosonic variables, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, but also of the [[Grassmann number]]s or fermions, &lt;math&gt;\chi\in TX&lt;/math&gt;, from the tangent space of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The wavefunctions can be viewed as [[differential form]]s on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the fermions playing the role of the differentials &lt;math&gt;\chi\equiv dx\wedge&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The concept of infinitesimal SEO generalizes the [[Fokker–Planck equation|Fokker–Planck operator]], which is essentially the SEO acting on top differential forms that have the meaning of the total [[probability distribution]]s. Differential forms of lesser degree can be interpreted, at least locally on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as [[conditional probability distribution]]s.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ovchinnikov|first=I.V.|date=2013-01-15|title=Topological field theory of dynamical systems.

Without it, the Witten index representing the most fundamental object of the model—the partition function of the noise—would not exist and the dynamical partition function would not represent the number of fixed points of the SDE ([[#Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and chaos|see below]]). The most general understanding of the wavefunctions is the coordinate-free objects that contain information not only on trajectories but also on the evolution of the differentials and/or [[Lyapunov exponent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=R.|date=1988|title=Lyapunov Exponents and Supersymmetry of Stochastic Dynamical Systems|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0295-5075/5/i=2/a=002|journal=EPL|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=101–106|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/5/2/002|issn=0295-5075|bibcode=1988EL......5..101G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to nonlinear sigma model and algebraic topology ==
In Ref.,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; a model has been introduced that can be viewed as a 1D prototype of the topological nonlinear sigma models (TNSM),&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; a subclass of the [[topological quantum field theory|Witten-type topological field theories]]. The 1D TNSM is defined for [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian phase spaces]] while for Euclidean phase spaces it reduces to the Parisi-Sourlas model. Its key difference from STS is the diffusion operator which is the [[Hodge Laplacian]] for 1D TNSM and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat  L_{e_a} \hat  L_{e_a} &lt;/math&gt;for STS . This difference in unimportant in the context of relation between STS and algebraic topology, the relation established by the theory of 1D TNSM (see, e.g., Refs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;).

The model is defined by the following evolution operator &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat H = \hat L_{-\partial U} + \Theta[\hat d, \hat{d}^\dagger]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; (\partial U)^i = g^{ij}\partial_j U&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math display="inline"&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; being the metric, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; [\hat d, \hat{d}^\dagger]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hodge Laplacian]], and the [[differential form]]s from the [[exterior algebra]] of the phase space, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Omega(X)&lt;/math&gt;, are viewed as wavefunctions. There exists a similarity transformation, &lt;math&gt;\hat H \to {\hat H}_U = e^{U/2\Theta} \hat H e^{- U/2\Theta} &lt;/math&gt;, that brings the evolution operator to the explicitly Hermitian form &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U = \Theta [\hat d_U, \hat d_U^\dagger] &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\hat d_U = e^{U/2\Theta} \hat d e^{-U/2\Theta} = 
\chi^i(\partial/\partial x^i - \partial_i U /2\Theta)   &lt;/math&gt;. In the Euclidean case, &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U &lt;/math&gt; is the Hamiltonian of a N=2 [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]]. One can introduce two Hermitian operators, &lt;math&gt;\hat q_1 = (\hat d_U + \hat d_U^\dagger) /2^{1/2}   &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat q_2 = i (\hat d_U - \hat d_U^\dagger) /2^{1/2}   &lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U = \Theta \hat q_1^2 = \Theta \hat q_2^2 &lt;/math&gt; . This demonstrates that the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;{\hat H}_U &lt;/math&gt; and/or &lt;math&gt;{\hat H} &lt;/math&gt; is real and nonnegative. This is also true for SEOs of Langevin SDEs. For the SDEs of arbitrary form, however, this is no longer true as the eigenvalues of the SEO can be negative and even complex, which actually allows for the TS to be broken spontanenously.

The following properties of the evolution operator of 1D TNSM hold even for the SEO of the SDEs of arbitrary form. The evolution operator commutes with the operator of the degree of differential forms. As a result, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \hat H  = \hat H^{(\dim X)} \oplus \dots \oplus \hat H^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(k)} = \hat H |_{\Omega^{(k)}} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Omega^{(n)}(X) &lt;/math&gt; is the space of differential forms of degree &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, due to the presence of TS, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Omega(X)={\mathcal H} \oplus {\mathcal N} \oplus (\hat d {\mathcal N})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt; {\mathcal H}&lt;/math&gt; are the supersymmetric eigenstates, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \theta's&lt;/math&gt;, non-trivial in [[de Rham cohomology]] whereas the rest are the pairs of non-supersymmetric eigenstates of the form &lt;math display="inline"&gt; |\vartheta\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \hat d |\vartheta\rangle &lt;/math&gt;. All supersymmetric eigenstates have exactly zero eigenvalue and, barring accidental situations, all non-supersymmetric states have non-zero eigenvalues. Non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates do not contribute to the Witten index, which equals the difference in the numbers of the supersymmetric states of even and odd degrees, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
{\mathcal W}  = \#\{\text{even }\theta's\} - \#\{\text{odd }\theta's\}.
&lt;/math&gt;For compact &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, each de Rham cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate and the Witten index equals the Euler characteristic of the phase space.

=== Ambiguity of path integral representation and Ito–Stratonovich dilemma ===
BRST gauge fixing procedure goes along the same lines as in case of Langevin SDEs. The topological interpretation of the BRST procedure is just the same and the path integral representation of the Witten index is defined by the gauge fermion, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Psi&lt;/math&gt;, given by the same expression but with the generalized version of&lt;math display="inline"&gt; \textstyle \bar d = \imath_{F} - \Theta \imath_{e_a} (Q,\imath_{e_a})&lt;/math&gt;. There is one important subtlety, however, that appears on the way to the operator representation of the model. Unlike for Langevin SDEs, classical mechanics, and other SDEs with additive noises, the path integral representation of the finite-time SEO is an ambiguous object. This ambiguity originates from non-commutativity of momenta and position operators, e.g., &lt;math&gt; \hat B \hat x \ne  \hat x \hat B &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, &lt;math&gt; B(\tau) x(\tau)  &lt;/math&gt; in the path integral representation has a whole one-parameter family of possible interpretations in the operator representation, &lt;math&gt; (\alpha \hat B \hat x + (1-\alpha)\hat x \hat B)|\psi(\tau)\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; |\psi(\tau)\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; denotes an arbitrary wavefunction. Accordingly, there is a whole &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-family of infinitesimal SEOs,   &lt;math display="block"&gt; \hat H_\alpha = \hat L_F - \Theta\hat L_{e_a} \hat L_{e_a}= [\hat d, \hat{\bar d}_\alpha],&lt;/math&gt;with  &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat{\bar d}_\alpha = \hat{\imath}_{F_\alpha} - \Theta \hat{\imath}_{e_a}\hat  L_{e_a} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\imath}_{F_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[interior multiplication]] by the subscript vector field, and the "shifted" flow vector field being &lt;math&gt; \textstyle F_\alpha = F - \Theta(2\alpha-1)(e_a\cdot\partial) e_a &lt;/math&gt;. Noteworthy, unlike in Langevin SDEs, &lt;math&gt;\hat {\bar d}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[supercharge]] and STS cannot be identified as a N=2 supersymmetric theory in the general case.

The path integral representation of stochastic dynamics is equivalent to the traditional understanding of SDEs as of a continuous time limit of [[stochastic difference equation]]s where different choices of parameter &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; are called "interpretations" of SDEs. The choice &lt;math&gt; \alpha=1/2  &lt;/math&gt;, for which &lt;math&gt; \textstyle F_{1/2} = F &lt;/math&gt; and which is known in quantum theory as [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl symmetrization]] rule, is known as the [[Stratonovich integral|Stratonovich interpretation]], whereas &lt;math&gt; \alpha=1  &lt;/math&gt; as the [[Itô calculus|Ito interpretation]]. While in quantum theory the Weyl symmetrization is preferred because it guaranties hermiticity of Hamiltonians, in STS the Weyl-Stratonovich approach is preferred because it corresponds to the most natural mathematical meaning of the finite-time SEO discussed [[Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics#Supersymmetric theory of SDEs without BRST quantization|below]]—the stochastically averaged pullback induced by the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms.

=== Eigensystem of stochastic evolution operator ===

Vertical arrowed lines visualize supersymmetry operator.]]

As compared to the SEO of Langevin SDEs, the SEO of a general form SDE is pseudo-Hermitian.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result, the eigenvalues of non-supersymmetric eigenstates are not restricted to be real positive, whereas the eigenvalues of supersymmetric eigenstates are still exactly zero. Just like for Langevin SDEs and nonlinear sigma model, the structure of the eigensystem of the SEO reestablishes the topological character of the Witten index: the contributions from the non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates vanish and only supersymmetric states contribute the [[Euler characteristic]] of (closed) &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt;. Among other properties of the SEO spectra is that &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(\operatorname{dim} X)} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \hat H^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt; never break TS, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \textstyle Re (\operatorname{spec} \hat H^{(\operatorname{dim} X)}) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, there are three major types of the SEO spectra presented in the figure on the right. The two types that have negative (real parts of) eigenvalues correspond to the spontaneously broken TS.  All types of the SEO spectra are realizable as can be established, e.g., from the exact relation between the theory of [[Dynamo theory#Kinematic dynamo theory|kinematic dynamo]] and STS.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==  STS without BRST procedure   ==
===  The mathematical meaning of stochastic evolution operator  ===
The finite-time SEO can be obtained in another, more mathematical way based on the idea to study the SDE-induced actions on differential forms directly, without going through the BRST gauge fixing procedure. The so-obtained finite-time SEO is known in [[dynamical systems theory]] as the generalized transfer operator&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; and it has also been used in the classical theory of SDEs (see, e.g., Refs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stochastic differential geometry at Saint-Flour|last=Ancona|first=A.|last2=Elworthy|first2=K. D.|last3=Emery|first3=M.|last4=Kunita|first4=H.|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642341700|location=|pages=|oclc=811000422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stochastic flows and stochastic differential equations|last=Kunita|first=H.|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521599252|location=|pages=|oclc=36864963}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). The contribution to this construction from STS&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; is the exposition of the supersymmetric structure underlying it and establishing its relation to the BRST procedure for SDEs.

Namely, for any configuration of the noise, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, and an initial condition, &lt;math&gt;x(t')=x'\in X&lt;/math&gt;, SDE defines a unique solution/trajectory, &lt;math&gt;x(t)\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Even for noise configurations that are non-differentiable with respect to time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is differentiable with respect to the initial condition, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slavík|first=A.|title=Generalized differential equations: Differentiability of solutions with respect to initial conditions and parameters|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022247X13000449|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|language=en|volume=402|issue=1|pages=261–274|doi=10.1016/j.jmaa.2013.01.027|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, SDE defines the family of the noise-configuration-dependent [[diffeomorphism]]s of the phase space to itself, &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;. This object can be understood as a collection and/or definition of all the noise-configuration-dependent trajectories, &lt;math&gt;x(t) = M_{tt'}(x')&lt;/math&gt;. The diffeomorphisms induce actions or [[Pullback (differential geometry)#Pullback of differential forms|pullbacks]], &lt;math&gt; \textstyle M^*_{t't}:\Omega(X)\to\Omega(X) &lt;/math&gt;. Unlike, say, trajectories in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, pullbacks are linear objects even for nonlinear &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Linear objects can be averaged and averaging &lt;math&gt; M^*_{t't}&lt;/math&gt; over the noise configurations, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, results in the finite-time SEO which is unique and corresponds to the Weyl-Stratonovich interpretation of the BRST procedure approach to SDEs, &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathcal M }_{tt'} = \langle M^*_{t't} \rangle_\text{noise}=e^{-(t-t')\hat H_{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Within this definition of the finite-time SEO, the Witten index can be recognized as the sharp trace of the generalized transfer operator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  It also links the Witten index to the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem|Lefschetz index]],&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\textstyle I_L=\operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} M_{t't}^*= \sum_{x\in \operatorname{fix} M_{tt'}} \operatorname{sign} \operatorname{det} (\delta_j^i -\partial M_{tt'}^i(x) /\partial x^j)
&lt;/math&gt;, a topological constant that equals the [[Euler characteristic]] of the (closed) phase space. Namely, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\textstyle {\mathcal W} = \operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} \langle M_{t't}^* \rangle_\text{noise} = \langle \operatorname{Tr} (-1)^{\hat n} M_{t't}^* \rangle_\text{noise} = I_{L}
&lt;/math&gt;.

===  The meaning of supersymmetry and the butterfly effect ===
The N=2 supersymmetry of Langevin SDEs has been linked to the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager principle of microscopic reversibility]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and [[Jarzynski equality]].&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; In classical mechanics, a relation between the corresponding N=2 supersymmetry and [[ergodicity]] has been proposed.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; In general form SDEs, where physical arguments may not be applicable, a lower level explanation of the TS is available. This explanation is based on understanding of the finite-time SEO as a stochastically averaged pullback of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms (see subsection above). In this picture, the question of why any SDE has TS is the same as the question of why [[exterior derivative]] commutes with the pullback of any diffeomorphism. The answer to this question is differentiability of the corresponding map.  In other words, the presence of TS is the algebraic version of the statement that continuous-time flow preserves continuity of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Two initially close points will remain close during evolution, which is just yet another way of saying that &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}&lt;/math&gt; is a diffeomorphism.

In deterministic chaotic models, initially close points can part in the limit of infinitely long temporal evolution. This is the famous [[butterfly effect]], which is equivalent to the statement that &lt;math&gt;M_{tt'}&lt;/math&gt; losses differentiability in this limit. In algebraic representation of dynamics, the evolution in the infinitely long time limit is described by the ground state of the SEO and the butterfly effect is equivalent to the spontaneous breakdown of TS, i.e., to the situation when the ground state is not supersymmetric. Noteworthy, unlike traditional understanding of deterministic chaotic dynamics, the spontaneous breakdown of TS works also for stochastic cases. This is the most important generalization because deterministic dynamics is, in fact, a mathematical idealization. Real dynamical systems cannot be isolated from their environments and thus always experience stochastic influence.

== Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and dynamical chaos ==

BRST gauge fixing procedure applied to SDEs leads directly to the Witten index. The Witten index is of topological character and it does not respond to any perturbation. In particular, all response correlators calculated using the Witten index vanish. This fact has a physical interpretation within the STS: the physical meaning of the Witten index is the partition function of the noise&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and since there is no backaction from the dynamical system to the noise, the Witten index has no information on the details of the SDE. In contrast, the information on the details of the model is contained in the other trace-like object of the theory, the dynamical partition function, &lt;math display="block"&gt; {\mathcal Z}_{tt'} = \int\dots\int_{a.p.b.c.} e^{(Q,\Psi)}D\Phi = \operatorname{Tr} \hat {\mathcal M}_{tt'},&lt;/math&gt;where a.p.b.c. denotes antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic fields and periodic boundary conditions for bosonic fields. In the standard manner, the dynamical partition function can be promoted to the [[generating function]]al by coupling the model to external probing fields.

For a wide class of models, dynamical partition function provides lower bound for the stochastically averaged number of fixed points of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms,&lt;math display="block"&gt; \left.{\mathcal Z}_{tt'}\right|_{t-t'\to\infty} = \sum\nolimits_{p} e^{-(t-t'){\mathsf E}_p} \le  \langle 
\#\{\text{fixed points of } M_{t't}\} \rangle_\text{noise} \propto e^{(t-t')S} .&lt;/math&gt;Here, index &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; runs over "physical states", i.e., the eigenstates that grow fastest with the rate of the exponential growth given as,&lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Gamma_g = - \min_\alpha \operatorname{Re} {\mathsf E}_\alpha \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and parameter &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as stochastic version of dynamical entropy such as [[topological entropy]]. Positive entropy is one of the key signatures of deterministic chaos. Therefore, the situation with positive &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_g &lt;/math&gt; must be identified as chaotic in the generalized, stochastic sense as it implies positive entropy: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \Gamma_g \le S &lt;/math&gt;. At the same time, positive &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_g &lt;/math&gt; implies that TS is broken spontaneously, that is, the ground state in not supersymmetric because its eigenvalue is not zero. In other words, positive dynamical entropy is a reason to identify spontaneous TS breaking as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos. Noteworthy, Langevin SDEs are never chaotic because the spectrum of their SEO is real non-negative.

The complete list of reasons why spontaneous TS breaking must be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the concept of dynamical chaos is as follows. 
* Positive dynamical entropy.
* According to the [[Goldstone's theorem]], spontaneous TS breaking must tailor a long-range dynamical behavior, one of the manifestations of which is the [[butterfly effect]] discussed above in the context of the meaning of TS.
* From the properties of the eigensystem of SEO, TS can be spontaneously broken only if &lt;math&gt; \dim X \ge 3 &lt;/math&gt;. This conclusion can be viewed as the stochastic generalization of the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem|Poincare–Bendixson theorem]] for deterministic chaos.
* In the deterministic case, [[Integrable system|integrable models in the sense of dynamical systems]] have well-defined global  [[Stable manifold|stable and unstable manifolds]] of &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;. The bras/kets of the global ground states of such models are the Poincare duals of the global stable/unstable manifolds. These ground states are supersymmetric so that TS is not broken spontaneously. On the contrary, when the model is non-integrable or chaotic, its global (un)stable manifolds are not well-defined topological manifolds, but rather have a fractal, self-recurrent structure that can be captured using the concept of branching manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The topology of chaos : Alice in stretch and squeezeland|last=Gilmore|first=R.|last2=Lefranc|first2=M.|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527410675|location=|pages=|oclc=967841676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wavefunctions that can represent such manifolds cannot be supersymmetric. Therefore, TS breaking is intrinsically related to the concept of non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, which is actually yet another widely accepted definition of deterministic chaos.
All the above features of TS breaking work for both deterministic and stochastic models. This is in contrast with the traditional [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]] whose trajectory-based properties such as the [[topological mixing]] cannot in principle be generalized to stochastic case because, just like in quantum dynamics, all trajectories are possible in the presence of noise and, say, the topological mixing property is satisfied trivially by all models with non-zero noise intensity.

There are other classes of topological objects. One class of objects is related to [[instanton]]s, i.e., transient dynamics. Crumpling paper, protein folding, and many other nonlinear dynamical processes in response to quenches, i.e., to external (sudden) changes of parameters, can be recognized as instantonic dynamics. From the mathematical point of view, instantons are families of solutions of deterministic equations of motion, &lt;math&gt;\dot x = F &lt;/math&gt;, that lead from, say, less stable fixed point of &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; to a more stable fixed point. Certain matrix elements calculated on instantons are of topological nature. An example of such matrix elements can be defined for a pair of critical points, &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; being more stable than &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math display="block"&gt; \left.\int\dots\int_{x(\pm\infty)=a,b} \left(\prod\nolimits_i O_i(t_i)\right)e^{({\mathcal Q},\Psi)} D\Phi  \right|_{\Theta\to0} = \langle a | {\mathcal T}\left(\prod\nolimits_i \hat O_i(t_i)\right) | b \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;Here &lt;math&gt; \langle a | &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; | b \rangle &lt;/math&gt; are the bra and ket of the corresponding perturbative supersymmetric ground states, or vacua, which are the Poincare duals of the local stable and unstable manifolds of the corresponding critical point; &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal T} &lt;/math&gt; denotes chronological ordering; &lt;math&gt; O &lt;/math&gt;'s are observables that are the Poincare duals of some closed submanifolds in &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \hat O(t) = \hat {\mathcal M}_{t_0 t} \hat O \hat {\mathcal M}_{t, t_0} &lt;/math&gt; are the observables in the Heisenberg representation with &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; being an unimportant reference time moment. The critical points have different indexes of stability so that the states &lt;math&gt;|a\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|b\rangle &lt;/math&gt; are topologically inequivalent as they represent unstable manifolds of different dimensionalities. The above matrix elements are independent of &lt;math&gt; t_i's &lt;/math&gt; as they actually represent the intersection number of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;-manifolds on the instanton as exemplified in the figure.

The above instantonic matrix elements are exact only in the deterministic limit. In the general stochastic case, one can consider global supersymmetric states, &lt;math&gt; \theta&lt;/math&gt;'s, from the [[De Rham cohomology]] classes of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and observables, &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, that are Poincare duals of [[closed manifold]]s non-trivial in [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The following matrix elements, &lt;math&gt; \textstyle \langle \theta_\alpha | {\mathcal T}\left(\prod\nolimits_i \hat \gamma_i(t_i)\right) | \theta_\beta \rangle, &lt;/math&gt; are topological invariants representative of the structure of De Rham [[cohomology ring]] of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics can be interesting in different ways. For example, STS offers a promising realization of the concept of [[supersymmetry]]. In general, there are two major problems in the context of supersymmetry. The first is establishing connections between this mathematical entity and the real world. Within STS, supersymmetry is the most common symmetry in nature because it is pertinent to all continuous time dynamical systems. The second is the [[Supersymmetry breaking|spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry]]. This problem is particularly important for particle physics because supersymmetry of [[elementary particle]]s, if exists at extremely short scale, must be broken spontaneously at large scale. This problem is nontrivial because supersymmetries are hard to break spontaneously, the very reason behind the introduction of [[Soft SUSY breaking|soft or explicit supersymmetry breaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=D.

A few more specific applications of STS are as follows.

=== Classification of stochastic dynamics ===

[[File:STS Phase Diagram.png|thumb|Stochastic dynamical systems can be classified according to whether TS is spontaneously broken or not (ordered/symmetric) and whether the flow vector field is integrable or non-integrable (chaotic). Symmetric phase can be identified as thermal equilibrium (T). Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos (C) because it hosts conventional deterministic chaos. Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos (N) because TS broking involves antiinstantons that disappear in the deterministic limit. The N''-''phase is also known in the literature as self-organized criticality.]]

STS provides classification for stochastic models depending on whether TS is broken and integrability of flow vector field. In can be exemplified as a part of the general phase diagram at the [[Edge of chaos|border of chaos]] (see figure on the right). The phase diagram has the following properties:   
* For physical models, TS gets restored eventually with the increase of noise intensity. 
* Symmetric phase can be called thermal equilibrium or T-phase because the ground state is the supersymmetric state of steady-state total probability distribution. 
* In the deterministic limit, ordered phase is equivalent to deterministic chaotic dynamics with non-integrable flow. 
* Ordered non-integrable phase can be called chaos or C-phase because ordinary deterministic chaos belongs to it. 
* Ordered integrable phase can be called noise-induced chaos or N-phase because it disappears in the deterministic limit. TS is broken by the condensation of (anti-)instantons (see below).   
* At stronger noises, the sharp N-C boundary must smear out into a crossover because (anti-)instantons lose their individuality and it is hard for an external observer to tell one tunneling process from another.

=== Demystification of self-organized criticality ===
Many sudden (or instantonic) processes in nature, such as, e.g., [[crackling noise]], exhibit scale-free statistics often called the [[Zipf's law]]. As an explanation for this peculiar spontaneous dynamical behavior, it was proposed to believe that some stochastic dynamical systems have a tendency to self-tune themselves into a [[Critical point (physics)|critical point]], the phenomenological approach known as [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=N.

Specifically, the definitive feature of the N-phase is the peculiar mechanism of the TS breaking. Unlike in the C-phase, where the TS is broken by the non-integrability of the flow, in the ''N''-phase, the TS is spontaneously broken due to the condensation of the configurations of instantons and noise-induced antiinstantons, i.e., time-reversed instantons. These processes can be roughly interpreted as the noise-induced tunneling events between, e.g., different attractors. Qualitatively, the dynamics in the ''N''-phase appears to an external observer as a sequence of sudden jumps or "avalanches" that must exhibit a scale-free behavior/statistics as a result of the [[Goldstone theorem]]. This picture of dynamics in the N-phase is exactly the dynamical behavior that the concept of SOC was designed to explain. In contrast with the original understanding of SOC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bak|first=P.|last2=Tang|first2=C.|last3=Wiesenfeld|first3=K.|date=1987|title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=59|issue=4|pages=381–384|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381|pmid=10035754|bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B}}&lt;/ref&gt; its STS interpretation has little to do with the traditional [[critical phenomena]] theory where scale-free behavior is associated with unstable fixed points of the [[renormalization group]] flow.

=== Kinematic dynamo theory ===
Magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon of  [[Dynamo theory#Kinematic dynamo theory|kinematic dynamo]] can also be identified as the spontaneous breakdown of TS.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ovchinnikov|first=I.V.|last2=Ensslin|first2=T. A.|date=2016|title=Kinematic dynamo, supersymmetry breaking, and chaos|journal=Physical Review D|volume=93|issue=8|pages=085023|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.93.085023|bibcode=2016PhRvD..93h5023O|arxiv=1512.01651}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result follows from equivalence between the evolution operator of the magnetic field and the SEO of the corresponding SDE describing the flow of the background matter. The so emerged ''STS-kinematic dynamo'' correspondence proves, in particular, that both types of TS breaking spectra are possible, with the real and complex ground state eigenvalues, because kinematic dynamo with both types of the fastest growing eigenmodes are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bouya|first=I.|last2=Dormy|first2=E.|date=2013-03-01|title=Revisiting the ABC flow dynamo|journal=Physics of Fluids|volume=25|issue=3|pages=037103–037103–10|doi=10.1063/1.4795546|issn=1070-6631|bibcode=2013PhFl...25c7103B|arxiv=1206.5186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transient dynamics ===
It is well known that various types of transient dynamics, such as quenches, exhibit spontaneous long-range behavior. In case of quenches across phase transitions, this behavior is often attributed to the proximity of criticality. At the same time, other quenches, not across a phase transition, are also known to exhibit long-range characteristics with the best known examples being the [[Barkhausen effect]] and other realizations of the concept of [[crackling noise]]. It is intuitively appealing that theoretical explanation for the scale-free behavior in quenches must be the same disregard whether the quench is across a phase transition or not. STS offers such an explanation. Namely, transient dynamics is essentially a composite instanton and TS is intrinsically broken within instantons. Even though TS breaking within instantons is not exactly the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry by a global ground state, this effective TS breaking must also result in a scale-free behavior. This understanding is supported by the fact that condensed instantons lead to appearance of logarithms in the correlation functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenkel|first=E.|last2=Losev|first2=A.|last3=Nekrasov|first3=N.|title=Notes on instantons in topological field theory and beyond|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920563207004161|journal=Nuclear Physics B: Proceedings Supplements|language=en|volume=171|pages=215–230|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2007.06.013|year=2007|bibcode=2007NuPhS.171..215F|arxiv=hep-th/0702137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This picture of transient dynamics explains computational efficiency of the digital memcomputing machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Ventra|first=M.|last2=Traversa|first2=F.

=== Low energy effective theories for dynamical chaos  ===
In physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking is known as "ordering". For example, the spontaneous breakdown of translational symmetry in a liquid is the mathematical essence of crystallization or spatial "ordering" of molecules into a lattice. Therefore, spontaneous TS breaking picture of chaotic dynamics is in a certain sense opposite to the semantics of word "chaos". Due to its temporal character, it is actually [[Chronos]], not [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], that appears to be the [[Greek primordial deities|primordial Greek deity]] closest in its spirit to the TS breaking order. Perhaps, a more accurate identifier than "chaos" should be coined for TS breaking in the future. As of this moment, this qualitatively new understanding of dynamical chaos already points into a research direction that may lead to resolutions of some important problems such as turbulence and neurodynamics. Namely, as in case of any other "ordering", a simplified yet accurate description of chaotic dynamics can be achieved in terms of the low-energy effective theory for an [[Phase transitions#Order parameters|order parameter]]. While the low-energy [[Effective action|effective description]] of chaotic dynamics may be very case specific, its order parameter must always be a representative of the gapless fermions or goldstinos of the spontaneously broken TS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4590">The '''Sussex Manifesto''' was a report on science and technology for development written at the request of the [[United Nations]] and published in 1970.

== History ==

In the late 1960s the United Nations asked for recommendations on science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/science/psd/un_unesco.pdf The rise and fall of S&amp;T on the UN agenda - 60 years of UN and UNESCO, Professor Dr Klaus-Heinrich Standke   Science and Public Policy,  November 2006  ]&lt;/ref&gt; from a team of academics at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and [[SPRU]] [[Science and Technology Policy Research]] (formerly called [[Science Policy Research Unit]]) at the [[University of Sussex]], UK.  This team became known as the Sussex Group and their report, ''Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade'', became known as the ''Sussex Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Sussex-Manifesto-IDS-Reprint.pdf The Sussex Manifesto: Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' was intended as the introductory chapter to the ''UN World Plan of Action on Science and Technology for Development''. But the solutions presented in the Manifesto were deemed too radical to be used for that purpose.  It was instead published in 1970 as an annex in ''Science and Technology for Development: Proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade'', a UN report by the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development (ACAST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0192-5121(1982)3%3A3%3C343%3ASATITN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K ACAST and the introduction of science and technology into the UN system]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' helped raise awareness of science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://sss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/385.pdf  Science, Technology and Development: Part of a course in Development Studies for first and second year engineering and medical students at the University of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, David Wield and Carol Barker, Social Studies of Science 1978; 8; 385]&lt;/ref&gt; in UN circles &lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=134280&amp;set=487E2528_2_7&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNESCO’s contribution to Stage 2 of the World Plan of Action for the Application of Science and Technology to Development; science and technology policies and institutions],&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the design of development institutions and was used for teaching courses in both North and South universities.

The Sussex Group were [[Hans Singer]] (Chairman), Charles Cooper (Secretary), R.C. Desai, [[Christopher Freeman]], Oscar Gish, Stephen Hill and Geoffrey Oldham.

== Today ==

In 2008 one of the authors of the original report Professor Geoff Oldham gave a seminar &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/event/steps-new-manifesto-seminar-geoff-oldham/ Professor Oldham's STEPS Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/news-at-ids-the-sussex-manifesto IDS News]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[STEPS Centre]] – a research centre and policy engagement based at IDS and SPRU. Following this event the STEPS Centre decided to create a new manifesto in association its partners around the world and Professor Oldham. The new publication, ''Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/wp-content/uploads/steps-manifesto_small-file.pdf Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2010, forty years after the original.

The New Manifesto has also been translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/publications/manifesto-translated-into-chinese-french-portuguese-and-spanish/ New Manifesto: translated versions]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The STEPS Centre is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1097">'''Weaponeering''' is the field of designing an attack with [[weapon]]s. It is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[weapon]]'' and ''[[engineering]]''. The term should not be confused with [[weapons engineering]], which is the actual engineering design and development of weapon systems.

The [[United States Department of Defense]] defines the term as the process of determining the quantity of a specific type of lethal or nonlethal weapons required to achieve a specific level of damage to a given target, considering target vulnerability, weapon effect, munitions delivery accuracy, damage criteria, probability of kill and weapon reliability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}
