'''Al Baker''' (September 4, 1874 – October 24, 1951) was a professional [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]. Al Baker was an inventor of many tricks that he marketed including his Dictionary Test, Al Baker Slates and his version of the Rice bowls. Many of his silk magic effects were included in Rice's ''Encyclopedia of Silk Magic''. Al Baker opened a magic shop with Martin Sunshine in [[Times Square]]. Al Baker also regularly contributed to ''[[The Sphinx: An Independent Magazine for Magicians|The Sphinx]]'' and other magic magazines.

==Biography==
He was born on September 4, 1874, in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]].

Al Baker was known by most of his magical contemporaries as an outstanding M.C., author, and inventor.&lt;ref name="Biography of Al Baker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compumagic.com/sam35/al_baker.html |title=Biography of Al Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was 21 was working in [[vaudeville]] as [[Illusionist|magician]] and [[ventriloquist]]. Though he was a performer at [[Coney Island]] as the [[Chautauqua]] &amp; [[Lyceum]] headliner, he also had a photo studio there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/coney-island-love-and-magic/37515/ |title=Coney Island Love and Magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Dean of the [[Society of American Magicians]] from 1941 to 1951.

In 1951 Al Baker wrote a book called ''Pet Secrets'', where he had the American [[mystery writer]], [[Clayton Rawson]] draw all his illustrations.

He died on October 24, 1951.

==Legacy==
Al Baker's dry humor and tongue in cheek approach to his advice to other magicians is timeless.&lt;ref name="Biography of Al Baker" /&gt; Al Baker was once quoted saying, "No matter how bad the show, or how little the kids, or how hard it is to get their attention, take a live rabbit and coil of paper out of your hat and you're safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denisbehr.de/quotes.html |title= On Universal Effects ~ Al Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternate ending''' ([[British English]]: '''alternative ending''') is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

==Examples in film==
Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's [[DVD]] release. These alternative endings are a special type of [[deleted scene]]. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:
*''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'': An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like ''The Butterfly Effect'', with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.
*''[[28 Days Later]]'': Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.
*''[[3 Ninjas]]'': The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'', [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[Showtime MAX]]; international [[DVD]]s have this version, as well.
*''[[Army of Darkness]]'': In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams "I slept too long!"
*''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'': When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...
*''[[Blade: Trinity]]'': The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director [[David S. Goyer]]. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.
*''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.
*''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'': Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his [[umbilical cord]] and dies, [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. This "[[Director's Cut]]" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.
*''[[Child's Play 2]]'': An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.
*''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'': After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).
*''[[Clerks]]'': Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.
*''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of ''three'' of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/alternateversions&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'': In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. McClane's police career is in ruins, and he is keen to take it out on Gruber, who he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.
*''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'': The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, "You happy now?")
*''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'': The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.
*''[[Fatal Attraction]]'': Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex "If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.
*''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'': Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.
*''[[Final Destination 2]]'': The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.
*''[[Final Destination 3]]'': The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.
*''[[The Final Destination]]'': In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, "The chain is broken." Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.
*''[[Final Destination 5]]'': In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.
*''[[First Blood]]'': In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.
*''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'': Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.
*''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'': An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.
*''[[Game of Death]]'': This movie has two alternative endings. In the [[Hong Kong]] [[Cantonese]]  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of [[Bruce Lee]]. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.
*''[[Happy Death Day]]'': An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.
*''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'': This movie had many different endings on whether [[Dakota Fanning]]'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.
*''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'': The "Monster Woman" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a "cure" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the "Alpha Monster" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the "Monster Woman" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the "Alpha Monster" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)
*''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'': In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads "I still know". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.
*''[[Infernal Affairs]]'': In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming ([[Andy Lau]]) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.
*''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'': In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.
*''[[Men in Black II]]'': The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.
* ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'': In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.
*''[[Paranormal Activity]]'': In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.
*''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'': Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel "do you believe in fate?" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point.
*''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'': Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down.
*''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'': [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] defeats [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed.
*''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'': Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the café considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.
*''[[Scream 3]]'': When [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices [[Sidney Prescott]] has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending.
*''[[Scary Movie 3]]'': Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from ''The Matrix'' and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].
*''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'': Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release.
*''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'': Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive.
*''[[Smokin' Aces]]'': Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them.
*''[[Super Troopers]]'': Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant.
*''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'': The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.
*''[[The Terminator]]'': The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending.
*''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'': The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'': Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.
*''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'': While Nicole and Michèle waiting in front of Stade Charléty, there was a duel between André and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings.
*''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'': Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of [[Jean Grey]] being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is now a professor; [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] coming back to [[Alberta, Canada]], specifically the very same tavern seen in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''; and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] keeping her powers.
* ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot.
* ''[[Whisper (film)|Whisper]]'': In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling.

==Examples in television==
In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.
*''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'': To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.
*''[[D.I.E]]'': In original ending, Yue Sir ([[Roger Kwok]]) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of [[mo lei tau]] comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening.
*''[[E.U. (TV series)|E.U.]]'': Due to the popularity of [[Michael Tse]]'s character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide.
*''[[Green Wing]]'': In the final [[Green Wing Special|Special]], Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.
*''[[Sex and the City]]'': In the series finale three endings were shot, in which [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'': (1) becomes engaged to [[Aleksandr Petrovsky]], (2) resumes her relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'': In the two part episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was [[Waylon Smithers]] rather than [[Maggie Simpson]]. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.)
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'': At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die.
*''[[Total Drama]]'': For every season of this animated "reality show", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air.
*''[[King of the Hill]]'': Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode "The Company Man"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features.
*''[[Psych]]'': the episode "100 Clues", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided  who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode "Right Turn or Left for Dead" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different.
*''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'': In the episode, "The Lady Killer," three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternate ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's.
*''[[Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series)|Secrets and Lies]]'': In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot.

==Examples in video games==
{{Main|Types_of_fiction_with_multiple_endings#Video_games|l1=Video games with multiple endings}}
Many video games also have alternative endings. These endings are generally posed after completing the game in a harder difficulty, or taking a different route through the game's storyline.

==Examples in music==
*English rock band [[Marillion]]'s 1994 [[concept album]] ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'' is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of ''Brave'' featured a [[multisided record|double groove]] on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs "The Great Escape" and "Made Again") or would instead play only an alternative version of "The Great Escape" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/brave.htm |title=Marillion – 'Brave' |publisher=marillion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
* [[Felix Salten]]’s ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'' differs greatly in the original [[German language]] (''Der Hund von Florenz'') and in the [[English language|English]] translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 | language=German | page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence: A Novel | date=1930 | location=New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | translator=Huntley Paterson | others=Illustrated by Kurt Wiese | pages=230– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

'''''Amy Unbounded''''' is an ongoing comic book series by [[Rachel Hartman]] that began in 1996.&lt;ref name="booklist"&gt; Robbins, Trina  (February 1, 2001). "Contemporary graphic novels for girls: a core list". ''[[Booklist]]'', Pg. 985(1) Vol. 100 No. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amy Unbounded'' won the 1998 [[Ignatz Award]] for Best Minicomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1998 Ignaz Award Winners|url=http://www.spxpo.com/1998-ignatz-award-recipients|publisher=SPXPO|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
''Amy Unbounded'' is set in the fictional fantasy kingdom of Goredd and features shape-shifting dragons that are capable of assuming human form. The story follows Amy, a nine-year-old girl whom Hartman has compared to "[[Anne of Green Gables]] and [[Harriet the Spy]]" in terms of personality.&lt;ref name=ST /&gt; The series has had two spinoffs, a prose novel entitled [[Seraphina (book)|Seraphina]] and the [[webcomic]] ''Return of the Mad Bun''.

'''''Armored Core: Project Phantasma''''' is a 1997 [[video game]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. It is part of the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series.  The storyline follows the original ''[[Armored Core (video game)|Armored Core]]''. The game was not released in Europe.

==Storyline==
A Raven operating out of [[Armored Core (video game)#Locations|Isaac City]] receives an unusual request. Not only is the request both vague and cryptic, stating simply: "Infiltrate the underground urban complex, Amber Crown,", but it also bypasses normal channels of communication and is sent directly to the Raven in question, without anyone else seeing the message. No sender name or corporate affiliation is mentioned, but the monetary reward promised is massive. Because of the amount, the mission will obviously be intensely dangerous, but Ravens aren't the type to shy away from any challenge. With interest piqued, the Raven climbs into the AC and heads toward Amber Crown.

==Background==
*'''Amber Crown''' - A mid-sized subterranean complex, large parts of which have fallen into disrepair. Rumors persist that a shadowy research group, known only as the "Doomsday Organization," is taking advantage of the neglected portions of the city and using them as sites on which to build and operate their facilities.
*'''Doomsday Organization''' - Shrouded in mystery, it is rumored that this so-called research organization is the beneficiary of financial backing contributed by a conglomeration of companies and the driving force behind "Project Phantasma."
*'''Project Phantasma''' - The codename believed to be assigned to a top-secret development project geared towards creating a new type of weapons system. The little information that exists regarding "Phantasma" points to a group known as the Doomsday Organization and strange happenings in Amber Crown.

===Characters===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Illustration 22.jpg|thumb|right|Sumika's AC]] --&gt;
*'''Sumika Juutilainen''' - A woman Raven operating in Amber Crown who was captured by the Doomsday Organization.  She was supposed to serve as an unwilling test subject for the mysterious Project Phantasma, but escaped just in time, and came back for revenge.  Sumika is the player’s primary client and partner throughout the game.  She pilots a unique pink and white AC known as "Ariake" which is lightly armored, highly mobile and uses a light (now known as PIXIE3) machine gun as its only weapon.  She is completely against the Doomsday Organization and all of its motives.
*'''Stinger''' - An "irregular" Raven working for the Doomsday Organization on Project Phantasma.  Stinger serves as the game’s primary antagonist.  His maniacal personality and mental instability make him a very dangerous threat.  Stinger pilots a custom white, grey and purple AC called "Vixen", which uses a powerful energy rifle (now known as DRAGON) and a special dual-bladed [[energy sword]] (TAROS).

==Gameplay==
''Project Phantasma'' continued from where ''[[Armored Core (video game)|Armored Core]]'' left off.  Players could either start a new game or convert their previous save data from ''Armored Core''.  Converting data allowed a player to carry over a number of parts that would otherwise be unavailable to a player who starts a new game like the powerful "Moonlight" laser blade.  ''Project Phantasma'' was the first AC game to introduce the concept of an Arena; the player was given the opportunity to face off against over 50 opponents of varying difficulty.  The Arena was an optional  feature, but if a player competed in the Arena they could earn extra credits and unlock new parts for their AC.

One notable aspect regarding the parts (particularly weapons) in the original Armored Core and its two PS1 expansions is that they are by far the most powerful in the series. For example, the original KARASAWA fired faster than most AST Rifles and Pulse Rifles in later games. The FINGER had 3000 ammo, and the Large Missile came in two styles, one that flew like a regular missile (discontinued after Master of Arena), and the traditional slow (though roughly twice as fast as later versions such as those in Last Raven) version. The slow version had ten missiles as opposed to the current four, and was the longest range missile of the first generation.

The '''Berousek family''' is a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[family]], originally from [[Vilémov (Havlíčkův Brod District)|Vilémov]], with members who have been [[circus performer]]s for two centuries. Skills include comedy, puppetry, acrobatics, equestrianism, bear training, tight rope walking, and juggling.

Berousek's dynasty dates back to 1756 when the family appeared in [[Vilémov (Havlíčkův Brod District)|Vilémov]]. The first performer from the family was '''Josef Berousek'''.

The '''Cirkus Berousek''' was founded around 1920 in [[Bohemia]] by fourth generation '''Hynek Ignac Berousek''', then taken over by his son '''Antonin Berousek''' and renamed '''Circus Central''', and then nationalized in 1951.

==Bobby Berosini==
'''Bohumil Berousek''', known professionally as '''Bobby Berosini'''&lt;ref name="NSC"&gt;[http://www1.law.umkc.edu/Faculty/levit/DefamationPrivacy/Winter2005/PETAvBobby.pdf PETA v. Bobby Berosini] from the [[Supreme Court of Nevada]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Czechs|Czech]]-born [[United States|American]] entertainer best known for his long-running show involving live [[orangutan]]s.

Berosini emigrated from [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1964, and eventually made his way to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. He was a fixture at the [[Stardust Resort &amp; Casino]] starting in the mid-1970s, and his act was featured in ''[[Going Ape!]]'', a 1981 comedy film starring [[Tony Danza]] and [[Danny DeVito]]. Earlier, in 1978, one of his orangutans, Manis, appeared as Clyde in ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way but Loose]]'' with [[Clint Eastwood]].

In 1989 a Stardust dancer secretly videotaped Berosini grabbing, slapping, punching and shaking his orangutans before going on stage with them.&lt;ref name="NSC"/&gt; The dancer, Ottavio Gesmundo, sent the tapes to [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], and the resulting outcry forced the Stardust to cancel Berosini's act for a few days.  He returned to star in the "Lido de Paris" at the Stardust until it closed in 1991 and then starred in the resort's "Enter the Night" for several years. Although he later moved his act to [[Branson, Missouri]], he has only made sporadic appearances in Las Vegas since then. The [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] later canceled Berosini's wildlife permit.

Berosini sued Gesmundo, PETA and another animal rights group, the [[Performing Animal Welfare Society]], for [[defamation]] and [[invasion of privacy]]. In 1990, a jury found in favor of Berosini and awarded him $3.1 million in damages. However, the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] threw out the judgment in 1994, saying that the tape was an accurate portrayal of Berosini's behavior and fell within the realm of "protected opinion." It also ruled that Berosini had no expectation of privacy in the crowded backstage area.&lt;ref name="NSC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcfp.org/news/1994/0222f.html High court throws out $4.2 million judgment animal trainer won in libel, privacy suit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611200819/http://www.rcfp.org/news/1994/0222f.html |date=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This judgment was affirmed on a rehearing of the case a year later, and in 1996, a [[Nevada District Courts|Nevada District Court]] judge ordered Berosini to pay a total of $417,000 in attorneys' fees to PETA and PaWS.&lt;ref&gt;Geer, Carri. [http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1998/Apr-30-Thu-1998/news/7409815.html Animal rights group's requests on Berosini assets rejected]. [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]], 1998-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA subsequently alleged that Berosini had moved more than $2 million out of the country to avoid paying court costs. Berosini and his wife, Joan, claimed that the money was for a land investment in Central and South America. In February 2000, a federal magistrate ordered Berosini to return the money, finding that Berosini was deliberately hiding his assets.&lt;ref&gt;Geer, Carri. [http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2000/Feb-15-Tue-2000/news/12963917.html Berosini ordered to return $2 million to United States]. [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]], 2000-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Berosini and PETA agreed to a settlement in which Berosini paid $340,000 in court costs and interest. However, two years later, Berosini was ordered to pay three law firms $250,000 for the time they spent trying to find the $2 million.&lt;ref name="LRJCourtorder"&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Mar-11-Mon-2002/news/18269503.html Former showman and his wife ordered to pay three law firms]. [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]], 2002-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Berosini contested this judgment four times on appeal and lost each time, and PETA claims that it is considering further legal action against Berosini for filing a frivolous appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/mc/NewsItem.asp?id=9491 Court rules that orangutan beater must pay PETA attorneys]--PETA press release&lt;/ref&gt;

Berosini told ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in 1993 that he and his wife received numerous death threats against themselves and their orangutans in the middle of the night. He also said he had to shop at a different supermarket every day for several months due to threats that the orangutans' food would be poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vicki |last=Hearne |authorlink=Vicki Hearne |coauthors= |title=Can an ape tell a joke? |url= |work=[[Harper's Magazine]] |publisher= |date=1993-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Billy Rose's Aquacade''''' was a music, dance and swimming show produced by [[Billy Rose]] at the [[Great Lakes Exposition]] in 1937.
[[File:2-Billy-Rose-Aquacade-Worlds-Fair-1939.jpg|thumb|Audience members viewing The Billy Rose Aquacade at the 1939-40 Worlds Fair.]]

Later ''Aquacade'' moved to the  [[1939 New York World's Fair]] where it was the most successful production of the fair (Lowe). The [[Art Deco]] 11,000 seat amphitheatre at the north end of Meadow Lake was designed by architects [[Sloan &amp; Robertson]]. Shows were staged by [[John Murray Anderson]] to the orchestrations of [[Ted Royal]]. The pool and the 300 by {{convert|200|ft|m|sing=on}} stage could be hidden behind a lighted {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} high curtain of water.

The inaugural ''Aquacade'' starred [[Olympics|Olympians]] [[Eleanor Holm]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller]] (later replaced by [[Buster Crabbe]]). Rose married Holm after divorcing his first wife, comedian [[Fanny Brice]]. 

[[Duke Ellington]] played in a 1955 edition for several weeks. 

For the New York ''Aquacade'', Rose interviewed 5,000 applicants and chose 500 dancers, actors and swimmers. [[Gertrude Ederle]], a [[Flushing, Queens]] resident and the first woman to swim the [[English Channel]], was an ''Aquacade'' star. Queens Borough President [[Donald R. Manes]] dedicated the pool to her in 1978.

In 1940, ''Aquacade'' also opened in [[San Francisco]] at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] where newcomer [[Esther Williams]] replaced Holm. 

The [[New York State Marine Amphitheatre]] was torn down in 1996 because of local opposition to renovating the asbestos-contaminated structure as a concert venue.

The game's campaign follows the Task Force 141, a [[special forces]] unit fronted by Captain [[Soap MacTavish]], as they hunt Vladimir Makarov, leader of the Russian Ultranationalist party, and the [[United States Army Rangers]], who are defending the country from a Russian invasion. The game's main playable characters are Sergeant Gary "Roach" Sanderson, of the 141, and Private James Ramirez, of the Army Rangers, with Captain MacTavish becoming playable later in the campaign. An expansive multiplayer mode is featured in the game, with several new features and modes that were not seen in its predecessor.

Development for the game began in 2008, when it was still known as ''Call of Duty 6''. It uses the [[IW engine|IW 4.0]] engine, an improved version of ''Call of Duty 4''{{'}}s IW 3.0. Infinity Ward was inspired by real-life conflicts when developing the campaign mode. They initially tested the multiplayer mode by playing an in-house beta version of the game. ''Modern Warfare 2'' was officially announced on February 11, 2009.&lt;ref name="Reannounced" /&gt; Teasing of the game began in March, with short trailers being released for the game and, eventually, a full reveal trailer. The multiplayer mode was revealed shortly after. Two [[downloadable content]] packs were released for it post-release, each containing four new multiplayer maps.

''Modern Warfare 2'' has been critically acclaimed by various gaming websites as one of the greatest first-person shooters of all time. Within 24 hours of release, the game sold approximately 4.7&amp;nbsp;million copies in North America and the United Kingdom. As of early 2018, the game has sold over 25 million copies and still has an active multiplayer base with third party servers being hosted in Melbourne, Australia. In addition to its release, a [[comic book]] series based on one of the game's characters was also produced, entitled ''[[Modern Warfare 2: Ghost]]''.&lt;ref name="Comic" /&gt; Despite the game's success, it was subject to [[Controversies surrounding Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|some controversies]], with one surrounding [[No Russian|a playable level]] that had the player carry out a terror attack on an airport. A sequel, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]'', was released in 2011 and finishes the ''Modern Warfare'' storyline.

==Gameplay==
The [[gameplay]] of ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'' revolves around fast-paced gunfights against enemy combatants.&lt;ref name="RPS Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meer|first=Alec|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/11/17/wot-i-think-modern-warfare-2/|title=Wot I Think: Modern Warfare 2|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player controls a soldier, and can perform several actions, including jump, sprint, crouch, lay [[Prone position|prone]], and aim down their gun's [[iron sights]].{{sfn|Infinity Ward|2009|p=2}} When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter their [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD), denoting that they have taken damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, their [[Health (gaming)|health]] will recover.{{sfn|Infinity Ward|2009|p=5}} The HUD also displays other information, such as a compass, a [[mini-map]], and the player's current ammunition count.{{sfn|Infinity Ward|2009|p=3-4}} The game features traditional guns, including [[assault rifle]]s, [[shotgun]]s, [[handgun]]s, and [[sniper rifle]]s.

==Plot==

===Characters and setting===
During the single-player campaign, the player controls five different characters from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player primarily controls Sergeant Gary "Roach" Sanderson, a British member of an international Special Forces unit named Task Force 141. In addition to Roach, the player will also assume control of [[Private First Class#United States|Private First Class]] Joseph Allen ([[Troy Baker]]) and [[Private (rank)#United States|Private]] James Ramirez of the [[United States Army Rangers]].&lt;ref name="E3 2009 IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/989/989984p1.html|title=E3 2009: Modern Warfare 2 Impressions|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate=June 2, 2009|last=Ocampo|first=Jason|publisher=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The now Captain [[Soap MacTavish|John "Soap" MacTavish]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]) serves as a senior member of Task Force 141, acting as Roach's superior officer and becomes the playable character in the final three missions of the game.&lt;ref name="IGN Early Reveal"/&gt; Lastly, the player briefly assumes the role of an astronaut stationed on the [[International Space Station]] during the height of the war between the United States and Russia.

The game's [[Non-player character|non-playable characters]] (NPCs) feature prominently in the story: For Task Force 141, Lieutenant Simon "Ghost" Riley ([[Craig Fairbrass]]), who conceals his face with a skull print [[balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] serves as Soap's second in command.&lt;ref name="MTV comic preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/08/17/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-comic-book-series-coming-from-wildstorm/|title='Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2' Comic Book Series Coming From Wildstorm|last=Frushtick|first=Russ|date=August 17, 2009|accessdate=August 17, 2009|work=[[MTV]] Multiplayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the United States Army Rangers, Sergeant Foley ([[Keith David]]), along with his subordinate, Corporal Dunn ([[Barry Pepper]]), is initially Joseph Allen's squad leader, and becomes James Ramirez's squad leader later in the story. [[Lieutenant General]] Shepherd ([[Lance Henriksen]]) is the commander of the United States Army Rangers and Task Force 141. Other supporting characters returning from Call of Duty 4 include Captain John Price ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]), MacTavish's former commanding officer in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Air Service]] who was imprisoned in Russia, and Russian informant "Nikolai" (Sven Holmberg).

===Story===
Despite the efforts of the U.S. Marine Corps and British Special Air Service in the previous game, the ultranationalists seize control of the Russian Federation, making Imran Zakhaev a martyr and straining diplomatic relations with the United States. Shortly after this, an ultranationalist named Vladimir Makarov, Zakhaev's right-hand man, begins a campaign of revenge against the West, by committing acts of terrorism on European and International soil over the course of five years.

In 2016, Private First Class Joseph Allen participates in a military operation alongside United States Army Rangers stationed in [[Afghanistan]], by assisting them in taking back a city from insurgents. Impressed by Allen's capabilities, General Shepherd recruits him into Task Force 141. While Allen prepares for an upcoming assignment, Captain John "Soap" MacTavish and Sergeant Gary "Roach" Sanderson infiltrate a Russian airbase in the [[Tian Shan]] mountains to retrieve an Attack Characterization System (ACS) module from a downed American satellite.

Allen is soon sent on an [[No Russian|undercover mission]] for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], joining Vladimir Makarov in a [[mass shooting]] at an airport in Moscow, Russia. Afterwards, Makarov kills Allen, aware of his true identity, and leaves his body behind to [[false flag|spark a war]] between Russia and the United States. Outraged by an apparent American-sponsored terrorist attack, Russia retaliates by launching a surprise [[Mainland invasion of the United States|invasion]] on the [[East Coast of the United States]].{{Efn|Following the invasion, Task Force 141 concludes that the ACS module had already been compromised before its retrieval.}}&lt;ref name="MW2-ps3"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|developer=[[Infinity Ward]]|date=November 14, 2009|publisher=[[Activision]]|version=1.04|platform=[[PlayStation 3]]/[[Xbox 360]]|level=Second Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no evidence of Makarov's involvement in the airport massacre, Task Force 141 is sent to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to capture his arms dealer, Alexandro Rojas. They succeed and learn that Makarov's nemesis is being held in a Russian [[gulag]]. They assault the gulag and rescue the prisoner: [[Captain Price]], Soap's previous commanding officer in the [[Special Air Service|SAS]].{{efn|In ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3|Modern Warfare 3]]'', it is revealed that Price was captured during "[[Find Makarov: Operation Kingfish|Operation Kingfish]]" in 2013, a mission to kill or capture Makarov.}}

Price agrees to help Task Force 141 but insists on ending the United States' war with Russia. After raiding a Russian port, Price launches a [[submarine-launched ballistic missile|ballistic missile]] towards [[Washington, D.C.]] and detonates it in the [[near space|upper atmosphere]]. The resulting [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] blast disables all electronic devices across the eastern seaboard, giving the Americans a much-needed advantage.&lt;ref&gt;"Soap's Journal". ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's Hardened edition''. Activision (November 8, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers fighting in D.C. narrowly avoid a [[scorched earth|bombing run of Russian-occupied strategic structures]] by the [[United States Air Force]], lighting green flares atop the [[White House]] to show that the city remains in American hands.

Meanwhile, Task Force 141 narrows Makarov's hiding place to two locations; an [[aircraft boneyard]] in Afghanistan, and Makarov's safehouse on the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]]-Russian border. Roach and Simon "Ghost" Riley successfully raid the safehouse, but are then betrayed and murdered by Shepherd. It soon becomes evident that Shepherd is the catalyst of the Russian-U.S. war, intent on cementing his status as a national hero and prolonging military action as revenge for the men he lost to the nuclear device five years earlier, during the [[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare|campaign against Khaled Al-Asad]].

Price and Soap learn of Shepherd's betrayal and escape a battle between his and Makarov's forces at the boneyard. After learning of Shepherd's mountain base in Afghanistan from Makarov, Price and Soap raid the base to take revenge on Shepherd in a [[suicide mission]]. The duo pursue Shepherd's boat, and Price manages to shoot down his helicopter extraction as he and Soap tumble over a waterfall.&lt;ref name="MW2-ps3"/&gt; A dazed Soap stumbles towards the crash site and attempts to kill Shepherd, but is stabbed in the chest. While Price arrives and engages Shepherd in a fist fight, Soap pulls the knife out of his chest and throws it at Shepherd, killing him. Nikolai arrives and helps Price evacuate Soap for medical attention.

''Modern Warfare 2'' was originally announced as ''Call of Duty 6''.&lt;ref name="CoD6 Announced"/&gt; The game was first announced under the title ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'' by Activision on December 3, 2008.&lt;ref name="ModWar2 Confirmed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/691461/Activision_Announces_New_Call_of_Duty_Guitar_Hero_and_Tony_Hawk_Games.html |title=Activision Announces New 'Call of Duty', 'Guitar Hero', and 'Tony Hawk' Games |date=December 3, 2008 |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |last=Leahy |first=Brian |publisher=G4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activision subsequently retracted its announcement, stating that any information about an upcoming ''Call of Duty'' game was "speculative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/news/04-12-2008-10107.html |title=Activision: CoD Modern Warfare 2 reports 'speculative' |date=December 4, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2009 |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |publisher=Videogamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinity Ward then asserted that it had not officially confirmed its latest project at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourzerotwo.com/2009/01/11/beware-of-fake-cod5-beta-invites/ |title=Beware of fake "COD5" Beta Invites |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 29, 2009 |last=Bowling |first=Robert |publisher=Infinity Ward |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123155224/http://www.fourzerotwo.com/2009/01/11/beware-of-fake-cod5-beta-invites/ |archivedate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 11, 2009, Activision officially announced ''Modern Warfare 2'' and set a tentative release date for "[[Christmas and holiday season|Holiday]] 2009."&lt;ref name="Reannounced"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/953/953538p1.html |title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 This Holiday |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2009 |last=Ocampo |first=Jason |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was tested in an internal [[Betaware|beta]] by the development team. While both ''Call of Duty 4'' and ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'' had been preceded by public multiplayer betas, no such beta was released for ''Modern Warfare 2'' because it was determined that, according to Community Manager Robert Bowling, no public beta was needed unless the internal beta did not provide adequate feedback.&lt;ref name="No beta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/101/1015777p1.html |title=No Public Beta for Modern Warfare 2 |last=Brudvig |first=Erik |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game utilizes the in-house [[IW engine|IW 4.0 game engine]], which is claimed to be a generation beyond the capabilities of the engine used in ''Call of Duty 4''.&lt;ref name="Engine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/100/1003728p2.html |title=The 10 Best Game Engines of This Generation |last=Stead |first=Chris |date=July 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 15, 2009 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although proprietary, the game is based on an unspecified [[id Tech]] engine, and can accommodate larger worlds, enhanced graphic detail, and more efficient rendering.&lt;ref name="TexStream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourzerotwo.com/?p=686 |title=Modern Warfare 2: Texture Streaming |author=fourzertwo aka Robert Bowling |date=August 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922222009/http://www.fourzerotwo.com/?p=686 |archivedate=September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infinity Ward]] has addressed the issue of enemies that continually respawn at different points of a level.&lt;ref name="GS Early Reveal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6209543.html?tag=recent_news;img;1 |title=First Modern Warfare 2 details emerge |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2009 |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |publisher=GameSpot |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629004338/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6209543.html?tag=recent_news%3Bimg%3B1 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer demonstrated that the game engine uses a "dynamic [[AI]]", which has replaced the infinite respawn system and allows enemies to act more independently. These "smarter" enemies are designed to actively seek out and drive the player forward through a level, and can break away from set behaviors such as following a designated route in order to attack. The player cannot depend on enemies to be found in the same locations as a previous play-through because enemies will behave differently each time a level is played.&lt;ref name="standard box" /&gt;

On March 25, 2009, a teaser trailer for the game was revealed at the Game Developer Choice Awards ceremony in San Francisco.

Criticisms of the game are directed towards a variety of aspects, but focus on the short length of the single player campaign. IGN's Mark Bozon remarks that the single-player of "''Modern Warfare 2'' is surprisingly short, and doesn't live up to the standard set by previous ''Call of Duty'' games."&lt;ref name="MW2X360REV-IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/104/1043366p1.html|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Xbox 360 Review|last=Bozon |first=Mark |date=November 10, 2009|publisher=IGN|accessdate=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many reviewers have complained about the lack of innovation to the formula of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/modern-warfare-2-review|title=Eurogamer Review|publisher=Eurogamer|accessdate=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge Online Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/review-modern-warfare-2|title=Edge Online Review|website=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Online]]|publisher=[[Future US]]|accessdate=November 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112085903/http://www.edge-online.com/features/review-modern-warfare-2|archivedate=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/104/1043273p1.html|title=IGN UK Review|publisher=IGN UK|accessdate=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Famitsu'' named ''Modern Warfare 2'' as the number one game on the top 10 video games sold in 2009, beating games such as ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]'', ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/game20091230.shtml|title=Magicbox Gaming News, December 30, 2009|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also gave the game a score of 39/40, being one of the few Western games released in Japan to have the same score as ''Grand Theft Auto IV''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5416505/modern-warfare-2-came-this-close-to-a-perfect-famitsu-score|title=Modern Warfare 2 Came *This* Close to a Perfect Famitsu Score|accessdate=January 10, 2010|date=December 1, 2009|publisher=Kotaku|author=Michael McWhertor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical problems===
After the [[PlayStation Network outage|successful hack]] on the [[PlayStation 3]] in January 2011, some ''Modern Warfare 2'' players on the PlayStation 3 have had their stats hacked or completely deleted. [[Infinity Ward]] replied that their advice was to play in private games, waiting for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] to fix the problems on the platform side, saying that they could not patch the security problem themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/01/17/blame-mw2-hacks-on-compromised-ps3-security-says-infinity-ward/|title=Bowling: I-Ward will "not rely solely on platform security" after PS3 crack |publisher=''[[VG247]]'' |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 20, 2011|quote=''"updates to the game through patches will not resolve this problem, unless the security exploit itself is resolved on the platform," said Bowling.(...)If you are concerned about playing with players who are hacking, I encourage you to play exclusively with friends by utilizing the party or private match options in Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty 4 to avoid such players as much as possible until this issue is resolved by Sony.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cassino''', also known as '''Casino''', is an Italian fishing [[card game]] for two, three, four (possibly in two partnerships), or even theoretically five players. It is the only one to have penetrated the English-speaking world. First recorded in 1797, it seems to have been heavily elaborated in 19th-century American practice.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Card Games'', p. 59, David Parlett, {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly played by two with a standard deck of [[playing card|playing cards]], the object of the game being to score 21 points by fishing up cards displayed on the table. It is very similar to and probably descended from the Italian game [[Scopa]].

==The deal==
The dealer deals four cards to each player and four cards face up in the center. Traditionally, the deal is in twos: two cards at a time to each player. The remainder of the deck is temporarily put aside. After everyone has played their four cards, another hand of four cards is dealt to each player from the remaining cards (two at a time), but no more cards are dealt to the table after the first deal. After these cards have been played there is another deal, and this continues until all 52 cards have been dealt. The dealer announces "cards" when dealing the last cards. After the last cards have been played, and the hand scored, the deal passes to the left for the next round.

==The play==
Beginning with the player to the dealer's left, each player plays one card at a time, performing one (or more) of the following actions:

* '''Trailing''': Any card may be discarded face up to the table.
* '''Pairing''': Any card may be used to take one or more cards of the same number, or a build with the same value, that is face up on the table.
* '''Combining''': A number card may be used to take two or more cards whose pips total the number on the card being used to take them. For example, a player may take a 3 and a 6 with a 9, or may take a 2, 4, and 4 with a 10.  
* '''Building''': Cards may be built upon in one of two ways (see [[#Building|Building]]).

Players may perform two of the above actions only when pairing and combining simultaneously; ''e.g.'' a player may take a 3, a 4 and a 7 with his own seven.

Players with builds on the table are limited in the actions they are permitted to make. This is described in more detail below.

Face cards do not have a denomination in Cassino and are not available for building. The face-cards may only be paired one at a time; if there are two queens on the table, only one queen can be paired up. This removes the possibility of a so-called "orphan" face card remaining and preventing further sweeps.

An ace has a numerical value of 1.

Cards are usually left on the table after each player's final hand is exhausted. These cards are given to the last player to take in cards through pairing or combining. It is common for the dealer, if dealt a face-card in the final hand, to hold this until the final play, as they are certain to pair with it.

==Building==
Under the first type of building, a player may lay one card on top of another if their total equals the total of a card in their hand, and announce that the two cards are built to the total. For example, a player may build a 2 onto a 7 and announce "building nine," provided they have a 9 in their hand. The two cards cannot be split up for pairing or combining and are treated as a single nine.

Builds of this type may be taken in by any player by pairing. The building player's adversaries may also take in a build by combination, increasing the capturing number; that is, an eight build may be combined with an ace if an adversary holds a nine. Any player may also continue to build on a build, for example, a seven build could be built to nine by a player with a 2 and a 9. The player who originally builds may also re-build, but only if they hold all appropriate cards: they would have to hold both a 7 and a 9 to make the required building steps.

Under the second type of building, called "multiple building," "natural building", or "double building," a player may lay one card on top of another if their values are the same, and announce that the two cards are built together. That is, a player can place a 7 on top of another 7, or on top of a 5 and a 2 which have been built to 7, and announce "building sevens," provided that he has a 7 in his hand. The built cards are gathered only with another 7. As with the first build type, a player must hold the card necessary to gather his build for the natural build to be permissible. Importantly, the capturing number of a multiple build can never be changed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html#play&lt;/ref&gt;

An optional rule is that, when building in this manner, players may combine other cards on the table, and build in the first manner. For example, suppose the cards on the table are 2 K 6 5 8, and the player holds a 3 and an 8. They may play their 3 onto the 5 to "build eight" and in the same move "build eights" by gathering the 5-3, the 8, and the 6-2 together onto one pile, taking in all five cards on their next play.

===Advantages gained through building===
Building exists as a means of protecting cards from being captured by adversaries. The first form of building is a weaker form of protection, and primarily protects cards against combination by mid-to-high range cards. Natural building is a much stronger protection, and prevents adversaries from taking cards unless they hold a card of specific face value, one of which the builder already knows resides in their own hand.

The value of building decreases significantly as the number of players in the game increases. In a two-player game, one requires only one adversary to be bereft of the necessary cards; in a four-player game, one requires three adversaries to be lacking the necessary cards to steal a build. As such, building effectively in a two-player game can be very advantageous, but in a four-player game is very difficult.

===Acting with builds on the table===
At least three rule variants exist dictating the actions which may be taken by a player who has a build on the table:
*'''Variant 1''': a player with a build on the table is not permitted to trail a card until that build has been taken in or rebuilt upon by an adversary; they may, however, pair or continue their "build" with any card on the table.
*'''Variant 2''': a player with a build on the table is obliged to either take in that build, by pairing or combination, or to add to that build on their next turn.
*'''Variant 3''': A player with a build on the table cannot trail.  Play &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; initiate from the hand.  Continuing a build from &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; cards on the table is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; allowed.  You must either take in the build, duplicate it or increase it, OR defer by starting another build or assuming ownership of an opponent's build.  A build 'belongs' to the last player that set its value.  You may assume ownership of a build started by another by increasing it.  But only if it consists of a single combination, i.e., not duplicated.  You may have more than one build, but only one of any particular value, and having a build of the same value of another (an adversary's) makes no sense at all.
While [[Edmond Hoyle|Hoyle]] recommends variant 1, all variants are very common in different regions. The regional variant of this rule in particular should always be checked before play.

Which variant is used changes the tactics, particularly in a two-player game. Under variant 1, the builder has a profound advantage; if they know that their adversary lacks the cards necessary to steal their build, they can often take several cards trailed by their adversary before taking in their build at the end of the round. Variant 2 allows the adversary to trail a card they wish to subsequently capture without the risk of it being taken, reducing the builder's advantage.

==Scoring==
The round is over when the stock has been exhausted, and the last deal played. Players count their tricks and score points as follows:

* Higher number of cards: 1
* Higher number of spades: 1
* 10 of diamonds ("big cassino", "big ten", or "good ten"): 3
* 2 of spades: ("little cassino", "little deuce", "good two", or "spy two"): 2
* Each ace: 1
* Each clearing of the board known as a "Sweep" : 1 extra point

If "most cards" or "most spades" are held by two or more players, no points are awarded in that category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html#scoring&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus there are 11 points to be won in each round if there are no sweeps scored and there is not a tie for number of cards. Typically, when at least one player has reached a score of 21 or more at the end of a round, the winner is the player to score the highest after tallying points.

In one two-player variation, a player can call for a game to be concluded once they are convinced they hold sufficient cards to bring their score to 21; if they do have 21 points, they win regardless of their adversary's score; if they do not have 21 points, their adversary wins.

===All 11 Points===
If one player has won the entire 11 points, some rules state that this player will be awarded an extra point for 12 total points in the round. Other rules state that this is a "skunk" if it occurs in the first round, and therefore that player wins. In other variations, taking all traditional 11 points in a single round is an automatic win, no matter when it occurs.

==Rules variants==
===Sweeps===
A '''sweep''' is declared by a player who manages to capture all face-up cards from the table. In some localities, each sweep is worth an additional point. The opponent has no move except to trail, and a follow-on sweep may result. Points for sweeps are awarded after the base 11 points, in the event that two players reach 21 in the same round. In another variation, trailing the five of spades sweeps the table, the sweep giving one point.

===Sudden-death scoring===
There is a variation in which sweeps are scored as they occur; if the sweeper had 20 points (or more, due to a tie score), the sweep would end the round instantly.  A scoring variation in which each point card is scored as it is captured also exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html Rules of Casino at pagat.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a variation devised in Michigan, a player who defaults on his duty after building gives up 2 points at the time of the violation.  This is sometimes an acceptable cost to trap cards from the other player in builds the player cannot take.  Sweeps also score 2 points.  In a series of "rounds to 5," any three instant scores (sweeps or defaults) against the same player ends the round.

These [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden-death]] variations make short-term tactics more important in certain situations than the longer-term goal of achieving the high score for the round.

===Face cards===
In some regions, all four face-cards of the same rank may be gathered simultaneously. This allows natural building with face-cards, while still removing the possibility of an "orphan" card. However, this provides no particular advantage if all four face cards are shared between one player and the table, as is necessary to build in such a manner.

===Initial Pairs===
Any pairs dealt to the table at the start of the round may be automatically granted to the first player to move, regardless of whether or not that player has a card to capture them. These cards cannot be built upon, but multiple pairs may constitute an automatic sweep if the table is cleared this way. This rule variation is intended to counteract the advantage of later players' ability to poach or modify builds started by the first player, by awarding extra points at the start.

==Game variations==
===Five players===
Five-player Cassino can be played by removing the deuces of hearts, diamonds and clubs, and by giving an extra card to each player on the last deal.

===Royal Cassino===
In '''Royal Cassino''', face cards are given number values upon which building may occur: jacks count as 11, queens as 12, kings as 13. For example, a player could combine a jack and a two with a king, since 11+2=13, and all applicable building laws remain.  An Ace is 1 or 14, the player's choice.  If trailed, it is not yet determined.  If not, it is fixed.  There are no 'Face Cards'.  Sweeps do not count.  The total points is always 11.  You may play to 6 or 21.  Ties are possible if no one has the majority of spades, broken by another hand played for 6.

In '''Buckeye Cassino''', all rules of Royal Cassino are inherited. In addition, the ten of diamonds ('Big Ten') holds two values: ten and eleven, poking fun at college basketball's [[Big Ten Conference]], which then consisted of 11 teams.

===Trailing-royals Cassino===
In the '''Trailing-royals Cassino''' variant, orphaned face cards are not considered a problem. Face cards may be naturally built or paired in any way, so a player may gather three of the same face card simultaneously.  The remaining face card will be an orphan, because there is no card left with which to capture it.  Such cards remain on the table until the end of the round, and are taken by whoever performed the final capture, as are all other cards left on the table. This method of play does not pair well with the preceding variant that rewards sweeps, because having orphaned cards on the table prevents sweeps.

==Pluck Cassino==
'''Pluck Cassino''' is an interesting and popular modern variation that follows all the rules of classic Cassino, with an optional additional play option called "pluck". Each player has one opportunity each time cards are dealt to "pluck" a card from the table and add it to their pile of "won" cards. Players still need to play a card on their turn, plucking is an additional move that they can make either before or after playing their card. The player may pluck at any time during play of that deal, with the following restrictions:
* Point cards cannot be plucked - so plucking excludes A's, big casino (10 of diamonds) and little casino (2 of spades).
*Plucking cannot be done when there is only one card left on the table i.e. causing a sweep with a pluck is disallowed.
*Plucking cannot be used to get the last trick of the round (after the deal pile is exhausted).
*Players are not allowed to pluck a card they just played on the same turn.

==Portuguese Cassino==
The gameplay of '''Portuguese Cassino''' is the same as the Italian version, except for the following differences:

* The game is either 2 player or 4 players split in 2 teams
* The first player/ team to reach 31 points or more is declared the winner.
*'''Scoring''': points allocation are as follows:
** Highest number of cards: 3
** Highest number of spades: 1
** 10 of diamonds ("manina"): 2
** 2 of spades: 1
** Each ace: 1
** Each clearing of the board known as a "clearance" : 1 extra point

If both players/teams finish the round with 26 cards each, the player/team with the most spades is awarded the points for most cards.

==California Cassino==
'''California Cassino''' is a variation for two, three, four or six players, played with a standard deck of cards. The object is to score the most points through acquiring certain cards or by acquiring a certain number of cards.

===The play===
The dealer deals four cards to each player, one at a time, and, in the first deal, four cards face up to the table. This is the only point at which cards are placed on the table by the dealer. Beginning with the player to the dealer's left, each player plays one card at a time, performing one of the following actions:

* '''Laying''': Any card need to be discarded face up to the table.
* '''Pairing''': Any card need to be use to take another card of the same rank, or a build with the same value (to know what the build is, please continue reading).
* '''Adding''': A number card need to be used to take two or more cards whose rank total the number on the card being used to take them.  For example: a player needs to take a 2 and a 5 with a 7, or may take a 2, 4, and 4 with a 10.
*'''Building''': Cards need to be placed upon one another to draw a new value on the table. The way for this way is listed below.

Face cards don't have a denomination and are not available for combining or building, though multiple face cards can be paired simultaneously. For example, if a player has a queen in their hand and two queens lie on the table, that player can acquire all three queens.

While other forms of [[cassino]] use "sweeps," a point for clearing the table, California Cassino prohibits points based on sweeps. Cards are usually left on the table after each player's final hand is exhausted. These cards are given to the last player to take in cards through pairing or combining.

===Scoring===
The round is over when the deck has been exhausted and the last deal played. Players count their cards and score points as follows:

* Higher number of cards: 3
* Higher number of spades: 1
* 10 of diamonds ("big cassino" or "good ten"): 2
* 2 of spades: ("little cassino" or "good two"): 1
* Each ace: 1 (4 points total for aces)

There are 11 points to be won in each round. If "most cards" or "most spades" are held by two or more players, no points are awarded in those respective categories. The number of rounds played is determined by the number of players present. Each player must deal twice in a complete match, so if there are 3 players, then there are 6 rounds of play. At the end of the 6 rounds - the player with the highest score is the winner.

==Diamond Cassino==
Diamond Cassino is a variant of Cassino which is similar to standard Cassino, but it is not played with the picture cards. It is, therefore, played with a forty-card pack. Players are dealt three cards each, and four cards are dealt to the table; these are the cards which the players aim to capture. In this game, players get points if they capture all aces, and extra points if they capture the seven of diamonds. Diamond Cassino has been described as an Italo-American version of Scopone.

==Callabra==
In this game, each player is dealt three cards, and five are dealt to the table. Players may trail or take cards from the table, if they have cards which match the cards on the table, or if they have two cards which add up to a card on the table and equal the table card's value. In this game, Jacks are worth eleven points, Queens are worth twelve points and Kings are worth thirteen points. Game ends when a player finally clears all the cards from the table. (SOURCE: The Penguin Book of Card Games).

==Tablanette==
Tablanette is said to be of Russian provenance. In this game, each player has six cards, and a player with a jack may use it to clear the whole table. At the end of a round, players score points for holding the most cards, and extra points if they are holding picture
cards.&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Book of Card Games'' (Penguin, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spade Cassino==
In '''Spade Cassino''', players are awarded two points for gathering the jack of spades, and one point for each additional spade, in addition to the one point awarded to the player with the most spades. This lifts the number of points awarded in one round to 25. A game of Spade Cassino is usually played to 61.

==Draw Cassino==
In '''Draw Cassino''', players draw a replacement card each time they make a play, so that they always have four cards in hand (until the end), rather than being dealt cards in discrete rounds of four.

'''''Cathouse: The Series''''' was an [[HBO]] television series that documents the professional lives of the workers at the [[Moonlite BunnyRanch]], a legal [[brothel]] in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cathouse: The Series|work= [[DVD Talk]]|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35262/cathouse-the-series/|accessdate= | first=| last=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cathouse: The Series|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=|url= http://tv.nytimes.com/show/176898/Cathouse-The-Series/overview|accessdate= | first= | last=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cathouse: The Series|work= [[DVD Verdict]]|date=|url= http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/cathouseseries.php|accessdate= | first= | last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11 episodes of the first season were originally broadcast in 2005; 6 episodes of the second season aired two years later. The series is the direct successor of the HBO documentaries ''Cathouse'' (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cathouse: The Series|work= [[DVD Talk]]|date=|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/16178/cathouse/|accessdate= | first=| last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Cathouse 2: Back in the Saddle'' (2003), which also focused on the Bunny Ranch. On New Year's Day 2008 at 12:05am, HBO aired a special episode of the series entitled "Cathouse the Musical."  Also in 2008, two standalone episodes (not part of a full season) aired - "Cathouse: Come to the Party" and "Best of Cathouse."

Unlike the specials, which showed only the negotiations between brothel workers and their clients, the series was more sexually explicit and showed sexual activity with customers. Regulars on the series include Moonlite owner [[Dennis Hof]], his then girlfriend [[Sunset Thomas]] (a porn star who was also a Moonlite employee), [[Air Force Amy]], Isabella Soprano, Brooke Taylor (who became Hof's girlfriend after Thomas departed) and Danielle.

In October, November and December 2008, three new specials aired, "Ménage à Trois," "What's on the Menu?" and "Three Ring Circus,". In October 2009 a special entitled "Sex, Guys and Videotape", aired which included footage of the Bunny Ranch shot by the working girls themselves.

In December 2010 a special entitled "Cat Call" aired and in February 2011 another special aired entitled "Welcome Aboard," it featured a visit from [[Heidi Fleiss]]. Both of these episodes include the introduction of a new group of women, including Hof's newest girlfriend, Cami Parker, while continuing to feature Brooke Taylor, Bunny Love and Air Force Amy. In December 2011 a new special aired entitled "Frisky Business".

The original "Cathouse" special was released to DVD in North America in 2005. The first two seasons, plus ''Cathouse: The Musical'' were released in a 4-disc set in September 2008.  A second DVD set was released in December 2010, including "Come to the Party," the third season of three episodes, "Sex, Guys and Videotape" and the "Best of Cathouse."

'''''Core War''''' is a 1984 [[programming game]] created by D. G. Jones and [[A. K. Dewdney]] in which two or more battle programs (called "warriors") compete for control of a [[virtual machine|virtual computer]]. These battle programs are written in an abstract [[assembly language]] called ''Redcode''.

==Gameplay==
At the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory at a random location, after which each program executes one instruction in turn. The goal of the game is to cause the processes of opposing programs to terminate (which happens if they execute an invalid instruction), leaving the victorious program in sole possession of the machine.

The earliest published version of Redcode defined only eight instructions. The ICWS-86 standard increased the number to 10 while the ICWS-88 standard increased it to 11. The currently used ICWS-94 standard has 16 instructions.  However, Redcode supports a number of different [[addressing mode]]s and (from ICWS-94) instruction modifiers which increase the actual number of operations possible to 7168. The Redcode standard leaves the underlying instruction representation undefined and provides no means for programs to access it.  Arithmetic operations may be done on the two address fields contained in each instruction, but the only operations supported on the instruction codes themselves are copying and comparing for equality.

;Constant instruction length and time: Each Redcode instruction occupies exactly one memory slot and takes exactly one cycle to execute.  The rate at which a process executes instructions, however, depends on the number of other processes in the queue, as processing time is shared equally.

;Circular memory: The memory is addressed in units of one instruction. The memory space (or ''core'') is of finite size, but only [[relative address]]ing is used, that is, address ''0'' always refers to the currently executing instruction, address ''1'' to the instruction after it, and so on. The maximum address value is set to equal one less than the number of memory locations, and will wrap around if necessary. As a result, there is a one-to-one correspondence between addresses and memory locations, but it is impossible for a Redcode program to determine any absolute address. A process that encounters no invalid or jump instructions will continue executing successive instructions endlessly, eventually returning to the instruction where it started.

;Low level multiprocessing: Instead of a single [[instruction pointer]] a Redcode simulator has a ''process queue'' for each program containing a variable number of instruction pointers which the simulator cycles through.  Each program starts with only one process, but new processes may be added to the queue using the &lt;code&gt;SPL&lt;/code&gt; instruction. A process dies when it executes a &lt;tt&gt;DAT&lt;/tt&gt; instruction or performs a division by zero.  A program is considered dead when it has no more processes left.

;No external access: Redcode and the MARS architecture provide no input or output functions.  The simulator is a closed system, with the only input being the initial values of the memory and the process queues, and the only output being the outcome of the battle, i.e., which programs had surviving processes.  Of course, the simulator may still allow external inspection and modification of the memory while the simulation is running.

===Versions of Redcode===
A number of versions of Redcode exist.  The earliest version described by [[A. K. Dewdney]]&lt;ref name=dewdneycwg/&gt; differs in many respects from the later standards established by the International Core War Society, and could be considered a different, albeit related, language.  The form of Redcode most commonly used today is based on a draft standard submitted to the ICWS in 1994 that was never formally accepted, as the ICWS had become effectively defunct around that time.  Development of Redcode, however, has continued in an informal manner, chiefly via online forums such as the &lt;code&gt;rec.games.corewar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!forum/rec.games.corewar |title=rec.games.corewar on Google Groups |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[newsgroup]].

===Strategy===
Warriors are commonly divided into a number of broad categories, although actual warriors may often combine the behavior of two or more of these.  Three of the common strategies (''replicator'', ''scanner'' and ''bomber'') are also known as [[Rock, Paper, Scissors|paper, scissors and stone]], since their performance against each other approximates that of their namesakes in the well-known playground game.&lt;ref name=wangsaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corewar.co.uk/mintard/index.htm |title=Intro to Art in '88: Paper - Stone - Scissors Trilogy |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Wangsaw |first=Mintardjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Paper (or replicator): A replicator makes repeated copies of itself and executes them in parallel, eventually filling the entire core with copies of its code. Replicators are hard to kill, but often have difficulty killing their opponents. Replicators therefore tend to score a lot of ties, particularly against other replicators.
:A '''silk''' is a special type of very rapid replicator, named after ''Silk Warrior''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/birk/COREWAR/94/HILL/silkwarrior13.red |title=Silk Warrior 1.3 |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Pohjalainen |first=Jippo}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Juha Pohjalainen. Most modern replicators are of this type. Silk replicators use parallel execution to copy their entire code with one instruction, and begin execution of the copy before it is finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.corewar/msg/4d996ff505fde9f4?dmode=source |title=Replicators? - Phoenix &amp; TimeScape source |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Pohjalainen |first=Jippo |date=April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Scissors (or scanner): A scanner is designed to beat replicators. A scanner does not attack blindly, but tries to locate its enemy before launching a targeted attack. This makes it more effective against hard-to-kill opponents like replicators, but also leaves it vulnerable to decoys. A scanner usually bombs memory with &lt;tt&gt;SPL 0&lt;/tt&gt; instructions. This causes the enemy to create a huge number of processes which do nothing but create more processes, slowing down useful processes. When the enemy becomes so slow that it is unable to do anything useful, the memory is bombed with &lt;tt&gt;DAT&lt;/tt&gt; instructions. Scanners are also generally more complex, and therefore larger and more fragile, than other types of warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corewar.co.uk/scanner.htm |title=Anatomy of the Scanner, A Basic Introduction |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Metcalf |first=John |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:A '''one-shot''' is a very simple scanner that only scans the core until it finds the first target, and then permanently switches to an attack strategy, usually a core clear. ''Myrmidon''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/birk/COREWAR/94/HILL/myrmidon.red |title=Myrmidon |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=van Rijn |first=Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Roy van Rijn is an example of a oneshot.

;Stone (or bomber): A bomber blindly copies a "bomb" at regular intervals in the core, hoping to hit the enemy. The bomb is often a &lt;tt&gt;DAT&lt;/tt&gt; instruction, although other instructions, or even multi-instruction bombs, may be used. A bomber can be small and fast, and they gain an extra edge over scanning opponents since the bombs also serve as convenient distractions. Bombers are often combined with imp spirals to gain extra resiliency against replicators.

;Vampire (or pit-trapper): A vampire tries to make its opponent's processes jump into a piece of its own code called a "pit". Vampires can be based on either bombers or scanners. A major weakness of vampires is that they can be easily attacked indirectly, since they must by necessity scatter pointers to their code all over the core. Their attacks are also slow, as it takes an extra round for the processes to reach the pit. ''myVamp''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/birk/COREWAR/94/HILL/myvamp37.red |title=myVamp v3.7 |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Paulsson |first=Magnus}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Paulsson is an example of a vampire.

;Imp: Imps are named after the first ever published warrior, ''Imp''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/birk/COREWAR/88/HILL/imp.red |title=Imp |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Dewdney |first=A. K. |authorlink=Alexander Dewdney}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[A. K. Dewdney]], a trivial one-instruction mobile warrior that continually copies its sole instruction just ahead of its [[instruction pointer]]. Imps are hard to kill but next to useless for offense. Their use lies in the fact that they can easily be spawned in large numbers, and may survive even if the rest of the warrior is killed.
:An '''imp ring''' (or '''imp spiral''') consists of imps spaced at equal intervals around the core and executing alternately. The imps at each arm of the ring/spiral copy their instruction to the next arm, where it is immediately executed again. Rings and spirals are even harder to kill than simple imps, and they even have a (small) chance of killing warriors not protected against them. The number of arms in an imp ring or spiral must be [[coprime|relatively prime]] with the size of the core.

;Quickscanner (or q-scan): A quickscanner attempts to catch its opponent early by using a very fast unrolled scanning loop. Quickscanning is an early-game strategy, and always requires some other strategy as a backup. Adding a quickscanning component to a warrior can improve its score against long warriors such as other quickscanners. However, the unrolled scan can only target a limited number of locations, and is unlikely to catch a small opponent.

;Core clear: A core clear sequentially overwrites every instruction in the core, sometimes even including itself. Core clears are not very common as stand-alone warriors, but are often used as an end-game strategy by bombers and scanners.

===''Core War'' Programming===
With an understanding of ''Core War'' strategies, a programmer can create a warrior to achieve certain goals. Revolutionary ideas come once in a while; most of the time, however, programmers base their programs on already published warriors. Using optimizers such as OptiMax or core-step optimizer tools, a more effective warrior can be created.

Warriors can also be generated by [[genetic algorithm]]s or [[genetic programming]]. Programs that integrate this evolutionary technique are known as ''evolvers''. Several evolvers were introduced by the ''Core War'' community and tend to focus on generating warriors for smaller core settings. The latest evolver with significant success was ''µGP''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/squillero/microgp2/ |title=&amp;micro;GP (MicroGP v2) |accessdate=2018-09-10 |last=Squillero |first=Giovanni }}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced some of the most successful nano and tiny warriors. Nevertheless, evolutionary strategy still needs to prove its effectiveness on larger core settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corewar.co.uk/vowk/alife9ac.pdf |title=An Evolutionary Approach Generates Human Competitive Corewar Programs |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Vowk |first=Barkley |author2=Wait, Alexander |author3=Schmidt, Christian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Core War'' was inspired by a [[self-replication|self-replicating]] program called [[Creeper (program)|Creeper]] and a subsequent program called Reaper that destroyed copies of Creeper.&lt;ref name=dewdney84&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewdney |first=A. K. |authorlink=Alexander Dewdney |date=May 1984 |title=In the game called Core War hostile programs engage in a battle of bits. |journal=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://corewar.co.uk/dewdney/1984-05.htm |accessdate=2017-10-05 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creeper was created by Bob Thomas at [[BBN Technologies|BBN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shoch |first=J. |authorlink=John Shoch |author2=Hupp, J. |date=March 1982 |title=The 'Worm' Programs - Early Experience with a Distributed Computation |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |doi = 10.1145/358453.358455 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=172–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney was not aware of the origin of Creeper and Reaper and refers to them as a rumor originating from [[Darwin (programming game)|Darwin]] and the worm experiments of [[John Shoch|Shoch]] and Hupp.  The 1984 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article on ''Core War''&lt;ref name=dewdney84/&gt; nevertheless cites the game ''[[Darwin (programming game)|Darwin]]'', played by [[Victor A. Vyssotsky]], [[Robert Morris (cryptographer)|Robert Morris]], and [[Douglas McIlroy]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1961. The word "Core" in the name comes from [[magnetic-core memory]], an obsolete [[random-access memory]] technology.

The first description of the Redcode language was published in March 1984, in ''Core War Guidelines'' by D. G. Jones and [[A. K. Dewdney]].&lt;ref name=dewdneycwg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corewar.co.uk/cwg.txt |title=Core War Guidelines |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Jones |first=D. G. |author2=Dewdney, A.K. |authorlink2=Alexander Dewdney  |date=March 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was introduced to the public in May 1984, in an article written by Dewdney in ''Scientific American''.  Dewdney revisited ''Core War'' in his "Computer Recreations" column in March 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewdney |first=A.&amp;nbsp;K. |authorlink=Alexander Dewdney |date=March 1985 |title=A Core War bestiary of viruses, worms and other threats to computer memories. |journal=Scientific American |url=http://corewar.co.uk/dewdney/1985-03.htm |accessdate=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in January 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewdney |first=A.&amp;nbsp;K. |authorlink=Alexander Dewdney |date=January 1987 |title=A program called MICE nibbles its way to victory at the first Core War tournament. |journal=Scientific American |url=http://corewar.co.uk/dewdney/1987-01.htm |accessdate=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Core Wars Society (ICWS) was founded in 1985, one year after Dewdney's original article. The ICWS published new standards for the Redcode language in 1986 and 1988, and proposed an update in 1994 that was never formally set as the new standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corewar.co.uk/icws94.txt |title=Annotated Draft of the Proposed 1994 Core War Standard |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Doligez |first=Damien |author2=Durham, Mark |date=8 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the 1994 draft was commonly adopted and extended, and forms the basis of the ''de facto'' standard for Redcode today.  The ICWS was directed by Mark Clarkson (1985–1987), William R. Buckley (1987–1992), and Jon Newman (1992–); currently the ICWS is defunct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corewar.co.uk/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Corewar |accessdate=2013-03-11 |last=Metcalf |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redcode===
&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; border: #99B3FF solid 1px; padding: 0.25em;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="redcode"&gt;
 0000:  ADD.AB  #   4, $   3
 0001:  MOV.F   $   2, @   2
 0002:  JMP.B   $  -2, $   0
 0003:  DAT.F   #   0, #   0
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Assembled ICWS-94 style Redcode&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Redcode is the [[programming language]] used in ''Core War''.  It is executed by a [[virtual machine]] known as a ''Memory Array Redcode Simulator'', or ''MARS''.  The design of Redcode is loosely based on actual [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] [[assembly language]]s of the early 1980s, but contains several features not usually found in actual computer systems.

Both Redcode and the MARS environment are designed to provide a simple and abstract platform without the complexity of actual computers and processors. Although Redcode is meant to resemble an ordinary CISC assembly language, it differs in many ways from "real" assembly.

== Implementations ==
Development of implementations of the game continued over the years by several authors. 
There are multiple versions of the game available,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corewar.info/emulator.htm The Corewar Emulators] on corewar.info&lt;/ref&gt; [[Porting|ported]] for several platforms. For instance ''pMARS'' which is [[open source software]] with [[source code]] on [[Sourceforge]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/corewar/ corewar] on [[sourceforge]]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Simple Directmedia Layer|SDL]] based ''SDL pMARS'' for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corewar.co.uk/pihlaja/pmars-sdl/index.htm pMARS-SDL] on corewar.co.uk by Joonas Pihlaja (7 May 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently a fully web based simulator has been created https://www.corewar.io/ removing the need to download any platform specific tooling.

== Reception ==
The common implementation pMars was downloaded 30,000 times between 2000 and 2017 from [[Sourceforge]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/corewar/files/stats/timeline?dates=1999-03-16+to+2017-03-22 download numbers coreware] on [[sourceforge]] (access 2017-03-22)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Daemonica''''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[action-adventure game]] with [[Roleplaying video game|RPG]] elements that was developed by Czech companies [[RA Images]] and [[Cinemax (video game developer)|Cinemax]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.databaze-her.cz/hry/daemonica/ Czech&lt;/ref&gt; The game is divided into 5 acts. Cinemax and RA Images planned a sequel to the game but it was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/games/legends-of-daemonica-farepoynts-purgatory/pc-14334084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://games.cinemax.cz/daemonica&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Daemonica tells a story of Haresh al-Dorem, the beast hunter, who is known as Nicholas Farepoynt. In the prologue, the player finds out that Nicholas was born as Nicholas Mortimer a son of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]] and queen [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. who were responsible for the death of King [[Edward II of England]]. When Mortimer was executed, Nicholas was sent to a church in France and was renamed Farepoynt.  He later became a mercenary and joined the English army in the [[Hundred Years' War (1337–60)|Hundred Years' War]]. When he returned to England he met Clarice, a beast hunter. Beast hunters hunt serial killers and other "human beasts". They have knowledge of an ancient language of Daemonica. It allows them to call a demon Dahn-en-nyan the soul bearer who can help them to talk with the dead if they know certain facts about the dead. Hunters can also call a demon Marghet-en-dryat who can bring the dead back but there is no known case of a hunter surviving the ritual. Clarice taught Nicholas until they worked on a case in York. Clarice made a mistake that cost her life. Nicholas then received a letter from a Mayor of the small town of Cavorn where a couple had disappeared.

The game starts as Nicholas gets near Cavorn. He finds out that a murder occurred in the meantime but the only suspect was already executed on the orders of the Mayor. Nicholas starts to investigate and proves that the executed person was innocent for which he earns trust from citizens but hatred from the mayor. He also meets Helen, the beautiful young wife of the mayor and starts to have feelings for her.

During his investigation another person comes to Cavorn - Fabius. Fabius tries to convince Nicholas to leave but he rejects. Nicholas eventually finds out that all murders and disappearances are caused by a demon locked in a Crypt of local monastery and Fabius is a member of society that tries to make it secret. Nicholas is then poisoned by the Mayor who is revealed to be controlled by the demon. Nicholas survives but he finds Helen killed and tries to resurrect her but the ritual looks as if not working. Nicholas then goes to the crypt where Fabius reveals that in fact he tries to release to demon to control him to use him for good. He also tries to convince Nicholas to help him. The player has to make a decision.

If he decides to help Fabius, the demon is pulled into Fabius who then returns to Rome where he helps to make the Church stronger as new crusades across the world are led. The live in Cavorns go on peacefully as no-one notices the shadow that will swallow all.

If the player refuses to help Fabius so Nicholas kills him and demon tries to control him  but is saved by Helen who pulls the demon into her. She says Nicholas that she is a daughter of Yerik whose blood is unbearable to the demon which helps her control him. Nicholas is not truly convinced if he should trust her so the player has to make decision once again.

If he decides to trust her they live happily together and Nicholas can have a normal life thanks to her. It is not sure if she will be able to hold the demon forever to protect the world or if he will get a control over her one day.

If the player kills her the world is saved but Nicholas loses any chance of getting a normal life. He leaves the town and continues as a Beast Hunter. The folks of Cavorn have been since then lighting up tho candles for Nicholas and Helen followed by prayer for Nicholas's soul.

== Development ==
The game was announced by software studio [[RA Images]] in January 2005. It was the first video game project of the studio. The game was scheduled for release in Q1 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ra-images-summons-daemonica/1100-6117449/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.czechgamer.com/mix/77/Minirozhovor-o-hre-Daemonica.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was released in the Czech Republic in May 2005. It was published by Cinemax that also codeveloped the game. In 2006 the game was published in North America by Meridian4.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrej.cz/novinky/2006/01/16/daemonica-si-bali-kufry-kvuli-vyletu-za-ocean-5884/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The game has received mostly mixed reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/daemonica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/926011-daemonica/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/17927&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/04/13/daemonica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://worthplaying.com/article/2006/7/8/reviews/34468/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequel ==
In December 2008 [[Cinemax (video game developer)|Cinemax]] announced that '''Legends of Daemonca: Fareypoint Purgatory''' is in development. It was supposed to be a sequel to the original Daemonica. Player would control Nicholas Fareypoint the protagonist of Daemonica as he arrives on a mysterious island. His goal is to escape from this island. The game was later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/games/legends-of-daemonica-farepoynts-purgatory/pc-14334084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://games.tiscali.cz/preview/ceska-adventura-legends-of-daemonica-33884&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Der Fuehrer's Face''''' (originally titled '''''Donald Duck in Nutzi Land'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New U.S. War Songs|magazine=LIFE|date=2 November 1942|volume=13|issue=18|page=44|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=JkAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1943 American [[Animated cartoon|animated]] anti-Nazi [[propaganda]] [[short film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released in 1943 by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]. The cartoon, which features [[Donald Duck]] in a nightmare setting working at a factory in [[Nazi Germany]], was made in an effort to sell [[Series E bond|war bonds]] and is an example of [[American propaganda during World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Jack Kinney]] and written by Joe Grant and  Dick Huemer from the original music by [[Oliver Wallace]].&lt;ref name="bcdb"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/5347-Der_Fuehrers_Face.html|title=Der Fuehrer's Face|publisher=BCDB|date=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is well known for Wallace's original song "Der Fuehrer's Face", which was released earlier by [[Spike Jones]].

''Der Fuehrer's Face'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] at the [[15th Academy Awards]]. It was the only ''Donald Duck'' film to receive the honor, although eight other films were also nominated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://d23.disney.go.com/archives/biographies-of-10-classic-disney-characters/#DonaldDuck Biographies of 10 Classic Disney Characters] from Walt Disney Archives at D23: The Official Disney Fan Club&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, it was voted Number 22 of "[[the 50 Greatest Cartoons]]" of all time by members of the animation field. However, because of the propagandistic nature of the short, and the depiction of Donald Duck as a Nazi (albeit a deeply reluctant one), Disney kept the film out of general circulation after its original release. Its first home video release came in 2004 with the release of the [[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Three|third wave of the Walt Disney Treasures]] DVD sets.

==Plot==
A German [[oom-pah]] band—composed of Axis leaders [[Joseph Goebbels]] on trombone, [[Heinrich Himmler]] on snare drum, [[Hirohito]] on sousaphone, [[Hermann Göring]] on piccolo and [[Benito Mussolini]] on bass drum—marches noisily at four o'clock in the morning through a small town where the trees, windmills, fence posts, and even the clouds are shaped like [[swastika]]s, singing the virtues of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] doctrine. As they near Donald Duck's house, Donald is heiling to the song in his sleep. His alarm clock, with all the numbers replaced with swastikas, goes off and he smashes it. His cuckoo clock with a bird that is dressed up as Hitler heils as a clock chime, only for Donald to throw a shoe at it. Passing by Donald Duck's house (the features of which depict Adolf Hitler), the band members poke him out of bed with a bayonet to get him ready for work. Here Donald then faces and "Heils" the portraits of the Führer ([[Adolf Hitler]]), the Emperor ([[Hirohito]]) and Il Duce (Mussolini) respectively, then goes to make breakfast.

Because of wartime [[rationing]], Donald's breakfast consists of bread that is so stale and hard it resembles wood (and must be sliced using a saw), coffee brewed from a single hoarded coffee bean, and an aromatic spray that smells (and, apparently, also tastes) like bacon and eggs. The band shoves a copy of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in front of him for a moment of reading, then marches into his house and escorts him to a factory, with Donald now carrying the bass drum and Göring kicking him.
[[Image:Ducknazi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Donald salutes the Führer]]

Upon arriving at the factory (at bayonet-point), Donald starts his comical 48-hour daily shift of screwing caps onto [[shell (projectile)|artillery shells]] coming at him in an [[assembly line]]. Mixed in with the shells are portraits of the Führer, so he must perform the [[Nazi salute|Hitler salute]] every time a portrait appears, all the while screwing the caps onto shells, much to Donald's disgust. Each new batch of shells is of a different size, ranging from individual bullets to massive shells, as large as Donald if not larger. The pace of the assembly line intensifies (as in the [[Charlie Chaplin]] comedy ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]''), and Donald finds it increasingly hard to complete all the tasks. At the same time, he is bombarded with propaganda messages about the superiority of the [[Aryan race]] and the glory of working for the Führer.

After a "[[Strength Through Joy|paid vacation]]" that consists of making swastika shapes with his body for a few seconds in front of a painted backdrop of the [[Alps]] as exercise, Donald is ordered to work overtime. While working, the band members begin rushing him for “more shells”. He has a [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] with [[hallucination]]s of artillery shells everywhere, some of which are [[snake]]s and [[bird]]s, some sing and are the same shape of the marching band from the start, music and all (some of the animation from this sequence is recycled from the "[[Pink Elephants on Parade]]" sequence from ''[[Dumbo]]'').

When the hallucinations clear, he finds himself in his bed, and realizes that the whole experience was a [[nightmare]], but he sees the shadow of a figure holding its right hand up in the form of a [[Nazi salute]]. He begins to do so himself until he realizes that it is the shadow of a miniature [[Statue of Liberty]], holding her torch high in her right hand. Remembering he is in the [[United States]], he embraces the statue, grateful of his United States citizenship.

The short ends with a [[caricature]] of Hitler's angry face, and a [[tomato]] is thrown at Hitler's face forming the words '''''The End'''''.

Before the film's release, the popular band [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers, noted for their parodies of popular songs of the time, released a version of [[Oliver Wallace]]'s theme song, "Der Fuehrer's Face" (also known informally as "The Nazi Song") in September 1942 on [[RCA Victor]] [[Bluebird Records]] #11586.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Week's Best Releases |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;lpg=PT62#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Der%20Fuehrer's%20Face%22 |newspaper=Billboard |location= |publisher= |page=66 |date=September 26, 1942 |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song parodied the Nazi anthem, the "[[Horst-Wessel-Lied|Horst Wessel Song]]". Unlike the version in the cartoon, some Spike Jones versions contain the rude [[sound effect]] of an instrument he called the "birdaphone", a rubber razzer (also known as the [[Blowing a raspberry|Bronx Cheer]]) with each "Heil!" to show contempt for Hitler (Instead, the cartoon version features the sound of a tuba.) The so-called "Bronx Cheer" was a well-known expression of disgust in that time period and was not deemed obscene or offensive. The sheet music cover bears the image of [[Donald Duck]] throwing a tomato in Hitler's face. In the Jones version, the chorus line, "Ja, we is the Supermen—" is answered by a soloist's "Super-duper super men!" effeminately delivered suggesting the prevalence of [[epicene]]s in the  Party; in the Disney version, these lines are flatly delivered but with effeminate gestures. The recording was very popular, peaking at #3 on U.S. charts.&lt;ref name="Whitburn1986"&gt;{{cite book |last= Whitburn|first=Joel |authorlink= Joel Whitburn|title=Pop Memories 1890-1954 |year=1986 |publisher=Record Research, Inc. |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89820-083-0 |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other versions===
*[[Johnny Bond]] recorded the song in July 1942 on the OKeh label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrydiscoghraphy2.blogspot.ca/2015/02/johnny-bond.html|title=Praguefrank's Country Music Discography: Johnny Bond|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tommy Trinder]] recorded the song in the United Kingdom soon after the cartoon's release.
*[[Harry Turtledove]] adapted the song in one of his ''[[Colonization (series)|Colonization]]'' novels, in tune with the novels' theme of an [[alternate history]] alien invasion during World War II. See the page on ''[[The Race (Worldwar)|the Race]]'' for the lyrics.

==Political themes==
Although the film portrays events in Nazi Germany, its release came while the United States also was on [[total war]] footing. Coffee, meat and food oils were [[Rationing in the United States#World War II|rationed]], civilians were [[United States home front during World War II|heavily employed]] in military production, and [[American propaganda during World War II|propaganda in support of the war effort]] (such as the film itself) was pervasive. The film's criticism therefore emphasizes violence and terror under the Nazi government, as compared with the dull grind that all the warring nations faced.&lt;ref&gt;Van Riper, A. Bowdoin (2011) ''Learning from Mickey, Donald and Walt: Essays on Disney’s Edutainment Films''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
In 2010, ''Der Fuehrer's Face'' was ruled by a local court in [[Kamchatka Krai|Kamchatka]], [[Russia]] to be included in the national list of extremist materials, which was first created in 2002. This was due to a local who received a suspended sentence of six months for uploading it to the internet and "inciting hatred and enmity". On July 21, 2016, another Russian court reversed the ruling of the local court, removing the short film from the list. The court highlighted that the film's portrayal of Nazism through caricature form cannot be deemed "extremist" in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kozlov|first1=Vladimir|title=Oscar-Winning Donald Duck Short About Nazi Germany Taken Off Russia's List of Extremist Material|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-winning-donald-duck-short-913151|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
*In August 1943, the cover of ''Four Favorites'' comic (Number 11), displayed the ''four favorites'' — from left to right, [[Unknown Soldier (Ace Comics)|The Unknown Soldier]], [[Captain Courageous (comics)|Captain Courageous]], [[Lash Lightning|Lightning]], and Magno, the Magnetic Man (along with Davey, his boy partner) — all singing "Der Fuehrer's Face" in the background, whilst a strong and powerful "[[War Bond]]" simultaneously knocks out [[Hirohito]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Benito Mussolini]] with one fierce blow in the foreground.

'''''Drighangchoo''''' was an independent magazine published from [[Kolkata]] (earlier Calcutta), [[India]] and it wa the first print magazine in India to deal exclusively with "mature" [[comics]] and sequential graphic art. The magazine devoted most of its contents to comics for "mature readers", and its name draws inspiration from a fable of the same name by [[Sukumar Ray]], which is about a troubled king's search for a mystery crow. The magazine started off in 2009 when six comics enthusiasts from [[Jadavpur University]] and an alumnus got together and decided to start a not-for-profit print magazine on comics for Indian readers.&lt;ref name="tcj"&gt;{{cite news|author=Ryan Holmberg|title=Bengal’s Drighangchoo: An Interview with Deeptanil Ray|url=http://www.tcj.com/bengals-drighangchoo-an-interview-with-deeptanil-ray/|accessdate=18 February 2017|work=The Comics Journal|date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of ''Drighangchoo'' was published in July 2009.

Unlike the focus of "mainstream" [[Indian comics]] which heavily borrows from the syndicated superhero comics of the North, the issues of ''Drighangchoo'' encouraged local artists and the use of serious story-telling through black-and-white sequential art in the traditional comics format, and the use of experimental and indigenous Indian artistic styles. The narratives in ''Drighangchoo'' mostly used [[Bengali language|Bengali]] or English as interface languages,&lt;ref name="tcj"/&gt; and also the wordless form. The magazine was published bi-annually from "under the (crow-infested) trees" of one of the student canteens of Jadavpur University, and had a small number of devoted and enthusiastic readers from the city of Kolkata, and outside. The magazine folded just after three issues in 2010.&lt;ref name="tcj"/&gt;

'''''Duets II''''' is the 59th and last [[studio album]] by American singer [[Frank Sinatra]]. It was released in 1994, and was the sequel to the previous year's ''[[Duets (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets]]''.

[[Phil Ramone]] produced the album and guest artists from various genres contributed their [[duet]] parts to Sinatra's already recorded vocals.  Though not as commercially successful as ''Duets'', it still rose to #9 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard albums chart]] and sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. It also peaked at #29 in the UK.

Critical notices were again mixed at best, although some viewed it as an improvement over its predecessor. However, the album won Sinatra the 1995 [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance]], his last competitive Grammy Award.

These would be the last studio recordings made by Sinatra, who had begun his recording career fifty five years earlier.

Both were packaged together in a "90th Birthday Limited Collector's Edition" released in 2005; North American pressings add an unreleased duet recording of "My Way" with [[Willie Nelson]], while international pressings have him singing with [[Luciano Pavarotti]].

'''Edward Riley Ives''' (September 13, 1839 – 1918) was an [[United States|American]] toymaker from [[Connecticut]]. He married Jennie Blakeslee in 1866, and with the help of his father in law and brother in law, he founded the [[Ives Manufacturing Company]] two years later in 1868 in [[Plymouth, Connecticut]]. It became one of the largest [[toy]] companies in the United States during the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. Late in his career, he turned the company over to his son, [[Harry Ives]].

Edward Ives was a distant cousin of U.S. [[european classical music|classical music]] composer [[Charles Edward Ives]]. Ives and his son were the subject of a biography titled ''Messrs. Ives of Bridgeport,'' written by Louis Hertz and published in 1950.

== Gameplay ==
The player controls [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent Victor Corbet. He fights narkomafia in [[Colombia]]. The gameplay is similar to [[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]. The player can use [[Bullet time]] and make jumps with aiming. It is also possible to use your guns in both hands. The game has realistic physics and a destructible environment.

The game also features boss combats, with the bosses being highlighted with a health meter beneath their portrait. They can intake more damage than the average game enemy, and move faster and deal more damage towards the player.

== Plot==

After a successful raid to rescue DA daughter in a nightclub owned by a druglord Alberto Entiendez, Victor Corbet is sent to Colombia to assist the local police in taking down La Valedora Cartel, who were involved in a massacre that killed Victor brother. The police department includes captain Carlos Enterrador, ADA Mia Rodriguez, Sgt. Gabriel Montego and Ricardo "Rico" Altemetra, a close friend of Victor.

Victor first assignment consists of eavesdropping a secret meeting of the Cartel in Hotel Paradiso, Bogota, hosted by druglord nicknamed "El Corsario". During the meeting, Victor team is attacked by the Cartel, with Victor being the only survivor. Victor raids the Hotel on his own, and kills "El Corsario" and several of his men, but the remaining leaders of La Valedora escape by Helicopter.

Due to Victor heroic actions at the hotel, he is nicknamed "El Matador" by his fellow comrades. Rico and Victor are then sent to raid an abandoned factory which serves as a secret drug factory for La Valedora. Victor and Rico are tasked to arrest Guillermo Toro, a drug kingpin who is controlling the operations. During the raid, Victor manages to destroy the factory with C-4, but Toro escapes. Victor and the rest of the team, including Enterrador and Mia, corner Toro in a church. The police raids the church, and in the ensuing shootout Toro is heavily wounded. Victor proceeds to arrest him, but is shot by Enterrador.

The police finds out that La Valedora has a training camp in Colombia ´s jungle. Due to Enterrador distrust of the police force, orders Victor to go on his own to dismantle the training camp, run by a former Israeli agent. Victor raids the camp, killing all hostile forces.

Thanks to information retrieved by Victor, the DEA finds out that the leader of La Valedora is Helmut Köch, a former SS soldier who lives in his island fortress. The DEA, with Victor and Montego leading the team, raids the island. Victor kills Köch in a gunfight.

Documents found in Köch lair reveal that a big drug cargo is being transported in a freighter. Enterrador gathers all police forces to retrieve the cargo, instead of destroying it. Two teams, one led by Rico and Victor, and the other led by Montego, raid the harbor, while Mia serves as air support. During the raid, Rico is shot and killed by an unknown assaultant. Victor backfires on him, and unmasks him, turning out to be Montego. Montego reveals to Victor that Carlos pretends to steal the cargo before dying from his wounds.

Victor, with the help of Mia, raids the freighter, where Enterrador and several of his Special Ops men are gathered. He manages to make his way, killing all of his men, and manages to wound Enterrador. Enterrador justifies all of his actions to Victor, claiming that the justice he served is controlled by men worst than the drug lords he has been fighting. Unbeknownst to Victor, Enterrador plans to shoot him with a gun concealed in his pants.Enterrador takes his gun and points it towards Victor before the screen turns into black and a gunshot is heard.

A mid-credits title card reveals that Mia was promoted after the downfall of the Cartel. Victor seemingly killed Enterrador in the gunfight, and is now working as an international observer in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmatador.net/index.php?dir=main&amp;page=story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://worthplaying.com/article/2006/5/19/previews/33381/&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Julian Dibbell]] described Encyclopædia Dramatica as the site "where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: [[Flaming (Internet)|Flamingly]] [[Racism|racist]], [[homophobia | homophobic]] and [[Misogyny|misogynist]] content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend."&lt;ref name="assclown"&gt;{{citation

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Wikipedia]]'s evil twin. It’s a site where almost every article is biased, offensive, unsourced, and without the faintest trace of [[political correctness]].

On April 14, 2011, the original URL of the site was redirected to a new website named 'Oh Internet' that bore little resemblance to Encyclopedia Dramatica.

== History ==
=== The original ===
Encyclopædia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DeGrippo, also known by the online [[pseudonym]] "Girlvinyl".&lt;ref name="ed:about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{cite news |last= Schwartz |first= Mattathias |title=Malwebolence  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?pagewanted=all |work= The New York Times Magazine |date = August 3, 2008 |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DeGrippo found [[LiveJournal]] (LJ Drama) in 2000 and became enthralled by the behavior of some of its members:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People were accessible and it was bidirectional. Voyeurs and exhibitionists were able to interact in a way that was normalized. That’s why I started ED. It was mostly just personalities that were just so nuts and fascinating.&lt;ref name="stryker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Epic Win for Anonymous: How 4chan's Army Conquered the Web |last=Stryker |first=Cole |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=Overlook Press |location=New York, New York |isbn=1-59020-738-6 |pages=137–9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbWNirl8gsMC&amp;pg=PT138 |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She became involved in the LJdrama community, which covered stories on LiveJournal gossip. When the community was banned from LiveJournal, they created their own website. In 2002, two LiveJournal users, Joshua Williams (aka mediacrat) and Andrewpants, became intimately involved with each other. After they broke off their relationship, LJdrama decided to document the resulting drama. Unflattering photographs of Williams were spread on the web, and Williams considered this to be harassment. He threatened legal action, traveled to Portland, Oregon, in order to speak to LiveJournal's abuse team, and reported the alleged harassment to a local TV news station.&lt;ref name="stryker" /&gt; DeGrippo created Encyclopedia Dramatica in order to "house some information from livejournal and some drama about hackers [[Theo de Raadt|Theo DeRaadt]] and Darren Reed."&lt;ref name="gawkerinterview"&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=Max |title=What Happened to Encyclopedia Dramatica? |url=http://gawker.com/5792738/what-happened-to-encyclopedia-dramatica |publisher=Gawker |date=April 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514145854/http://gawker.com/5792738/what-happened-to-encyclopedia-dramatica |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some regular users of Encyclopædia Dramatica were displeased by the change and attacked the website's official [[Facebook]] fan page&lt;ref name="gos" /&gt; with "hate messages and pornography".&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt;

In a question and answer session at the [[ROFLCon]] summit in October 2011, DeGrippo was asked why Encyclopædia Dramatica was closed and replaced with Oh Internet. She replied: "We were unable to stop the degradation of the content.

On March 19, 2012, encyclopediadramatica.ch was shut down for a short time due to a "[[Domain Name System|DNS]] block". On March 21, 2012, the site moved to a Swedish domain name, at encyclopediadramatica.se, instead of a domain in Switzerland as before. The site's Facebook account later addressed the block, stating that it was because "we didn't keep up our end of the nic.ch user agreement contract stating that we had to keep a mailing address and phone number in Switzerland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Encyclopedia Dramatica suffers minor outage |author=Fruzsina Eördögh |url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/encyclopedia-dramatica-suffers-minor-outage/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, the site changed its domain to encyclopediadramatica.es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= Encyc Dramatica æ|user=ED_Updates |number= 380439272513609728|date= September 18, 2013|title=Hi we're back! - ED is now at https://encyclopediadramatica.es, tell your friends!|access-date=September 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219032142/https://twitter.com/ED_Updates/status/380439272513609728|archive-date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, the site returned to the .se domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= Encyc Dramatica æ|user=ED_Updates |number=519339941479055360 |title= Some of the internal links might be set to .es for a bit until we change them all.

Garrett E. Moore, the operator of a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Encyclopædia Dramatica located at encyclopediadramatica.se (encyclopediadramatica.ch at the time), told an interviewer for ''[[The Daily Dot]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;People take themselves too seriously, they can't laugh at anything. We make fun of everything. I make fun of skinny white computer nerds, but I am one.&lt;ref name="thedailydot1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/culture/encyclopedia-dramatica-returns/ |title=Encyclopedia Dramatica's seething satire is back |first=Fruzsina |last=Eordogh |date=July 26, 2011 |work=The Daily Dot |publisher= |accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked about "abusive content", Moore stated that he removes it when he sees it, then further explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm not going to leave a 14 year old girl's address up on a page cause some dipshit got mad at her and made an article. But if you dress up like a fox and wear diapers and then take pictures of it? That's fair game, sir.&lt;ref name="thedailydot1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2013, a video game created by EDF user "gizmo01942" came to the attention of the media.

In 2006, "a well-known band of trolls"&lt;ref name="schwartz" /&gt; emailed Encyclopædia Dramatica's creator, DeGrippo, demanding edits to the protected (i.e. locked) article describing them.

Encyclopædia Dramatica became a "favourite target for critics, who accuse Anonymous of propagating hate,"&lt;ref name="davies" /&gt; for allowing alleged members of the group to sometimes use the website as a [[Platformism|platform]].

'''Eve Arden''' (born '''Eunice Mary Quedens''',&lt;!-- (pronounced qwi-DENZ) --&gt; April 30, 1908 – November 12, 1990) was an American film, radio, stage, and television actress, and comedian. She performed in leading and supporting roles for nearly six decades.

Beginning her career on Broadway in the early 1930s, Arden's first major role was in the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] drama ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1937) opposite [[Katharine Hepburn]], followed by roles in the comedies ''[[Having Wonderful Time]]'' (1938) and the [[Marx Brothers]]' ''[[At the Circus]]'' (1939). Arden would go on to earn an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945).

In the latter part of her career, she played the sardonic but engaging title character of a high school teacher in ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'', winning the first [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]], and as the school principal in the musicals ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) and ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982).

==Early life==
Arden was born  in [[Mill Valley, California]], on April 30, 1908&lt;ref name="yob"&gt;Census records from 1910 and 1920 (the earliest records found on Arden) as well as the Social Security Death Index ([http://www.locateancestors.com/arden-california 568-03-2856] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602123949/http://www.locateancestors.com/arden-california/ |date=2016-06-02 }}) support 1909 as her year of birth. However, her [http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/a/Eve%20Arden/eve_arden.htm death certificate (#39019050699, County of Los Angeles Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk in the name of Eve Arden West)], the [http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;db=CAdeath1940&amp;h=7839277&amp;tid=&amp;pid=&amp;usePUB=true&amp;rhSource=7884 California Death Registry] {{paywall}} and her [http://www.seeing-stars.com/ImagePages/EveArdensGravePhoto.shtml family crypt at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery] cite 1908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/11/13/Actress-Eve-Arden-dies/2194658472400/ Obituary (with 1908 year of birth confirmed by Arden's daughter, Liza)], upi.com, November 13, 1990; accessed January 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After her death, some sources initially cited 1907, giving her age as 83, but this is groundless. Arden gave her own year of birth as 1912 for many years.&lt;/ref&gt; to Charles Peter Quedens, son of Charles Henry Augustus and Meta L. (née Dierks) Quedens, and Lucille (née Frank) Quedens, daughter of Bernard and Louisa (née Mertens) Frank, both of German descent. Lucille, a milliner, divorced Charles over his gambling, and went into business for herself.

Although not Roman Catholic, young Eunice was sent to a Dominican convent school in [[San Rafael, California]], and later attended [[Tamalpais High School]], a public high school in Mill Valley until age 16. After leaving school, she joined the stock theater company of Henry "Terry" Duffy.&lt;ref&gt;Three Phases of Eve (1985). St Martin's Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Film===

She made her film debut under her real name in the backstage musical ''[[Song of Love (1929 film)|Song of Love]]'' (1929), as a wisecracking, homewrecking showgirl who becomes a rival to the film's star, singer [[Belle Baker]].{{Sfn|Ware|Braukman|2005|p=27}} The film was one of [[Columbia Pictures]]' earliest successes. In 1933, she relocated to [[New York City]], where she appeared in multiple [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage productions in supporting parts.{{Sfn|Ware|Braukman|2005|p=27}} In 1934, she was cast in that year's ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' revue. This was the first role in which she was credited as Eve Arden. Told to change her name for the show, she looked at her cosmetics and "stole my first name from Evening in Paris and the second from [[Elizabeth Arden]]".&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Between 1934 and 1941, she would appear in Broadway productions of ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'', ''[[Very Warm for May]]'', ''[[Two for the Show (musical)|Two for the Show]]'', and ''[[Let's Face It!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/person/eve-arden-vault-0000080930|work=Playbill|title=Eve Arden|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her film career began in earnest in 1937 when she signed a contract with [[RKO Radio Pictures]],{{Sfn|Tucker|2011|p=77}} and appeared in the films ''Oh Doctor'' and ''[[Stage Door]]''. Her ''Stage Door'' portrayal of a fast-talking, witty supporting character gained Arden considerable notice and was to be a template for many of Arden's future roles.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eve Arden, Actress, Is Dead...

In 1940, she appeared opposite [[Clark Gable]] in ''[[Comrade X]]'', followed by the drama ''[[Manpower (1941 film)|Manpower]]'' (1941), opposite [[Marlene Dietrich]].{{Sfn|Ware|Braukman|2005|p=27}} She also appeared in a supporting part in the [[Red Skelton]] comedy ''[[Whistling in the Dark (1941 film)|Whistling in the Dark]]'' (1941),{{Sfn|Tucker|2011|p=71}} and the romantic comedy ''[[Obliging Young Lady]]'' (1942).{{Sfn|Tucker|2011|p=69}}
Her many memorable screen roles include a supporting role as [[Joan Crawford]]'s wise-cracking friend in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945) for which she received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination as Best Supporting Actress, and [[James Stewart]]'s wistful secretary in [[Otto Preminger]]'s murder mystery, ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959). (One of her co-stars in that film was husband Brooks West.) In 1946, exhibitors voted her the sixth-most promising "star of tomorrow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17994035|title=The Stars of To-morrow.|newspaper=Sydney Morning Morning Herald (NSW: 1842-1954)|location=NSW|date=September 10, 1946|accessdate=April 24, 2012|page=11 Supplement: The Sydney Morning Herald Magazine|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became familiar to a new generation of film-goers when she played Principal McGee in both 1978's ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' and 1982's ''[[Grease 2]]''. She was known for her [[deadpan]] delivery of jokes in films.&lt;ref name=LAtimes /&gt;

===Radio and television===
[[File:Groucho Marx-Eve Arden in At the Circus trailer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Groucho Marx]] and Eve Arden in a scene from ''[[At the Circus]]'' (1939)]]
Arden's ability with witty scripts made her a natural talent for radio; she became a regular on [[Danny Kaye]]'s short-lived but memorably zany [[The Danny Kaye Show (radio program)|comedy-variety show]] in 1946, which also featured swing bandleader [[Harry James]] and gravel-voiced character actor-comedian [[Lionel Stander]].&lt;ref name="deli"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Danny Kaye Show|url=http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Danny-Kaye-Show.html|publisher=The Digital Deli Too|accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaye's show lasted one season, but Arden's display of comic talent and timing set the stage for her to be cast in her best-known role, Madison High School English teacher Connie Brooks in ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]''. Arden portrayed the character on radio from 1948 to 1957, in a television version of the program from 1952 to 1956, and in a 1956 feature film. Arden's character clashed with the school's principal, Osgood Conklin (played by [[Gale Gordon]]), and nursed an unrequited crush on fellow teacher Philip Boynton (played originally by future film star [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]], and later on radio, then on television, by [[Robert Rockwell]]). Except for Chandler, the entire radio cast of Arden, Gordon, [[Richard Crenna]] (Walter Denton), Robert Rockwell (Mr. Philip Boynton), Gloria McMillan (Harriet Conklin), and Jane Morgan (landlady Margaret Davis) played the same roles on television.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

Arden's portrayal of the character was so popular that she was made an honorary member of the [[National Education Association]], received a 1952 award from the [[Teachers College of Connecticut]]'s Alumni Association "for humanizing the American teacher", and even received teaching job offers.&lt;ref name="LAtimes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Eve Arden, 82; Portrayed TV's Beloved 'Our Miss Brooks'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-13/news/mn-4578_1_miss-brooks|author=Burt A. Folkart|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=LAtimes.com|date=November 13, 1990|accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her wisecracking, deadpan attitude as the character ultimately became her public persona as a commedienne as well.&lt;ref name=LAtimes /&gt;

[[File:Eve Arden.jpg|thumb|With the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]], 1940s]]
She won a listeners' poll by ''Radio Mirror'' magazine as the top-ranking comedienne of 1948–1949, receiving her award at the end of an ''Our Miss Brooks'' broadcast that March. "I'm certainly going to try in the coming months to merit the honor you've bestowed upon me, because I understand that if I win this (award) two years in a row, I get to keep Mr. Boynton," she joked. But she was also a hit with the critics; a winter 1949 poll of newspaper and magazine radio editors taken by ''[[Motion Picture Daily]]'' named her the year's best radio comedienne.&lt;ref name="oregonian"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Eve Arden, 82, dies; best known as 'Our Miss Brooks'|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/eve-arden-dies-our-miss-brooks-grease-obituary|work=The Oregonian|date=November 13, 1990|publisher=Worthpoint|accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arden had a very brief guest appearance in a 1955 ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' episode entitled "L.A. at Last" in which she played herself. While awaiting their food at [[The Brown Derby]], [[Lucy Ricardo]] ([[Lucille Ball]]) and [[Ethel Mertz]] ([[Vivian Vance]]) argue over whether a certain portrait on a nearby wall is [[Shelley Winters]] or [[Judy Holliday]]. Lucy urges Ethel to ask a lady occupying the next booth, who turns and replies, "Neither. That's Eve Arden." Ethel suddenly realizes she was just talking to Arden herself, who soon passes Lucy and Ethel's table to leave the restaurant while the pair gawk.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

[[file:Eve Arden 1954 Emmy Award.png|left|thumb|Arden with her [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] for ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'', February 11, 1954]]
[[Desilu]] Productions, jointly owned by [[Desi Arnaz]] and Ball during their marriage, was the production company for the ''Our Miss Brooks'' television show, which filmed during the same years as ''I Love Lucy''. Ball and Arden became acquainted when they co-starred together in the film ''[[Stage Door]]'' in 1937. Ball, according to numerous radio historians, suggested Arden for ''Our Miss Brooks'' after [[Shirley Booth]] auditioned for but failed to land the role and Ball – committed at the time to ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' – could not.&lt;ref name="brooks"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eve Arden as Connie Brooks|url=http://www.ourmissbrooks.com/connie-brooks-eve-arden-biography.html|publisher=Ourmissbrooks.com|accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arden tried another series in the fall of 1957, ''[[The Eve Arden Show]]'', but it was canceled in spring of 1958 after 26 episodes. In 1966, Arden played Nurse Kelton in an episode of ''[[Bewitched]]''. She later co-starred with [[Kaye Ballard]] as her neighbor and in-law, Eve Hubbard, in the 1967–69 situation comedy ''[[The Mothers-in-Law]]'', which was produced by Arnaz after the dissolution of Desilu Productions.&lt;ref name="Brians"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eve Arden profile (1908-1990)|url=http://www.briansdriveintheater.com/evearden.html|date=February 15, 2011|publisher=Brian's Drive-in Theatre|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her later career, Arden made appearances on such television shows as ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]], [[Hart to Hart]]'', and ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. In 1985, she appeared as the wicked stepmother in the ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'' production of ''[[Cinderella (Faerie Tale Theatre episode)|Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0000781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage===
Arden was one of many actresses to take on the title roles in ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' and ''[[Auntie Mame]]'' in the 1960s; in 1967, she won the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]].&lt;ref name="siddons"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sarah Siddons Society Awardees|url=http://sarahsiddonssociety.org|publisher=Sarah Siddons Society|year=2010|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arden was cast in 1983 as the leading lady in what was to be her Broadway comeback in ''[[Moose Murders]]'', but she wisely withdrew (and was replaced with the much younger [[Holland Taylor]]) after one preview performance, citing "artistic differences". The show went on to open and close on the same night, becoming known as one of the most legendary flops in Broadway history.&lt;ref name="moose"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Broadway Flop Again Raises Its Antlers|author=Campbell Robertson|date=April 21, 2008|work=New York Times|publisher=NYTimes.com|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/21/theater/21moos.html|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arden published an autobiography, ''The Three Phases of Eve'', in 1985. In addition to her [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, Arden has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: Radio and Television (see [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for addresses). She was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="HOF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comedy: Eve Arden|url=http://www.radiohof.org/comedy/evearden.html|publisher=Radio Hall of Fame|accessdate=June 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526094027/http://www.radiohof.org/comedy/evearden.html|archive-date=May 26, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Arden was married to Ned Bergen from 1939–1947, and to actor Brooks West from 1952 until his death in 1984 from a heart ailment, aged 67. West and she had four children; all but the youngest were adopted. All four survived their parents.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

==Death==
On November 12, 1990, Arden died from [[cardiac arrest]] and [[heart disease]], aged 82, at her home, according to her death certificate. Some sources, including her manager, Glenn Rose, said she had also been battling cancer. However, cancer is not mentioned in her death certificate.&lt;ref name="findadeath"&gt;[http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/a/Eve%20Arden/eve_arden.htm Copy of death certificate], findadeath.cim; accessed October 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She is interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery|Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, Westwood, Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name="findadeath"/&gt;

'''''God of War: Chains of Olympus''''' is a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ready at Dawn]] and [[SCE Santa Monica Studio|Santa Monica Studio]], and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] (SCE). It was first released for the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) [[handheld video game console|handheld console]] on March 4, 2008. The game is the fourth installment in the [[God of War (franchise)|''God of War'' series]], the second chronologically, and a prequel to the original ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]''. It is loosely based on [[Greek mythology]] and set in [[ancient Greece]], with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]], a [[Sparta]]n warrior who serves the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Gods]]. Kratos is guided by the goddess [[Athena]], who instructs him to find the Sun God [[Helios]], as the Dream God [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]] has caused many of the gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With the power of the Sun and the aid of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], Morpheus and the Queen of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]] [[Persephone]] intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].

The gameplay is similar to the previous installments, with a focus on [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features [[quick time event]]s that require the player to complete game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. The player can use up to three magical attacks as alternative combat options. The game also features [[puzzle video game|puzzles]] and [[platform game|platforming]] elements. The control setup was reconfigured for the PSP, as it has fewer buttons than the [[PlayStation 2]]'s [[DualShock 2|controller]]. Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls received praise from critics.

Debuting at No. 5 on the North American charts, ''Chains of Olympus'' achieved the highest composite score for a PSP title from [[Metacritic]] and [[GameRankings]]. [[1UP.com|1UP]] stated that the game is "a technical showpiece for Sony, and arguably the best-looking game on the system."&lt;ref name="1up_review"/&gt; It won several awards, including "Best PSP Action Game", "Best Graphics Technology", and "Best Use of Sound". In September 2010, ''[[GamePro]]'' named ''Chains of Olympus'' the best PSP game. By June 2012, the game had sold 3.2 million copies worldwide, making it the [[List of best-selling video games#PlayStation Portable|fourth best-selling PlayStation Portable game of all time]]. Together with ''[[God of War: Ghost of Sparta]]'', ''Chains of Olympus'' was remastered and released on September 13, 2011, as part of the ''[[God of War: Origins Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3). The remastered version was included in the ''[[God of War Saga]]'' released on August 28, 2012, also for PlayStation 3.

==Gameplay==
{{further|Common gameplay elements in the God of War series}}
''God of War: Chains of Olympus'' is a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] [[single-player video game|single-player]] video game viewed from a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed camera]] perspective. The player controls the character Kratos in [[Combo (video gaming)|combo-based combat]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from [[Greek mythology]], including [[cyclops|cyclopes]], [[Gorgons]], [[satyr]]s, [[harpies]], [[minotaur]]s, [[hoplite]]s, and [[sphinx]]es. Morpheus beasts, shades, [[banshee]]s, fire guards, fire sentries, hyperion guards, and death knights were created specifically for the game. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across [[Beam (structure)|beams]] to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can use it as a jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.&lt;ref name="mahalo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ready at Dawn, ed.|(2008)|pp=4, 10, 11, 12|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat===
Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos: a pair of [[blade]]s attached to [[Chain weapon|chains]] that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of [[Zeus]]—offering alternative combat options.&lt;ref name="mahalo"/&gt; Kratos only learns three [[Magic (gaming)|magical]] abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the [[Efreet]], the Light of Dawn, and [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]'s Wrath, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to [[Poseidon]]'s Trident in ''God of War''— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.&lt;ref name="mahalo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ready at Dawn, ed.|(2008)|p=12|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Hades (five trials), and requires players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., Burn 50 soldiers with the Efreet). It is unlocked by completing the game. The player may [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlock]] bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and [[concept art]] of the characters and environments, as rewards. Completion of each of the game's difficulty levels unlocks additional rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ready at Dawn, ed.|(2008)|p=5|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
As with the previous games in the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' franchise, ''God of War: Chains of Olympus'' is set in an alternate version of [[ancient Greece]], populated by the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Gods]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], and other beings of [[Greek mythology]]. With the exception of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], the events are set between those of the games ''[[God of War: Ascension|Ascension]]'' (2013) and ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]'' (2005). Several locations are explored, including the real world locations of the ancient cities of [[Attica]] and [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], the latter including fictional settings of the Temple of [[Helios]] and the Caves of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and several other fictional locations, including the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], which features scenes at the [[Styx|River Styx]], [[Tartarus]], the Fields of [[Elysium]], and the Temple of [[Persephone]].

Attica is a war-torn city under assault by the [[Persian Empire]] and their pet [[basilisk]], and is the site of [[Eurybiades]]' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog of the Dream God, [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]]. Just beyond the city is the Temple of Helios, which sits atop the Sun Chariot, which has plummeted to Earth in Helios' absence. [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]], [[Zephyrus|Zephyros]], [[Eurus|Euros]], and [[Notus|Notos]], [[Anemoi|gods]] of the [[North wind|north]], [[West wind|west]], [[East wind|east]], and [[South wind|south]] winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is an underground cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess [[Eos]], the Primordial Fires, and a statue of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]. The Underworld is the underground realm of the dead and is host to the River Styx and ferryman of the dead, [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]. Tartarus is the prison of the dead and the Titans where the massive Titan [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] is chained. The Fields of Elysium are home to deserving souls that roam peacefully and are overlooked by the Temple of Persephone.

===Characters===
{{main|Characters of God of War}}
The protagonist of the game is [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] (voiced by [[Terrence C. Carson]]), a former Captain of [[Sparta]]'s Army, and once servant to the God of War, [[Ares]]. He now serves the other Olympian Gods in hopes that they will free him of his nightmares. Other characters include Kratos' mentor and ally [[Athena]] ([[Erin Torpey]]), the Goddess of Wisdom; Eos (Erin Torpey), the Goddess of Dawn and sister of Helios; Persephone ([[Marina Gordon]]), the Queen of the Underworld and the main antagonist; and [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] ([[Fred Tatasciore]]), a four-armed Titan imprisoned in Tartarus after the [[Titanomachy|Great War]]. Kratos' deceased daughter Calliope ([[Debi Derryberry]]) briefly reunites with him in the Fields of Elysium and his wife Lysandra appears in a flashback. Minor characters include Helios ([[Dwight Schultz]]), the captured Sun God; Charon (Dwight Schultz), the ferryman of the Underworld; and the [[Persian Empire|Persian King]] (Fred Tatasciore), leader of the Persian forces attacking Attica.&lt;ref name="characters"/&gt; The Dream God Morpheus is an [[unseen character]] that affects the plot.&lt;ref name="mahalo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mahalo.com/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus-walkthrough/ |title=God of War Chains of Olympus Walkthrough |author=Mahalo Video Games |publisher=[[Mahalo.com]] |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIvP1gTy?url=http://www.mahalo.com/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus-walkthrough/ |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
[[File:God of War COO Gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] battles the [[basilisk]] in the city of Attica.&lt;ref name="mahalo"/&gt;]]
During Kratos' ten years of service to the Olympian Gods, he is sent to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army. After successfully killing the Persian King, decimating his army and slaying their pet basilisk, Kratos observes the Sun fall from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. As he fights his way through the city of Marathon, the Spartan witnesses the black fog of the Olympian Morpheus cover the land. He hears a haunting flute melody, which he recognizes as a melody once played by his deceased daughter Calliope. Finding the Temple of Helios, Kratos is tasked by Athena to find the missing Sun God, as Morpheus has caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber in the absence of light. The Spartan eventually locates Helios' sister, Eos, who tells Kratos that the Titan Atlas has abducted her brother. Eos advises Kratos to seek the Primordial Fires, which he uses to awaken the fire steeds of Helios. The steeds take the Spartan to the Underworld, where he has two encounters with Charon at the River Styx. Although Charon initially defeats Kratos and banishes him to Tartarus, the Spartan returns and destroys the ferryman.&lt;ref name="mahalo"/&gt;

After locating the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos is given a choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power to be reunited with his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband [[Hades]]. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold the weight of the world on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will [[God of War II|meet again]]. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.&lt;ref name="mahalo"/&gt;

In a [[post-credits scene]], Kratos is still riding Helios' chariot back into the sky and after seeing the return of the Sun, Kratos loses consciousness from the exertion and plummets to the ground. At the last moment, Kratos is saved by Athena and Helios, and Athena tells Helios that "He will live."&lt;ref name="mahalo"/&gt;

Two of the voice actors returned from the previous installments to reprise their roles, which were Terrence C. Carson and Linda Hunt, who voiced Kratos and the narrator respectively. Erin Torpey adopted the dual roles of Athena and Eos. Fred Tatasciore, who voiced different characters in previous installments, returned, and in this game, voiced both Atlas and the Persian King. [[Carole Ruggier]] and [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] did not return to reprise their roles, which were Athena and Atlas respectively. Voice actor Dwight Schultz voiced both Charon and Helios; Debi Derryberry voiced Calliope and continued this role in a later installment; and Marina Gordon provided the voice of Persephone.

The game was praised for its graphics and presentation. Matt Leone of 1UP claimed ''Chains of Olympus'' is "a technical showpiece for Sony, and arguably the best-looking game on the system."&lt;ref name="1up_review"/&gt; Robert Falcon of Modojo.com similarly praised the presentation, calling it "an absolute stunner, the pinnacle of PSP development". He also praised the visuals as "absolutely breathtaking," and that the "game moves beautifully throughout, with very little loss in detail or speed."&lt;ref name="modojo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modojo.com/reviews/psp/god_of_war_chains_of_olympus/ |title=God of War: Chains of Olympus (PSP) Review |date=March 6, 2008 |last=Falcon |first=Robert |publisher=Modojo.com |accessdate=August 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIyXveha?url=http://www.modojo.com/reviews/psp/god_of_war_chains_of_olympus/ |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s Jonathan Hunt said that it "occasionally suffers from screen tearing and framerate drops."&lt;ref name=g4/&gt;

Several reviewers praised Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls and gameplay. Because the [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) controller has two analog sticks and the PSP only has one, ''[[GamePro]]'' stated "the lack of a second analog stick could have been problematic but it's not."&lt;ref name="gamepro_review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/sony/psp/games/reviews/162468.shtml|title=Review: God of War: Chains of Olympus for PSP on GamePro.com|accessdate=February 21, 2008|date=February 20, 2008|last=Kim|first=Tae K.|publisher=''[[GamePro]]''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225123920/http://www.gamepro.com/sony/psp/games/reviews/162468.shtml|archivedate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modojo.com similarly stated that despite the lack of a second analog stick, "Kratos handles superbly on the PSP" and that the weapon and magic attacks are "mapped out perfectly around the PSP's control set-up."&lt;ref name="modojo"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s Chris Roper even claimed the control scheme "works better than on the PS2." Roper further claimed that Ready at Dawn "has done a stellar job of keeping Kratos' move set intact," stating that "combat is extremely responsive."&lt;ref name="ign_review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/852/852821p1.html |title=IGN: God of War: Chains of Olympus Review |accessdate=February 21, 2008 |date=February 18, 2008 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] |work=[[IGN]] |first=Chris |last=Roper |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIyXDYen?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/18/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus-review |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Leone of 1UP similarly praised developers solution for the control scheme as well as the game's "fantastic" pacing.&lt;ref name="1up_review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3166395 |title=Reviews: God of War PSP |date=February 19, 2008 |accessdate=February 21, 2008 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] |work=[[1UP.com|1UP]] |first=Matt |last=Leone |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIyRle10?url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/god-war-psp |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''GamePro'' criticized the relative lack of variety in enemies.&lt;ref name="gamepro_review"/&gt; The puzzles were criticized, and G4 claimed that some "are so maddeningly difficult to solve",&lt;ref name=g4&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/psp/44693/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus/review/ |title=God of War: Chains of Olympus |publisher=[[G4 Media]] |work=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] |date=February 26, 2008 |first=Jonathan |last=Hunt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIyTElYc?url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/psp/44693/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus/ |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[GameSpot]]'s Aaron Thomas noted the lack of puzzles, claiming that it "could have used more".&lt;ref name="gs_review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/god-of-war/reviews/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus-review-6187153/ |title=God of War: Chains of Olympus Review |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |date=March 4, 2008 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[GameSpot]] |first=Aaron |last=Thomas |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIyVZYhR?url=http://uk.gamespot.com/god-of-war/reviews/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus-review-6187153/ |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GamePro'' also criticized the fact that "You still have to lug boxes around to solve environmental puzzles".&lt;ref name="gamepro_review"/&gt; Kristan Reed of [[Eurogamer]] also criticized Ready at Dawn for cutting some puzzles, as well as cutting co-op play, multiplayer, dialogue, and characters.&lt;ref name=euro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus-review |title=God of War: Chains of Olympus Review |date=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=February 13, 2012 |first=Kristan |last=Reed |publisher=Eurogamer Network |work=[[Eurogamer]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CIySYJgu?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus-review |archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameSpot&lt;ref name="gs_review"/&gt; and IGN&lt;ref name="ign_review"/&gt; criticized the short length and minimal boss fights, although ''GamePro'' stated that it has "the same epic feel" as the previous installments and claimed that if it was the only ''God of War'' title, "it would still stand on its own merits."&lt;ref name="gamepro_review"/&gt; Cheat Code Central claimed ''Chains of Olympus'' is "one of the best games ever made for the PSP."

'''Henry''' "'''Henny'''" '''Youngman''' (original Yiddish surname Yungman;&lt;ref name="jweekly"/&gt; 16 March 1906&amp;nbsp;– 24 February 1998) was an English-American comedian and violinist famous for his mastery of the "[[one-line joke|one-liner]]"; his best known one-liner being "Take my wife&amp;nbsp;... please".

In a time when many comedians told elaborate anecdotes, Youngman's routine consisted of telling simple one-liner jokes, occasionally with interludes of [[violin]] playing. These depicted simple, cartoon-like situations, eliminating lengthy build-ups and going straight to the punch line. He was known as "The King of the One Liners", a title conferred to him by columnist [[Walter Winchell]]. A stage performance by Youngman lasted only 15 to 20 minutes but contained dozens of jokes in rapid-fire succession.

==Early life==
Youngman was born to a [[Jewish]]&lt;ref name="jweekly"&gt;{{cite web |first=Leslie |last=Katz |title=Henny Youngman kept them laughing until the end |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/7721/henny-youngman-kept-them-laughing-until-the-end/ |work=[[J.|Jweekly]] |date=February 27, 1998 |accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; family in [[London]], England.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |first=Mervyn |last=Rothstein |title=Henny Youngman, King of the One-Liners, Is Dead at 91 After 6 Decades of Laughter |url =https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/25/arts/henny-youngman-king-of-the-one-liners-is-dead-at-91-after-6-decades-of-laughter.html |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York, when he was a child. He grew up in New York City, and began as a comedian after he had worked for years at a print shop, where he wrote "comedy cards" containing one-line gags. The comedy cards were discovered by up-and-coming comedian [[Milton Berle]], who encouraged Youngman and formed a close friendship with him. Berle said about him, "The only thing funnier than Henny's jokes is his violin playing."

==Career==

Encouraged by his family to study the violin, Youngman began in show business as a musician. He led a small [[jazz]] band called the Swanee Syncopaters, and during performances, he often told jokes. One night, the club's regular comedian did not show up and the owner asked Youngman to fill in. He enjoyed it and began his long career as a stand-up comic. His inoffensive, friendly style of comedy kept his audiences laughing for decades. He first played in clubs and [[speakeasy|speakeasies]], but his break came on [[Kate Smith]]'s radio show in 1937. Youngman's manager [[Ted Collins (manager)|Ted Collins]] booked him on the show, and he made many appearances on the radio.

During the 1940s, Youngman tried to work into films as an actor, but he found little work in [[Hollywood]]. He returned to nightclubs and worked steadily, performing as many as 200 shows per year. Working with writer/producer Danny Shapiro, Youngman recorded ''The Primitive Sounds of Henny Youngman'' a "live" album for [[National Recording Corporation]] in 1959 at the Celebrity Club in St. Louis. The album is still popular today in CD, and is a frequent iTunes download.

Like many comedians, Henny Youngman treated his profession as a working job, one where making a living is difficult, and getting paid for the work is all-important. In numerous interviews, Youngman's advice to other entertainers was to ''nem di gelt'' (Yiddish for "take the money").

He was quoted in an interview with the online magazine ''Eye'': "I get on the plane. I go and do the job, grab the money and I come home and I keep it clean. Those are my rules. Sinatra does the same thing, only he has a helicopter waiting. That's the difference."

When the New York Telephone Company started its [[Dial-a-Joke]] in 1974, over three million people called in one month to hear 30&amp;nbsp;seconds of Youngman's material—the most ever for a comedian.

Youngman never retired, and he performed his stage act in venues worldwide until his final days. As his fame passed into legendary status, he never considered himself aloof or above others, and he never refused to perform a show in a small venue or unknown club. In a tribute to Youngman, TV and animation producer [[Mark Evanier]] described him in a way that emphasized both his money consciousness and his love of performing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He would take his fiddle and go to some hotel that had banquet rooms. He'd consult the daily directory in the lobby and find a party—usually a bar mitzvah reception—and he would go up to the room and ask to speak to whoever was paying for the affair. "I'm Henny Youngman," he would tell that person. "I was playing a date in another banquet room here and one of the waiters suggested you might want to have me do my act for your gathering here." He would negotiate whatever price he could get—$200, $500, preferably in cash—and he would do his act for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://povonline.com/cols/COL178.htm |title=Point of View |last=Evanier |first=Mark |date=1998-04-03 |work=POVonline.com |accessdate=29 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208075343/http://povonline.com/cols/COL178.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roger Ebert described a similar episode in a 2011 film review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I once observed Henny Youngman taping a TV show in the old NBC studios at the Merchandise Mart. We got into an elevator together. It stopped at the second floor, a private club. A wedding was under way. Youngman got off the elevator, asked to meet the father of the bride and said, "I'm Henny Youngman. I'll do 10 minutes for $100."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110622/REVIEWS/110629993| title=Conan O'Brien Can't Stop| last=Ebert| first=Robert| author-link=Roger Ebert| date=June 22, 2011| work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Youngman made numerous appearances on television, including a long-running stint on ''[[Laugh-In|Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. In 1955, he hosted a TV series entitled ''The Henny and Rocky Show,'' appearing with champion boxer [[Rocky Graziano]]. He had cameo appearances in several movies, including ''[[Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood]]'', ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'', and ''[[Goodfellas]].''

He had a larger role as the strip-club owner in [[Herschell Gordon Lewis|Herschell Gordon Lewis's]] ''[[The Gore Gore Girls]]'', a fact he denied vehemently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Gore Gore Girls: Butts and gore| work=[[Las Vegas Mercury]]| date=October 28, 2004| first=Newt| last=Briggs| url=http://www.lasvegasmercury.com/2004/MERC-Oct-28-Thu-2004/25096536.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121020352/http://www.lasvegasmercury.com/2004/MERC-Oct-28-Thu-2004/25096536.html| archivedate=January 21, 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} He made a few recordings, most notably ''The Primitive Side of Henny Youngman'', recorded live in St. Louis and released by National Recording Corporation on the NRC label. The CD is still in print.

His autobiography is entitled ''Take My Life, Please!''.

Youngman's last movie appearance before his death was in Daniel Robert Cohn's film ''[[Eyes Beyond Seeing]],'' in which he has a cameo as a mental patient claiming to be Henny Youngman.

==Personal life==

Youngman's wife Sadie Cohen was often the butt of his jokes ("My wife said to me, 'For our anniversary I want to go somewhere I've never been before.' I said, 'Try the kitchen!{{'"}}, or "My wife's cooking is fit for a king. [Gesturing as if feeding an invisible dog.] Here, King; here, King!" Also, "Last night my wife said the weather outside was fit for neither man nor beast, so we both stayed home.") In reality the two were very close, with Sadie often accompanying her husband on his tours. The Youngmans remained married for 59 years until Sadie's death in 1987 after a prolonged illness. While she was ill, Henny had an ICU built in their bedroom, so she could be taken care of at home, rather than in the hospital, as Sadie was terrified of hospitals.

Henny explained the origin of his classic line "Take my wife, please" as a misinterpretation: he took his wife to a radio show and asked a stagehand to escort his wife to a seat. But his request was taken as a joke, and Youngman used the line countless times ever after.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Youngman had two children, Gary and Marilyn. Gary started his career screenwriting and directing, continuing to work in the film industry in various capacities. Gary is best known for his 1976 film ''[[Rush It]]!''.

With the exception of a week following his wife's death, and the month he was in his final hospital stay, Henny was known for having worked almost every day for over 70 years without vacations or other breaks.

==Death==
Youngman developed [[pneumonia]] and died on 24 February 1998, three weeks before his 92nd birthday. He is interred in the Mount Carmel Cemetery, [[Glendale, Queens|Glendale, New York]] next to his wife Sadie.

'''Hero''' (formerly known as '''Hero TV''') is a [[pop culture]] web portal based in [[Quezon City]]. It provides content on [[anime]], [[Japan|Japanese]] [[pop culture]] and [[eSports|eGames]] and is currently operated by [[ABS-CBN Digital Media]], a division of the media conglomerate [[ABS-CBN Corporation]]. It was formerly a 24-hour [[Television in the Philippines|Filipino]] [[pay TV]] channel from 2005 to 2018 operated by ABS-CBN narrowcast arm [[Creative Programs]] which its programming was composed primarily of [[Filipino language|Filipino]]-dubbed [[anime|Japanese animation]].

==Background==
{{Imageframe|width=200|content=[[File:HeroTV.JPG|200px]]&lt;br&gt;[[File:HeroTV-2010.jpg|200px]]&lt;br&gt;[[File:HeroTV-2013.jpg|200px]]|caption=Logos used from 2005 to 2014. Top logo was used until 2010 when the center logo was used until April 2013 and the bottom logo used until December 2014. All logos are actually similar with the removal of the black outline from the second version and the addition of a backdrop graffiti design with indent slogan and thin black outline to the third version.|align=left}}

Much of the content in Hero is attributed to the fact that Creative Programs Inc's parent company ABS-CBN (through its [[ABS-CBN|main network]]) has produced numerous dubs of anime years before the launch of Hero, as well as maintained an [[Animax Asia|Animax]] airing block for quite sometime. Aside from those, the channel also airs anime that have not yet seen in any terrestrial or cable channel shown in the Philippines prior to its first showing in the channel, such as ''[[Mirmo!|Mirmo de Pon!]]''.

The channel also once featured anime dubbed by Telesuccess, Inc., supplier for most of the anime aired on ABS-CBN's rival [[GMA Network]], before transferring them all to [[TeleAsia]]. Some of these are ''[[Love Hina]], [[Rune Soldier]], and [[Shaman King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/magtibayanime/gma7.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:06:26 List of Philippine anime aired in the Philippines, GMA 7 list]&lt;/ref&gt; Others seen in the channel were previously shown in English on [[Cartoon Network (Philippines)|Cartoon Network]]'s Philippine feed (e.g. [[Crush Gear Turbo]]) or, in the case of ''[[Zettai Muteki Raijin-Oh]]'', on government-controlled [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] (now known as [[CNN Philippines]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/magtibayanime/varioustv.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:06:31 List of Philippine anime aired in the Philippines, Various TV channels]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the channel features re-dubs (i.e. it produced its own dubbed version of anime which previously were already dubbed in Tagalog.) Examples of these are ''[[Mon Colle Knights]], [[Metal Fighter Miku]], [[Zenki]], [[The Slayers]], and [[Voltes V]]''.

In 2011, undubbed anime was introduced to the channel with accompanying Filipino-language subtitles in the form of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light]]'', and [[Initial D#Extra Stage|the ''Initial D Extra Stage'' OVA]]. The reason for airing these two anime features in their original Japanese audio is not known.

In the Summer of 2012, HERO began to greatly increase its lineup of new titles, starting with ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds]], [[Toaru Kagaku no Railgun]], [[Naruto|Naruto Shippuden]], [[Hanasaku Iroha]], and [[Shiki (novel series)|Shiki]]''; as well as airing the first two series of the ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' franchise, and a more complete version of the [[Aniplex]]-produced ''[[Jigoku Shoujo]]''. Except for ''Sailor Moon'', ''Jigoku Shoujo'' and ''Toaru Kagaku no Railgun'', all of these titles have never been aired on Animax before (Animax airs ''Railgun'' and ''Sailor Moon'' in other countries).

===Shutdown and migration to social media===
On December 23, 2017, an Anime Pilipinas article stated that Hero TV will end its broadcast operations on January 31, 2018 after 12 years due to [[Movie Central (Philippines)|lack of advertising support and change in business direction]] (before Hero TV, sister stations [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] and [[ABS-CBN Regional Channel]] closed down earlier on January 15.) It was publicly announced through a plug that aired in the channel starting January 16.&lt;ref name=end&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.animepilipinas.com/2017/12/23/abs-cbn-herotv-cease-broadcast-january-31/|title=HEROtv set to end broadcast on January 31|publisher=Anime Pilipinas|date=December 23, 2017|accessdate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last full day of broadcast, January 31, Hero TV aired a Facebook live broadcast, where its staff shared great memories and thanked supporters. Hero TV signed off for the last time on February 1, 2018 at 12:04 am after airing a tribute video that shows past anime titles, and local programs and events produced or sponsored by the station, ending with a final farewell message and the words "Hero Now Signing Off." Few seconds later, cable providers still receiving Hero would see the modified EBU test card that reads "ABS-CBN TOC SD" before shutdown until the provider can replace it or automatically scan with another channel, while other providers like Sky Cable (in Metro Manila and in selected metropolitan and large cities) have replaced this channel with [[Liga (TV channel)|Liga]], a sports channel that complements the programming of [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]] with international football and local sports events, which was silently launched earlier on January 1.

Hero was relaunched and demoted as a social media portal on February 7, 2018 and is being handled by the Lifestyle team from [[ABS-CBN Digital Media]]. Whilst its news content includes anime, gaming and pop culture, it will not carry anime titles nor establish an anime video-on-demand service. Meanwhile, its sister station [[Yey!]] has limited airing of some of the anime titles aired on Hero and will carry the last remaining new titles on Yey! channel including ''[[Ace of Diamond]]'' and ''[[My Hero Academia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.facebook.com/notes/hero-tv/hero-evolves-into-a-digital-platform/1675462479159615/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hero had its two-hour Sunday morning anime block on [[Jeepney TV]] beginning March 11, 2018. However, it was later cancelled in July 2018 just before Jeepney TV became available on [[ABS-CBN TV Plus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.animepilipinas.com/2018/03/02/abs-cbn-jeepney-tv-relaunches-hero-zone-anime-block-march-11/|title=ABS-CBN’s Jeepney TV relaunches HERO Zone anime block on March 11|publisher=Anime Pilipinas|date=March 2, 2018|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final programming==
{{Main|List of programs previously broadcast by Hero}}

===Non-anime programs===
Although the channel markets itself as an "anime channel", some of the programs it aired were non-anime. They are ''Mission Odyssey'' and ''Shadow of the Elves'', both produced by the Berliner Film Companie, and the [[tokusatsu]] or live-action shows ''[[Chouseishin Gransazer|The Gransazers]], [[Kamen Rider Ryuki|Masked Rider Ryuki]], and [[Uchuu Keiji Shaider|Shaider]]''.

'''Hmong music''' is an important part of the culture of the [[Hmong people]], an ethnic group from southeast Asia.  Because the [[Hmong language]] is [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]], there is a close connection between Hmong music and the spoken language.  Music is an important part of Hmong life, played for entertainment, for welcoming guests, and at weddings and funerals. Hmong musical instruments includes flutes such as the dra, leaves also called nblaw, and the [[qeej]] or gaeng, a type of mouth organ.

==History==
The Hmong people trace their origin to the [[Yellow River]] region of China around 2700 B.C.  In the 16th century Hmong leaders formed a kingdom in the central Chinese provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Henan. This kingdom existed for several centuries before being defeated by the Chinese government.  Surviving Hmong led to the mountains of Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan, where many Hmong still live today.  In Hmong folktales and songs, this ancient Hmong kingdom is celebrated as a golden age. Accompanying the legend is the story of a Hmong messiah who will someday lead the Hmong people to victory against their oppressors and re-establish the ancient kingdom. It is a story that has inspired Hmong insurrections throughout the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cal.org/co/hmong/hhist.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118030940/http://www.cal.org/co/hmong/hhist.html |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular plot for songs is the story of an orphan who becomes a hero through persistence.

Hmong used poetry and story cloths to pass down their history and culture to successive generations. Contemporary Hmong songs are made up of poems using rhyme and clever word play or traditional songs. Skilled singers can gain great fame among the Hmong population across the world. Even though many Hmong have left their homeland in China, their songs are still connected to the life they had there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bankston III |first=Carl |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Judy Galens |editor2=Anna Sheets |editor3=Robyn V Young |encyclopedia=Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America |title=Hmong Americans |edition= |date= |year=1995 |publisher=Gale Research Inc |volume=1 |location=Detroit, Michigan |id= |doi= |pages=670–881 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different types of vocal songs: Kwv txhiaj (storytelling songs), zaj tshoob (engagement songs), ntau txhuv (wishing songs), laig dab (Invitation songs), hu plig (spirit Invocation songs), ua neeb (possession chant), qhua ke (farewell to the spirit songs), and nyiav (weeping songs).

Kwv txhiaj are performed mostly by Hmong couples and involve comparing aspects of one's lover to aspects of nature, or to tell a story or explain the details of a ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storytellingandvideoconferencing.com/11.html |title=Continuity and Change in Chinese Storytelling |accessdate=2009-11-14 |last=Miller |first=Eric }}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of kwv txhiaj include:
* kwv txhiaj plees, a love song based on broken relationships and impractical matches
* kwv txhiaj ua nyab, a bride song which is usually a sad song about leaving her family
* kwv txhiaj cia nyab, a song sung by the groom to reassure the bride-to-be and to convince her not to abandon him
* kwv txhiaj tuag, a song about someone who has died or tells of a wish to die
* kwv txhiaj ntsuag, an orphan's song that can be sung by a widow or a forsaken girl
* kwv txhiaj sib-ncaim, a song about separation
* kwv txhiaj ua tshoob-kos, a wedding song where the groom's side and the bride's side have answering parts.

==Instruments==
Instruments are an important part of Hmong music. Hmong Instruments have a tonal quality that allows words to be heard just by playing.

===Qeej===
The most well-known instrument is the [[qeej]], a type of [[reed pipe]], in which each tone corresponds to a Hmong spoken word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hmongstudies.com/HSJ-v2n1_Morrison.pdf|title = The Hmong Qeej: Speaking to the Spirit World|last = Morrison|first = Gayle|date = 1997-09-27|journal = The Hmong Qeej: Speaking to the Spirit World|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a free-reed mouth organ, used to play a text-based melody in the middle range. It consists of a wooden wind chest, with a long horizontal tapering neck ending in a mouth hole. The wooden section is made from two identical pieces of mahogany bound together with straps. The six bamboo tubes are variously curving or straight and can also change in length from quite small for a child's instrument to about two meters long for a more experience player.  Each bamboo tube has a hole for fingering above the wind chest and a metal reed over a hole in the pipe encircled within the wind chest. For extra volume, the lowest tube, which is also the thickest and shortest one, often has two or three reeds. The tubes are inserted vertically through the wind chest. When the player exhales or inhales and covers one or more holes for fingering, this allows air in the tube in motion to create a musical tone. There are two types of qeej composition: text-based and text-free. Both genres are played successively in rituals, including funerals, ancestral rites, offerings to vital spirits, sacrifices to the drum, and marriages.

The qeej is more than an instrument in the Hmong culture. The music it plays is like an extension to the [[Hmong language]], meaning every note symbolizes its own word. To Hmong people, the sounds of the Qeej is like speech and Qeej players are known as story tellers. It is most often played at funerals and its purpose is to communicate with the spiritual world by leading the deceased person to its rightful place. If this fails by all means, the deceased spirit may wander back and bring misfortune to the family.

===Raj===
Raj are small, sometimes disposable, wind instruments. There are two types of raj: the raj nplaim and the raj lev les. The more-popular raj nplaim is a [[Free reed aerophone|free-reed pipe]] and is a longer flute than the raj lev les. It uses a small reed to create a buzzing tone quality. It is made in many different sizes and can have from five to seven holes. It is played by sealing one's lips around the reed or by putting the top of the instrument in one's mouth and blowing to make the different pitches. The raj lev les is also a free-reed pipe but it is shorter and recorder-like. The raj lev les can be made out of a small piece of bamboo or grass.
These instruments are known for playing words rather than melodies. This is done by setting pitches to match certain tones of words. {{cns|In Laos, the raj is commonly associated with [[Hmong customs and culture|Hmong courtship]] and dating practices.|date=May 2014}} Young boys and girls play songs back and forth that express their feelings to each other.  Raj are also played for entertainment purposes or as a way to signal others in the jungle. Although the raj is not played by everyone, most people in Laos could understand the messages played on the instrument because the pitches were based on real tones of the words. Most of these messages were either about loneliness or love.

===Ncas===
The ncas is another instrument used in Hmong music similar to the [[jaw harp]]. The ncas is a six-inch, thin strip of wood or brass with a blade cut out from it. The ncas is played by vibrating next to the mouth while blowing air through the blade. It is commonly used in Hmong courting practices.

===Nplooj===
The nplooj is a leaf, usually a banana leaf that is curled up and positioned in the mouth so it vibrates when it is blown. It makes loud, very high pitched sounds that can be heard from miles away. The varying pitches are made by pulling on the leaf and blowing to make certain tones that relate to words in the [[Hmong language]]. This instrument can be made from almost any nearby plant or tree, making it easily accessible for Hmong children. The nplooj was traditionally used during times of war, where they were used to send signals in combat and secret messages communicated with words played as melodies.

==Contemporary Hmong music==
These traditional forms of music are not as common among younger generations of Hmong, especially those in the Hmong diaspora.  Nonetheless, the music can still be heard at Hmong cultural festivals, usually being performed by elders in the community.

In today's modern society, Hmong bands and solo artists are growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/994287647|title=Musical minorities : the sounds of Hmong ethnicity in Northern Vietnam|last=Ó Briain|first=Lonán|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=9780190626976|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=994287647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hybris''''' is a vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] video game for the [[Amiga]] home computer developed by [[Cope-Com]] and published by [[Discovery Software]].

The creators are working to port the game to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cope-com.com/hybris/&lt;/ref&gt; Cope-Com later created the [[spiritual successor]] [[Battle Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mobygames.com/game/battle-squadron&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Players choose a [[player character]] commander from either Lovett or Maverick and begin play, controlling a spaceship which can be moved up and down the screen, as well as left and right.&lt;ref name="cvg"&gt;{{cite magazine| last = Brennan| first = Ciaran | title = Reviews - Hybris| magazine = [[Computer and Video Games]]| issue = 90| pages = 58, 59| publisher = [[EMAP]] | date = April 1989| url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_090_1989-04_EMAP_Publishing_GB/Computer__Video_Games_Issue_090_1989-04_EMAP_Publishing_GB#page/n57/mode/2up | accessdate = 2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airborne alien enemies and groundbased defensive weapons appear as the game scrolls upwards constantly, these can be destroyed by the player's weapon fire. More advanced weapons can be collected in the form of [[Power-up|power ups]]. ''Hybris'' has a weapon enhancement feature, called "expansion"; once a new weapon has been collected it can be temporarily upgraded by the player rotating the joystick or pressing "Enter" on the keyboard, each weapon can be enhanced three times before a new weapon is needed in order to enhance again. Pressing "Space" on the keyboard activates a smart bomb that destroy every enemy (except bosses) and bullet on the screen: player starts with three of them.&lt;ref name="amiga computing"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Luckham| first = Mark | title = Reviews - Hybris| magazine= [[Amiga Computing]]| volume = 1| issue = 8| pages = 73| publisher = [[Europress]]| location = [[Macclesfield]]| date = January 1989| url=https://archive.org/stream/amiga-computing-magazine-008/AmigaComputing_008_Jan_1989#page/n71/mode/2up | accessdate = 2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hill &amp; Company''' or '''Johillco''' was a British toy company specialising in the manufacture of [[hollowcast]] metal and later plastic [[toy soldiers]] becoming second to [[W. Britain]] in popularity. No one knows where the name of John Hill came from.

==History==
John Hill &amp; Co was started in 1898 by a former employee of [[W. Britain]] named Mr F. H Wood.&lt;ref&gt;p.134 Joplin, Norman ''The Great Book of Hollow-Cast Figures'' 1993 New Cavendish Books&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Britains, Johillco was the first British hollowcast figure company to sell their figures individually&lt;ref name="Garratt"&gt;Garratt, John G. ''Model Soldiers-A Collectors Guide'' Seeley Service &amp; Co London&lt;/ref&gt; leading to competition from Britains who later began to sell individual figures and figures painted less ornately to be sold in [[variety store]]s like the [[F. W. Woolworth Company]].

Johillco also manufactured [[Coronation]] and other souvenir items.

The firm's original factory was located at 2-22 Britannia Row, [[Islington]], London but the factory was bombed during [[World War II]]. In August 1946 the company reopened under new management in Plumbe Street [[Burnley]]. Also after World War II, Johillco's chief figure designer Wilfred Cherrington in conjunction with a Mr Leaver started his own company called Cherilea.

In their book ''The Art of the Toy Soldier'', the authors note that due to the cheapness of the figures and the individuality of their poses, Johillco figures were found more in working-class homes than the expensive Britains that came in boxes of rigid identical poses. The authors also noted the company probably used a variety of sculptors leading to various grades of quality of Johillco figures, that the authors call "the good, the bad, and the ugly".&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Burtt R &amp; Kurtz, Henry I ''The Art of the Toy Soldier'' 1990 Abbeville Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to toy soldiers and cowboys and Indians, Johillco made many figures of knights and a [[movie tie-in]] set of figures from [[MGM]]'s ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)]]'' as well as [[spacemen]].

Johillco was slow to realise the effect of production in plastic. From 1956 they began making plastic figures in their hollowcast moulds under the name of '''Hilco'''&lt;ref name="Garratt"/&gt; but the company ceased in the early 1960s.

'''Miss Curaçao''' (In [[Papiamentu]]: ''Miss Kòrsou'') is a national [[beauty pageant]] in [[Curaçao]]. This pageant is unrelated to the [[Señorita Curaçao]] or [[Miss International Curaçao]] pageant.

==History==
The pageant started in 1963 and sends contestants to the [[Miss World]] and [[Miss Universe]] pageants. The organization started with the creation of the Curaçao Youth Beauty Contest Organization (CYBECO).

Between 1997 and 2006 Sheida Wever, former Miss Curaçao 1985 who went to compete to the Miss Universe pageant that same year, organized the national pageant and was the national director for both Miss World and Miss Universe.
 
In 2006, Reinilla Productions Developments (ReProD) obtained the [[Miss World]], Miss Intercontinental, [[Top Model of the World]] and [[Miss Earth]] franchise for Curaçao. Their first delegate was Fyrena Martha who competed in Miss World 2006 in Poland. In 2007 and 2008, ReProD in association with Sanjess Promotions held a joint pageant where the Miss Universe and Miss World representative were selected. Since 2009 the event is independent to Miss Universe Curaçao.

Since 2006, the Curaçao Tourism Board holds the [[Miss Universe]] franchise and every year they have a bidding to choose who is going to organize the Miss Curaçao Universe pageant, Sanjess Promotions run by Jearmeane Colastica organized it in 2007 and 2008.

Smaller pageants had been held to select contestants to [[Miss International]], until 2002 by Richard Isa.

In 2008, the Curaçao Beauty Organization presided by Aubrey America won the bid to organize the pageant jointly with Hart &amp; Private Productions. The winner of Miss Universe Curaçao represents the island in [[Miss Universe]].

In 2011, [[Evalina van Putten]] won [[Reina Hispanoamericana 2011]] in Bolivia. This was first time Curaçao winning the title.

In 2013, after a long time of speculating about the Miss Universe Curaçao pageant, Coridja Stars Productions got the license to organize the most important pageant of the island.

In 2018 the Curaçao Beauty Pageant Committee took the franchise of Miss Universe, together with Miss World and Miss Earth.

Since 1963 traditionally the winner of Miss Universe Curaçao represents her country at [[Miss Universe]]. On occasion, when the winner does not qualify (due to age) for either contest, a runner-up is sent. Curaçao had sent contestants to [[Miss Universe]] since [[Miss Universe 1963|1963]] with Philomena Zielinki, the second Miss Curaçao. Of all the 48 representatives from the island, 5 of them have placed in the semifinals.

'''MyAnimeList''', often abbreviated as '''MAL''', is an [[anime]] and [[manga]] [[social network]]ing and [[social cataloging application]] website. The site provides its users with a list-like system to organize and score anime and manga.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; It facilitates finding users who share similar tastes and provides a large database on anime and manga.&lt;ref name="kotaku"/&gt; The site claims to have 4.4 million anime and 775,000 [[manga]] entries.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the site received 120 million visitors a month.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

==History==
The site was launched in April 2006 by Garrett Gyssler and maintained solely by him until 2008.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2018/05/30/myanimelist-passes-third-day-of-unexpected-downtime/#4de588827e9e |title=MyAnimeList Passes Third Day Of Unexpected Downtime |last=Orsini |first=Lauren |website=[[Forbes]] |language=en |access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2008, [[CraveOnline]], a men's entertainment and lifestyle site owned by AtomicOnline, purchased MyAnimeList for an undisclosed sum of money.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/craveonline-buys-manga-social-net-myanimelist/ |title=CraveOnline Buys Manga Social Net MyAnimeList |language=en |website=''[[CBS News]]''|publisher=''[[CBS Interactive]]'' |access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[DeNA]] announced that it had purchased MyAnimeList from CraveOnline, and that they would partner with Anime Consortium Japan to stream anime on the service, via [[Daisuki.net|Daisuki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-07-18/dena-confirms-myanimelist-buyout/.90591|title=DeNA Confirms MyAnimeList Buyout|last=Hale|first=Daryl Lee|date=July 18, 2015|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnetjpdena"/&gt;

MyAnimeList announced in April 2016 that they had embed episodes from [[Crunchyroll]] and [[Hulu]] directly onto the site, with over 20,000 episodes being made available on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-09/myanimelist-adds-more-anime-from-hulu-crunchyroll/.100716|title=MyAnimeList Adds More Anime From Hulu, Crunchyroll (Updated)|date=April 9, 2016|last=Pineda|first=Rafael Antonio|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, MyAnimeList added ''[[The King's Avatar]]'', its first [[Chinese animation|Chinese anime]] to the site's database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1050256.shtml |title=Famous Chinese animation The King’s Avatar picking up steam among anime fans around the globe - Global Times |publisher=''[[Global Times]]'' |website=www.globaltimes.cn |access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8 2018, MyAnimeList opened an online manga store, in partnership with [[Kodansha Comics]] and [[Viz Media]], allowing users to purchase manga digitally from the website. The service originally launched in Canada but later expanded to United States, the United Kingdom, and several other English-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-03-15/myanimelist-opens-manga-store-with-titles-from-viz-kodansha/.128912|title=MyAnimeList Opens Manga Store With Titles From Viz, Kodansha|last=Pineda|first=Rafael Antonio|date=March 15, 2018|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MAL became inaccessible for several days in May and June 2018 when site staff took it offline for maintenance, citing security and privacy concerns.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comicbook"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://comicbook.com/anime/2018/05/31/myanimelist-down-issue-gone-security-problem/ |title=Wait, What's Wrong With MyAnimeList? |website=''Comic Book.com'' |language=en |access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site operators also disabled [[API]] for third-party apps, rendering them unusable.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; The moves were done in efforts to conform to the [[European Union]]'s [[GDPR]] program.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comicbook"/&gt;

==Features==
MyAnimeList lists [[anime|Japanese animation]], [[Korean animation]], and [[Chinese animation]]. Similarly, MyAnimeList has information on [[manga]], [[manwha]] (South Korean comics), [[manhua]] (Chinese comics), as well as [[dōjinshi]] (fan comics) and light novels. Users create lists that they strive to complete. Users can submit reviews, write recommendations, [[blog]]s, post in the site's forum, create clubs to unite with people of similar interests, and subscribe to the [[RSS]] news feed of anime and manga related news. MAL also starts challenges for users to complete their 'lists.'&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/01/why-some-fans-watch-anime-at-double-speed/ |title=Why Some Fans Watch Anime At Double Speed |date=2018-01-11 |website=[[Kotaku]] Australia |publisher=''[[Gawker Media]]'' |language=en |access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scoring ===

MyAnimeList allows users to score the anime and manga on their on a scale from 1 to 10. These scores are then aggregated to give each show in the database a rank from best to worst. A show's rank is calculated twice a day using the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{vS + mC}{v + m}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; stands for the total number of user votes, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for the average user score, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; for the minimum number of votes required to get a calculated score (currently 50), and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; for the average score across the entire anime/manga database. Only scores where a user has completed at least 20% of the anime/manga are calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How are top anime/manga scores calculated? |url=https://myanimelist.net/info.php?go=topanime |website=My Anime List |publisher=MyAnimeList, LLC. |accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}{{Nihongo|'''Nippon Cultural Broadcasting, Inc.'''|株式会社文化放送|Kabushiki Gaisha Bunka Hōsō|extra='''JOQR''', '''QR''' or simply '''Cultural Broadcasting'''}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[radio station]] in [[Tokyo]] which broadcasts to the Kanto area. It is one of the two flagship radio stations of [[National Radio Network (Japan)|National Radio Network (NRN)]] (the other station is {{nihongo|[[Nippon Broadcasting System]], Inc.|株式会社ニッポン放送}}) and is a member of the [[Fujisankei Communications Group]].

The station was established in 1951 by the [[Society of St. Paul]] to promote [[Catholic]] religion on the Japanese culture. JOQR went on the air on March 31, 1952 as the '''Japan Cultural Broadcasting Association'''. Japan Cultural Broadcasting Association was formally dissolved on February 16, 1956 and the JOQR broadcast license was handed over the same day to a new succeeding company, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting Co., Ltd.

In 1957, Cultural Broadcasting established [[Fuji Television]] as part of a joint venture with [[Nippon Broadcasting System]]. Cultural Broadcasting was one of the founding companies behind the creation of the [[Fujisankei Communications Group]] in 1967. To this day, Cultural Broadcasting remains associated with the Fujisankei Communications Group and has a 3.30% ownership in [[Fuji Media Holdings]], the company it helped established with Nippon Broadcasting System in 1957 as Fuji Television.

JOQR moved the head office from Wakaba, [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] to QR Media Plus in Hamamatsuchō, [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]] on July 24, 2006, and started broadcasting from Hamamatsuchō at 13:00 on the same day.

[[Society of St. Paul]] holds 30 percent of the station's shares, followed by [[Shogakukan]] (17.1%), [[Kodansha]] (9.0%) and [[Dai Nippon Printing]] (8.5%).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2137">'''Paint Dancing''' is an American art and [[Novelty and fad dances|dance craze]] which involves both painting and dancing. [[Paint Dancers]], using paint, brushes and paper, attend organized events dressed in ready-to-paint and dance clothing. The concept of combining movement and painting originated during the later part of the American and European [[Modern art]] period; however, Evangeline Welch of Shreveport, Louisiana has been credited with being the "brainchild" of Paint Dancing in the United States of America.&lt;ref name="sfgate article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinberg|first=Stan|title=Artist makes a splash as she dances to the rhythm of the paint |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-05-14/news/17426496_1_paint-art-class-dancing|publisher=SFGate|accessdate=13 December 2010|date=May 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This departure from traditional [[painting style]]s was often referred to as [[Action painting]]. Over the years, several variations of the art form have evolved, including an adaptation introduced by the [[Hippie]]s during the [[Summer of Love]], that integrated the art of [[body painting]] with dancing. One of the more recent introductions of Paint Dancing to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] is being popularized by a grassroots movement created in 2006 by Seattle artist and activist Matt Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paint Dancing Rocks the Scene/Matt Jones Gasworks |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/357443_paintdancing03.html|publisher=Seattle Post Intelligencer|accessdate=13 December 2010|date=Apr 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Studio offers toe-tapping artistic outlet |newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=Apr 23, 2008|author=Kristin Dizon|page=A7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrases "paint dancing" and "paint dancer" and other variations were originally coined in 1996 by Gloria M. Buono, author, illustrator and publisher of ''The Painting Ballerina''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buono|first=Gloria|title=The Painting Ballerina|url=http://www.paintingballerina.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3243">'''''Pelaaja''''' ("Gamer") is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[video game]]s [[magazine]] published 11 times a year by [[H-Town (publisher)|H-Town]]. ''Pelaaja'' turned 15 years old in 2017. Pelaaja covers both [[Personal computer|PC]]s and [[Video game console|console]]s, although between 2003 and 2007 it focused only on consoles. During that time the PC coverage was in a separate magazine named ''PCPelaaja'', now defunct. Its editor-in-chief was [[Miika Huttunen]], who is the current editor-in-chief of Pelaaja.

[[File:Pelaaja Issue 100.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of issue 100 of Pelaaja-magazine]]

==History and profile==
''Pelaaja'' was started by 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tuukka Taarluoto|title=Writing Games. A Study of Finnish Video Game Journalism|url=http://www15.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/GEN/tt-games.html|work=University of Tampere|accessdate=2 June 2016|date=Fall 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611185430/http://www15.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/GEN/tt-games.html|archivedate=11 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest running editor-in-chief of Pelaaja was [[Thomas Puha]]. Its current editor-in-chief is [[Miika Huttunen]], a veteran of the Finnish electronic gaming scene and among the permanent staff is Janne Pyykkönen, who is also the editor-in-chief of H-Town's ''[[Pelaa!]]'' magazine. The art director is Lasse Erkola and some of the frequent collaborators include Miikka Lehtonen, Tero Lehtiniemi and Jukka O. Kauppinen.

The magazine is more akin to European and American videogames magazines than Finnish ones with its focus on exclusive coverage on the latest games and extensive interviews with members of the development community. Game reviews are also a big part of the magazine. The magazine's tagline is "for the love of gaming" as the magazine's staff are hardcore gaming enthusiasts, which is evident in the passionate writing of the magazine features. The magazine was started because the people working on the magazine felt there was no high quality games magazine available in Finland which would focus on console games rather than the PC. Another feature is the international vibe of the magazine via Japan- and US- based writers contributing to the magazine.

'''Pelaaja''' focuses heavily on its art direction, which is handled by Lasse Erkola, with additional design during the years from [[Thomas Puha]]. The magazine was redesigned in summer of 2005 and re-launched in October 2005. Another redesign coincided with the magazine's 10th anniversary issue #121 in October 2012. PC games also made a return to the magazine during this redesign.

Puha and Huttunen are known to cable television and public broadcasting channel viewing audiences for both their games related program appearances and their program featuring neat webpages.

The '''Pepsi Venezuela Music Awards''' ({{lang-es|'''Premios Pepsi Music Venezuela'''|links=no}}; '''PPM''') are honors for the best music in Venezuela in various genres.

Its first edition took place on 29 March 2012 in [[Caracas]] and was broadcast on [[Venevisión]]. Since its second edition in 2013, it has been broadcast by [[Televen]]. 

==History==
The Pepsi Music Awards were created to recognize Venezuela's musical talent in all its genres, connecting musicians among themselves, with their fans, and with the general public.

Each year, the process begins in October through nominations on the {{ill|Pepsi-Cola Venezuela|es|lt=Pepsi Venezuela}} website. After that, nominations close and voting begins with a jury chosen by the Pepsi Music Academy. This culminates with ceremonies that take place in September of the following year.

The awards have more than 60 categories in which bands or artists who have worked actively from 1 January to 15 December can be nominated.

Each winning artist in a category receives a personalized statuette with their name and the name of the category. The awards are delivered through two galas – one private (not televised) and another broadcast nationwide.

==Pepsi Music Academy==
The awards' governing body is the Pepsi Music Academy, comprising connoisseurs of Venezuela's music industry, independent of Pepsi-Cola Venezuela. It is responsible for the dissemination and design of the categories and regulations of each edition of the awards, ensuring compliance for the selection of the five nominees for each category, and later of the winners.

It is made up of two types of members differentiated by their participation in the awards' phases: Advisory Members – personalities with extensive experience and commitment to the country's music industry – and Specialist Members – knowledgeable opinion leaders of the music industry with specific strengths in one or more musical genres.

'''''Sangeet Natak''''' in [[Marathi language]] literally means [[Musical theatre|Musical Drama]]. As the name suggests, this form of [[drama]] combines [[prose]] as well as [[poetry]] in form of [[songs]] to convey the [[Narrative|story]]. In a manner, they are very much similar to [[Musical theatre|Musicals]]. ''Sangeet Natakas'' played a vital role in the development of Marathi theater and thus the [[Marathi cinema]] as well as [[Indian film industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ash|Kasbekar, p. 52]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sangeet Natak start with praise of [[Natraj|Lord Natraja]] which is called as ''Naandi'' or ''Mangalaacharan'' or ''Suchakpad'' usually the famous one "Panchatunda Nararundamaldhar" from ''Sangeet Shakuntal''. They are popular for use of [[Indian classical music]]. The "Dramatic Music" is called '''Natya Sangeet''', one of the two popular forms of vocal arts in [[Maharashtra]] and surrounding states. The other is [[Bhavageet]].

==History==

===The beginning===
[[Vishnudas Bhave]] is considered the founder of Marathi theater. In 1843, his group staged  the first public performance of  Marathi play ''Seeta Swayamvar'' (सीता स्वयं‍वर). The integration of music in the dramas took place quite late in 1879 when [[play writer]] and [[Producer (film)|producer]] Trilokekar presented his musical play Nal-Damayanti (नल-दमयंती). It was the first musical play on Marathi stage.

But only when Balwant Pandurang Kirloskar (popularly known as [[Annasaheb Kirloskar]]) staged his first musical play ''Shaakuntal'', based on [[Kālidāsa|Kalidas's]] play [[Abhijñānaśākuntalam]], on October 31, 1880 in [[Pune]] did the trend of Sangeet Natak really start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/indica/music/natya_sangeet.htm|title=Marathi Natya Sangeet|accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kirloskar included 209 musical pieces in his ''Shaakuntal'' of 7 acts. They consisted of a mix of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[Carnatic classical music]], and lighter music.

Prior to the public performance of sangeet natak, attending musical performances was a monopoly of the ruling classes and other rich classes.Common people could not enjoy classical music. Natya Sangeet basically emerged so that the common people could also enjoy classical music as it is based on classical base{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. 

During its early period, Sangeet natak was dominated by religious plays like ''Sangeet Saubhdra'', which is legend in Marathi sangeet natak.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The trend changed with coming of sangeet Manapman, which depicts bravery of its hero Dheryadhar and his love with Bhamini which was written by [[Krushnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar]].

===Golden age===
The new trend of ''Sangeet Natakas'' caught up with the popularity quite quickly. With [[British Raj]] then existing in India, ''Sangeet Natakas'' were compared with the [[Opera]]s and thus local [[Marathi people|Marathi]] Indians found synonymous recreation. In the blooming times, Sangeet Natakas were mainly based on mythological stories of [[Mahabharata]] or [[Ramayana]] which would hence easily connect with the masses. They did not cover the complete epics but were limited to only small stories in them.

With popularity &amp; success, experimentation started on stage with abandoning mythological themes and bringing social issues to audiences. ''[[Sangeet Sharada]]'', for example, by portraying the feelings of a teenage girl to be married to a widower in his late seventies, brought out a social message. Few dramas, like ''[[Krushnaji_Prabhakar_Khadilkar#Kichak_Vadh|Kichak Vadh]]'', even agitated the [[British rule in India|British rulers]] to the extent that they were banned. ''Kichak Vadh'' compared the Britishers with ''Kichak'', an evil character from ''Mahabharata'' who tried to dishonour ''[[Draupadi]]''. ''Draupadi'' was then synonymous with the oppressed common Indian masses.

During the 1960s, another turn came in natya sangeet with the emergence of [[Jitendra Abhisheki]], who was credited with applying simplicity to the complex composition of Natya Sangeet.

===Plays===
The recent play Katyar Kaljat Ghusli by Zee studios opened up a new era of musical cinemas. This movie was based  on the legendary play bearing the same name. Its music was composed by Jitendra Abhisekhi and sung by Vasantrao Deshpande.

==Notable contributions==
*[[Annasaheb Kirloskar]] who founded the Sangeet Natakas also offered other famous plays like ''Sangeet Saubhadra'' and ''Ramrajyaviyog''.

'''Silver Fox''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. Silver Fox is a former love interest for [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and currently works for the terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].

==Publication history==
Silver Fox first appears in ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #10 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Buscema]].

==Fictional character biography==
Silver Fox is a member of the [[First Nations|First Nation]] [[Blackfoot Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3et4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early to late 1900s, she lived with Wolverine as his lover in Canada. She was allegedly murdered by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] on Wolverine's birthday,&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol.2 #10&lt;/ref&gt; but is later revealed to be alive and a member of "[[Team X (comics)|Team X]]", the most formidable [[covert ops]] team the CIA had to offer. Fox eventually betrays Team X and becomes a member of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], a subversive terrorist organization.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

Silver Fox reappears during the modern period when Wolverine tracks down each member of the Weapon X staff, discovering the studios where many of his memories, which he believes to be real, were staged. Allegedly she kills the professor who had been in charge of the program after Logan left. At this point it is revealed that Silver Fox is in command of a section of HYDRA.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol.2 #50&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Silver Fox captures the assassin Reiko, and forms an alliance with Reiko's boss, Hand Jonin [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]]. Matsu'o is in the process of trying to buy Clan Yashida's underworld connections before Mariko Yashida severs them entirely. Silver Fox dupes Reiko into poisoning Mariko, giving Matsu'o what he wanted. Silver Fox's motivations in this are unclear.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

Later, when Mastodon, a member of the Weapon X Program, dies due to the failure of his anti-aging factor, Silver Fox reunites with Logan, Creed, Maverick, and Wraith. She is cold to Logan, and seems not to remember having spent any pleasant time with him. The group infiltrates a secret base and confronts the man who had implanted them with their false memories: Aldo Ferro, the [[List of Marvel Comics characters: P#Psi-Borg|Psi-Borg]]. After [[Carol Hines]] dies of fright at the hands of Ferro's transformation, Ferro takes control of their minds and this time makes Creed kill Silver Fox.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol.2 #64&lt;/ref&gt; After Ferro's defeat, Silver Fox was to be buried in Salem Center. At the church, Logan discovers that her body has been prepared for flight. The father at the church notifies Logan that "a brick wall with an eyepatch" gave the order. Suddenly, a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] carrier arrives with [[Nick Fury]], who states he never imagined the day when a top-ranking HYDRA member would get a full honors S.H.I.E.L.D. burial. Wraith appears as well, having orchestrated the entire funeral, stating "Salem Center meant nothing to her". Wraith tells Logan that they found the cabin where he really had lived with Silver Fox a lifetime ago. He gets permission to bury her there, by himself with only a shovel and uses the part of the door with "Silver Fox + Logan" in a heart that he had carved into it as a headstone.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol.2 #65&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolverine again relives the induced memory of Sabretooth killing Silver Fox on his birthday, although this issue seems to ignore her previous "return" to life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeph Loeb]] (w), ''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Silver Fox possesses an artificial healing factor and an age suppressant, allowing her to retain her looks after years of being separated from Logan.

===Film===
[[File:Silverfoxfilm.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Lynn Collins]] as Kayla Silverfox in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''.]]
* Actress [[Lynn Collins]] plays Silver Fox in the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. She is named '''Kayla Silverfox''' and instead of the accelerated healing factor that she displays in comics, in the movie she possesses a tactile manipulation ability (similar to that of Alpha Flight's [[Murmur (Marvel Comics)|Murmur]] II) that she can use to persuade anyone she touches, with the exception of Logan or Victor (Sabretooth). She is in a relationship with Logan and works as a schoolteacher. Stemming from her Native American ancestry, she recites a story to Logan about a spirit named Kuekuatsheu (pronounced in the movie as koo-ay-koo-aut-soo and translates into 'Wolverine') who fell in love with the moon but was fooled by Trickster into stepping foot in the mortal world from which he could never return. Thus, Kuekuatsheu was parted forever from the moon, howling at her whenever he saw her. Subsequently, Kayla is responsible for Logan's choice of "[[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]" as his alias after her apparent death at the hands of Sabretooth. However, when Logan discovers that she is not only alive but also working for William Stryker, he likens her to the Trickster who played Logan as the fool. Despite taking part in faking her death as a way for Stryker to copy Wolverine's powers and test the [[adamantium]], Kayla assures Logan that her feelings for him were genuine and explains that Stryker has her sister Emma (sharing the same name and powers as [[Emma Frost]]) in custody along with other mutants, some of whose powers were pooled into the Deadpool project. During the final assault and escape from the [[Three Mile Island Facility]], Kayla is mortally wounded by a gunshot. Logan finds her and begins to carry her to safety before he is shot with an adamantium bullet by Stryker. Before Kayla dies, she touches Stryker's leg and tells him to walk until his feet bleed and then to walk some more. Unable to resist her command, Stryker walks away and only stops some time later when military officers apprehend him for questioning regarding the murder of General Munson. When Logan comes to after being shot, he discovers Kayla's dead body but doesn't remember her due to the amnesia brought on by the gunshot.
* In ''[[The Wolverine (2013 film)|The Wolverine]]'', Logan's voice can be heard calling Kayla's name through one of his nightmares. Additionally, her voice can be briefly heard near the end of the film where archived footage was used for this&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrI_oVzyxN4]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Video games===
Kayla Silverfox appears in the video game adaptation of ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' voiced by [[April Stewart]].&lt;ref name="btva"/&gt;

[[File:Um yeah, hooray for slow dancing!! (1382786008).jpg|thumb|People slow dancing at a wedding]]
A '''slow dance''' is a type of [[partner dance]] in which a couple [[dance]] slowly, swaying to the [[music]]. This is usually done to very slow-beat [[song]]s, namely [[sentimental ballads]]. This simple form of slow dancing is common at dances sponsored by schools or by religious organizations, such as churches or synagogues. In Western popular culture, slow dancing can serve as a symbol of [[adolescence|adolescent]] social awkwardness.&lt;ref name=Mansour2005 /&gt;

Slow dancing can refer to any slow couple dance (such as certain [[ballroom dance]]s), but is often associated with a particular, simple style of dance performed by [[middle school]], [[high school]] and [[college]] students.&lt;ref name=Mansour2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansour|first=David|title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|date=2005|page=445|isbn=978-0-7407-5118-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1ruwF6xYNIC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=%22slow+dance%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Technique==
When two partners dance together, the lead partner- usually male- typically holds their hands against the sides of the following - usually female- partner's [[hip]]s, [[buttocks]] or [[waist]] while the follower drapes their hands on the leader's shoulders. The couple then sways back and forth with the music. Foot movement is minimal, but the pair may use their feet to slowly turn on the spot. Because the dance requires little physical concentration, participants often talk to each other while dancing. Some couples who have a close relationship may dance very closely together, in a "hug-and-sway" fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|title=Chicago Soul|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=1992|page=207|isbn=978-0-252-06259-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kkcmS0AzMEC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22slow+dance%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spoon bending''' is the apparent deformation of objects, especially metal [[cutlery]], either without physical force, or with less force than would normally seem necessary. It is a common form of [[stage magic]], and a variety of methods are used to produce the illusion.

Spoon bending attracted considerable media attention in the 1970s when some people claimed to have the ability to cause such events by [[paranormal]] [[psychic]] means. The most notable was [[Uri Geller]], who performed by bending metal spoons as well as metal [[key (lock)|key]]s and several other objects and materials.  Geller's performances were attributed to stage magic by critics such as [[James Randi]]&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]]. (1982). ''[[The Truth About Uri Geller]]''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Gardner]].&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (1983). ''Science: Good, Bad and Bogus''. Oxford University Press. pp. 179-184. {{ISBN|0-19-286037-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage magic==
[[File:RandiFork.jpg|thumb|Fork bent by [[James Randi]].]]

Causing [[spoon]]s, [[key (lock)|key]]s, and other items to appear to bend without any [[Kinetic energy|physical force]] is a common stage magic trick that has many variants. Simply holding a spoon by its neck and rapidly tilting it back and forth can create the illusion that the spoon is bending, due to the way that the human eye perceives the rocking motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=While a Magician Works, the Mind Does the Tricks |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=[[Benedict Carey]] |date=August 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/science/12magic.html?em}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a spoon is physically bent or broken, it is usually at the point where the object would be easiest to bend by hand. In many cases, the trick uses [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]], a basic tool of the stage magician. The performer draws the audience's attention away from the spoon during the brief moment while the spoon is being physically bent. The typical bend, where the bowl meets the handle, requires relatively little force. The magician then gradually reveals the bend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Other methods use a metal spoon that has been prepared so that a simple flick will cause it to bend or break. This can be done, for instance, by repeatedly bending the spoon at the desired spot, until the metal [[Fatigue (material)|cracks and weakens]]. If the spoon breaks, the magician holds together the two halves of the spoon as if it were unbroken, then slowly relaxes the grip, making the spoon appear to bend before splitting in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a magician has control over the viewing angle, the trick can be done by using a spoon that is already bent at the start of the trick. The spoon is initially held with the bend along the viewing angle, making it invisible. The magician then turns the spoon slowly to reveal the bend. The magician Ben Harris author of the book ''Gellerism Revealed: The Psychology and Methodology Behind the Geller Effect'' (1985) revealed step-by-step photographs and text showing how to bend keys and cutlery by trick methods.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ben. (1985). ''Gellerism Revealed: The Psychology and Methodology Behind the Geller Effect''. Calgary: Micky Hades International.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Novelty item|novelty]] or magic shops sell self-bending spoons (utilizing the physical properties of a [[nickel titanium]] alloy) which can be used by amateur and stage magicians to demonstrate "psychic" powers or as a practical joke.  Such "self-bending" spoons will bend themselves when used to stir tea, coffee, or any other warm liquid, or even when warmed by body heat.

==Psychology==

In an experimental study (Wiseman and Greening, 2005) two groups of participants were shown a [[videotape]] in which a fake psychic placed a bent [[key (lock)|key]] on a table. Participants in the first group heard the fake psychic suggest that the key was continuing to bend when it had remained stationary, while those in the second group did not. The results revealed that participants from the first group reported significantly more movement of the key than the second group.

The findings were replicated in another study. The experiments had demonstrated that "testimony for PKMB after effects can be created by verbal suggestion, and therefore the testimony from individuals who have observed allegedly genuine demonstrations of such effects should not be seen as strong evidence in support of the paranormal".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]; Greening, Emma. (2005). [http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/BJP-key.pdf ''It's still bending': verbal suggestion and alleged psychokinetic ability'']. British Journal of Psychology 96: 115–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spoon bending and the paranormal ==
Due partly to the publicity surrounding [[Uri Geller]] in the 1970s, bent spoons have become a common visual symbol of the paranormal. It is shown, for example, in ''[[The Matrix]]'', when a young boy bends a spoon to demonstrate the unreality of a computer simulation.

While many individuals have claimed the [[paranormal]] or [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] ability to bend spoons or manipulate other objects, spoon bending by mental powers alone has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the [[scientific community]]. Magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] has offered [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge|a prize]] of one million dollars to any person who is able to demonstrate paranormal abilities such as spoon bending.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/01/72482 "Skeptic Revamps $1M Psychic Prize"]. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. Retrieved June 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims ===

Retired Boeing Engineer Jack Houck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jackhouck.com/pk.shtml |title= PK Parties |date=1988 |website=Jack Houck |access-date= April 25, 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; hosted "PK Parties" ([[psychokinesis]] parties)  from 1981 to 1988 where 85% of thousands of participants claimed to have accomplished spoon bending personally.

Author [[Michael Crichton]] described his successful experience with spoon bending at a psychokinesis party in his 1988 book ''[[Travels (book)|Travels]]'':
{{Quote|I looked down. My spoon had begun to bend. I hadn't even realized. The metal was completely pliable, like soft plastic. It wasn't particularly hot, either, just slightly warm. ... I had bent a spoon, and I knew it wasn't a trick. I looked around the room and saw little children, eight or nine years old, bending large metal bars. They weren't trying to trick anybody.| Michael Crichton|''[[Travels (book)|Travels]]'', 1988, pages 319–320}}

Parapsychologist and author [[Dean Radin]] has reported that he was able to bend the bowl of a spoon over with unexplained ease of force with witnesses present at an informal psychokinesis experiment gathering in 2000.

{{Quote|I was much more skeptical about such claims until one day I personally folded the bowl of a large, heavy [[soup spoon]] in half with a gentle touch, and with half a dozen witnesses present. I later tested to see if I could do this again with a similar spoon using ordinary force. I couldn't budge the bowl without the assistance of two pairs of pliers and some serious leverage.| Dean Radin| ''Entangled Minds'', page 331}}

Maureen Caudill, a trainer associated with the [[Monroe Institute]], claims this is significantly easier to achieve when performed in groups rather than alone.&lt;ref&gt;Caudill, Maureen. (2006). ''Suddenly Psychic: A Skeptic's Journey''. Chapter 7. {{ISBN|978-1-57174-501-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests===
Physicist [[John Hasted]] believed that children could paranormally bend [[paper clips]] inside a glass sphere, provided the sphere had a hole in it and they were allowed to take the sphere into a room unobserved. [[Martin Gardner]] wrote Hasted was incapable of devising simple controls such as videotaping the children secretly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (1991). ''The New Age: Notes of a Fringe-Watcher''. Prometheus Books. pp. 28-29. {{ISBN|0-87975-644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen North, a British psychic, was tested by Hasted in the late 1970s. Hasted claimed North had the psychokinetic ability to bend spoons and [[teleportation|teleport]] objects in and out of sealed containers.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hasted|Hasted, John]]. (1981). ''The Metal-Benders''.

''New Scientist''. p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Randi]], during a test at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], North was observed to have bent a metal sample with his bare hands. Randi wrote that "I find it unfortunate that [Hasted] never had an epiphany in which he was able to recognize just how thoughtless, cruel, and predatory were the acts perpetrated on him by fakers who took advantage of his naivety and trust."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]].

Jean-Pierre Girard, a French psychic, has claimed he can bend metal bars by psychokinesis. Girard was tested in the 1970s but failed to produce any paranormal effects in scientifically controlled conditions.&lt;ref name="Blanc1978"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTTswrb4YRMC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;dq=Jean-Pierre+Girard+psychokinesis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yH4fU8OaNcHT7AbQ3IHgBQ&amp;ved=0CDcQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jean-Pierre%20Girard%20psychokinesis&amp;f=false |title=New Scientist - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=1978-02-16 |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was tested on January 19, 1977 during a two-hour experiment in a [[Paris]] laboratory. The experiment was directed by physicist Yves Farge with a magician also present. All of the experiments were negative as Girard failed to make any of the objects move paranormally. He failed two tests in [[Grenoble]] in June 1977 with James Randi.&lt;ref name="Blanc1978"/&gt; He was also tested on September 24, 1977 at a laboratory at the Nuclear Research Centre. Girard failed to bend any bars or change the structure of the metals. Other experiments into spoon bending were also negative and witnesses described his feats as fraudulent. Girard later admitted that he would sometimes cheat to avoid disappointing the public but insisted he still had genuine psychic power.&lt;ref name="Blanc1978"/&gt; Magicians and scientists have written that he produced all his alleged psychokinetic feats through fraudulent means.&lt;ref&gt;Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-0508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1979 and 1981, the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research at Washington University reported a series of experiments they named [[Project Alpha]], in which two teenaged male subjects had demonstrated psychokinesis phenomena, including metal-bending and causing images to appear on film, under less than stringent laboratory conditions. James Randi eventually revealed that the subjects were two of his associates, amateur conjurers [[Banachek|Steve Shaw]] and Michael Edwards. The pair had created the effects by standard trickery, but the researchers, being unfamiliar with magic techniques, interpreted them as proof of psychokinesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew|title=Facts, Fallacies and Frauds in Psychology |publisher=Unwin Hyman | year=1987|pages=195–6 | isbn=978-0-09-173041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John G. Taylor|John Taylor]] had tested children in metal bending. According to Martin Gardner, the controls were inadequate as the children would put paper clips in their pockets and later take one out twisted or be left with metal rods unobserved. James Randi managed to bend an aluminum bar when Taylor was not looking and scratch on it "Bent by Randi". In other experiments, two scientists from the [[University of Bath]] examined metal bending with children in a room which was secretly being videotaped through a one-way mirror. The film revealed that the children bent the objects with their hands and feet. Due to the evidence of trickery, Taylor concluded metal bending had no paranormal basis.&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Stitch!'''''|スティッチ!|Sutitchi!}} is a Japanese [[anime]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] [[Lilo &amp; Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo &amp; Stitch'' franchise]]. It is the franchise's second television series, after ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series]]''. The anime series aired in [[Japan]] from October 2008 to March 2011, later receiving additional television specials in 2012 and 2015. It features a Japanese girl named [[Yuna Kamihara]], who takes the place of [[Lilo Pelekai]] as the best friend of the titular [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]], and is set on a fictional island in the [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]] off the shore of [[Okinawa]] called Izayoi instead of [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii]].

The first arc of the series, which serves as the first season outside Japan, was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and aired from 8 October 2008 to 25 March 2009. A second arc of the original series, called {{Nihongo|'''''Stitch! ~The Mischievous Alien's Great Adventure~'''''|スティッチ! ～いたずらエイリアンの大冒険～|Sutitchi! ~Itazura Eirian no Daibōken~}} aired in Japan from 13 October 2009 to 29 June 2010, completing Madhouse's 56 original episodes of the show. A 29-episode sequel series from the original two-arc anime, entitled {{nihongo|'''''Stitch! ~Best Friends Forever~'''''|スティッチ! ～ずっと最高のトモダチ～|Sutitchi! ~Zutto Saikō no Tomodachi~}} aired on [[TV Asahi]] from 6 July 2010 to 8 March 2011, with [[Shin-Ei Animation]] taking over production.&lt;ref name="animenewsnetwork.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-05/colorful-arrietty-stitch-evangelion-promos-streamed|title=Colorful, Arrietty, Stitch, Evangelion Promos Streamed|work=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, a TV special continuing from the sequel series entitled {{nihongo|'''''Stitch and the Planet of Sand'''''|スティッチと砂の惑星|Sutitchi to Suna no Wakusei}} aired on 16 June 2012. Following this, three years following the release of ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand'' and announced on 26 June 2015, a TV special entitled {{nihongo|'''''Stitch! Perfect Memory'''''|スティッチ！パーフェクト・メモリー|Sutitchi! Pāfekuto Memorī}} aired on 7 August 2015 as part of a "'''''Stitch! New Specials'''''" series (a line that ''Stitch and the Planet of Sand'' started). However, the anime would nonetheless be succeeded in the franchise by the Chinese animated series ''[[Stitch &amp; Ai]]'' in 2017, effectively ending the anime's run.

== Production ==
In March 2008, Walt Disney Television International Japan started procuring its own animated shows with their first two debuting at Tokyo International Anime Fair 2008, producing ''Stitch!'' with Japanese animation studio [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nakata|first1=Hiroko|title=Disney to work with two local animators|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/03/07/business/disney-to-work-with-two-local-animators/|accessdate=May 31, 2017|work=The Japan Times Online|date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasons one and two of ''Stitch!'' were animated by Madhouse, and season three was animated by [[Shin-Ei Animation]].

At the 2008 Tokyo International Anime Fair, the pilot for the series was showcased for attendees at the Madhouse booth. Information was also shown around Disney's booth, showing the cast of characters who would appear in the anime. Many of the past characters, such as [[Jumba Jookiba]] and [[Pleakley]], appear, as well as five villains: [[Gantu]], [[Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel]], [[Reuben (Lilo &amp; Stitch)|Experiment 625/Reuben]], Experiment 627, and (in the third season) a new villain named [[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Delia|Delia]]. In addition, two characters, [[Angel (Lilo &amp; Stitch)|Experiment 624/Angel]] and [[Sparky (Lilo &amp; Stitch)|Experiment 221/Sparky]], also appear in the anime due to their popularity from the American franchise.

''Stitch!'' started on TV Tokyo and following affiliates at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 8, 2008, and had an hour premiere of the first two episodes. Afterwards, it aired on every Wednesday after at 7:26&amp;nbsp;p.m. time slot, essentially replacing ''[[Bleach (anime)|Bleach]]''.

Where the Hawaiian culture was featured in the original version, the culture of [[Okinawa Prefecture]] and the other [[Ryukyu Islands]] is featured. For example, Yuna's [[karate]] has replaced Lilo's [[hula]].

The ''Stitch!'' anime is influenced by [[children's manga]]. It was originally aimed in Japan at young kids aged 4 to 14 years. Most of the main characters are young children ranging from 8–12 years old, including Yuna. However, unlike the movies and American series, the anime contains darker and more mature content.

The series is edited and localized for younger [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]] and [[Western world|Western]] audiences and a lower TV rating. Every English-speaking country aired the American English dub.

== Characters ==
{{See also|List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Characters introduced in Stitch!}}

===Main characters===
; {{Nihongo|[[Stitch (Lilo &amp; Stitch)|Stitch]]|スティッチ|Sutitchi}}
: Stitch (original name: Experiment 626), an alien from outer space, one day ends up falling to an island located on Earth, called Izayoi Island, off the coast of Okinawa. He discovers "The Spiritual Stone" on Okinawa, with the help of his new friend Yuna, and learns it can grant his wish of becoming the strongest in the universe, provided he does 43 good deeds. Thus, with his Good Deed Counter made by Jumba, he is able to keep track of his good deeds, and keep track of his wish of becoming strongest in the universe. However, he has mischievous tendencies that often make him lose deeds due to his overabundance of such things.

; {{Nihongo|[[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Yuna Kamihara|Yuna Kamihara]]|加美原ユウナ|Kamihara Yūna}}
: Yuna is a young Japanese girl; a tomboy at that, and is a 10-year-old 4th Grade elementary school student (11-year-old 5th Grade elementary school student in ''Stitch! Zutto Saiko no Tomodachi'', albeit with her move to Okinawa New Town) who lives on a fictional island off the shore of Okinawa in the [[Ryukyus]] called Izayoi Island. Her personality is sweet and outgoing, while still tough and feisty all in all. Living on Izayoi Island, she learns and studies karate, having learned it from her grandpa. Her grandpa also did the honor of giving her a special type of starsand, as a good luck charm in her study of karate before he left. Yuna lives a rather normal cherished life with her grandma, Obaa. The other majority of her family are elsewhere, her father is out at work a lot as a marine biologist around Okinawa, and her mother died when she was an infant in a typhoon. Her life remained normal yet happy until one day, after a varied coincidence, she meets a strange creature that came crashlanding from the Turo system of outer space, Experiment 626, or as we know him, Stitch. From then and there when they met, the two became best friends and the duo go on various adventures on Stitch's quest in order to be "good". Yuna though, has a strong sense of justice and an overbearing attitude, which make her a tomboy, and that shows throughout the series. The creators of the anime got Yuna's name from the Japanese name of sea [[hibiscus]] out in Okinawa (known in Japanese as Yuna). Yuna's birthday is 25 February. It can be assumed that Yuna's favorite animal is a [[porpoise]] or [[dolphin]] from a few instances in the series. Yuna isn't good at mathematics, often getting low scores on math tests. Yuna's last name, Kamihara, wasn't unveiled until much later, although previous guesses were Chitama, after the dojo and the forest on Izayoi and Hanako, which was Yuna's previous name and design during development of the anime.

; {{Nihongo|[[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Jumba Jookiba|Dr. Jumba Jookiba]]|ジャンバ博士|Janba Hakase}}
: Jumba is an "[[Mad scientist|evil genius]]" scientist, the one who created Stitch and [[List of experiments from Lilo &amp; Stitch|the other 625 experiments]] made before him. He is assigned by the Galactic Council to watch over Stitch, and lives with Yuna and Obaa. He is more friendly in this series than the original, and has less of a penchant for evil.

; {{Nihongo|[[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Pleakley|Agent Pleakley]]|プリークリー|Purīkurī}}
: He is a one-eyed alien working for the Galactic Council and Earth expert. He is Jumba's best friend, and lives with him along with Yuna, Obaa, and Stitch.

; Obaa Kamihara (Grandma)
: Yuna's grandmother whom Yuna lives with. She is one of the three characters that believes in the existence of yōkai.

; Kijimunaa
: He is a little yokai, who is Yuna and Stitch's friend. He is kind of a coward, but with the help of his friends, he can find the courage to best whatever he can.

===Other characters===
; {{Nihongo|[[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Angel (624)|Angel]]|エンジェル|Enjeru}}
: Experiment 624: A pink female experiment who is Stitch's love interest. Stitch is madly in love with her and she shares the same feeling. Angel travels a lot, but she stops at the island, at times, to visit Stitch and Yuna. It turns out that while Stitch is immune to Angel's song if sung by her, if it is in a different voice it still will turn him evil.

; {{Nihongo|[[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Sparky (221)|Sparky]]|スパーキー|Spaakii}}
: Experiment 221: A yellow male experiment with electrical abilities who is one of Stitch's cousins.

; Piko (named Penny in the English dub)
: A blonde girl, rival to Yuna. Piko/Penny is self-centered, impatient and in some cases, a bit snobby. She often takes great pride to mock and deride Yuna and Stitch in any case, often ending with Yuna and her fighting. There are rare occasions where she and Yuna can get along though. Her father runs the island's pineapple plants and her family runs the highest rated hotels and resorts on Izayoi. There's a habit with Piko/Penny where when she's angered, she'll often end her ranting with a comparison of something akin to pineapples. She is also a black-team karate leader. Piko/Penny may have been idealized after Hawaiian pop song "[[Pineapple Princess]]". Piko/Penny dislikes Sae but secretly does believe that she dresses better than her.

; {{Nihongo|Sae (named Sasha in the English dub)}}
: A young girl about Yuna's age who is introduced in the second season. A transfer student from [[Koube]], she joins Yuna's class amidst the second season. She believes in good fashion and beauty, and is girly in spirit, often talking about fashion, love and all. She's also quite ditsy at times. She believes Yuna has a good fashion sense, and becomes good friends with her; as her fashion sense reminded her of her mother, a tropical fashion designer. Her father is a doctor. She not only has a rather brave personality, like Yuna; but she has a sweet and gentle personality too. Kouji (Kenny) has a crush for Sae, unbeknownst to her, and Piko (Penny) secretly dislikes Sae, but believes that Sae dresses better than she does.

; {{Nihongo|Zuruko (named Tigerlily in the English dub)}}
:Yuna's mean, bullying cousin who appears mid-way through Season 2. Although she may seem nice at first look, once you get to know her you'll discover that isn't the case. While she's kind hearted to others she is harsh and cruel to Yuna for unknown reasons, and constantly blackmails her into doing all the chores around the house (Although she later claims that she's only trying to do a role-model for Yuna). But when Yuna and Stitch move off to live with her in season 3, she becomes more friendly with Yuna and treats her nicer, although she still forces her to do most of the house chores.

; Takumi (named Hiroman in the English dub)
: A boy from Okinawa New Town introduced in the third season. A popular soccer player, and love interest of Reika, he often acts cool and calm. He bears a secret of acting as a maid to his sisters, and even dressing up in bishoujo-styled outfits for his sisters' enjoyment. His name is obviously a play on "hero man". It is hinted that he and Yuna have feelings for each other since Yuna often saves him from trouble; in the episode "Dorkifier", it was shown that Yuna blushed at him.

; Reika (named Jessica in the English dub)
: Yuna's rival in season 3. She has a crush on Takumi and friends who she bosses around. She, like Piko/Penny from the first two seasons, likes to mock and deride Stitch and Yuna. She also bears a trait of saying rather dull jokes and puns, often met with silent response. She is followed by two girls, Torriko and Makiko.

; [[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Lilo Pelekai|Lilo Pelekai]]
: A character mentioned in the English dub, she was Stitch's best friend in the past, but one day she left for college. However, her mention in the English dub is only due to Disney intertwining ''Stitch!'' with ''[[Leroy &amp; Stitch]]'' (and [[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series|the television series preceding it]]) for the English dub. The Japanese original bears little to no direct mention of Lilo, though they do mention a "bigger Hawaiian girl" in episode 2 similar to the main character in this series. However, episode 23 of season 3 had Lilo visit Okinawa in cahoots to reunite with Stitch, only for a while though. Lilo is now grown up, and has a daughter who looks like her when she was younger, named Ani.

===Villains===
; [[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Dr. Hämsterviel|Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel]]
: A villain who was a college buddy of Jumba. Much like the rest of the franchise, he bears a want to defeat Stitch. Hämsterviel also wishes to steal Stitch's Good Deed Counter in order to gain ultimate power. 

; [[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Delia|Delia]]
: An evil alien woman in a partnership with Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel to get the Neo-PowerChip that is inside of Stitch. Delia altered a majority of the experiments, which had caused them to become physically stronger and evil, and Angel, who is rescued by Stitch. Delia usually calls Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel the wrong name such as Hamu Sama or Hämusta Sama and then, when Hämsterviel's plans go wrong, she eventually punishes him based on whatever scheme he used.

; [[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Gantu|Gantu]]
: He works under Dr. Hämsterviel, to steal Stitch's Good Deed Counter. According to the English dub, Gantu was dishonorably discharged from his Galactic Federation job due to bad karaoke singing. He bears an over-obsession to a television drama called "Red Rose Maiden", or "The Young and the Stupid" in the English dub. He has a huge crush on the main character of the drama, Princess Michigo.

; [[List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters#Reuben (625)|Reuben]]
: Experiment 625: He has all of the same powers as Stitch and works alongside Gantu, but he is lazy and eats sandwiches. Dr. Hämsterviel claims he doesn't do much besides make sandwiches all the time. During the series he isn't much of an enemy to Stitch, even coming to visiting him sometimes. During "Reuben's Rice Balls", he becomes fond of Japanese rice balls, and even includes them among his sandwich ingredients.

; Dark End
: An experiment made by Delia who is designed to be much stronger than Stitch and his cousins. He is not among Stitch's cousins, as neither Jumba nor Hämsterviel made him.

; Cyber
: Experiment 000: He is an evil experiment who looks like a cyborg version of Stitch.

'''''The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius: Jet Fusion''''' is a [[video game]] released in 2003 based on the animated TV series ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' as well as the [[telefilm]] of the same name. In the game, the player controls Jimmy Neutron who has to save the movie star/spy Jet Fusion by using a variety of gadgets and inventions.

An [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version was planned, but ultimately cancelled due to the low sales of the game.

==Plot==
Jimmy has an assignment to write a book report, and Jimmy decides to invent the Virtual World Reproduction Machine (VWRM), a device that will show the class what the book is about like a movie. Jimmy places his Jet Fusion book into the machine and it malfunctions, thus turning Retroville into a virtual world. Then Professor Calamitous kidnaps Jet Fusion and it's up to Jimmy to save him. Throughout the game, the player has to collect pieces for major and minor inventions, which help Jimmy continue to the next level. The one major invention in each level helps defeat the boss in the boss level, while the one minor invention in each world helps Jimmy battle his enemies and various obstacles. The minor inventions also come with a primary and secondary action.

'''''The ClueFinders''''' is a series of educational software aimed at children aged eight to twelve. The series was created by [[The Learning Company]] as a counterpart to their ''[[Reader Rabbit]]'' series for older elementary-aged students and features a band of mystery-solving teens. The series has received praise for its balance of education and entertainment and has won numerous awards.

== History ==

=== The Learning Company era (1997-2001) ===
ClueFInders was conceived as a continuation of the ''Reader Rabbit'' series, appealing to the older 3rd-6th grade level.&lt;ref name="CF-LANews"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/30/news/tt-40015|title=An Education in Child's Play|last=Shannon|first=L.

=== Riverdeep/HMH era (2001-present) ===
In 2001, Riverdeep acquired many of The Learning Company's properties from Gores Technology Group by selling $40 million in stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-11-01|title=Riverdeep acquires assets of The Learning Company.

== Design ==

=== Plot ===
Development of the games' "super compelling" and "rich" backstory took 16 months.&lt;ref name="CF-LANews" /&gt; The ClueFinders' adventures take place in the contemporary real world incorporating some elements of [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]], with merely the continued presence of LapTrap pushing the series into the realm of science fiction. They simultaneously had a sense of urgency toward an end goal while allowing players to explore and use their minds on puzzles.&lt;ref name="CF-LANews" /&gt; Nevertheless, the opening titles from ''The ClueFinders 5th Grade Adventures'' place the series in the [[present day]]. The main cast of "complex" and "flawed" characters include ClueFinders founder and tomboy Joni, skater dude Owen, mechanically-minded Santiago, literary-minded Leslie, artificial intelligent LapTrap, and intelligent dog Socrates.&lt;ref name="CF-LANews" /&gt; They were chosen to be around the same age as the players after the art director ran various character designs by a group of kids; unsuccessful designs included animals, rock stars, FBI agents, which came across as babysitters instead of teammates.&lt;ref name="CF-LANews" /&gt; They were designed with distinct personalities and with identifiable faults to increase their relatability.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The developers used a  character grid to aid their writing; it contained information such as: "their flaws, their fears, how they met, where they grew up, and their likely reactions to certain situations".&lt;ref name="CF-LANews" /&gt;

=== Gameplay ===
The series consists of "Multisubject by grade" programs, in which players practice skills and advance understanding of grade-based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64BdAqI3BdkC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=%22ClueFinders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6pcHhsv7SAhUnj1QKHRl3BqsQ6AEINTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ClueFinders%22&amp;f=false|title=Teaching for Student Learning: Becoming a Master Teacher|last=Ryan|first=Kevin|last2=Cooper|first2=James M.|last3=Tauer|first3=Susan|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1111833605|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can choose to play the adventure mode or to play the game's activities outside the adventure in "practice mode." Choosing to play the adventure will lead to a follow-up sequence which further establishes the premise as well as the overall goal of the game. The bulk of each game involves traveling between different screens in a predetermined area which has various educational activities. The user will have to play these games to advance. Most of the time, each area will have one activity that needs to be completed to advance onwards, but which can only be played by collecting items from all the other activities in the area. In all the games except for ''The ClueFinders 4th Grade Adventures'', the ClueFinders are split into two teams at the start. A portable red [[videophone]] allows the two teams to make contact with each other and clicking on the phone provides the user with game hints from the other team. The other team will typically either be serving as backup, looking for clues, or else be captured and in need of rescue.

=== Graphics and coding ===
During the gameplay, [[2D computer graphics]] are used in the style of hand-drawn [[animated cartoon]]s with animations that use thick outlines and solid colors on two-dimensional backgrounds. For this reason, the series is often&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/reviews/reading/7/cfra/merge.shtml|title=SuperKids Software Review of Clue Finders Reading Adventures.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://auctions.yahoo.com/i:Clue%20Finders%20-%204th%20Grade%20Adventures%20-%20The%20Learning%20Com:5392175 Yahoo!

Cutscenes, however, use [[pre-rendered]] [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].

=== Educational goals ===
While Reader Rabbit was popular with younger audiences, the Learning Company came up with ClueFinders to appeal to third graders onward for both boys and girls. To coincide with kids' abstract thinking, the games were activity-centered and included cross-curriculum topics more sophisticated than preschool material, which included algebra, grammar and spelling. To ensure that users actually learned something, the educational content came first before the puzzles, gameplay, and objectives.&lt;ref name="CF-LANews"/&gt; Andy Young, vice president of product marketing for The Learning Company, noted that the ClueFinders series aimed to show children that it was "cool to be smart".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The A.D.A.P.T. Learning Technology was introduced into The ClueFinders titles in 1999; the system contained a series of customisable features that would facilitate the player's learning by '''''A'''''ssessing abilities, '''''D'''''eveloping skills, '''''A'''''djusting levels, '''''P'''''roviding help, and '''''T'''''racking progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-adapt-learning-technologytm-helps-kids-get-the-most-out-of-their-software-experience-74942522.html|title=New A.D.A.P.T.

''Exploring Values Through Literature, Multimedia, and Literacy Events'' highlighted the series for its multicultural and balanced cast in which the nonwhite characters have equal status to the white character, noting that Leslie and Santiago are the main sources of knowledge, though noted there were no examples of software with the primary character being non-white.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djgoFoEQ6poC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=cluefinders&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD_MSllovTAhUKhrwKHWxMBJcQ6AEIKjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=cluefinders&amp;f=false|title=Exploring Values Through Literature, Multimedia, and Literacy Events: Making Connections|last=Schmidt|first=Patricia Ruggiano|last2=Pailliotet|first2=Ann Watts|date=2008-01-01|publisher=IAP|isbn=9781593119454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, while ''[[Boston Herald|The Boston Herald]]'' commented the series had "come a long way", the paper suggested that the decision to include a Caucasian (Joni), Asian (Owen), Black (Leslie), and Latino (Santiago) in its main cast smelt of interference from the California School Board standard.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002-05-05|title=ClueFinders uncover much frustration.(Arts and Lifestyle)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85458459.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper praised the series' "television-quality animation, broad educational focus and lively situations", though thought the early games were uneven in difficulty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  ''Exploring Values Through Literature, Multimedia, and Literacy Events'' further praised the series' focus on character interdependence; how missions are not successful until and unless they work together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Children's Software Review'' managing editor Ellen Wolock criticised The Learning Company for focusing too much of its resources on repackaging its old software, commenting that she received the impression the company was "just throw[ing] together" entries in its newer ClueFinders series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-02-04|title=Purchase of Educational Software Maker Dragged Down Mattel.(Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59201957.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Working Mother'' thought the series offered a "painless way for kids to hone their skills".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aA1CjS2rMcC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;dq=cluefinders&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL08WBmIvTAhVGgLwKHRocBDQQ6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=cluefinders&amp;f=false|title=Working Mother|last=Media|first=Working Mother|date=1999-12-01|publisher=Working Mother Media|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cincinnati Enquirer recommended the "strong" series to gamers who were unable to locate the then-soon-to-be-discontinued title ''[[The Sims: Livin' Large]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/102350570/|title=The Cincinnati Enquirer from Cincinnati, Ohio on October 11, 2000 &amp;middot; Page 62|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said "there is a lot to like" about entries in the series, such as its [[closed captioning]] of later titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/102594851/|title=The Cincinnati Enquirer from Cincinnati, Ohio on September 19, 2001 &amp;middot; Page 73|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Paul Chambers''''' (appealed to the High Court as '''''Chambers v Director of Public Prosecutions'''''), popularly known as the '''Twitter Joke Trial''', was a [[United Kingdom]] legal case centred on the conviction of a man under the [[Communications Act 2003]] for posting a joke about destroying an airport to [[Twitter]], a message which police regarded as "menacing".

== Background ==
During late December 2009 and early January 2010, [[Winter of 2009–2010 in the United Kingdom|cold weather]] had resulted in considerable disruption across northern England. [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport|Robin Hood Airport]] in [[South Yorkshire]] was one of many airports which was forced to cancel flights.

== Response ==
A number of legal commentators and celebrities criticised the conviction and called for it to be overturned&lt;!-- we need examples and quotes --&gt;.

== Appeals ==
Chambers lost an appeal against his conviction. Judge [[Jacqueline Davies]], sitting with two magistrates,&lt;ref name="Telegraph-2012-06-27" /&gt; heard his appeal in Doncaster Crown Court; she judged that the tweet contained "menace" and that Chambers must have known that it might be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="twitterjoke-appeal-verdict"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/11/twitter-joke-trial-appeal-verdict|title=Twitter joke trial: Paul Chambers loses appeal against conviction|date=2010-11-11|accessdate=12 November 2010|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Martin|last=Wainwright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Twitter users responded by reposting Chambers' Tweet including the [[hashtag]] #iamspartacus,&lt;ref name="twitterjoke-spartacus-hashtag-guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/12/iamspartacus-campaign-twitter-airport|title=#IAmSpartacus campaign explodes on Twitter in support of airport joker|date=2010-11-12|accessdate=12 November 2010|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Haroon|last=Siddique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twitterjoketrial-iamspartacus-mashable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/11/12/iamspartacus/|title=Thousands of Twitter users express support for Chambers|date=2010-11-12|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the climactic [[Spartacus (film)#"I'm Spartacus!"|"I am Spartacus!" scene]] in the 1960 film ''Spartacus''.

A further appeal to [[High Court of Justice|the High Court]] was heard on 8 February 2012, in which the two judge panel of Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Irwin failed to reach a decision after initially reserving judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Twitter Joke Trial|url=http://www.whoswholegal.com/news/features/article/29377/the-twitter-joke-trial-high-profile-uk-legal-case-social-media-criminal-liability/|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAG-2012-02-07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/02/paul-chambers-twitter-joke-trial|title=Must read posts on the Twitter Joke Trial appeal|last=Alllen Green|first=David|date=2012-02-07|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Case Stated|appeal by case stated]]" was made by Chambers' barristers, [[Ben Emmerson]] QC and Sarah Przybylska; [[David Allen Green]], who acted for Chambers in earlier proceedings,&lt;ref name="David-Allen-Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preiskel.com/people/david-allen-green/|title=David Allen Green - Profile from Preiskel.com|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; also acted as his solicitor, through Preiskel &amp; Co LLP.&lt;ref name="NS-2011-09-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/09/-3|title=High Court Date for "Twitter Joke Trial"|date=2011-09-08|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was entirely on points of law and centred on the correct interpretation of section 127(1) of the Communications Act 2003.&lt;ref name="DAG-2012-02-07" /&gt;

[[File:Twitter Joke Trial 1.jpg|thumb|Chambers (centre), with Al Murray (left) and Stephen Fry (right) outside the High Court on 27 June 2012]]

A second High Court appeal, before a panel of three judges, headed by the [[Lord Chief Justice]] [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Lord Judge]], opened on 22 June 2012.&lt;ref name="DAG-2012-06-22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/06/twitter-joke-trial-david-allen-green|title=The "Twitter Joke Trial" returns to the High Court|last=Allen Green|first=David|date=2012-06-22|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the arguments made by Chambers' barrister for this last appeal, [[John Cooper (barrister)|John Cooper]] QC, was that if the tweet was "menacing" so was [[John Betjeman]]'s poem, ''[[Slough (poem)|Slough]]'', pleading "Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough!".&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Robert|title=Twitter joke humorous not menacing, high court judges told|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jun/27/twitter-joke-appeal|accessdate=27 July 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also asked whether Shakespeare would have been prosecuted if he had tweeted his line from ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' (Act IV, Scene 2), "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers".&lt;ref name="Booth" /&gt; The latter reputedly drew laughter from the judges. On 27 June, the judges announced a [[reserved judgement]].&lt;ref name="BBC-2012-06-27"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18607798|title=Paul Chambers 'blow up' airport tweet appeal judgement reserved|date=2012-06-27|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers arrived at court accompanied by [[Stephen Fry]] and the comedian [[Al Murray]].&lt;ref name="BBC-2012-06-27" /&gt;

Chambers' conviction was quashed on 27 July 2012.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The approved judgement concluded that "a message which does not create fear or apprehension in those to whom it is communicated, or who may reasonably be expected to see it, falls outside this provision [of the 2003 Act]".&lt;ref name="High Court Judgment"/&gt; Accordingly, the appeal against conviction was "allowed on the basis that this 'tweet' did not constitute or include a message of a menacing character".&lt;ref name="High Court Judgment"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Judgments/chambers-v-dpp.pdf|date=2012-07-27|title=Approved Judgment|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127114900/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Judgments/chambers-v-dpp.pdf|archive-date=2016-01-27|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2012/2157.html|title=Chambers v Director of Public Prosecutions &amp;#91;2012&amp;#93; EWHC 2157 (QB) (27 July 2012)|publisher=BAILII|date=2012-07-27|accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that staff at the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] had been in favour of dropping the case, to the point of informing Chambers, via his solicitor, that they would not oppose the final appeal, but had then been overruled by their head of service, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]], [[Keir Starmer]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-2012-07-28"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/29/paul-chambers-twitter-joke-airport|title='Twitter joke' case only went ahead at insistence of DPP|last=Cohen|first=Nick|date=2012-07-28|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers' MP, [[Louise Mensch]], called for a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] committee to investigate Starmer's behaviour.&lt;ref name="Cohen-2012-07-28" /&gt;

'''''Wanita dan Satria''''' ({{IPA-id|waˈnita ˈdan satˈria|}}; Indonesian for ''The Woman and the Hero'') is a 1941 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia) directed by [[Rd Ariffien]] and produced by Ang Hock Liem for [[Union Films]] that is probably [[lost film|lost]]. Starring [[Djoewariah]], Ratna Djoewita, Hidajat, Z. Algadrie, and Moesa, it follows a womaniser named Soedrajat who abuses his status to gain women's trust before ultimately getting his comeuppance. Reviews were mostly positive, with one praising the film's depiction of [[Women in Indonesia|women's issues]] in a Muslim society.

==Plot==
Soedrajat abuses his high social status in order to womanise and becomes his rich uncle's heir despite the latter having a son, the kindly and noble Soelarsa. The uncle is disappointed with Soelarsa and considers Soedrajat the better man. Being considered high class, he is unwilling to associate with people of the lower classes. Ultimately Soedrajat falls for a beautiful young woman, Koestijah. Meanwhile, Soelarsa saves Koestijah's life while driving a truck through her village; the two fall in love at first sight. By manipulating Koestijah's father, Soedrajat arranges for her to marry him.

At the wedding, however, the terrible truth about Soedrajat is revealed. One of his former conquests, Tarmini, stands up and tells the crowd, including Soelarsa, of the bridegroom's true nature. In a rage, Soedrajat takes a revolver and shoots Tarmini. With her dying breath, Tarmini makes one last confession. Her father then takes revenge on Soedrajat.{{efn|Film plot derived from two contemporary newspaper reviews. See {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna a}} and {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna b}}.}}

==Production==
''Wanita dan Satria'' was produced by Ang Hock Liem for [[Union Films]]. It was directed by [[Rd Ariffien]], a former theatre leader and nationalist journalist who had made his directorial debut the preceding year with ''[[Harta Berdarah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Wanita dan Satria}}; {{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The story was written by [[Saeroen]], a former journalist with several screenwriting credits for Union.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna a}}

The [[black-and-white]] film starred [[Djoewariah]], Ratna Djoewita, Hidajat, Z. Algadrie, and Moesa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Wanita dan Satria}}; {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moesa was the most experienced of these: he had entered the industry in 1938 with ''[[Fatima (1938 film)|Fatima]]'', a production by [[Tan's Film]], and had been with Union since 1940.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Moesa}} Djoewariah had been on Union's payroll since ''[[Bajar dengan Djiwa]]'' in 1940,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djuariah}} while Ratna Djoewita and Hidajat had not appeared in any films before 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ratna Djoewita}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, R Hidajat}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
''Wanita dan Satria'' was released in 1941, reaching [[Bandung]] by August{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Bandoeng}} and [[Surabaya]] by September. The film was open to all ages.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} A novelisation was published later in 1941 by the [[Yogyakarta]]-based Kolff-Buning.{{sfn|WorldCat, Wanita dan Satria}} As part of the growing movement to attract Indonesian intellectuals, the marketing staff emphasised the respectable (non-theatrical) background of the actors; the intelligentsia had little respect for traditional theatre and its players.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=262–263}}

A review in the Surabaya-based ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'' wrote that the film "gives a clear picture of the precarious position of Indonesian women and motivates the desire for a firmer outline of her rights in the Moslem society."{{efn|Original: "... ''geeft een duidelijk beeld van de wankele positie der Indonesische vrouw en motiveert den drang naar een vaster omlijning harer rechten In de Mohammedaansche maatschappij.''"}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna a}} Another review in the same newspaper wrote that the film "is captivating from start to finish",{{efn|Original: "... ''is van het begin tot het eind boeiend.''"}} one which "the film audience in Surabaya should certainly not miss".{{efn|Original: "... ''het Soerabaiasche filmpubliek beslist niet missen.''"}}{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna b}}

==Legacy==
After ''Wanita dan Satria'', Union produced a further two films;{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=233}} none of these were by Rd. Ariffien, who had left the company.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=263}} Saeroen likewise left soon after, joining [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=234}} Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djuariah}} Neither Ratna Djoewita nor Hidajat appeared in any films after 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ratna Djoewita}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, R Hidajat}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is likely [[lost film|lost]]; the American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

'''''Wreckfest''''' is a [[racing video game]] developed by [[Bugbear Entertainment]] and published by [[THQ Nordic]]. ''Wreckfest'' is described as the spiritual successor to the ''[[FlatOut]]'' series and a cross between ''FlatOut'', ''[[Destruction Derby]]'' and cult 1989 PC racer ''[[Street Rod (video game)|Street Rod]]''.&lt;ref name = "LukeReilly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reilly|first=Luke|title=The FlatOut Successor Publishers Don't Think You Want|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/the-flatout-successor-publishers-dont-think-you-want|date=16 February 2014|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable feature of the game engine is the use of [[soft body dynamics|soft-body damage modelling]], which enables location-based damage that affects the driving dynamics of vehicles in a realistic fashion.&lt;ref name = "TommyRoberts"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Tommy|title=Bugbear Inc. Crowdfunding 'Next Car Game', Utilizes Interesting Soft Body Car Damage|url=http://www.gameskinny.com/io4sh/bugbear-inc-crowdfunding-next-car-game-utilizes-interesting-soft-body-car-damage|work=GameSkinny|accessdate=23 May 2014|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a four-year long [[early access]] phase, the [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released in June 2018, with [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] versions scheduled to be released on March 31, 2019.&lt;ref name="Console delay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2018/10/wreckfest-for-ps4-and-xbox-one-delayed-to-2019|title=Wreckfest for PS4 and Xbox One delayed to 2019|publisher=Gematsu|accessdate=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The final game is intended to include a variety of [[gameplay]] features, including traditional [[auto racing|track racing]] and demolition derbies.&lt;ref name = "TommyRoberts" /&gt; The racing gameplay follows the same fundamental rules as most modern racing games, such as ''[[Need for Speed]]'' or ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]''. The player controls a car in a race or demolition derby, the goal being to win the race or be the sole survivor of the derby respectively. Before participating in an event the player must choose a vehicle, select either [[manual transmission|manual]] or [[automatic transmission]], and finally select either a dirt or [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] track on which to race. Players will also be able to buy and sell vehicles, customise vehicles, and perform "research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Usher|first=William|title=Bugbear's Next Car Game Early Access Pre-Alpha Gameplay Video|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Bugbear-Next-Car-Game-Early-Access-Pre-Alpha-Gameplay-Video-61239.html|work=Gaming Blend|accessdate=23 May 2014|date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The races themselves focus heavily on "vehicular combat", where players have to find a balance between defensive tactics such as avoiding debris or opponents' vehicles and more aggressive tactics such as grinding against opponents and forcing them out of the way in order to overtake them or avoid harm.&lt;ref name = "AdamSmith"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=Impressions: Next Car Game|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/16/impressions-next-car-game/|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Wreckfest's'' focus on physics and vehicular damage is similar to previous destruction-based racing games such as [[Criterion Games|Criterion]]'s ''[[Burnout (series)|Burnout]]'', it follows a somewhat slower and more strategic approach,&lt;ref name = "AdamSmith" /&gt; resulting in a more traditional racing gameplay experience than in comparable games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Alasdair|title=Next Car Game is now available on Steam Early Access|url=http://www.destructoid.com/next-car-game-is-now-available-on-steam-early-access-269016.phtml|work=[[Destructoid]]|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Development on ''Next Car Game'' began in 2012, and was first announced by Bugbear Entertainment on the ''Next Car Game'' blog in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laakso|first=Joonas|title=Welcome to Next Car Game!|url=http://nextcargame.com/welcome-to-next-car-game/#comments|publisher=Bugbear Entertainment|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[IGN]], lead game designer Janne Suur-Näkki stated that the game should reach a "feature-complete state" in 2014, with all key features implemented.&lt;ref name = "LukeReilly" /&gt; In a press release published by [[Eurogamer]], ''Next Car Game'' was officially announced for PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tom|title=Footage of FlatOut dev's next-gen racing game. UPDATE: Unbounded fun coming to PC and "yet-to-be announced" platforms.|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-25-footage-of-flatout-devs-possibly-next-gen-racing-game|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of publisher support, the development team provided early access to the game via pre-orders on the official ''Next Car Game'' website as well as [[Steam Early Access]] and also created a [[Kickstarter]] campaign as alternate means of raising revenue in order to develop the game.&lt;ref name = "LukeReilly" /&gt; The overhaul of the physics engine has caused updates to the game to slow significantly.&lt;ref name = "WeeklyReport8"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nextcargame.com/weekly-report-8/ | title = Weekly Report #8 | author = Team Bugbear | date = 20 February 2015 | website = [[Next Car Game]] | publisher = [[Bugbear Entertainment]] | accessdate = 17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was last updated in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/228380/announcements/detail/1699433555496548544|title=Wreckfest :: New Hotfix Out!|date=2018-08-21|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed Kickstarter campaign ===
Bugbear launched a Kickstarter campaign on November 1, 2013 in an effort to fund the development of ''Next Car Game'', with a goal of $350,000 to complete the game, and a stretch goal of $1.5 million to create [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] versions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=FlatOut developer turns to Kickstarter for new racing game|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/1/5056674/bugbear-entertainment-next-car-game-kickstarter|work=[[polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was cancelled on November 22, after it became "obvious" that the game would not reach its funding goal, having only raised $81,722.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|title=Bugbear Entertainment cancels Next Car Game Kickstarter|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/24/5140782/bugbear-entertainment-cancels-next-car-game-kickstarter|work=Polygon|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead game designer Janne Suur-Näkki described the Kickstarter campaign as a bewildering and disappointing experience, as Bugbear had to go to "great lengths" to make the campaign happen due to Kickstarter and Finnish legislation imposing "considerable challenges" on the project.&lt;ref name = "LukeReilly" /&gt;

After failing to meet the $350,000 goal of the Kickstarter campaign, Bugbear concentrated efforts on a pre-order campaign being run via the ''Next Car Game'' official website. A playable "technology sneak peek" was made available for download to supporters who had pre-ordered the game, the sneak peek featured 24 vehicles and a single level which the developers used internally to test the game's damage engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reilly|first=Luke|title=Bugbear Yanks Plug on Next Car Game Kickstarter|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/25/bugbear-yanks-plug-on-next-car-game-kickstarter|work=IGN|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a highly positive response from players regarding the sneak peek, Bugbear released an extended version called ''Sneak Peek v2.0'' to all pre-order supporters. This extended sneak peek included additional features such as new destructive machinery, more dynamic destructible objects, and a "physics cannon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sneak Peak v2.0 Released!|url=http://nextcargame.com/sneak-peak-v2-0-released/|publisher=Bugbear Entertainment|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early access ===
Following the success of the ''Technology Sneak Peek'', an early access version of the game was released shortly before [[Christmas]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Access doubled sales over Christmas week, free demo downloaded over 50,000 times!|url=http://nextcargame.com/early-access-doubled-sales-over-christmas-week-free-demo-downloaded-over-50000-times/|publisher=Bugbear Entertainment|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early access release featured two playable vehicles and three tracks, two of which were traditional race tracks while the other was a demolition derby arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Next Car Game: Early Access out now, free Sneak Peek demo released!|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/207692/Next_Car_Game_Early_Access_out_now_free_Sneak_Peek_demoreleased.php|work=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The early access release was highly successful and received great feedback from sim racers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why you will love Next Car Game|url=http://gamecrusaders.com/article/will-love-next-car-game/|publisher=Game Crusaders|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Christmas week the game had already sold for more than Bugbear's initial funding goal of $350,000 on Kickstarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|title=After stalling on Kickstarter, Next Car Game finds success in Early Access|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/8/5383334/next-car-game-pulled-in-1m-on-early-access-in-just-a-week-devs-say|work=Polygon|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Next Car Game'' was subsequently released on Steam Early Access on 15 January 2014, with special discount prices offered until the 29 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tach|first=Dave|title=Bugbear's Next Car Game hits Steam Early Access|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/15/5313004/bugbears-next-car-game-steam-early-access|work=Polygon|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game found tremendous success on the Steam Early Access platform, earning over $1 million in sales during a single week.&lt;ref name = "MikeSuszek"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suszek|first=Mike|title=Next Car Game earns $1 million from Steam Early Access|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/01/30/next-car-game-earns-1-million-from-steam-early-access/|work=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2014, Bugbear made an announcement on the game's blog entry for the game's sixth build that ''Next Car Game'' was now officially titled ''Wreckfest''.&lt;ref name="Build 6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nextcargame.com/build-6-live-official-name-revealed-multiplayer-introduced/|title=Build #6 Live!

F1). This happens on some tracks during races where the cars are close together and drivers misjudge how close the cars are. Thus, resulting in one big wreck after another. It can also result in only a few cars being taken out of the race instead of seven cars at once.|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same announcement, Bugbear also announced an eighteen-player online multiplayer has been introduced with new [[deathmatch]] and team deathmatch game modes, as well as a new track and a new car.&lt;ref name="Build 6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Destructoid name reveal" /&gt; The developer also said that they were aiming for twenty-four-player multiplayer for the final release, but will need to spend more time optimizing the game's network code.&lt;ref name="Build 6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Destructoid name reveal" /&gt; It was released out of early access on June 14, 2018. The [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] versions were originally scheduled for release on November 20, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=THQNordic|title=Wreckfest will COME OUT ON PC on JUNE 14!

== Reception ==
