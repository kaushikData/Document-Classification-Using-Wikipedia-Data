'''''A Woman Is a Risky Bet: Six Orchestra Conductors ''''' (Swedish: ''Dirigenterna'') is a 1987 [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish]] [[documentary film]] about women orchestra [[conducting|conductors]] directed by [[Christina Olofson]].

==Description==
In ''A Woman Is a Risky Bet'' we meet six women who have broken their way into a man's world – the world of [[conducting]].

[[JoAnn Falletta]] and [[Victoria Bond]] from U.S., {{ill|Kerstin Nerbe|sv}} and {{ill|Ortrud Mann|sv}} from Sweden, [[Veronika Dudarova]] and [[Camilla Kolchinsky]] from the USSR share a passion for music and the courage to break with existing values and face challenge. Christina Olofson takes us to New York City, Moscow, Stockholm and Oslo to meet them. The film covers preparations, rehearsals and parts of concerts. At home, alone with the conductor's score, they give us their account of the work of the conductor, of their convictions and their love for music.

The skepticism towards women conductors and musicians by some becomes obvious in a visit to the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]&lt;ref name="Campell (1994)"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YD82cYYM7NwC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=A+woman+is+a+risky+bet+film&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MxIjesRq8p&amp;sig=nh2KXr1wrkW_NAkMNvA-OqajA6I&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=5RQVSp7sC8vw_Aa0m4iEDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA249,M1| title=Analysing performance, pp. 248–249 | publisher=Manchester University Press 1994| author=Patrick Campell }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in interviews with international [[impresario]]s. Conductors [[Sixten Ehrling]] and [[Jorge Mester]] make comments on what they believe is the prevailing conservative attitudes among colleagues.

The rehearsal and concert scenes in the film reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the featured conductors;  Falletta leading the Queens Philharmonic in Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'',  Dudarova with the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra and Choir rehearsing [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart's Requiem]], Nerbe conducting Mozart's ''[[Linz Symphony]]'' and Kolchinsky directing  [[von Weber]]'s [[overture]] to the opera ''[[Euryanthe]]''.

"Only poor soldiers don't want to be generals." – Veronika Dudarova&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;quote from the film&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ana María Arroyo Mariscal''' (31 July 1923 – 28 March 1995) better known as '''Ana Mariscal''' was a classic [[Spain|Spanish]] film [[actress]], [[Film director|director]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film producer]]. She also acted in Argentinean films. She was involved in well over 50 films between 1940 and 1968, frequently starring in films she also wrote and directed. She is iconic to 1940s and 50s Spanish cinema. Her brother [[Luis Arroyo (film director)|Luis Arroyo]] (1915–1956) was also an actor and film director.

== Early Career and Education ==
Mariscal was born in Madrid in 1923 to a middle-class family. Her father owned a furniture store and a theater that would provide Mariscal much of her early exposure to acting. While occasionally appearing in theater productions with her brother, Mariscal intended to go to university to study mathematics. She decided to pursue acting after being incidentally cast in her first film role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6HctKgK5lsC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=ana+mariscal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jpaPFues5z&amp;sig=u7Vvi3ZJI5wsckBucKzaorhQg0A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNl8Xg29DeAhVkMn0KHczICVY4ChDoATAJegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ana%20mariscal&amp;f=false|title=Heroines Without Heroes: Reconstructing Female and National Identities in European Cinema, 1945-1951|last=Siehlohr|first=Ulrike|date=2000-03-01|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780304702503|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnMqzBu1vH4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=ana+mariscal+career&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HuljnwkQNP&amp;sig=bOudjXdKCUitYosKwVQaxVaqB7E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-m533ntPeAhXollQKHf8LCz0Q6AEwBHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ana%20mariscal%20career&amp;f=false|title=Feminist Discourse and Spanish Cinema: Sight Unseen|last=Martin-Márquez|first=Susan|last2=Martin-Marquez|first2=Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Susan|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198159797|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Ana Mariscal began her career after accompanying her actor brother Luis Arroyo to an audition for ''El Ultimo Husar''. Almost by chance, she was noticed by the director [[Luis Marquina]] and cast in the film. This would start a prolific career in acting and directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cvc.cervantes.es/el_rinconete/anteriores/junio_01/08062001_02.htm|title=CVC. Rinconete. Cine y televisión. Ana Mariscal: una mujer marcada, por José Ignacio Pernas.|website=cvc.cervantes.es|language=es|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next decade, Mariscal would star in over twenty films, becoming a household name in Spain. A few notable films from this time include ''[[The Queen's Flower Girl]]'', ''[[Raza (film)|Raza]], [[A Shadow at the Window|A Shadow at the Window,]]'' and ''[[The Princess of the Ursines]]''. After a decade of typecast roles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2003/04/17/andalucia/1050531735_850215.html|title=Reportaje {{!}} Una pionera del cine español|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=2003-04-17|work=El País|access-date=2018-11-16|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Mariscal would start her own production company called BOSCO and begin writing and directing her own works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGikCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA548&amp;lpg=PA548&amp;dq=ana+mariscal+bosco+productions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HgsWYG5eTk&amp;sig=914MTCkzVgv1LNJbdO42_7Z5eiI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjDqYbTvNjeAhWHjFQKHc42DQUQ6AEwCnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ana%20mariscal%20bosco%20productions&amp;f=false|title=Women Screenwriters: An International Guide|last=Nelmes|first=Jill|last2=Selbo|first2=Jule|date=2015-09-29|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137312372|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her directorial debut with ''[[Segundo López|Segundo Lopez]],'' a film she also wrote and starred in. It was a critically well-received comedy with [[Italian neorealism|Italian Neo-realist]] influences. She would later direct her esteemed work ''[[They Fired with Their Lives|They fired with their lives]]'' that deals with the [[Spanish Civil War]]; an event Mariscal herself lived through during her childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmotech.com/v2/ES/FX_RevistaEditorial.asp?ID=2543|title=Filmotech.com - Revista de Cine - ReportajesYO TAMBIÉN QUIERO SER DIRECTOR . De delante a detrás de la cámara|website=www.filmotech.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later career she would shift between film, television, and theater pursuits, still using her production company to fund her projects. During this period she would direct or be involved with ''Occidente y sabotaje,'' ''El Camino,'' and ''The Other Woman.'' She would soon begin teaching classes at the IIEC (Institute of Investigations and Cinematographic Experiences) while still balancing acting and directing jobs. She would eventually recede from the world of film making and dedicate her time entirely to the study of literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cvc.cervantes.es/el_rinconete/anteriores/junio_01/08062001_02.htm|title=CVC.

Just a few months before her death, She would receive the Gold Medal for Merit in the Fine Arts in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1995/01/04/pdfs/A00273-00273.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in the Cementerio de la Almudena&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7702997/ana-mariscal|title=Ana Mariscal (1923 - 1995)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Cypriot art''' refers to all works of [[Visual arts|visual art]] originating from [[Cyprus]] in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] from c. 10,000 BC to c. 330 AD.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/ancient-art-from-cyprus-in-the-cesnola-collection-the-cesnola-collection-in-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/oclc/469681412&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Ancient art from Cyprus in the Cesnola collection: the Cesnola collection in the Metropolitan Museum of art|last=Karagiorgis|first=Vasos|last2=Mertens|first2=Joan R|last3=Rose|first3=Marice E|date=2000|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0870999444|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, various types of objects were produced such as domestic tools, weaponry, jewellery, and decorative figurines. This range of art attests to the blend of both native and foreign influences of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] as they successively occupied the country. Artworks produced in ancient Cyprus incorporate almost all of the mediums of visual art worked on in ancient history including [[terracotta]], stone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cesnola collection of Cypriot art : stone sculpture|last=Antoine|first=Hermary|publisher=|others=Mertens, Joan R.,, Mariani, Phil,, Jourlait, Anne|year=2014|isbn=9780300206715|edition=Print-on-demand|location=New York|pages=|oclc=877005100}}&lt;/ref&gt; metals, glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cesnola Collection of Cypriot art : ancient glass|last=Lightfoot|first=Chris S.|date=2018-03-13|publisher=|others=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)|isbn=9781588396815|edition=Print-on-demand|location=New York|pages=|oclc=1017990618}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Ancient_Art_from_Cyprus_The_Cesnola_Collection_in_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art|title=Description: Ancient Art from Cyprus (The Cesnola Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art)|last=Karageorghis|first=Vassos|date=2000|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistoric Period (c. 10,000 - c. 1050 BC) ==

=== Pre-Neolithic (c. 10,000 - c. 8500 BC) and Neolithic (c. 8500 - c. 3900 BC) Periods ===
In c. 10,000 BC, seasonal hunters of pygmy hippopotami and elephants were present on the island. The first [[Neolithic]] settlers in Cyprus originated from either the Syro-Palestinian coast or southern [[Anatolia]], forming communities founded on [[agriculture]]. It was towards the end of the Neolithic period when people began to bake moulded clay into vessels which were frequently embellished with abstract designs in red on a light [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hemingway, Colette, and Seán Hemingway. “Prehistoric Cypriot Art and Culture.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcyp/hd_pcyp.htm (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Pottery, Early Cypriot I period, 2500-2075 BC, UC, 154761.jpg|thumb|Pottery of the Early Cypriot I period (c. 2500 - c. 2075 BC)|228x228px]]

=== Chalcolithic Period (c. 3900 - c. 2500 BC) ===
During this period, a new flood of Syro-Palestinian and Anatolian migrants introduced a more advanced culture where religion was practised and art processes became more complex. Examples of such art are that of female [[Figurine|figurines]] formed from [[clay]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]]—in particular the local stone picrolite—with prominent genitals which represented [[fertility]] as one of the crucial values of [[agrarian society]] at the time. Towards the end of this period, small implements and ornamental decorations began to be hammered from [[copper]], ''chalkos'' in Greek, hence giving the name of this era of progression from the Neolithic Period to the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite the continuation of agriculture, certain developments such as diversified burial procedures, the building of unique religious installations, and the use of [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] indicate a more sophisticated and organised society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cycladic.gr/en/page/istoria-tis-kiprou|title=THE HISTORY OF CYPRUS|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Museum of Cycladic Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Bronze Age (c. 2500 - c. 1900 BC) ===
Profound changes caused by incoming coastal Asia Minor migrants and other intra-societal processes marked the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Communities began to move, settling in areas of fertile land near sources of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Influences from the [[Near East]], where [[metallurgy]] was highly developed, established standardised procedures of mining, extracting, and smelting of the rich copper [[Ore|ores]] found in Cyprus. This resource would become a valued export of high demand throughout Mediterranean antiquity during the Middle Bronze Age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Cypriot society was still rooted in agriculture, bronze-smiths began to manufacture unique ornaments and tools following personal techniques towards the end of Early Bronze Age.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Red polished cypriot flask Antikensammlung Kiel.jpg|thumb|Red polished Cypriot flask (c. 2200 - c. 1700 BC)|337x337px]]

=== Middle Bronze Age (c. 1900 - c. 1650 BC) ===
The distinctive geographical location of Cyprus in the centre of Eastern Mediterranean maritime [[trade]] allowed for the country to become a significant commercial hub. This advantage also provided the country the ability to build contacts with Egypt, the Near East, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]], and [[Mycenaean Greece]]. However, despite progressive social organisation, the profound distinctions in wealth as evidenced in burials highlight the explicit social divisions at the time. Such divide and local disputes resulted in the construction of [[Fortification|fortifications]] in many settlements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The shapes and designs of [[pottery]] produced in the Early and Middle Bronze Ages were innovative and creative. Terracotta was used extensively to produce statuettes for tomb burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cesnola Collection of Cypriot Art: terracottas|last=VASSOS.|first=KARAGEORGHIS,|date=2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300227192|location=[S.l.]|oclc=967270977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other burial items, particularly those for men, consisted of bronze weaponry and tools. Cylinder seals and use of gold and silver for jewellery were gradually popularised as well. With the increasing need for more complex ways of expressing religion, ceremonial sites and unique metalworks were constructed. Such constructions give evidence of the growing significance of metals like copper in Cyprus. By the end of the Bronze Age, Near Eastern and Aegean influences allowed for Cyprus to develop the art of [[engraving]] and [[carving]] to a large extent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Late Bronze Age (c. 1650 - c. 1050 BC) ===

During the Late Bronze Age, Cyprus was producing copper on a colossal scale and exporting it throughout the entire Eastern Mediterranean to be bartered for commodities and luxury goods. Various works of [[alabaster]] and [[faience]], displayed within The Cesnola Collection, were imported from Egypt during the first half of the 14th century BC. The recent archaeological discovery off the Anatolian coast of ten tonnes of copper in a 14th century BC [[Uluburun shipwreck|shipwreck at Ulu Burun]] show the large scope of Cyprus’ seafaring commerce. Jars holding Cypriot pottery and products of agriculture such as coriander were also found in the excavation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Antikensammlung Kiel 220.JPG|left|thumb|Cypriot vessel of the Red Polished Ware II-III period (c. 2200 - c. 1700 BC)|alt=|229x229px]]
By the Late Bronze Age, Cypriot art could be seen as a mixture of both domestic pressures and foreign influences. Adaptations of foreign stylistic elements from the Aegean, the Near East, and Egypt led to their reinterpretation and as a result incorporation into unique Cypriot customs. Particularly during the 12th century BC, bronze-work, writing, jewellery, and stone seal carvings were all influenced by the Aegean. From c. 1500 BC, Cypriots commenced using an [[Cypro-Minoan syllabary|undecipherable Cypro-Minoan script]] adopted from Crete which gave them the means to manage records and inventories at a time when social organisation was becoming increasingly complex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This script can be seen on clay tablets and records found in metropolitan cities such as [[Enkomi]] and [[Kalavasos]]. The Cesnola Collection also contains numerous vases on which some characters of this ancient script is visible. Upon excavations of rich burial grounds and 14th to 13th century BC urban centres like Enkomi, luxurious artefacts made from a range of materials have been discovered. Burial chambers of an elite class have further unearthed nearly exclusively a collection of imported Mycenaean vessels from the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the arts in Cyprus thrived, social inequities arose as a result of the flux of imported wealth and resources. During the latter part of the 13th century BC, unrest took over Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean, leaving cities in ruins and generating a surge of Aegean refugees to Cyprus. However, despite the turmoil, Cyprus managed to eventually recover its economic and commercial success.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Amphoriskos, Cypriot, Cypro-Geometric II-III, c. 950-750 BC, terracotta - Middlebury College Museum of Art - Middlebury, VT - DSC07983.jpg|thumb|Terracotta from the Cypro-Geometric II-III period (c. 950 - c. 750 BC)|194x194px]]

== Cypro-Geometric Period (c. 1050 - c. 750 BC) ==
After its recuperation, new settlements arose in Cyprus as a result of the influx of Greek and Achaean immigrants who brought with them their Mycenaean culture in the forms of pottery, clothing, weaponry, burial customs, and the Greek language. The country maintained its role as a main exporter of raw materials in the Mediterranean, and eventually introduced a new local syllabic script in the 11th century BC which was in use until the 3rd century BC for the writing of ancient Greek and Cypriot language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The establishment of a [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] settlement at [[Kition]] on the southern coast in around 900 BC further pushed Cyprus’ trade as the Phoenicians were interested in the plentiful copper and wood resources for [[shipbuilding]]. With this, the Phoenician language was adopted, and foreign ideas such as the cult of the goddess [[Astarte]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; were assimilated into Cypriot culture. However, despite such imported customs at the time, Cypriot art managed to maintain its native characteristics. Pottery of this period was generally produced from Proto-White Painted Ware, but the Cypriots also painted in black and red.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Advancements in the political structure of society could be seen in the founding of ten kingdoms ruled by kings called ''wanaktes'',&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Department of Greek and Roman Art. “Geometric and Archaic Cyprus.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gcyp/hd_gcyp.htm (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; as evidenced in a 7th century BC inscription. [[File:Limestone stele (shaft) with the head of Hathor MET DP263876.jpg|thumb|263x263px|Limestone stele with the head of Hathor from Cyprus (c. 575 - c. 550 BC)]]

== Cypro-Archaic Period (c. 750 - c. 480 BC) ==
Evidence revealing the surrender of the Cypriot rulers to [[Assyria]] in 709 BC was found on a [[stele]] at Kition&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and the kingdoms remained under Assyrian rule until 669 BC.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Prosperity and cultural incitement in the kingdoms followed, and the kings of Cyprus were able to self-rule as long as they paid frequent [[tribute]] to the king of Assyria. The riches and foreign relations of these Cypriot kings can be seen in evidence found in royal burial chambers at [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]]. In 669 BC, Cyprus became independent, a rare circumstance in Cypriot history that lasted until the country was subjugated by Egypt under [[Amasis II]] in 560 BC. During this time, the extent of Egyptian control was evident in the increasing use of Egyptian symbols in Cypriot art, such as the head of [[Hathor]] which was found commonly on art pieces from [[Amathus]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It could also be seen in the many stone sculptures of male votaries. Cypriot sculpture in the Cypro-Archaic Period was characterised by [[polychrome]] decoration which was also used in Greece. Terracotta during this time was often painted, and the development of the mould meant that figurine production could be accelerated to a great extent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 545 BC, Cyprus was conquered by [[Cyrus the Great]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]], but allied with the [[Ionians|Ionian Greeks]] in 499 BC in attempt to rebel against the Persian invaders. Undeterred by the fluctuations in power, Cyprus remained prosperous as a pivotal trade hub&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, and religious practices did not change with new rule.

== Cypro-Classical Period (c. 480 - c. 310 BC) ==
Until Cyprus was liberated by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC, there was a constant power struggle for Cypriot independence against the Persians. During the Cypro-Classical era, sculptures, jewellery, clothing, and other art forms began to take on many Hellenic elements as a result of increased affiliation with the Greeks who aided the Cypriots in their attempts to depose the Persians.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sculptures in this period were generally made from terracotta or limestone and could only be afforded by the affluent. Although the influence of Greek culture was evident in the arts of Cyprus, the Cypriots still kept and used their own artistic styles. One prominent example is that of a Golgoi [[sarcophagus]] adorned with warriors in battle which is a scene commonly seen in Greek art. However, the Cypriot artist combines a hunting scene with this landscape, whereby the proportions of the animals are clearly distinctive from those found in Hellenic works. Similarly, Cypriot jewellery, in particular those made from gold, reveal a combination of both local and Greek artistic styles. East Greek influences from the sixth century BC gave rise to freestanding Cypriot sculptures that exhibited common Hellenic features such as the subtle smile and forward left foot.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Greek and Roman Art. “Classical Cyprus (ca. 480–ca. 310 B.C.).” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

== Hellenistic and Roman Periods (c. 310 BC - c. 330 AD) ==
Art in Cyprus eventually came to assimilate [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] elements as the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] conquered the country in 300 BC. Although artistic elements of ancient Athens influenced Cypriot burial architecture and other art forms in the beginning, Egyptian styles ultimately superseded. After the Romans seized control in 58 BC, Cyprus once again became a vibrant trading centre. Eastern Mediterranean traders and artists, including sculptors, brought with them a range of foreign artistic practices as they entered the country. As marble and bronze sculptures were increasingly imported from the Aegean, traditional limestone sculptures started to diminish.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Hellenistic elements were still prevalent in Cypriot sculpture, ceramics and jewellery during this time. Ultimately, all forms of Cypriot art became influenced by Roman techniques and styles.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Greek and Roman Art. “Hellenistic and Roman Cyprus.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

==Collections==
Outside Cyprus, there are large collections in several museums, notably the [[British Museum]] and [[Louvre]]. One of the most extensive collections of ancient Cypriot art is The Cesnola Collection which is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. This inventory was amassed through personal investments and excavations by [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola]] who was an American consul based in Cyprus in 1865, before becoming the first director of the Metropolitan.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Greek and Roman Art. “The Cesnola Collection at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19510">A growing number of film festivals are held in the Middle East to showcase films from the region as well as international standouts.&lt;ref&gt;Jaafar, Ali, [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008038/ Film festivals bloom in Middle East], ''Variety'', 2 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, institutions and organizations in other parts of the world are increasingly honoring the new generation of filmmakers in the Middle East with '''Arab film festivals'''.

Though burgeoning Arab filmmakers still struggle with constrained funding and a lack of established distribution channels, artists are beginning to produce more and more commercially viable films.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfbusiness.com/2012/12/waiting-for-the-rise-of-the-arab-film-industry/#.URmGf46hZaE&lt;/ref&gt;  Films featured at festivals both in the Middle East and around the world run the gamut from films about war, identity, political or social issues to romantic comedies and thrillers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/world/middleeast/arab-filmmakers-seek-commercial-success.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Goals of festival organizers are largely to provide an alternative portrayal of Arabs to that in mainstream global media in order to promote understanding and dialogue between the Arab world and the West. In addition, festivals work to support Arab filmmakers in the Middle East and elsewhere by providing a platform for them to screen and promote their cinematic achievements to broad audiences.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia"&gt;http://www.varietyarabia.com/en/print.aspx?sid=c34c335b-5b8e-4636-9166-34ec0b3ca62a&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arab film festivals in the Middle East ==

=== Egypt ===

The '''[[Cairo International Film Festival]]''' is a world-class annual film festival in Cairo, Egypt. Established in 1976, it was the first film festival to be held in the Arab world and is the only international competitive feature film festival in the Middle East and Africa recognized by the [[FIAPF]]. The festival has awarded many Egyptian and internationally renowned actors, actresses and directors. Special awards, such as the Best Arab Film Award, are bestowed upon the most exceptional regional films of the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciff.org.eg/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the '''[[Alexandria International Film Festival]]''', Egypt's second largest film festival, is held every September in local theaters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fodors.com/world/africa-and-middle-east/egypt/alexandria/review-470391.html&lt;/ref&gt; Organized by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics (EAFWC), the festival promotes film culture and aims to bolster relations among international filmmakers and the Mediterranean in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bulletfilm.com/festival/alexandria-international-film-festival&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrating its 10th edition in 2017 is the '''[[Cairo International Women's Film Festival]]'''. From its earliest edition, Entre Cineastas, to the Caravan of Arab and Latin American Women's Films, CIWFF has developed and expanded over the years. The festival aims at introducing films made by female filmmakers from around the world and serving as a meeting point for them and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/188201/Arts--Culture/Film/INTERVIEW-Filmmaker-Amal-Ramsis-on-the-th-Cairo-In.aspx |title=INTERVIEW: Filmmaker Amal Ramsis on the 9th Cairo Int'l Women's Film Festival |website=english.ahram.org.eg |date=2016-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chosen solely by public vote, one film is presented with the Audience Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairowomenfilmfest.com/aboutus/ |title=Cairo International Women Film Festival |website=cairowomenfilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jordan ===

Founded in 2004, the '''[[Jordan Short Film Festival]]''' is managed by the [[Amman Filmmakers Cooperative]], a film collective based in Amman, Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ammanfilmmakers.alif.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625100608/http://ammanfilmmakers.alif.com/ |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a week-long event, the festival organizers promote independent cinema with screenings throughout the year and have launched two main competitions: the International short film competition and the Arab short film competition. Notably, the festival was suspended in 2011 as an act of protest against the killing of peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring. In a statement, the JSFF founder and director noted that "it would be misleading and dishonest to pretend that Jordan under such circumstances can host film festivals that can openly and freely screen films about human rights and other pressing issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jordanfilmfestival.com/jsff11-suspended.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919150719/http://jordanfilmfestival.com/jsff11-suspended.html |archivedate=2013-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arab film festivals abroad ==

A large and growing number of Arab film festivals take place outside of the Middle East. These festivals play a key role in increasing access to and interest in Arab cinema outside of the Arab world.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia" /&gt; They are also important for Arab diasporas eager to stay in touch with the cultural scene of their homelands.&lt;ref name="varietyarabia" /&gt;

Established in California in 1996, the [[Arab Film Festival]] is the largest independent annual exhibition of Arab films in the United States. It is regarded as one of the most important Arab film festivals outside of the Arab world. The official mission of the festival is to "enhance public understanding of Arab culture and to provide alternative representations of Arabs that contradict the stereotypical images frequently encountered in the American mass media." The festival shows films from and about the Arab world in order to furnish audiences with realistic images of Arab culture, art, history, people and politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://arabfilmfestival.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[:es:Festival Internacional de Cine Euro-Árabe AMAL|Amal Euroarab Film Festival]]''' was born in 2003 in [[:es:Santiago de Compostela|Santiago de Compostela]], Spain. It is developed by [http://www.fundacionaraguaney.org/ Araguaney-Bridge between Cultures Foundation] and directed by Ghaleb Jaber Martínez. Amal means "hope" in Arab language, the hope that Arab world needs more than ever. [http://www.festivalamal.es/ Amal Festival] seeks to promote the development of co-productions between Galicia and Spain and Arab countries, building cross-cultural bridges.

The '''London Middle East &amp; North Africa Film Festival''', created in 2011, provides an annual platform for filmmakers to showcase their work and reach audiences who might not otherwise get the opportunity to view cinema from the region, stimulating cross-cultural dialogue, connection and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;http://menafilmfest.com/#/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in London, the annual '''London Palestine Film Festival''' was established in 1998, making it the UK's longest-running festival specialising in film from and upon any region of the Arab world. Providing a platform for international as well as Palestinian film, the festival takes place in Spring and is managed by UK-based non-profit the '''Palestine Film Foundation'''. It combines screenings, artists' talks, and panel discussions, with art exhibitions, conferences, and book launches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palestinefilm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Middle Eastern Film Festival NYC''', produced by Media Space NYC, aims to entertain and enlighten moviegoers with both short and feature-length films about topics related to the Middle East. It is an offshoot and new medium incarnation of the very successful Noor Play Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middleeasternfilmfestivalnyc.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sofia Middle East &amp; North Africa Region Film Festival''' is an annual Arab/Islamic event in the Balkans, presenting films from the Middle East and North Africa to a Bulgarian audience. Since its inception in 2009, the festival has screened more than 120 titles.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.menarfest.com/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Malmö Arab Film Festival]] (MAFF)''', founded in 2011 has rapidly grown to be one of the major yearly manifestations of Arab film outside the Arab World. The founder, Mouhamad Keblawi, is also managing director. Thirteen prices are awarded yearly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malmoarabfilmfestival.se&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a number of Arab film festivals abroad focus specifically on the issue of Palestine. Events such as the '''Boston Palestine Film Festival''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonpalestinefilmfest.org/&lt;/ref&gt; '''Toronto Palestine Film Festival''',&lt;ref&gt;http://tpff.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; '''Houston Palestine Film Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpff.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Chicago Palestine Film Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;http://palestinefilmfest.com/&lt;/ref&gt; bring Palestinian and Palestine-related cinema, narratives and culture to a dispersed audience.

== LatinAmerica ==

1.1 [http://www.cinefertil.org/latinarab/ LatinArab International Film Festival]

The Latin Arab International Film Festival has been held yearly for the last seven years in the City of Buenos Aires. The only festival of its kind in the American continent, it has grown into a platform where to meet and promote Arab cinema and where to build a bridge and bring together the Latin American and Arab cultures, as they have so much in common. The festival's venues are public theatres Cine.Ar and el cultural San Martín and the Alliance Francaise. 
At the same time, LatinArab's industry Forum (The Latin Arab Co-Production Forum), held within the frame of the Mar del Plata International Film Festival, aims at potentiating both regions' film industries with the conception of films carried out as co-productions. [http://www.cinefertil.org/latinarab/]

== Notable films ==

Arab film festivals sometimes serve as forums for political and cultural statements. In 2003, for instance, Egyptian filmmaker Khaled Hagar presented his controversial ''Girls' Love'', the story of a love affair between an Egyptian man and a Jewish woman.

More recently, films screened and/or competing at the festivals have reflected the Arab Spring. The 2012 Dubai International Film Festival showcased Hinde Boujemaa’s ''It was Better Tomorrow'', in which a homeless woman and her son live hand to mouth, squatting in apartments left empty by fleeing multinationals. Another documentary, ''True Story of Love, Life Death and Sometimes Revolution'' by Nidal Hassan, gathers the views and testimonies of Syrian women during the Syrian revolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://dubaifilmfest.com/en/news/article/15-powerful-muhr-arab-documentaries-explore-womens-lives-and-society-post-a/year/2012{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12229">[[Image:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|Schopenhauer claimed that art provides knowledge of eternal Platonic Ideas and also results in temporary relief from the pressures of willing.]]
'''Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics''' result from his doctrine of the primacy of the [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] as the ''[[thing in itself]]'', the ground of life and all being; and from his judgment that individuation of the Will is [[evil]].  [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] held that [[art]] offers a way for people to temporarily escape the suffering that results from willing.&lt;ref&gt;"…aesthetic pleasure in the beautiful consists, to a large extent, in the fact that, when
we enter the state of pure contemplation, we are raised for the moment above all willing, above all desires and cares; we are, so to speak, rid of ourselves." (Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. I, § 68, Dover page 390)
&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his doctrine on the dual aspect of the world as will and the world as representation, he taught that if [[consciousness]] or attention is fully engrossed, absorbed, or occupied with the world as painless representations or images, then there is no consciousness of the world as painful willing. Aesthetic pleasure results from being a spectator of "the world as representation" [mental image or idea] without any experience of "the world as will" [need, craving, urge].&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer's Account of Aesthetic Experience. TJ Diffey - ''The British Journal of Aesthetics'', 1990 - Br Soc Aesthetics&lt;/ref&gt; Art, according to Schopenhauer, also provides essential knowledge of the world’s objects in a way that is more profound than science or everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;"[A]esthetics is at the heart of philosophy for Schopenhauer: art and aesthetic experience not only provide escape from an otherwise miserable existence, but attain an objectivity explicitly superior to that of science or ordinary empirical knowledge." "Knowledge and Tranquility: Schopenhauer on the Value of Art," [[Christopher Janaway]], in Dale Jacquette (ed.), ''Schopenhauer, Philosophy and the Arts'', ch. 2, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==An extension of his philosophy==
For Schopenhauer, the Will is an aimless desire to perpetuate itself, the basis of [[life]].  Desire engendered by the Will is the source of all the sorrow in the world; each satisfied desire leaves us either with boredom, or with some new desire to take its place.  A world in thrall to Will is necessarily a world of suffering.  Since the Will is the source of life, and our very bodies are stamped with its image and designed to serve its purpose, the human intellect is, in Schopenhauer's [[simile]], like a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulders of a blind giant.

Schopenhauer's [[aesthetics]] is an attempt to break out of the [[pessimism]] that naturally comes from this world view.  Schopenhauer believed that what distinguished ''aesthetic experiences'' from other experiences is that contemplation of the object of aesthetic appreciation temporarily allowed the subject a respite from the strife of desire, and allowed the subject to enter a realm of purely mental enjoyment, the world purely as representation or mental image.  The more a person's mind is concerned with the world as representation, the less it feels the suffering of the world as will.&lt;ref&gt;"Schopenhauer&amp;hellip;regards art as the only means of temporarily escaping the fundamentally futile nature of reality. Art’s essential role is&amp;hellip;to enable us to escape what we already intuitively know about the irredeemable nature of what we are." ([[Andrew Bowie]], ''Aesthetics and subjectivity: from Kant to Nietzsche'', Chapter 8, "Nietzsche and the fate of Romantic thought," "Schopenhauer: music as metaphysics," Manchester University Press, 2003, Page 262.)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer analysed [[art]] from its effects, both on the personality of the artist, and the personality of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Magee|Magee, Bryan]], ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'' (Oxford University Press, revised edition, 1977) {{ISBN|0-19-823722-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Schopenhauerian artistic genius==
Schopenhauer believed that while all people were in thrall to the Will, the quality and intensity of their subjection differed:

:Only through the pure contemplation . . . which becomes absorbed entirely in the object, are the Ideas comprehended; and the nature of ''genius'' consists precisely in the preëminent ability for such contemplation. . . . (T)his demands a complete forgetting of our own person.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (v. 1. ss. 185)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthetic experience temporarily emancipates the subject from the Will's domination and raises them to a level of pure perception.  "On the occurrence of an aesthetic appreciation, the will thereby vanishes entirely from consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' 2:415&lt;/ref&gt;  Genuine art cannot be created by anyone who merely follows standard artistic rules. A genius is required, that is, a person who creates original art without concern for rules. The personality of the artist was also supposed to be less subject to Will than most: such a person was a Schopenhauerian [[genius]], a person whose exceptional predominance of intellect over Will made them relatively aloof from earthly cares and concerns.  The [[poetry|poet]] living in a [[garret]], the [[absent-minded professor]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] struggling with madness, are all (at least in the popular mind) examples of Schopenhauer's geniuses: so fixed on their art that they neglect the "business of life" that in Schopenhauer's mind meant only the domination of the evil and painful Will.  For Schopenhauer, the relative lack of competence of the artist and the thinker for practical pursuits was no mere [[stereotype]]: it was cause and effect.

Schopenhauer believed that what gives arts such as [[literature]] and [[sculpture]] their value was the extent to which they incorporated pure perceptions.  But, being concerned with human forms (at least in Schopenhauer's day) and human emotions, these art forms were inferior to [[music]], which being a direct manifestation of will, was to Schopenhauer's mind the highest form of art.  Schopenhauer's philosophy of music was influential in the works of [[Richard Wagner]].  Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of Schopenhauer, and recommended the reading of Schopenhauer to his friends.  His published works on [[music theory]] changed over time, and became more aligned with Schopenhauer's thought, over the course of his life. Schopenhauer had stated that music was more important than [[libretto]] in opera. Music is, according to Schopenhauer, an immediate expression of will, the basic reality of the experienced world. Libretto is merely a linguistic representation of transient phenomena. Wagner emphasized music over libretto in his later works after reading Schopenhauer's aesthetic doctrine.

==Influence==
In proposing that art could offer deliverance from the Will, Schopenhauer elevated art from mere [[artisan]]ry or [[Decorative arts|decoration]], and held that art potentially offered temporary deliverance from the aimless strife of the Will in nature.  In effect, Schopenhauer turned art into a substitute religion by offering a doctrine of [[salvation]] through aesthetic experiences.  Artists were not merely skilled hands; they were [[priest]]s or [[prophet]]s of this doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Will Durant]], ''[[The Story of Philosophy]]'', sub. tit. "Arthur Schopenhauer".&lt;/ref&gt;  This teaching goes far to explain Schopenhauer's appeal to members of the creative communities over the second half of the nineteenth century. His doctrine of aesthetics justified artistic work as a matter of highest importance in human society.

Schopenhauer's aesthetics remain influential today, and are perhaps the most lasting part of his [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The aesthetic theories of Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer''
I Knox - 1958 - Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;  Their appeal to later generations of [[romanticism|Romantics]], and to all schools of [[bohemianism]], is demonstrated.  Wagner sent Schopenhauer a note expressing deep gratitude for Schopenhauer's discussion of music.  Schopenhauer's philosophy in general left a deep impression on a number of important writers, especially [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Thomas Mann]], and [[Ivan Turgenev]].&lt;ref name="Magee 1977"&gt;Magee (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's aesthetics were directly responsible for the rise of the [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and their allied movements, and to the general development of the concept of [[art for art's sake]].  It deeply influenced the aesthetics of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], although he ultimately rejected Schopenhauer's conception of Will as evil, whose famous opposition of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] is a translation of Schopenhauer's opposition of intellect against will in terms of [[Greek mythology]].  When the [[Marxism|Marxist]] critique of [[capitalism]] was stirred into the aesthetic stew, Schopenhauer's essentially [[asceticism|ascetic]] view of the purpose of art laid the foundation for the opposition of [[kitsch]] versus the [[avant-garde]] which is found in such critics as [[Clement Greenberg]].  Contemporary beliefs that artistic creation should not be swayed by financial gains or the demands of patrons or customers, and the belief that the greatest artists are those who create new and entirely unprecedented forms of expression, rather than those who develop already existing forms, all owe a great deal to the influence of Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="Magee 1977"/&gt;

[[George Santayana|Santayana]]  praised Schopenhauer's doctrine that [[tragedy]] benefited audiences because it helped them to deny the will&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;live and to turn away from life. "He [Schopenhauer] thought tragedy beautiful because it detached us from a
troubled world and did not think a troubled world
good, as those unspeakable optimists did, because it
made such a fine tragedy. It is pleasant to find
that among all these philosophers one at least was
a gentleman."&lt;ref&gt;Santayana, George, [https://archive.org/details/egotismingerman00santuoft Egotism in German Philosophy], Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
"&amp;hellip;things are certainly beautiful to ''behold'', but to ''be'' them is something quite different." (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVI)

"&amp;hellip;aesthetic pleasure in the beautiful consists, to a large extent, in the fact that, when we enter the state of pure contemplation, we are raised for the moment above all willing, above all desires and cares; we are, so to speak, rid of ourselves." (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 68)

"Perhaps the reason why common objects in ''still life'' seem so transfigured and generally everything ''painted'' appears in a supernatural light is that we then no longer look at things in the flux of time and in the connection of cause and effect &amp;hellip;. On the contrary, we are snatched out of that eternal flux of all things and removed into a dead and silent eternity. In its individuality the thing itself was determined by time and by the [causal] conditions of the understanding; here we see this connection abolished and only the ''Platonic Idea'' is left." (''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. I, § 80)

The '''''Assumption of the Virgin''''' or '''''Frari Assumption''''' is a large [[altarpiece]] [[panel painting]] in oils by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Titian]], painted in 1515–18.  It remains in the position it was designed for, on the high altar of the [[Frari|Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] or Frari church in [[Venice]].  It is the largest [[altarpiece]] in the city, with the figures well over life-size, necessitated by the large church, with a considerable distance between the altar and the congregation.

It marked a new direction in Titian's style, that reflected his awareness of the developments in [[High Renaissance]] painting further south, in [[Florence]] and Rome,  by artists including [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]].  The agitated figures of the Apostles marked a break with the usual meditative stillness of saints in Venetian painting, in the tradition of [[Giovanni Bellini]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 149-151; Hale, 158; Rosand, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

It was perhaps originally rather shocking for the Venetian public, but soon recognised as a masterpiece that confirmed Titian's position as the leading artist in Venice, and one of the most important in all Italy, a rival to Michelangelo and Raphael.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 15, 73; Hale, 157-158: Steer, 94, 96, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==
The [[Assumption of Mary]] was a Catholic doctrine that remained optional in the early 16th century; it was not declared an [[article of faith]] [[Munificentissimus Deus|until 1950]].  The [[Franciscan order]] whose church the Frari is, were always keen promoters of this and other aspects of [[Marian theology]], in particular the related doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception of Mary]], then still a matter of live controversy.  The doctrine held that the body of the [[Virgin Mary]] was "assumed"  or moved physically into heaven "at the end of her earthly life".  Most Catholics believed that this took place after a normal death (usually three days after in tradition), but some that Mary was still alive when it happened, a question that [[Munificentissimus Deus]] in 1950 was careful not to settle.  At the base of the picture, glimpses of Mary's stone sarcophagus can be discreetly seen, allowing those believing in an assumption before death to ignore it or regard it as something else.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 158; Rosand, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad composition of Titian's painting, with a group of apostles below a rising Mary, shown as alive, who moves towards a group of angels in heaven, follows earlier depictions in art, though such an imagined scene did not form part of the doctrine.  The related scene of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] in heaven had tended to be replaced by scenes showing the moment of the actual assumption, as here, which was often combined with it.  Here the angel accompanying [[God the Father]] on the right holds out a crown, which he is about to place on her head.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 34-35; Hale, 158-159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The figures are in three zones, divided by spaces filled only with light.  On the ground are the [[Apostles]], tightly packed in a group and in a variety of dramatic poses, most looking up at the unprecedented sight of the [[Virgin Mary]] rising to heaven. They are shown in a variety of poses, ranging from gazing in awe, to kneeling and reaching for the skies, "monumental figures ... massed in collective movement, united with shadow, heroic gestures are given a silhouette of unprecedented boldness".&lt;ref name="Penny 201"&gt;Penny, 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centre zone, the [[Virgin Mary]] stands on clouds, wrapped in a red robe and blue mantle, and also makes a gesture of astonishment.  Around her "throngs of angels are melted into clouds irradiated by heavenly light".&lt;ref name="Penny 201"/&gt;  Above is [[God the Father in art|God the Father]], who is about to be handed a crown for Mary by the angel to the right (see above).

Titian broke with tradition by omitting all landscape elements, although the blue-grey sky above the apostles shows the scene is set outdoors. The sky contrasts with the golden heavenly light in the upper zones, which recalls the gold ground traditional in [[mosaic]]s such as those still being made in [[San Marco]], and the gold ground paintings of the Gothic period.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 158-159; Steer, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether there are twelve apostles, some only visible by a small area of their face. [[Saint Peter]] sits at the centre with his hands together in prayer, and Saint [[John the Evangelist]] is the younger man in red to the left of him; the others are probably not intended to be identifiable.  The painting is signed "TITIANUS" on the sarcophagus below St Peter.

==Location==
The Frari is a very large Gothic church of the early 15th-century, initially plainly built of brick, like many Franciscan churches designed for preaching to large crowds, but now filled with elaborate tombs and paintings.  Titian himself is buried there, though this is an unintended result of the chaos of the plague that killed him,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 15, 704-705, 721-722; Rosand, 57-58.  See [[Pietà (Titian)]] for the changes in his burial place.&lt;/ref&gt; with a large 19th-century monument that includes a [[relief]] version of the ''Assumption''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The high altar is a very long way from the nave, and the view of it is restricted by an elaborate stone [[choir-screen]] of 1475, with a round-headed arch in the centre, and a [[pulpit]] at each end. Immediately behind this, across about half the width of the church, is the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], with rows of choir-stalls facing each other, and a high wooden backing.  After this comes a wide but shallow area, reaching into the [[transept]]s, before the [[chancel]] in the [[apse]], which is very deep.  The rounded top of the painting allows it to be framed neatly by the choir-screen arch for a viewer standing at the central axis of the church even at the back of the nave, though from there it appears tiny.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 41-43; Hale, 157&lt;/ref&gt;  It also allows the rounded circle of heavenly light to complete the top of the composition, with no awkward corners to fill.

The high altar and its elaborate [[reredos]] framing the altarpiece was probably designed in its broad conception by Titian, to match his painting.  The detailed design and execution was probably by [[Lorenzo Bregno]]. The painting is framed by an extension of the altar in marble and gilding, which matches not only the round top of the choir-screen arch, but (in broad terms) the scrolling decoration around it.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 43-45&lt;/ref&gt;  The classical style, with large columns on either side, inevitably clashes somewhat with the Gothic style of the architecture, but efforts have been made to minimize this by aligning the levels of elements of both frame and painting with the zones of the architecture.  For example, the top of the [[cornice]] of the frame is (depending on the viewing position) broadly the same as the level of the bottom of the third tier of windows.&lt;ref name="Rosand, 41"&gt;Rosand, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Assumption of the Virgin'' was Titian's first major commission for a church in Venice, and brought his art great public attention.  Although he was at work on a huge commission for the [[Doge's Palace]], which he took until the 1530s to complete, most of his previous works were out of public view in palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 156-157&lt;/ref&gt; He painted it ''in situ'' in the church (perhaps not actually in the final location), and according to [[Carlo Ridolfi]] (1594–1658), had to deal with frequent questions from the friars over the size of the figures, which he explained by saying they were necessary for the painting to register from distance.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 157, 159; Rosand, 40; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nNxVU2khKfcC&amp;pg=PA72 Ridolfi's text], pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many painters had by this time moved to paint on canvas, Titian continued to paint his largest works on wood panels until about 1550, even while using canvas for smaller works.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 203&lt;/ref&gt;  This was painted on a series of 21 wide [[Cedar wood|cedar]] planks, 3&amp;nbsp;cm thick,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 157&lt;/ref&gt; placed horizontally, which can be easily detected when viewing the front of the painting.

Unusually, the public unveiling on 19 May 1518 (a public holiday, chosen to allow a big attendance) was noted by the diarist [[Marino Sanuto the Younger]], though with little detail.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 161; Rosand, 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;  The story recorded over a century later by Ridolfi, that the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s ambassador was present at the unveiling ceremony and asked the Franciscans, who were doubtful about the painting's quality, to buy it, so persuading them that it was worth keeping, does not seem to be true as the ambassador was not in Venice at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 159-160; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nNxVU2khKfcC&amp;pg=PA72 Ridolfi's text], pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there does seem to have been initial hesitation among viewers, if [[Lodovico Dolce]] (1508/10–1568), writing some decades later, is to be believed, though his account is rather cast into doubt by his placing the painting several years earlier than it was actually painted.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 159&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "the oafish painters and the foolish masses, who until then had seen nothing but the dead and cold works of Giovanni Bellini, of [[Gentile Bellini|Gentili]], and of [[Bartolomeo Vivarini|Vivarino]] .... which were without movement or modelling, grossly defamed that picture. Then, as envy cooled and the truth slowly dawned on them, people began to marvel at the new style established in Venice by Titian."&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 40&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Giuseppe Borsato - Commemoration of Canova in the Scuola Grande della Carità - WGA02480.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''Assumption'' in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Accademia]] in 1822]] 
The placement of the painting over an altar attracted candle grease, and even by the time that [[Vasari]] saw it some decades later it was dark and hard to see. Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in 1752 described it as "most terribly dark but nobly painted",&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 160, quoting Reynolds; Rosand, 41&lt;/ref&gt; despite two new windows having been added at the side in 1650 to give the painting more light.&lt;ref name="Rosand, 41"/&gt;

In 1817, it was moved to the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Accademia]], returning to its original place at the Frari in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand, 38&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceiling of the gallery had to be raised to accommodate it, and at the opening ceremony in 1822, Canova described it as the greatest painting in the world.&lt;ref name="Hale, 160"&gt;Hale, 160&lt;/ref&gt;  Viewing the painting while housed in the Accademia, the young [[Oscar Wilde]] remarked that ''The Assumption'' was "certainly the best picture in Italy."&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Merlin, ed. ''Oscar Wilde: A Life in Letters''. Fourth Estate: London and New York (2010). (unpaginated) Letter to Lady Wilde, 24 June 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nicholas Penny]], this "must surely have been the painting by Titian that most influenced" [[Tintoretto]], who may have worked briefly in Titian's studio some years later.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is now cleaned and helped by artificial lighting,&lt;ref name="Hale, 160"/&gt; but (as Titian planned for) can only be seen by the public from an unusually distant point, as the apse is roped off.

==Style==
[[File:Transfigurazione (Raffaello) September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'' by [[Raphael]], 1517&amp;ndash;20, with which Titian's painting is often compared.]]
The painting is frequently compared to the ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'' by [[Raphael]] (now [[Vatican Museums#Pinacoteca Vaticana|Vatican Pinacoteca]]), whose period of execution overlapped with Titian's, beginning slightly later, probably in 1517, and soon ending after the artist's death in 1520.  The compositions have obvious similarities, with an isolated main figure in the air, and below, a crowd of agitated followers who are not fully lit.&lt;ref&gt;Steer begins his history of Venetian painting with this comparison, 7-10; Freedburg, 151&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Steer (art historian)|John Steer]] notes that "Both paintings are, of course, in the grand manner: heroic in scale and conception. A vocabulary of forceful movements and large gestures conveys the sense of morally exalted persons engaged in great events. ... Form and content are one, and both works have that internal balance and organic unity of parts which makes the [[High Renaissance]] a normative period in the history of European art."&lt;ref&gt;Steer, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between them show in their treatment of form: "Each of Raphael's figures is thought of as a separate unit, and brought together they are like group sculpture. Even when only a small part of the body is showing ... the rest of the body is implied, because Raphael's space is so clearly constructed that it creates a vacuum which the figure must be conceived as filling."&lt;ref name="Steer 8"&gt;Steer, 8&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, "In the ''Assumption'', the group of Apostles, silhouetted against the sky, is created, by strong cross illumination, from patches of light and shade. So strong is this pattern that when our attention is not deliberately concentrated, the forms are partly lost in it, and it is only by conscious effort that we attach the gesticulating limbs to individual bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Steer, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

For Raphael "form is primary, and colour, light and shadow are only additional elements, added to it. For Titian, on the other hand, light and shade are the revealers of form, and colour the substance from which it is made."&lt;ref name="Steer 8"/&gt;

[[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|S.J. Freedburg]] describes the painting as "the first challenge that was adequate to the whole range of artistic resource Titian had by now acquired", and a return to the "passion and force of statement" of Titian's earliest period, "before his partial subjugation to [[Giorgione]]".&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 149&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared to Raphael's ''Transfiguration'', which "points a way that leads beyond the sphere of classical style, towards the still greater intellectual abstraction and complexity of [[Mannerism]]", Titian "points to the possibility of [[baroque]]; but it is Titian's option to realize it, and he does not."&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Rostand titles it as an ''[[Immaculate Conception]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Aïcha Aminata Laïla Fofana''' (1957 – 10 August 2003) was a Malian translator and author. With ''Mariage: on copie'' (1994), she became the first woman in [[Mali]] to publish a novel.&lt;ref name="Boyd-BuggsScott2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyd-Buggs|first1=Debra|last2=Scott|first2=Joyce Hope|title=Camel Tracks: Critical Perspectives on Sahelian Literatures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OU5smBgGku0C&amp;pg=PA271|year=2003|publisher=Africa World Press|isbn=978-0-86543-757-9|pages=271–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/FofanaAichaEng.html|title=Aïcha Fofana|publisher=University of Western Australia|accessdate=4 February 2016|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A women's rights activist, her writings are aimed at improving the social conditions for women in Mali.&lt;ref name="ImperatoImperato2008"/&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Bamako]], Mali, in 1957, Aïcha Fofana was the daughter of Bénitiéni Fofana (1928–1991), who served as Mali's Minister of Health. After her primary school education in Bamako and in [[Bordeaux]], France, she attended the Lycée Notre-Dame in [[Niger]]. She went on to study languages, first at the [[Sorbonne]], then at the [[University of Mannheim]], Germany, and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. With her command of French, German and English, she subsequently worked as a translator and interpreter.&lt;ref name="Boyd-BuggsScott2003"/&gt;

Her first novel ''Mariage: on copie'' probes the conventional views of Malian women, telling the story of four of them who experience different problems owing to their varied ethnic backgrounds and status. By describing how the women resolve their marital problems, the novel sets out to show that Malian society is moving in the right direction.&lt;ref name="Boyd-BuggsScott2003"/&gt; Her second novel ''La fourmilière'' (The Anthill) was published posthumously in 2006.&lt;ref name="ImperatoImperato2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Imperato|first1=Pascal James|last2=Imperato|first2=Gavin H.|title=Historical Dictionary of Mali|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zf6xAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6402-3|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brings out the difficulties of Malian society as represented by the life of a large family. Her title is inspired by social structures which can be compared to those of a colony of ants.&lt;ref name=volet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motspluriels.arts.uwa.edu.au/MP1299fofana.html|title=A l'ecoute d'Aïcha Fofana: Un entretien avec Aïcha Fofana, romancière et femme de théâtre|author=Volet, Jean-Marie|publisher=University of Western Australia|date=July 1999|accessdate=4 February 2016 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the time taken to have books published, Fofana decided to turn to the theatre where she could rely on communicating her ideas much more quickly. In April 1997, her first play ''Excellence on fait le ménage'' was presented at Bamako's Cultural Centre. As it was critical of political corruption, it caused quite a stir, both among the actors and those who came to see it.&lt;ref name=volet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/Fofanaexcellence.html|title=Excellence on fait le ménage|publisher=University of Western Australia|accessdate=4 February 2016 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second play, ''L'Africaine de Paris no 2'', presented the following year, tells the story of a Malian who marries a local woman only to discover that his first wife, also an African whom he married in Paris, comes to claim him as her husband, upsetting the family environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/Fofanaafricaine.html|title=L'Africaine de Paris no 2|publisher=University of Western Australia|date=12 August 1998|accessdate=4 February 2016 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fofana is also remembered as a courageous advocate of women's rights. In 1998, she was a founding member of the [[Association Malienne des Droits de l'Homme|Malian Association of Human Rights]]. Her writings are often centred on improving social conditions for African women.&lt;ref name="ImperatoImperato2008"/&gt;

Aïcha Fofana died unexpectedly in Bamako on 16 August 2003.&lt;ref name="ImperatoImperato2008"/&gt;

{{Emotion}}
In conventional usage, '''boredom''' is an [[emotion]]al and occasionally [[psychology|psychological]] state experienced when an individual is left without anything in particular to do, is not interested in his or her surroundings, or feels that a day or period is dull or tedious. It is also understood by scholars as a modern phenomenon which has a cultural dimension. "There is no universally accepted definition of boredom. But whatever it is, researchers argue, it is not simply another name for depression or apathy. It seems to be a specific mental state that people find unpleasant—a lack of stimulation that leaves them craving relief, with a host of behavioural, medical and social consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-boredom-is-anything-but-boring/|title=Why Boredom Is Anything but Boring|first=Maggie Koerth-Baker,Nature|last=magazine|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608101457/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-boredom-is-anything-but-boring/|archivedate=8 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to BBC  News, boredom "...can be a dangerous and disruptive state of mind that damages your health"; yet research "...suggest[s] that without boredom we couldn't achieve our creative feats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141218-why-boredom-is-good-for-you|title=Psychology: Why boredom is bad... and good for you|first=David|last=Robson|date=|website=bbc.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824121704/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141218-why-boredom-is-good-for-you|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Experience Without Qualities: Boredom and Modernity'', Elizabeth Goodstein traces the modern discourse on boredom through literary, philosophical, and sociological texts to find that as "a discursively articulated phenomenon...boredom is at once objective and subjective, emotion and intellectualization — not just a response to the modern world but also a historically constituted strategy for coping with its discontents."&lt;ref&gt;Goodstein, Elizabeth S. 2005. Experience Without Qualities: Boredom and Modernity. Stanford: Stanford University Press. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In both conceptions, boredom has to do fundamentally with an experience of time and problems of meaning.

==Etymology and terminology==
The expression ''to be a bore'' had been used in print in the sense of "to be tiresome or dull" since 1768 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=b&amp;p=27 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213061635/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=b&amp;p=27 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "boredom" means "state of being bored," 1852, from bore (v.1) + -dom. It also has been employed in a sense "bores as a class" (1883) and "practice of being a bore" (1864, a sense properly belonging to boreism, 1833).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=boredom |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-12-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163157/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=boredom |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "bore" as a noun meaning a "thing which causes ennui or annoyance" is attested to since 1778; "of persons by 1812". The noun "bore" comes from the verb "bore", which had the meaning "[to] be tiresome or dull" first attested [in] 1768, a vogue word c. 1780-81 according to Grose (1785); possibly a figurative extension of "to move forward slowly and persistently, as a [hole-] boring tool does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=bore |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-12-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222150953/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=bore |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term for boredom, '''''ennui''''', is sometimes used in English as well, at least since 1778. The term ''ennui'' was first used "as a French word in English;" in the 1660s and it was "nativized by 1758".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|title=ennui - Origin and meaning of ennui by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216052339/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ennui'' comes "from French ennui, from Old French enui "annoyance" (13c.), [a] back-formation from enoiier, anuier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|title=ennui - Origin and meaning of ennui by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216052339/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The German word for "boredom" expresses this: ''[[wikt:Langeweile|Langeweile]]'', a compound made of ''lange'' "long" and ''Weile'' "while", which is in line with the common perception that when one is bored, time passes "tortuously" slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us|title=News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's US edition|author=|date=|website=the Guardian|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425213521/https://www.theguardian.com/us|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different scholars use different definitions of ''boredom'', which complicates research.&lt;ref&gt;Vodanovich, Stephen J.  (November 2003) "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2f48/fb5444550d14c5b4a09e5a54d2a312221233.pdf Psychometric Measures of Boredom: A Review of the Literature]"  ''The Journal of Psychology''. '''137''':6 p. 569  "Indeed, a shortcoming of the boredom literature is the absence of a coherent, universally accepted definition. The lack of an agreed-upon definition of boredom has limited the measurement of the construct and partly accounts for the existence of diverse approaches to assessing various subsets of boredom."&lt;/ref&gt;  Boredom has been defined by Cynthia D. Fisher in terms of its main central [[psychological]] processes: "an unpleasant, transient [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] state in which the individual feels a pervasive lack of [[interest (emotion)|interest]] and difficulty concentrating on the current activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1993|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Leary]] et al. describe boredom as "an affective experience associated with cognitive attentional processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.5.968 |author1=Leary, M.

There are three types of boredom, all of which involve problems of engagement of [[attention]]. These include times when we are prevented from engaging in wanted activity, when we are forced to engage in unwanted activity, or when we are simply unable for no apparent reason to maintain engagement in any activity or spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2005.11.009 |author1=Cheyne, J.

[[Absent-mindedness]] is where a person shows inattentive or forgetful behaviour.&lt;ref name=ODam&gt;{{cite web|title=absent-minded|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/absent-minded|publisher=Oxford dictionaries|accessdate=5 August 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908132137/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/absent-minded|archivedate=8 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Absent-mindedness is a mental condition in which the subject experiences low levels of [[attention]] and frequent distraction. Absent-mindedness is not a diagnosed condition but rather a symptom of boredom and sleepiness which people experience in their daily lives. When suffering from absent-mindedness, people tend to show signs of memory lapse and weak recollection of recently occurring events. This can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians such as [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. In addition to absent-mindedness leading to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can have as more severe, long-term problems.

==Physical health==
[[Lethargy]] is a state of tiredness, weariness, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or lack of energy. It can be accompanied by depression, decreased motivation, or apathy. Lethargy can be a normal response to boredom, inadequate sleep, overexertion, overworking, stress, lack of exercise, or a symptom of a disorder. When part of a normal response, lethargy often resolves with rest, adequate sleep, decreased stress, and good nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/symptom/lethargy|title=Lethargy: Causes, Symptoms and Diagnosis|author=|date=|website=www.healthline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121080553/https://www.healthline.com/symptom/lethargy|archivedate=21 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall J.

==Philosophy==
Boredom is a condition characterized by [[perception]] of one's environment as dull, tedious, and lacking in [[stimulation]].  This can result from leisure and a lack of aesthetic interests.  [[Labour economics|Labor]] and [[art]] may be alienated and passive, or immersed in tedium. There is an inherent [[anxiety]] in boredom; people will expend considerable effort to prevent or remedy it, yet in many circumstances, it is accepted as suffering to be endured. Common passive ways to escape boredom are to sleep or to think creative thoughts ([[daydream]]).  Typical active solutions consist in an intentional activity of some sort, often something new, as familiarity and [[wikt:repetition|repetition]] lead to the tedious.

During the [[fin de siècle]], the French term for the end of the 19th century in the West, some of the cultural hallmarks included "ennui", [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], [[pessimism]], and "...a widespread belief that civilization leads to [[decadence]]."&lt;ref&gt;Meštrović, Stjepan G.  ''The Coming Fin de Siecle: An Application of Durkheim's Sociology to modernity and postmodernism.'' Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge (1992 [1991]: 2). Pireddu, Nicoletta. "Primitive marks of modernity: cultural reconfigurations in the Franco-Italian fin de siècle," _Romanic Review_, 97 (3-4), 2006: 371-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boredom also plays a role in [[existentialism|existentialist]] thought. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement. Like [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom. Kierkegaard's ''[[Either/Or]]'' describes the [[rotation method]], a method used by higher level aesthetes in order to avoid boredom. The method is an essential [[hedonism|hedonistic]] aspect of the aesthetic way of life. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.

In contexts where one is confined, spatially or otherwise, boredom may be met with various religious activities, not because religion would want to associate itself with tedium, but rather, partly because boredom may be taken as the essential human condition, to which God, wisdom, or morality are the ultimate answers. It is taken in this sense by virtually all existentialist philosophers as well as by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].

[[Martin Heidegger]] wrote about boredom in two texts available in English, in the 1929/30 semester lecture course ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', and again in the essay ''What is Metaphysics?'' published in the same year. In the lecture, Heidegger included about 100 pages on boredom, probably the most extensive philosophical treatment ever of the subject. He focused on waiting at [[railway station]]s in particular as a major context of boredom.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger. ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', pp. 78–164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Søren Kierkegaard]] remarks in ''[[Either/Or]]'' that "patience cannot be depicted" visually, since there is a sense that any immediate moment of life may be fundamentally tedious.

[[Blaise Pascal]] in the ''[[Pensées]]'' discusses the human condition in saying "we seek rest in a struggle against some obstacles. And when we have overcome these, rest proves unbearable because of the boredom it produces", and later states that "only an infinite and immutable object – that is, God himself – can fill this infinite abyss."&lt;ref name="Pensées"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Pensées | url = https://books.google.com/?id=DdlNuvGMPisC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Blaise+Pascal%22 | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-87220-717-2 | last1 = Pascal| first1 =  Blaise |last2 =  Ariew| first2 =  Roger | accessdate = 2009-07-27 | publisher = Hackett Pub. Co. | location = Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without stimulus or focus, the individual is confronted with [[nothing]]ness, the meaninglessness of existence, and experiences existential [[anxiety]]. Heidegger states this idea as follows: "Profound boredom, drifting here and there in the abysses of our existence like a muffling fog, removes all things and men and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference. This boredom reveals being as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''What is Metaphysics?'' (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer used the existence of boredom in an attempt to prove the [[vanity]] of human existence, stating, "...for if life, in the desire for which our essence and existence consists, possessed in itself a positive value and real content, there would be no such thing as boredom: mere existence would fulfil and satisfy us."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, Essays and Aphorisms, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|0-14-044227-8}} (2004), p53 Full text available online: [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0140442278&amp;id=AZUe_0tOZIUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=e-esU4GaO5&amp;dq=arthur+schopenhauer+books&amp;sig=Jze2WQysljLWFYQKTr_Oh-UHsE0 Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] and other thinkers of [[critical theory]] speak of boredom as a common psychological response to industrial society, where people are required to engage in [[alienated labor]]. According to Fromm, boredom is "perhaps the most important source of aggression and destructiveness today." For Fromm, the search for thrills and novelty that characterizes consumer culture are not solutions to boredom, but mere distractions from boredom which, he argues, continues unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], [http://www.erich-fromm.de/data/pdf/1972c-e.pdf "Theory of Aggression"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513020501/http://www.erich-fromm.de/data/pdf/1972c-e.pdf |date=May 13, 2011 }} pg.7&lt;/ref&gt; Above and beyond taste and character, the universal case of boredom consists in any instance of ''waiting'', as Heidegger noted, such as in line, for someone else to arrive or finish a task, or while one is travelling somewhere. The automobile requires fast reflexes, making its operator busy and hence, perhaps for other reasons as well, making the ride more tedious despite being over sooner. 

Interestingly, in some [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] languages such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]], boredom and loneliness are represented by the same word (isizungu). This adds a new dimension to the oft-quoted definition of [[Ubuntu philosophy|ubuntu]]: "A person is a person through other people".

Although it has not been widely studied, research on boredom suggests that boredom is a major factor impacting diverse areas of a person's life. People ranked low on a boredom-proneness scale were found to have better performance in a wide variety of aspects of their lives, including career, education, and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Watt, J. D. |author2=Vodanovich, S. J. |title=Boredom Proneness and Psychosocial Development |journal=Journal of Psychology |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=149–155 |year=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200001)56:1&lt;149::AID-JCLP14&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom can be a symptom of [[clinical depression]]. Boredom can be a form of [[learned helplessness]], a phenomenon closely related to depression. Some philosophies of [[parenting]] propose that if children are raised in an environment devoid of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and are not allowed or encouraged to interact with their environment, they will fail to develop the mental capacities to do so.

In a learning environment, a common cause of boredom is lack of understanding; for instance, if one is not following or connecting to the material in a class or lecture, it will usually seem boring. However, the opposite can also be true; something that is too easily understood, simple or transparent, can also be boring. Boredom is often inversely related to [[learning]], and in school it may be a sign that a student is not challenged enough, or too challenged. An activity that is predictable to the students is likely to bore them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED397840 Ed.gov] – R.V. Small et al.  ''Dimensions of Interest and Boredom in Instructional Situations'', Proceedings of Selected Research and Development Presentations at the 1996 National Convention of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (18th, Indianapolis, IN), (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 study indicated that an individual's impression of boredom may be influenced by the individual's degree of [[attention]], as a higher acoustic level of distraction from the environment correlated with higher reportings of boredom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Damrad-Frye| first = R|author2=Laird JD| title = The experience of boredom: the role of the self-perception of attention| year = 1989| journal = J Personality Social Psych| volume = 57| pages = 315–20| doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.315| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom has been studied as being related to [[drug abuse]] among teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iso-Ahola, Seppo E. |author2=Crowley, Edward D. |title=Adolescent Substance Abuse and Leisure Boredom |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=260–71 |year=1991 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ429375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom has been proposed as a cause of [[pathological gambling]] behavior.  A study found results consistent with the hypothesis that pathological gamblers seek stimulation to avoid states of boredom and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2466/PR0.67.5.35-42 |vauthors=Blaszczynski A, McConaghy N, Frankova A |title=Boredom proneness in pathological gambling |journal=Psychol Rep |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=35–42 |date=August 1990 |pmid=2236416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that boredom has an evolutionary basis that encourages humans to seek out new challenges. It may influence human learning and ingenuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/17142/1/The-Psychology-of-Boredom--Why-Your-Brain-Punishes-You-for-Being-Comfortable-and-Safe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325110543/http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/17142/1/The-Psychology-of-Boredom--Why-Your-Brain-Punishes-You-for-Being-Comfortable-and-Safe.html |archivedate=2015-03-25 |df= }} The Psychology of Boredom – Why Your Brain Punishes You for Being Comfortable and Safe&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent studies have suggested that boredom may have some positive effects. A low-stimulus environment may lead to increased creativity and may set the stage for a "[[eureka moment]]".&lt;ref name="MyUser_Cbc.ca_November_22_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boredom-benefits-1.3860655 |title='It's like a little trigger': The surprising benefits of boredom - Technology &amp; Science - CBC News |newspaper=Cbc.ca |date= |author= |accessdate=November 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122153029/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boredom-benefits-1.3860655 |archivedate=November 22, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
{{Main article|Boreout}}
[[Boreout]] is a [[management theory]] that posits that lack of work, boredom, and consequent lack of satisfaction are a common malaise affecting individuals working in modern organizations, especially in office-based white collar jobs. This theory was first expounded in 2007 in ''Diagnose Boreout'', a book by Peter Werder and Philippe Rothlin, two Swiss business consultants. They claim the absence of meaningful tasks, rather than the presence of stress, is many workers' chief problem.

A "[[banishment room]]" (also known as a "chasing-out-room" and a "boredom room") is a modern [[employee exit management]] strategy whereby employees are transferred to a department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened enough to quit.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Ida|title=Japanese companies using 'banishment rooms' to push employees to resign|url=http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=Japan Daily Press|date=May 30, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815050741/http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|archivedate=15 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASAHI&gt;{{cite news|title=BANISHMENT ROOM: Top companies under investigation over unfair labor practices |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |newspaper=THE ASAHI SHIMBUN |date=January 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919011307/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071 |archivedate=19 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TABUCHI&gt;{{cite news|last=TABUCHI|first=HIROKO|title=Layoffs Taboo, Japan Workers Are Sent to the Boredom Room|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 16, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822220641/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits. The legality and ethics of the practice is questionable and may be construed as [[constructive dismissal]] by the courts in some regions.

==In popular culture==
"[[Meh]]" is an [[interjection]] used as an expression of [[Indifference (emotion)|indifference]] or boredom. It may also mean "be it as it may".&lt;ref name=zimmer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/06/meh_etymology_tracing_the_yiddish_word_from_leo_rosten_to_auden_to_the_simpsons.html |title=A History of Meh, from Leo Rosten to Auden to The Simpsons |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |author=[[Benjamin Zimmer]] |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228041933/http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/06/meh_etymology_tracing_the_yiddish_word_from_leo_rosten_to_auden_to_the_simpsons.html |archivedate=February 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often regarded as a verbal shrug of the shoulders.

===Superfluous man===

[[File:Eugene Onegin illustration.jpg|thumb|250px|A superfluous man (''[[Eugene Onegin]]'') idly polishing his fingernails. Illustration by [[Elena Samokysh-Sudkovskaya]], 1908.]]
{{Main article|Superfluous man}}
The superfluous man ({{lang-ru|лишний человек}}, ''lishniy chelovek'') is an 1840s and 1850s Russian literary concept derived from the [[Byronic hero]].&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{Harvnb|Chances|2001|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege.  Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], and [[Existentialism|existential]] boredom; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, smoking, sexual intrigues, and [[duel]]s.  He is often unempathetic and carelessly distresses others with his actions.
===Existentialist fiction===
The bored [[antihero]] became prominent in early 20th century [[Existentialism|existentialist]] works such as [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' (1915),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnhart|first1=Joe E.|title=Dostoevsky's Polyphonic Talent|date=2005|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham|isbn=9780761830979|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (novel)|La Nausée]]'' (1938) ({{Language with name/for||French|''Nausea''}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asong|first1=Linus T.|title=Psychological Constructs and the Craft of African Fiction of Yesteryears: Six Studies|date=2012|publisher=Langaa Research &amp; Publishing CIG|location=Mankon|isbn=9789956727667|pages=76|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MFkDP6Lym9YC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=La+Naus%C3%A9e+anti-hero&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WvAeVfvwK4e5OJLPgIgD&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=La%20Naus%C3%A9e%20anti-hero&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111326/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MFkDP6Lym9YC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=La+Naus%C3%A9e+anti-hero&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WvAeVfvwK4e5OJLPgIgD&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=La%20Naus%C3%A9e%20anti-hero&amp;f=false|archivedate=2015-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'Étranger]]'' (1942) ({{Language with name/for||French|''The Stranger''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gargett|first1=Graham|title=Heroism and Passion in Literature: Studies in Honour of Moya Longstaffe|date=2004|publisher=Rodopi|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9789042016927|page=198|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sc6QqZCpHgYC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=l%27etranger+anti-hero&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BVY1Vev8NoLiaMfdgZgL&amp;ved=0CCIQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=l'etranger%20anti-hero&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111433/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sc6QqZCpHgYC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=l%27etranger+anti-hero&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BVY1Vev8NoLiaMfdgZgL&amp;ved=0CCIQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=l'etranger%20anti-hero&amp;f=false|archivedate=2015-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist in these works is an indecisive central character who drifts through his life and is marked by ennui, [[angst]], and [[social alienation|alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brereton|first1=Geoffery|title=A Short History of French Literature|date=1968|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grunge lit===
{{Main|Grunge lit}}
Grunge lit is an [[Australia|Australian]] [[literary genre]] of [[fiction]]al or [[Autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] writing  in the early 1990s about young adults living in an "inner cit[y]" "...world of disintegrating futures where the only relief from...boredom was through a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] pursuit of sex, violence, drugs and alcohol".&lt;ref name="leishman"/&gt; Often the central characters are disfranchised, lacking drive and determination beyond the desire to satisfy their basic needs. It was typically written by "new, young authors"&lt;ref name='leishman'&gt;Leishman, Kirsty, '[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14443059909387538 Australian Grunge Literature and the Conflict between Literary Generations]', ''Journal of Australian Studies'', 23.63 (1999), pp. 94–102&lt;/ref&gt; who examined "gritty, dirty, real existences"&lt;ref name="leishman"/&gt; of everyday characters.

'''Confucian art''' is art inspired by the writings of [[Confucius]], and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings. Confucian art originated in [[China]], then spread westwards on the [[Silk road]], southward down to [[Northern and southern China|southern China]] and then onto [[Southeast Asia]], and eastwards through [[North China|northern China]] on to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. While it still maintains a strong influence within Indonesia, Confucian influence on western art has been limited. While Confucian themes enjoyed representation in Chinese art centers, they are fewer in comparison to the number of artworks that are about or influenced by [[Taoism|Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Religious Art|last=Karetzky|first=Patricia|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2014|isbn=9780739180587|location=Lanham, MD|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements and themes ==
When Confucius was elevated to the rank of Supreme Sage and the Uncrown King (''Su Wang''), Confucian art became identified with the art of Confucius in recognition to the sage's central position in the transmission of the Chinese ancient culture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Confucianism|last=Yao|first=Xinzhong|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415515221|location=Oxon|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable elements of this art are calligraphy of Confucian writings and thoughts, often contained within [[Confucian temple]]s and [[schools]], as well as whiteware ceramics and pottery related to Confucian religious and scholarly practices. In China, [[Chinese scholar's rocks]] were part of this tradition. As most importantly the [[Korean stone art]] which continues to this day. Themes and subjects usually include the depiction of prominent Confucian figures such as statesmen, poets, and painters, among others. These are the subjects, for instance, of the paintings of [[Zhang Lu (painter)|Zhang Lu]] (1464-1538). Artworks also reflected prevailing interests during the Confucian period such as [[chess]], music, and painting in addition to the depiction of the didactic pictorial narratives of the life of Confucius and the twenty-four paragons of [[filial piety]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Confucian art is demonstrated in the Six Classics: ''[[Classic of Poetry|The Book of Odes]]'', which describes the will; the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', which describes events; ''The Book of Ritual,'' which focuses on conduct; ''[[Classic of Music|The Book of Music]]'', which is about harmony; the ''[[I Ching|Book of Changes]]'' for the concept of the [[yin and yang]]; and, [[Spring and Autumn Annals|The Spring and Autumn Annals]], which describes titles and functions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Confucian art may also be distinguished between classical early period, neo-Confucianism, and post-modern Confucian art.

== Ancient Cultivation Stories: Confucius and Ran Qiu ==

Every one of Confucius' students had his own character. Some were modest and keen to learn; some were strong and argumentative; some were cowardly and slow to improve. However, Confucius would teach each student according to his nature guiding him along the way so that he/she may become a useful and talented person.

Ran Qiu was a very talented person. He really hoped to improve his political abilities and obtain the opportunity to be promoted to become a government official after learning from Confucius.

Officials in ancient times had to understand poetry, literature, ritual, and music, only when they had a good understanding of this knowledge could they work for the people. In order to improve on these abilities to become a government official, Ran Qiu followed Confucius as his teacher and diligently studied a variety of subjects and skills.

After some time, however, Confucius found that Ran Qiu had become idle and lazy and was no longer curious to understand and discuss the principles taught in the class. Therefore, one day after the class, Confucius asked Ran Qiu the reason for this.

Ran Qiu said, "It is not that I don't like the principles that you teach. It is just because I am lacking in ability!"

In fact, Ran Qiu thought that the principles that Confucius taught were too high and were different from what he had expected them to be. Ran Qiu had only planned to learn from Confucius the abilities necessary to become a government official. Then, with the help of Confucius' reputation, he would get the chance to start his political career. But when he came to Confucius's school, he found that the principles Confucius taught seemed to be apart from society. Though the ideals were high, it was not easy to follow them in practice.

Holding such thoughts, Ran Qiu started to become lazy and felt it was useless no matter how much more he learned. In addition, Ran Qiu also attributed his poor performance in the class to his own insufficient abilities. He thought that, since he was not capable enough, he would never be able to achieve the level that Confucius was teaching, so why did he need to study carefully?

Confucius however didn't think that Ran Qiu's declining performance was due to a lack of ability. Therefore, he told Ran Qiu, "Look at those people who don't have enough ability. They usually stop and give up halfway, whereas you draw a boundary in front of yourself to restrict you from moving forward. How can you make progress that way?"

After hearing what Confucius had to say, Ran Qiu was ashamed and lowered his head. Confucius continued, "Before you fully demonstrate your ability, you should not easily give up the effort to strive forward; you shouldn't feel so desperate about yourself so easily. As long as you try your best to do everything well, you will find that you have good potential!"

After Confucius had encouraged him, Ran Qiu was again full of confidence and resumed his usual earnest learning attitude. It was after this that Ran Qiu took note of Confucius' skills as a teacher!

In 1974, the husband and wife pair of Florence Ludins-Katz and Elias Katz founded Creative Growith in their garage. Ludins-Katz was an artist and Katz was a psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hurwitz |first1=Rebecca |title=Creative Growth Center: An unwavering community in an ever-changing Oakland {{!}} The Daily Californian |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2016/10/23/creative-growth-center-unwavering-community-ever-changing-oakland/ |website=The Daily Californian |date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of Bay Area grassroots [[collectivism]] and the disability-rights movement of the 1970s, the nonprofit Creative Growth Art Center is currently run by the filmmaker and former curator, Tom di Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Buckwalter |first1=Timothy |title=Creative Growth: An interview with Tom di Maria {{!}} KQED Arts |url=https://www.kqed.org/arts/20885/creative_growth_an_interview_with_tom_di_maria |website=www.kqed.org |publisher=KQED |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond Trend - fashion show==
Beyond Trend is Creative Growth's runway extravaganza that started in 2010 as a small in-gallery showing of fashion. The 2018 show, its' largest yet, opened at the 1,250-seat Scottish Rite Center, where it was chaired by [[Paper magazine]] co-founder [[Kim Hastreiter]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] Chief Creative Officer Todd Waterbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bravo |first1=Tony |title=Creative Growth's special needs clients seize the limelight at fashion show |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/style/article/Creative-Growth-s-special-needs-clients-seize-12810750.php |website=SFChronicle.com |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Attention==

'''''Delirium''''' is a 2013 [[Ukrainian cinema|Ukrainian film]] produced and directed by [[Ihor Podolchak]], premiered in Director’s Week Competition in [[Fantasporto]] (Portugal, 2013),&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.imdb.com/list/7MM0eMKIv7Q?sort=listorian%3Aasc&amp;view=detail&amp;start=1 Fantasporto 2013 Director's Week Competition], [https://uk.imdb.com/ IMDb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424144107/http://uk.imdb.com/ |date=2013-04-24 }}. Retrieved March 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; awarded with the "First Prize"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baghdadfilmfest.com Baghdad International Film Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Baghdad]] International Film Festival (2013).

''Delirium'' is the second Podolchak feature film. The screenplay is based on the novel ''Inductor'' by Ukrainian writer Dmytro Belyansky.

==Plot==
A family asks a young psychiatrist to be their guest for a while and help look after their father who’s developed a suicidal fixation for ropes and knots among other things. It is also entirely possible that the mental health of the guest that is the real cause for concern.

==Production==
Work on the script had begun in the spring of 2008 and was completed on the eve of filming. The director's development and preparatory period were financially supported by the [[Huub Bals|Hubert Balls Foundation]] (The Netherlands). In search of locations for filming, the film group carried out a long expedition on the Carpathians and Transcarpathians of Ukraine. The first stage of filming took place from August 1 to September 15, 2008, in the suburbs of [[Lviv]] - [[Briukhovychi]] and [[Horodok, Lviv Oblast|Horodok]], the second stage was held in [[Kyiv]] in late 2009 - early 2010. In total. The shooting was conducted on a digital [[Red Digital Cinema|Red One]] camera. Almost the whole film, with the exception of the first and last scene, was shot with the help of the [[Tilt–shift photography|Tilt- Shift]] lenses, which made it possible to create a specific image with uneven focus distribution along the frame, plane and various geometric distortions of the frame content. In the scene, which was filmed in Gorodok church, an Oscar-winning ''Garmoshka'' crane &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmotechnic.kz/equipment/#7 Filmotechnik Garmoshka Crane] Retrieved July 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and a gyrostabilized panoramic head ''Flight Head''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmotechnic.kz/equipment/#2 Filmotechnik Flight Head]Retrieved July 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; of the renowned&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.kinokolo.ua/up/news.php?id=2608 Filmotechnik Awards]. Retrieved June 29, 2013{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian company ''[http://filmotechnic.com/ Filmotechnik]'' were used.

Editing, color correction, and sound design were made on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hardware and Apple software: [[Final Cut Studio]], and [[Logic Pro]]. Visual effects were made in [[Adobe After Effects]]. The sounds from the set were not used. The voices of three male characters - the Father, the Guest, the Son - was performed by the Kiev actor Vitaly Linetsky. The sound design of the film was performed by well-known Ukrainian musician and TV showman - Miroslav Kuvaldin. The final edition of the sound was made by Igor Podolchak and Igor Durych in 2011.

==Music==
The score was written and performed by [[Alexander Schetinsky]]. Initially, the director and composer planned to use the traditional musical genre [[Dies irae]], which is part of the Catholic Mass. Were written six completed instrumental parts, named according to the sections of the Latin mass: [[Dies irae]], [[Quantus tremor]], [[Mors stupebit]], [[Ingemisco]], [[Tuba mirum]], [[Lacrimosa]].

The composer limited himself to the means of the symphony orchestra and did not use any text or vocals. The music does not contain direct illustrations, and, in particular, thanks to avant-garde style techniques, paradoxically combined with names, appealing to the [[surrealism]] principles, which fully corresponded to the aesthetics of the film. However, during the work the authors decided to use only two musical parts - Mors stupebit at the beginning of the film (initial [[titles]]) and Dies irae on the final credits&lt;ref&gt;[http://society.lb.ua/culture/2013/ 02/27 / 190761_mirovaya_premera_ukrainskogo_filma.html World premiere of ''DELIRIUM], [http://lb.ua lb.ua]. Retraived on March 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the unfolding of the film, music does not sound at all. Thanks to this, the initial and final musical fragments acquired additional dramatic significance: an introduction to the "[[problematic]]" of the film (the effect of tuning on the corresponding aesthetic "wave") and a semantic generalization.

== Interpretations ==
[[File:DELIRIUM Still 1.jpg|thumb|left|230px|&lt;small&gt;Still&lt;/small&gt;]]
Like in his first film ''[[Las Meninas (film)|Las Meninas]]'', ''Deliriu'' appeals to the intricate family sagas, which appear in the novels by [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Milorad Pavic]], and [[Bruno Schulz]].
Unlike the sagas [[Luchino Visconti]] ("[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned (1969 film)]]) or [[Ingmar Bergman]] (''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''), Podol'chak avoids [[Narrative|narrative]] but everything happens outside the space-time [[Continuum hypothesis|continuum]] with a focus on psychological states. His characters are arbitrary, which is emphasized by archetypal names: Father, Mother, Daughter.

Developing the themes set in his first film ''Las Meninas'', Podolchak in ''Delirium'' somewhat modifies the "family" structure - introduces into the hermetic nightmare the "other" character - the person from the side. But this "stranger" (the main character is the Psychiatrist, a kind of heir to the narrator from''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]) shows himself not as an alien body. His invasion does not cause any changes in the "family organism". The family absorbs the "alien", turning him into a full participant of a strange game, the exit of which does not exist&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Підгороа-Ґвяздовский, Я. [http://tyzhden.ua/Publication/7469 ''Фільтр для марень''], [http://tyzhden.ua/ Український тиждень], 1 октября, 2010, Retrieved April 1, 2013{{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From the point of view of cinematic genres, more accurately subgenres, ''Delirium'' can be attributed to the so-called "stories about the house with no way out" or "stories of houses with ghosts." From the films of the first category, the closest is ''[[Singapore Sling (1990 film)|Singapore Sling]]'' and ''[[See You in Hell, My Darling]]'' by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]. From the films of the second category, you can, for comparison, recall ''[[The House on Telegraph Hill]]'' by [[Robert Wise]] and ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'' by [[Alejandro Amenábar]]. But unlike the films by Wise and Amenabar, in Podolchak's ''Delirium'' the spectator encounters the concept of "erroneous suspense" when the director seems to create an atmosphere of anxious anticipation, but these premonitions of something terrible are being destroyed by the characters' inadequate reaction on them.

[[Suspense]], performed by Podolchak, is self-destructing. It has no point of view "from the outside", there is no coordinate of "normality", relating to which the viewer is able to oppose herself/himself to screen suspense. The viewer becomes this obscurity. Thus Podolchak provokes a feeling of acute [[claustrophobia]]&lt;ref name="Купінська, А."&gt;Купінська, А. [http://life.pravda.com.ua/culture/2013/07/20/134289/ ''Сьомий день Одеського фестивалю: перші підсумки, непрості фільми Кіри Муратової та Ігоря Подольчака'']. [http://life.pravda.com.ua life.pravda.com.ua], 20.07.2013 Retrieved September 20, 2013{{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; - there is no way out from Podolchak's "home-world". The spectator, like the characters, does not know is there anything beyond the boundaries of the place where she/he is at the moment. Since "this moment" has the ability to loop, then the flight "from here" becomes simply impossible.

[[File:tree.ring.arp.jpg|thumb|The growth rings of a tree at [[Bristol Zoo]], England. Each ring represents one year; the outside rings, near the bark, are the youngest.]]
'''Dendrochronology'''  (or '''tree-ring dating''') is the [[scientific method]] of [[chronological dating|dating]] tree rings (also called growth rings) to the exact year they were formed in order to analyze atmospheric conditions during different periods in history.

Dendrochronology is useful for determining the timing of events and rates of change in the environment (most prominently climate) and also in works of art and architecture, such as old [[panel painting]]s on wood, buildings, etc. It is also used in [[radiocarbon dating]] to calibrate radiocarbon ages.&lt;ref name=Grissino&gt;{{cite|title=The Science of Tree Rings: Principles of Dendrochronology|first=Henri D.|last=Grissino-Mayer|publisher=Department of Geography, The University of Tennessee|date=n.d.|url=http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|accessdate=October 23, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104042215/http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New growth in [[tree]]s occurs in a layer of cells near the bark. A tree's growth rate changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year in response to seasonal climate changes, resulting in visible growth rings. Each ring marks a complete cycle of seasons, or one year, in the tree's life.&lt;ref name=Grissino /&gt; {{Asof|2013}}, the oldest tree-ring measurements in the Northern Hemisphere are a floating sequence extending from about 12,580 to 13,900 years.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reimer |first1=Paula J. |year=2013 |title=IntCal13 and Marine13 radiocarbon age calibration curves 0–50,000 years cal BP |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=55 |pages=1869–1887 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.55.16947 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516010345/https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |archivedate=2014-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrochronology derives from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:δένδρον|δένδρον]]}} (''{{lang|la|dendron}}''), meaning "tree", {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}} (''{{lang|la|khronos}}''), meaning "time", and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}} ''({{lang|la|[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]}}''), "the study of".

== History ==
The Greek botanist [[Theophrastus]] (ca. 371 – ca. 287 BC) first mentioned that the wood of trees has rings.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus with Arthur Hort, trans., ''Enquiry into Plants'', volume 1 (London, England: William Heinemann, 1916), Book V, [https://archive.org/stream/enquiryintoplant01theouoft#page/422/mode/2up p. 423.] From p. 423: "Moreover, the wood of the silver-fir has many layers, like an onion; there is always another beneath that which is visible, and the wood is composed of such layers throughout."

During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the scientific study of tree rings and the application of dendrochronology began.

During the first half of the 20th century, the astronomer [[A. E. Douglass]] founded the [[Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research]] at the [[University of Arizona]]. Douglass sought to better understand cycles of sunspot activity and reasoned that changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on earth, which would subsequently be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns (''i.e.'', sunspots → climate → tree rings).

[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of [[wood]] is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots, to form a growth ring.]]
Horizontal [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] cut through the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[tree]] can reveal growth rings, also referred to as ''tree rings'' or ''annual rings''. Growth rings result from new growth in the [[vascular cambium]], a layer of cells near the [[bark (botany)|bark]] that botanists classify as a [[lateral meristem]]; this growth in diameter is known as [[secondary growth]]. Visible rings result from the change in growth speed through the [[season]]s of the year; thus, critical for the title method, one ring generally marks the passage of one year in the life of the tree. Removal of the bark of the tree in a particular area may cause deformation of the rings as the plant overgrows the scar.

The rings are more visible in trees which have grown in [[temperate zone]]s, where the seasons differ more markedly. The inner portion of a growth ring forms early in the growing season, when growth is comparatively rapid (hence the wood is less dense) and is known as "early wood" (or "spring wood", or "late-spring wood"&lt;ref&gt;"Early wood" is used in preference to "spring wood", as the latter term may not correspond to that time of year in climates where early wood is formed in the early summer (e.g. [[Canada]]) or in autumn, as in some [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] species.&lt;/ref&gt;); the outer portion is the "late wood" (sometimes termed "summer wood", often being produced in the summer, though sometimes in the autumn) and is denser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv |last= Capon |first= Brian|title= Botany for Gardeners |year= 2005 |pages= 66–67 |edition= 2nd |isbn= 0-88192-655-8 |publisher= Timber Publishing|location= Portland, OR}} {{better source|date= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many trees in temperate zones produce one growth-ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. Hence, for the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record or ring pattern builds up that reflects the age of the tree and the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring, while a drought year may result in a very narrow one.

Direct reading of tree ring chronologies is a complex science, for several reasons. First, contrary to the single-ring-per-year paradigm, alternating poor and favorable conditions, such as mid-summer droughts, can result in several rings forming in a given year. In addition, particular tree-species may present "missing rings", and this influences the selection of trees for study of long time-spans. For instance, missing rings are rare in oak and [[elm]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;The only recorded instance of a missing ring in oak trees occurred in the year 1816, also known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]".{{cite web | url = http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | title= Useful Tree Species for Tree-Ring Dating | author= Lori Martinez | year= 1996 | publisher= | location= | accessdate= 2008-11-08 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081108094321/http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | archivedate= 2008-11-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical to the science, trees from the same region tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period of chronological study. Researchers can compare and match these patterns  ring-for-ring with patterns from trees which have grown at the same time in the same geographical zone (and therefore under similar climatic conditions). When one can match these tree-ring patterns across successive trees in the same locale, in overlapping fashion, chronologies can be built up—both for entire geographical regions and for sub-regions. Moreover, wood from ancient structures with known chronologies can be matched to the tree-ring data (a technique called ''cross-dating''), and the age of the wood can thereby be determined precisely. Dendrochronologists originally carried out cross-dating by visual inspection; more recently, they have harnessed computers to do the task, applying statistical techniques to assess the matching. To eliminate individual variations in tree-ring growth, dendrochronologists take the smoothed average of the tree-ring widths of multiple tree-samples to build up a '''ring history''', a process termed replication. A tree-ring history whose beginning- and end-dates are not known is called a ''floating chronology''. It can be anchored by cross-matching a section against another chronology (tree-ring history) whose dates are known.

Dendrochronological equation defines the law of growth of tree rings.
The equation was proposed by Russian biophysicist Alexandr N. Tetearing in his work "Theory of populations" &lt;ref name=Tetearing2012&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Alexandr N. Tetearing
 |title=Theory of populations |year=2012 |page=583 |isbn=978-1-365-56080-4 |publisher=SSO Foundation |location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = \frac{1}{k_v\, \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}}} \, \frac{d\big(M^{\tfrac{1}{3}}(t)\big)}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Delta L&lt;/math&gt; is width of annual ring, &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is time (in years), &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is density of wood, &lt;math&gt; k_v &lt;/math&gt; is some coefficient, &lt;math&gt; M(t) &lt;/math&gt; is function of mass growth of the tree.

With the neglection of natural sinusoidal oscillations in tree mass,
the formula of the changes in the annual ring width is:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = -\dfrac{ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t} }{3 k_v \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}} (c_4+ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t})^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

There &lt;math&gt; c_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c_2 &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c_4 &lt;/math&gt; are some coefficients, &lt;math&gt; a_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a_2 &lt;/math&gt; are positive constants.

The formula is useful for correct approximation of samples data before data normalization procedure.

The typical forms of the function &lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) &lt;/math&gt; of annual growth of wood ring are  shown in the figures.

== Sampling and dating ==
Dendrochronology makes available specimens of once-living material accurately dated to a specific year.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004&gt;{{cite book |author1=Renfrew Colin |author2=Bahn Paul |title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice |edition=4th |year=2004 |pages=144–5 |isbn=0-500-28441-5 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dates are often represented as estimated calendar years [[before present|B.P.]], for before present, where "present" refers to 1 January 1950.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

Timber core samples are sampled and used to measure the width of annual growth rings; by taking samples from different sites within a particular region, researchers can build a comprehensive historical sequence. The techniques of dendrochronology are more consistent in areas where trees grew in marginal conditions such as aridity or semi-aridity where the ring growth is more sensitive to the environment, rather than in humid areas where tree-ring growth is more uniform (complacent). In addition, some genera of trees are more suitable than others for this type of analysis. For instance, the [[bristlecone pine]] is exceptionally long-lived and slow growing, and has been used extensively for chronologies; still-living and dead specimens of this species provide tree-ring patterns going back thousands of years, in some regions more than 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |title=Bibliography of Dendrochronology |publisher=ETH Forest Snow and Landscape Research |location=Switzerland |accessdate=2010-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804005355/http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}{{specify|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the maximum span for fully anchored chronology is a little over 11,000 years B.P.

Dendrochronology practice faces many obstacles, including the existence of [[species]] of [[ant]]s that inhabit [[tree]]s and extend their galleries into the wood, thus destroying ring structure.

== Reference sequences ==
European chronologies derived from wooden structures initially found it difficult to bridge the gap in the 14th century when there was a building hiatus, which coincided with the [[Black Death]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there do exist unbroken chronologies dating back to prehistoric times, for example the Danish chronology dating back to 352 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skalk.dk/Sider/0003wm.html |website=skalk.dk |title=WM Trædatering |language=da |trans-title=WM Tree dating |accessdate=15 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221121805/http://www.skalk.dk/Sider/0003wm.html |archivedate=21 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a sample of wood, the variation of the tree-ring growths provides not only a match by year, it can also match location because the climate across a continent is not consistent. This makes it possible to determine the source of ships as well as smaller artifacts made from wood but which were transported long distances, such as panels for paintings and ship timbers.

== Applications ==

=== Radiocarbon dating calibration ===
Dates from dendrochronology can be used as a [[calibration]] and check of [[radiocarbon dating]]&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

=== Climatology ===
{{Main|dendroclimatology}}

[[Dendroclimatology]] is the science of determining past [[climate]]s from [[tree]]s primarily from the properties of the annual tree rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/~sheppard/Raul/DendroclimatologyReview.pdf |title=Dendroclimatology: extracting climate from trees |first=Paul R. |last=Sheppard |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.]] |journal=WIREs Clim Change  |year=May-June 2010 |volume=1 |page=343-352 |format=PDF |access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum [[latewood]] density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.

=== Art history ===
[[File:Mary Queen of Scots portrait.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Mary Queen of Scots, determined to date from the 16th century by dendrochronology.]]

Dendrochronology has become important to art historians in the dating of [[panel painting]]s. However, unlike analysis of samples from buildings, which are typically sent to a laboratory, wooden supports for paintings usually have to be measured in a museum conservation department, which places limitations on the techniques that can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf English Heritage Guide to Dendrochronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063338/http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to dating, dendrochronology can also provide information as to the source of the panel. Many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s have turned out to be painted on panels of "Baltic oak" shipped from the [[Vistula]] region via ports of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Oak panels were used in a number of northern countries such as England, France and Germany. Wooden supports other than oak were rarely used by Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref&gt;Spronk, Ron, ''More than Meets the Eye: An Introduction to Technical Examination of Early Netherlandish Paintings at the Fogg Art Museum'', Harvard University Art Museums Bulletin, Vol. 5, No. 1, Autumn, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Since panels of seasoned wood were used, an uncertain number of years has to be allowed for seasoning when estimating dates.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ian Kuniholm, [http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf ''Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017230735/http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }} Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; Panels were trimmed of the outer rings, and often each panel only uses a small part of the [[radius]] of the trunk. Consequently, dating studies usually result in a "[[terminus post quem]]" (earliest possible) date, and a tentative date for the actual arrival of a seasoned raw panel using assumptions as to these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=W. Stanley |last1=Taft |first2=James W. |last2=Mayer |first3=Richard |last3=Newman |first4=Peter Ian |last4=Kuniholm |first5=Dusan |last5=Stulik |title=The Science of Paintings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |year=2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98722-4 |chapter=Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings |chapterurl=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/dendro/painttex.html |pages=206–215 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422142755/https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |archivedate=2017-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of establishing numerous sequences, it was possible to date 85–90% of the 250 paintings from the 14th to 17th century analysed between 1971 and 1982;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, John, ''Panel Examination and Dendrochronology'' The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal, Vol. 10, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; by now a much greater number have been analysed.

A portrait of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] was believed to be an 18th-century copy. However, dendrochronology revealed that the wood dated from the second half of the 16th century. It is now regarded as an original 16th-century painting by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots#dendro National Portrait gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017160354/http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, dendrochronology was applied to four paintings depicting the same subject, that of [[Cleansing of the Temple|Christ expelling the money-lenders from the Temple]]. The results showed that the age of the wood was too late for any of them to have been painted by [[Hieronymus Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 Tree Rings, the barcodes of Nature illuminate art history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043013/http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 |date=2013-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While dendrochronology has become an important tool for dating oak panels, it is not effective in dating the poplar panels often used by Italian painters because of the erratic growth rings in poplar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology National Portrait Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017120656/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century saw a gradual replacement of wooden panels by canvas as the support for paintings, which means the technique is less often applicable to later paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty Conservation Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123200401/http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ |date=2013-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many panel paintings were transferred onto canvas or other supports during the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Building history ===
The dating of buildings with wooden structures and components has also been done by using dendrochronology. While archaeologists can date wood and when it was felled, it may be difficult to definitively determine the age of a building or structure in which the wood was used; the wood could have been reused from an older structure, may have been felled and left for many years before use, or could have been used to replace a damaged piece of wood. The dating of building via dendrochronology thus requires knowledge of the history of building technology.&lt;ref name=sawyer1993&gt;{{cite book |title= Medieval Scandinavia: from conversion to Reformation, circa 800–1500 |first1= Peter |last1= Sawyer |authorlink1= Peter Sawyer (historian) |first2= Birgit |last2= Sawyer |publisher= [[University of Minnesota Press]] |series= The Nordic Series |volume= 17 |year= 1993 |page= 6 |isbn= 978-0-8166-1739-5 |oclc= 489584487 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518110748/https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate= 2015-05-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] in Dedham, Massachusetts. While the house had long been claimed to have been built circa 1640 (and being the oldest wood-framed house in North America), core samples of wood taken from a summer beam confirmed the wood was from an oak tree felled in 1637–8. An additional sample from another beam yielded a date of 1641, thus confirming the house had been constructed starting in 1638 and finished sometime after 1641 as wood was not seasoned before use in building at that time in New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Grand House in 17th-Century New England|url=http://www.fairbankshouse.org/the_house.html|publisher=Fairbanks House Historical Site|accessdate=May 27, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316053504/http://www.fairbankshouse.org/the_house.html|archivedate=March 16, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related chronologies ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Similar seasonal patterns also occur in [[ice core]]s and in [[varve]]s (layers of [[sediment]] deposition in a lake, river, or sea bed). The deposition pattern in the core will vary for a frozen-over lake versus an ice-free lake, and with the fineness of the sediment.

Some columnar [[cactus]] also exhibit similar seasonal patterns in the isotopes of carbon and oxygen in their spines ([[acanthochronology]]). These are used for dating in a manner similar to dendrochronology, and such techniques are used in combination with dendrochronology, to plug gaps and to extend the range of the seasonal data available to archaeologists and [[paleoclimatologist]]s.

A similar technique is used to [[Estimating the age of fish|estimate the age of fish]] stocks through the analysis of growth rings in the [[otolith]] bones.

A '''dream diary''' (or '''dream journal''') is a [[diary]] in which dream experiences are recorded. A [[dream]] diary might include a record of nightly dreams, personal reflections and [[waking dream]] experiences. It is often used in the study of dreams and [[psychology]]. Dream diaries are also used by some people as a way to help induce  [[lucid dream]]s. They are also regarded as a useful catalyst for remembering dreams. The use of a dream diary was recommended by Ann Faraday in ''The Dream Game'' as an aid to memory and a way to preserve details, many of which are otherwise rapidly forgotten no matter how memorable the dream originally seemed.&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, Ann: ''The Dream Game'', [[Harpercollins]], March 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Keeping a dream diary conditions a person to view remembering dreams as important. Dreams can be recorded in a paper diary (as text, drawings, paintings, etc.) or via an audio recording device (as narrative, music or imitations of other auditory experiences from the dream). Many websites offer the ability to create a digital dream diary.

== Lucid dreaming ==
Dream diaries are often kept by people striving to induce and remember lucid dreams. Writing down dreams increases what is called dream recall, or the ability to remember dreams. When writing down dreams, the dreamer often searches for dream signs, or recurring themes that have been detected between dreams. Dream recall can vary from day to day but keeping a diary tends to regulate waking dream memory.

It is important to record the dreams in the diary immediately after waking up, as individuals forget the details of their dreams very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Sponias - [http://www.freepsychologyarticles.com/how-to-keep-a-dream-journal-free-psychotherapy-in-your-own-dreams.html How to Keep a Dream Journal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192441/http://www.freepsychologyarticles.com/how-to-keep-a-dream-journal-free-psychotherapy-in-your-own-dreams.html |date=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing the next day's date in the dream diary asserts a conscious thought to remember dreams, which communicates intention to the subconscious mind.  The subconscious mind then responds by fulfilling that desire.  This mental action causes the conscious and subconscious minds to work together toward the common goal of remembering the dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condron|first=Barbara|title=The Dreamer's Dictionary|year=1994|publisher=SOM Publishing|location=Windyville, Missouri|isbn=0-944386-16-4|url=http://som.org/NewPages/Newsite07/SOMBar/Books/Titles/DreamersDictionary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False awakenings ===
The discipline of waking up to record a dream in a diary sometimes leads to a [[false awakening]] where the dreamer records the previous dream while still in a dream. Some dream diarists report writing down the same dream one or two times in a dream before actually waking up, and recording it in a physical dream diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/IJoDR/article/download/9085/pdf|title = False awakenings in light of the dream protoconsciousness theory: A study in lucid dreamers|last = Buzzi|first = Giorgio|date = September 2011|journal = International Journal of Dream Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific uses==
Followers of [[Eckankar]] frequently keep dream diaries, since they view dreams as important teaching tools and as a gateway to "Soul Travel," or the shifting of one's consciousness to ever-higher states of being.&lt;ref&gt;Klemp, H. (1999). ''The Art of Spiritual Dreaming''. Minneapolis, MN: [http://www.eckankar.org/dream.html Eckankar]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''''' (or simply '''''Drood''''') is a [[musical theatre|musical]] based on the unfinished [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]''.  It is written by [[Rupert Holmes]], and was the first Broadway musical with multiple endings (determined by audience vote). Holmes received [[Tony Awards]] for Best Book and Best Original Score.  The musical won five Tony Awards out of eleven nominations, including Best Musical and Best Leading Actor.

The musical debuted as part of the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] in August 1985, and, following revision, transferred to Broadway, where it ran until May 1987. Two national tours and a production in [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]] followed.  The [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] revived the musical as ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://broadwayworld.com/article/Chita-Rivera-Leads-THE-MYSTERY-OF-EDWIN-DROOD-for-Roundabout-in-2012-2013-New-Productions-Announced-20120301 |title= ''Chita Rivera Leads The Mystery of Edwin Drood for Roundabout in 2012-2013'' |accessdate=2012-05-07 |work=BroadwayWorld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Inspiration===
The musical ''Drood'' is derived from two major inspirations: [[Charles Dickens]]' final (and unfinished) [[novel]], ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', and the British [[pantomime]] and [[music hall]] traditions that reached the height of their popularity in the years following Dickens' death.

Dickens' ''Mystery'' began publication in 1870. The book, which had been written and published in episodic installments (as had most of Dickens' other novels) was left unfinished upon Dickens' sudden death from a [[stroke]] that year. The lack of resolution to the mystery (and the absence of notes that would indicate Dickens' intentions) have made ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' a literary curiosity. Almost immediately after the publication of Dickens' last episode, various authors and playwrights (including Dickens' own son) attempted to resolve the story with their own endings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/adaptations/39.html |title=''Some Early Dramatic Solutions to Dickens' Unfinished Mystery'' |accessdate=2007-09-03 |last=Allingham |first=Philip V. |work=The Victorian Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the time of the ''Drood'' musical's production, there had been several "collaborations" between the late Dickens and other novelists, numerous theatrical extrapolations of the material, and three film adaptations of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/drood/cinema.html |title= ''The Cinematic Adaptations of'' The Mystery of Edwin Drood:'' 1909, 1914, 1935, and 1993; or, Dickens Gone Hollywood'' |accessdate=2007-09-03 |last=Allingham |first= Philip V. |work=The Victorian Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneous with Dickens' writing, British pantomime styles — distinguished by the importance of [[audience participation]] and conventions like the [[principal boy]] — reached their height of popularity, just as music hall performance with its attributes of raucous, risque comedy and a distinctive style of music began to achieve prominence.

[[Rupert Holmes]], who would go on to be the major creative contributor to the musical ''Drood'', spent his early childhood in England.  At age three, he would experience theater for the first time when he was taken to a modern "panto", complete with cross-dressing lead boy and audience sing-alongs.  Some years later, as an 11-year-old boy fascinated by mystery books, Holmes first discovered the unfinished Dickens novel.  Both of those seminal experiences would go on to have a major impact on Holmes when he was first approached to write a new [[musical theatre|musical]] by impresario [[Joseph Papp]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rupertholmes.com/theatre/essdrood.html |title=''The History of'' The Mystery |accessdate=2007-09-02 |last= Holmes |first= Rupert |authorlink= Rupert Holmes |work= RupertHolmes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept===
Holmes, a well-known popular songwriter whose songs had been performed by the likes of [[Barbra Streisand]], and who had himself recorded the [[Hot 100 number-one hits of 1979 (USA)|#1]] hit [[Escape (Rupert Holmes song)|"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"]] in 1979, first became interested in writing a [[musical theatre|musical]] in 1983. Following a nightclub appearance during which Holmes performed some of his "story-songs" while sharing humorous anecdotes, Holmes received a note from Gail Merrifield, director of play development at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] (and wife of [[Joseph Papp]], the creator and head of the Festival), who had seen Holmes' performance and suggested that he write a full-length musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.rememberwenn.org/wennmoed.htm#evodrood | title=''Evolution of Drood as Musical'' |accessdate=09-02-07 | last=Freedman | first= Samuel G. | publication-date= August 28, 1985 | periodical= [[The New York Times]] | year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on his recollections of [[pantomime]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens']] novel, as well as later experiences with Victorian-style [[music hall]] performance, Holmes conceived the central premises of the show. From the Dickens work, Holmes took the central plot and most of the featured characters.  From music hall traditions, he created the lead character of "The Chairman", a sort of Master of Ceremonies and instigator of the action on stage. And from pantomime he retained the concept of the "Lead Boy" (always portrayed by a young female in male drag) and the most ground-breaking aspect of ''Drood'', audience participation.

''Drood'' is unusual in part because of Holmes' feat of writing the book, music, lyrics, and full orchestrations for the show.  Though Holmes believed no Broadway creator had done this before,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Boasberg| first= Leonard W.| publication-date= June 7, 1986 | periodical= Knight-Ridder Newspapers | title= Wowing Broadway on 1st Try | url= http://www.rememberwenn.org/wennmoed.htm#wowing | accessdate=09-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite frequent mentions of this feat in articles and reviews of the show, the practice was not entirely uncommon in the early days of musical theater. Songwriters, including [[Adolf Philipp]], were previously credited with the books to their musicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=3910 Adolf Philipp's IBDB entry]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, none of these composer/librettists had written their own orchestrations as well.

In writing the book, Holmes did not let Dickens overshadow his own intentions. Rather than imitate Dickens' writing style, which he felt would be too bleak for the kind of show he wished to write, Holmes employed the device of a "show-within-a-show."  The cast members of ''Drood'' do not specifically play Dickens' characters, but rather music hall performers who are performing as Dickens' characters.  This device allowed for a great deal of light comedy that was not originally found in Dickens' novel to be incorporated into the show, as well as several musical numbers that were unrelated to the original story.  In explaining this decision, Holmes was quoted as saying, "This is not Nicholas Nickleby set to music--it's not a Dickensian work. It's light and fun and entertaining. But I hope--I think--that Dickens would have enjoyed it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Holden| first= Stephen| publication-date= June 1985 | periodical= [[The New York Times]] | title= Dickens Characters are Set to Music | url= http://www.rememberwenn.org/wennmoed.htm#oranges | accessdate=09-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes has also pointed out that "It has the same relationship to Dickens that ''Kiss Me Kate'' does to ''The Taming of the Shrew''." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Kilian|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pantomime concept also allowed Holmes to employ a female in the lead male role, which further allowed him to write a love song designed to be sung by two sopranos.

Most inventively, Holmes employed a novel method of determining the outcome of the play: having the audience vote for an ending. At a break in the show, the audience votes on who killed Drood (if, indeed, he was killed at all), the identity of the mysterious Dick Datchery, and on which two characters will become romantically involved in the end, creating a [[happy ending]]. Since every audience differs in temperament, the outcome is theoretically unpredictable even to the actors, who must quickly tally the votes and commence with the chosen ending (although some smaller companies will "fix" the results to limit the number of possible endings). This device required extra work from Holmes, who had to write numerous short endings which covered every possible voting outcome.

==Novel/musical differences==
There are several differences between the musical and the novel. The tone of Dickens' original book was somewhat bleak (as was Dickens' style), whereas the show is considerably more lighthearted and played for comedy.  The most notable difference in characterization involves Jasper: though Dickens' character is undoubtedly repressed and troubled, he is not depicted with the full-fledged [[dissociative identity disorder|split personality]] that he appears to have in the musical. Several minor characters are omitted, and the roles of others are expanded. In the musical, Bazzard is Crisparkle's assistant, whereas in the novel he is employed by Rosa's guardian, Mr. Grewgious.  Meanwhile, in order to increase the interactivity of the play and introduce doubt as to who the murderer is, the musical omits several of the novel's clues that Jasper is the killer and introduces clues which do not appear in the novel pointing at other suspects.

==Synopsis==
{{tone|date=October 2015}}

===Act I===
Act One opens as the members of the Music Hall Royale circulate among the audience, introducing themselves to the patrons. More and more members of the company add to the growing noise, until the music begins and the Chairman of the proceedings bursts forth with the show’s opening number "There You Are". They then introduce John Jasper, the 'Jekyll and Hyde' choirmaster who greets his young nephew Edwin Drood in the song "Two Kinsmen", where they express their strong friendship. Drood is engaged to the fair Miss Rosa Bud, who is Jasper’s music pupil and the object of his mad obsession. Rosa's suspicion of his obsession is confirmed when at her next lesson, he asks her to sing a song he has written- "Moonfall"- an innuendo-heavy love song from Jasper to her. The kindly Reverend Crisparkle and two exotic emigrants from Ceylon, Helena and Neville Landless, arrive. Neville is immediately attracted to Rosa, which makes him a rival to both Edwin and the secretive Jasper.

Next the chairman brings the audience to London and the sinister opium den of the Princess Puffer who talks with the audience, and explains her life in "Wages of Sin". A sinewy ballet dance follows. We discover that one of Puffer’s regular clients is none other than Jasper himself, who cries out the name 'Rosa Bud' during a hallucination. Puffer shows great interest in this fact, and stores it away in her memory. Back in Cloisterham, Neville and Drood meet and come to odds with each other almost immediately.

Next, The Chairman is called in to play another character as that actor is unable to come, but it turned out that the scenes of his character and the scenes of Mayor Sapsea coincide- and the characters have to disagree with each other. This results in major confusion for poor Mayor Sapsea/The Chairman, and laughs for the audience. He and Jasper sing of their conflicting minds- Jasper, of course, meaning it literally- in the patter song "Both Sides Of The Coin". We are then introduced to the drunken stonemason Durdles, and his assistant Deputy. In the graveyard, they tell us that Edwin and Rosa, who have been promised to each other since they were children and so cannot tell if they truly love each other, have called off their engagement ("Perfect Strangers"). As a parting gift, Rosa gives Drood her hair clasp, which once belonged to her mother.

It is Christmas Eve and Jasper has arranged a ‘reconciliation’ dinner for the Landless twins, Crisparkle, Rosa and Drood. In the resulting song "No Good Can Come from Bad", Neville and Drood's antagonism is reinstated, Helena's and Crisparkle's worry for Neville's reputation is shown, and it is revealed that Crisparkle used to be in love with Rosa's mother, who died after Rosa's birth. Soon the party disbands and the guests depart into a violent storm. There is a short halt here, where the actor playing Bazzard soliloquizes about how he never seems to be able to get a major part in a show in the song "Never The Luck".

The next day Drood has vanished. Crisparkle’s assistant discovers Edwin’s torn coat by the river. Drood was last seen walking there with Neville the night before. Nevile is almost lynched by the townsfolk before being rescued by Crisparkle. Jasper publicly swears to track down his nephew's killer; later he visits Rosa and confesses his love for her. She is horrified and angry, and they sing "The Name Of Love And Moonfall", ending with Jasper's pursuing Rosa off-stage as the act concludes.

===Act II===
Act Two begins six months later, and still there is no sign of Drood. There is much speculation as to his fate. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Puffer has been investigating Drood's disappearance, but has also noticed a rather seedy looking figure who seems to be doing the same. It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator. They sing "Settling Up The Score". The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, "don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!", telling them to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song "Don't Quit While You're Ahead". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever.  However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is ''not'' chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in a huff.  Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing "Don't Quit While You're Ahead" to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.

Puffer finds Rosa, reveals that years before she had been Rosa's nanny and tells her backstory in the song "Garden Path To Hell"; she tells of a man she loved who made her become a prostitute to please his friends and then left her. Once she lost her looks, she found a way to earn money- selling opium. She then continues with "Puffer's Revelation" and reveals the identity of Datchery (previously chosen by the audience.) The evening's Datchery (either Bazzard, Reverend Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, or Rosa) explains in their version of the revelation song "Out On A Limerick" why they donned the costume and tracked down the killer; the girls did it mainly to disguise their gender, Neville to prove his innocence, Crisparkle to help both Neville and Helena, and Bazzard to give himself both a dramatic reveal and an important character to play. The gist of each song is that the character followed Jasper to his house and found the clasp that Rosa gave Drood, which Jasper would have had only if he had taken it from Drood. Jasper's double nature reveals itself, and he admits that he strangled his nephew while under the influence of the laudanum that he reveals he poured into the wine the night of the dinner party ("Jasper's Confession").

Durdles the gravedigger, however, disagrees; he witnessed the crime and knows who truly killed Edwin Drood. Depending on the audience's vote, the finger is pointed at Bazzard, Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, Puffer, Rosa or Durdles. The murderer confesses, then sings a reprise of one of several numbers, beginning with "A Man Could Go Quite Mad", to admit his or her culpability; the gist of each of these songs is that the character who killed Drood was seeking to kill ''Jasper'', not Drood, for his or her own purpose- Puffer to protect Rosa, Rosa to save herself, Helena to get revenge on Jasper for ruining her twin's chance at a new beginning, Bazzard to bring himself into the limelight, Neville because he wanted Rosa for himself, and Crisparkle because he killed Rosa's mother out of jealousy and religious mania and wanted to protect both Rosa and Neville from Jasper's evil. However, because of the storm, Jasper had walked with Drood for a while and then given him his coat to wear for the journey home, so the murderer, because of the laudanum in the wine and the foul night weather, mistook Drood for Jasper. (Durdles lacks this motivation, however, so his confession is simply that, in his drunkenness, he mistook Drood for a ghost.) If, although not likely, the audience chooses Jasper as the murderer, Durdles does not interrupt and a second confession is not performed (Some theaters will not count Jasper votes, to make sure that there is a twist).

Still, a happy ending is needed, and the Chairman asks the audience to choose two lovers from among the remaining cast members. The two chosen members declare their love, and then reprise "Perfect Strangers". Just then, there comes a noise from the crypt, and a very-much-alive Edwin Drood appears, ready to tell all what really happened on the night of his disappearance ("The Writing On The Wall"). What happened was that when Drood was attacked, he was only stunned when he fell and not killed. Jasper dragged him to a crypt where he left him. When Drood woke, he escaped and fled from Cloisterham, only returning so that he could find out who wanted him dead. He sings to the audience, eventually joined by the rest of the cast, imploring them to hold on to life for as long as they possibly can and telling them that 'holding on to life is all.' The mystery is solved, and the show concludes as the cast sings to the audience to read the writing on the wall.

===Murderers===
'''John Jasper'''- Jasper was madly in love with Rosa Bud, and his violent split personality gladly killed Drood. His confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "Moonfall". Jasper's confession is performed no matter who is chosen as the murderer, and the audience is discouraged from voting for him since he is the obvious solution.  &lt;br&gt; 
'''Rosa Bud'''- Meant to kill Jasper in revenge for his lustful advances and also due to her own mental instability caused by Jasper's persecution, but killed Drood by accident as Drood was wearing Jasper's coat. Her confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "No Good Can Come From Bad" &lt;br&gt;
'''Neville Landless'''- Humiliated by Drood, Neville murdered him in order to regain his pride and also to have a chance with Rosa Bud. His confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "No Good Can Come From Bad" in the original Broadway production, later changed to "A British Subject" &lt;br&gt;
'''Helena Landless'''- Knowing her brother's hot temper, Helena murdered Drood so Neville would not be tempted to seek revenge. Her confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "No Good Can Come From Bad" in the original Broadway production, later changed to "A British Subject"  &lt;br&gt;
'''Princess Puffer'''- Intended to kill Jasper in order to protect Rosa from his advances, but accidentally killed Drood because he was wearing Jasper's coat and because she was confused after having smoked opium for [[Dutch courage]]. Her confession is a reprise of "The Wages of Sin" &lt;br&gt;
'''The Rev. Mr. Crisparkle'''- Crisparkle was madly in love with Rosa's mother, and he saw Rosa as a reincarnation of her. He murdered Drood so that he could marry Rosa, thinking her to be the woman he loved. This version of Crisparkle's confession was introduced in the first national tour, and has been used in all productions since. His confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "No Good Can Come From Bad" in the original Broadway production, later changed to "A British Subject". &lt;br&gt;
'''Bazzard''' - In an effort to boost his role in the show, murders Drood.  This is definitely the most metatheatrical of the endings. His confession is a reprise of "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "Never the Luck" &lt;br&gt;
'''Durdles'''- After Jasper laid Drood in the crypt, Durdles believed the still-alive Drood to be a ghost and so smashed his head in.  (Even Durdles admits the silliness of this motive within his solo, but laments that because he has been chosen he must have one.) This solo was not used in the original Broadway production and was added for the first national tour. His confession is a reprise of "Off to the Races"

==Characters==
As ''Drood'' is [[metatheatre|metatheatrical]], the characters of the play ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' are played by actors of the "Music Hall Royale", within the production. The following are the dual roles each cast member plays. Note: The actress portraying Miss Alice Nutting/Edwin Drood also performs the role of Dick Datchery up until the Voting portion of the evening. However, as is noted in the script, this is merely a "bit" within the context of The Music Hall Royale - that Miss Nutting only portrays Datchery due to a contractual obligation for her to appear in both acts of the play. Ultimately, the audience decides who Dick Datchery is within the confines of Dickens' story.

*'''The role of Crisparkle was originally portrayed both in the readings and Delacorte production by the actor/playwright, [[Larry Shue]].''' When Shue died in a plane crash between the show's run at the Delacorte and its opening on Broadway, Rupert Holmes renamed the Music Hall Royale performer who portrayed Crisparkle from Wilfred Barking-Smythe to Cedric Moncrieffe, out of respect for Shue.

==Recordings==
[[File:Drood.jpg|thumb|200px|Original cast recording]]
In 1985, a recording was made of ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' featuring the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] cast.  This recording was released by [[Polydor]] with the additional subtitle, ''The Solve-It-Yourself Broadway Musical'' (Polydor 827969) and the CD included versions of "Out on a Limerick" by all five possible Datcherys (Rosa, Crisparkle, Bazzard, Neville, and Helena) and all six possible Murderer's Confessions (Puffer, Rosa, Bazzard, Crisparkle, Neville, and Helena), as well as an "instructional track" entitled "A Word From Your Chairman...."  The LP and cassette included only the opening-night Confession and murderer, and omitted the "lovers." A 1990 re-issue of the cast album by [[Varèse Sarabande]] (Varèse 5597) included two tracks, "Ceylon" and "Moonfall Quartet", that are on the original LP and cassette, but not on the CD. It included only Bazzard's version of "Out on a Limerick" and two Murderer Confessions (Rosa's and Puffer's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.castalbumdb.com/title.cfm?TNumber=431 |title=The Mystery of Edwin Drood |accessdate=2008-09-01 |work=Musical Cast Album Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Polydor recording was briefly available on cassette and LP, and ultimately re-released by Varèse Sarabande.  Both versions of the cast album are currently out of print, but can sometimes be found (often at a high price) through secondhand vendors or online auction sites.

An Australian cast album (GEP Records 9401) was released in 1994.  This recording did not include "Ceylon" or "Moonfall Quartet", but did include three previously unrecorded tracks: "A British Subject", "Puffer's Revelation", and "Durdles' Confession". It should be noted that the Australian cast album was performed by a largely non-professional cast and used (arguably crude) midi sequencing in lieu of a live orchestra. Two songs that were omitted from ''Drood'' before it reached Broadway, "An English Music Hall" and "Evensong," (a duet between Rosa and Crisparkle) were later recorded for the 1994 album, ''Lost In Boston''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000014U4  |title=Lost in Boston: Songs You Never Heard From |accessdate=2007-09-02 |work= Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs that never made into the Broadway or London/'88 Tour (Tams-Witmark) versions include: "When the Wicked Man Comes" (sung by a much younger Deputy), "Sapsea's Song" (a music hall ditty for Mayor Sapsea),  "I Wouldn't Say No" (a song and dance routine for Durdles) as well as "When Shall These Three Meet Again" - a group number which can be heard as underscoring throughout the show and in the murderer's confession: "But the night was far from bright..."

Holmes also re-orchestrated the production for a 19-piece orchestra led by [[Paul Gemignani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/172699-DRG-Will-Record-Broadway-Revival-of-The-Mystery-of-Edwin-Drood-on-Two-Discs |title=DRG Will Record Broadway Revival of The Mystery of Edwin Drood on Two Discs |publisher=Playbill.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714174714/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/172699-DRG-Will-Record-Broadway-Revival-of-The-Mystery-of-Edwin-Drood-on-Two-Discs |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
After Rupert Holmes wrote an initial draft that lasted three-and-a-half hours, and performed it, solo, for Joseph Papp, Gail Merrifield, and Wilford Leach, (the New York Shakespeare Festival's artistic director), Papp offered to produce the show as part of the Festival (also known as "Shakespeare in the Park"), and told Holmes that it would be immediately transferred to Broadway if it was deemed a success.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The original production of ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' premiered in [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Central Park]] at the [[Delacorte Theatre]] on August 21, 1985 after only three weeks of rehearsals. Notably, Holmes conceived most of the orchestrations himself, a rarity for a Broadway composer.

After the final Festival performance on September 1, preparations for the Broadway transfer (retaining the original cast) immediately got underway. Following a great deal of editing (the Delacorte version contained 32 original songs and was nearly three hours long)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Freedman|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatre]] on December 2, 1985.  Roughly halfway through the run, the title of the musical was officially shortened to ''Drood'' (the name it continues to be licensed under).  The show ran for 608 performances (not including 24 previews), and closed on May 16, 1987.  The Broadway production was produced by Papp and directed by Leach, with choreography by [[Graciela Daniele]].

The opening night cast of the Broadway production starred [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]], [[Cleo Laine]], John Herrera, [[Howard McGillin]], [[Patti Cohenour]], and Jana Schneider, who were all nominated for 1986 [[Tony Awards]] for their performances, as well as [[Betty Buckley]] in the title role. [[Donna Murphy]], [[Judy Kuhn]], and [[Rob Marshall]] were also members of the ensemble. (Marshall, who would later become best known as a choreographer and theater/film director, also received an early choreography credit as assistant to Daniele.)  Before the show ended its run, Murphy, who was understudy to Cleo Laine and Jana Schneider, took over the title role. Other notable replacements during the show's run included [[Alison Fraser]] (taking over for Jana Schneider), [[Paige O'Hara]] (taking over for Donna Murphy as Drood), as well as [[Loretta Swit]] and later [[Karen Morrow]], who stepped into Laine's roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4386 |title= The Mystery of Edwin Drood |accessdate=2007-09-02 |work= The Internet Broadway Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, several months after closing on Broadway, a slightly-revised version of ''Drood'', directed by Rob Marshall, began its first North America tour at the [[Kennedy Center]] Opera House in Washington, DC, with Rose, Schneider and O'Hara reprising their leads, and [[Jean Stapleton]] playing Laine's role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://www.rememberwenn.org/wennmoed.htm#kilian | title=''Drood Hits the Road Without Missing a Beat'' | accessdate=09-02-07 | last=Kilian | first= Michael | publication-date= April 15, 1988 | periodical= [[The Chicago Tribune]] | year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a break in the tour [[George Rose (actor)|George Rose]] returned to his home in the [[Dominican Republic]], and was murdered during his stay. Rose was succeeded by [[Clive Revill]]. 

The show, also enjoyed a 1987 [[West End theatre|West End]] run at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London, a second U.S. national tour,&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; a production at the [[Shaw Festival]] in [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], [[Ontario, Canada]], and numerous regional and professional and amateur theatrical productions worldwide.&lt;ref name="holmessite"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rupertholmes.com/theatre/drood.html |title=''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' |accessdate=2007-09-02 |author= Holmes, Rupert |authorlink= Rupert Holmes |work= RupertHolmes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007–08, a London revival, presented as a chamber piece and directed by [[Ted Craig]], ran at the [[Warehouse Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/19290/the-mystery-of-edwin-drood Review of the Warehouse Theatre production]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a London West End revival of the musical played at the [[Arts Theatre]] for a limited season from 18 May. The cast was headed by [[Wendi Peters]] as Princess Puffer, with Natalie Day as Edwin Drood, Daniel Robinson as John Jasper and Victoria Farley as Rosa Budd. The production was directed by Matthew Gould.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.droodwestend.com Edwin Drood | West End ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011650/http://www.droodwestend.com/ |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] presented a Broadway revival at [[Studio 54]], which opened in November 2012. The production was directed by [[Scott Ellis]], and starred [[Chita Rivera]] as Puffer, [[Stephanie J. Block]] as Drood, [[Will Chase]] as Jasper, [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as the Chairman and [[Gregg Edelmann]] as Crisparkle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/13878/The-Mystery-of-Edwin-Drood ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''] playbillvault.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinacorona.jpg|thumb|Detail of Parthenope]]
The '''Fountain of the Spinacorona''', ({{lang-it|Fontana della Spinacorona}}), vulgarly known as the ''Fontana delle Zizze'' (Fountain of the Breasts), is an ancient fountain in central [[Naples]], located against a wall of the church of [[Santa Caterina della Spina Corona, Naples|Santa Caterina della Spina Corona]].


==History==
There was likely a fountain at the site well before the 15th century, but documents attest to its reconstruction in [[1490s in art|1498]]  It was rebuilt in the mid-16th century in the present shape by commission of the viceroy Don [[Pedro Álvarez de Toledo]] using designs by [[Giovanni da Nola]]. The fountain has the heraldic symbol of [[Charles I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. 

The subject is the depiction of the [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]] (icon of Naples) who douses, with water emerging from her breasts, the flames of the volcano of [[Vesuvius]].  It is unclear why a violin is carved on the slopes of the volcano. The phrase: ''Dum Vesevi Syrena Incendia Mulcet'' (While the Mermaid softens the fire of Vesuvius) is carved into the marble. The fountain seen today is a copy by [[Achille D’Orsi]]: the original has been housed in the [[Museo di San Martino]] since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpodinapoli.it/ospitalita/monumenti/fontana-spinacorona.html Corpo di Napoli], website dedicated to sites in central Naples.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
=== Family provenance and early years ===
Frymeta Idesa Frenkel, who later changed her first name to Françoise, was born into an intellectual Jewish family in [[Piotrków Trybunalski]], a midsized prosperous industrial town in [[Congress Poland]], at that time a partially digested western province of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt;   She had a musical education, and on completing her schooling she moved to [[Leipzig]] to study with the composer [[Xaver Scharwenka]], which also gave her an opportunity to improve her German.&lt;ref name=DasBuch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://files.hanser.de/hanser/docs/20160711_216711162425-110_978-3-446-25271-4-Leseprobe.pdf|work="Leseprobe ..." (Extract from the German translation of the book as placed online by its most recent publisher.   But do '''not''' expect to find the complete text online here.)|title=Nichts, um sein Haupt zu betten|author1=Françoise Frenkel|author2=Elisabeth Edl (translation from the French language original text)|publisher=Carl Hanser Verlag München|date=2016|isbn=978-3-446-25271-4|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She then moved on to the [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] where the focus of her study - later also her life's defining passion - was French literature.&lt;ref name=FFperRFinIndy/&gt;   When not studying, she spent her time engrossed by the second hand book stalls along the quais by the river near [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], and in the second hand-book shops in the  city's left-bank quarter.&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;   In 1918, at the end of the [[First World War|war]], she returned home.   Her family were well, but the house had been emptied by invading armies.   The piano had disappeared from the living room, and in her childhood bedroom the wall hangings had been stripped, the otherwise uncovered plaster being coated with newspaper.   Worst of all, the little book collection that she had started to assemble as a child had been taken, although the homemade cabinet that had accommodated it, now emptied, retained pride of place, on the floor in the centre of her room.&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;

=== The dedicated entrepreneuse ===
She returned to Paris to complete her studies, after which she took a traineeship/job in a second hand bookshop in the [[:fr:Rue Gay-Lussac|Rue Gay-Lussac]].   She loved the work and absorbed the commercial lessons provided, deciding to set up a bookshop specialising in French books back home in [[Poland]], where Russian attempts to restore pre-war partitions had [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|been defeated]], and an [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|independent Polish state]] was re-emerging for the first time since [[History of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1764–95)#Final partition|1795]].   French culture and literature were respected and widely studied in Poland, especially in the south of the country, and she selected [[Krakow]] as an ideal location for a specialist French bookshop.   Visiting the city to research the market forced a change of plan, however, when she discovered an abundance of well stocked book shops, many of which already offered an excellent selection of French literature, old and new.   Travelling back to Paris, she interrupted her journey for an overnight stop at [[Berlin]] to visit friends.   That evening she walked with her friends along the city centre streets: lingering in front of the book shop windows she noticed a total absence of French books.   Her friends did not share her conviction that the absence of French books in Berlin shop windows represented a commercial opportunity, and the French Consul General also appeared determined to dampen her enthusiasm.   The commercial attaché at the French embassy was no more encouraging.   Four years of appalling war, accompanied by government propaganda campaigns and followed by the humiliations of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], had done nothing to encourage a love of foreign - especially French - culture.&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;    Frenkel was not to be dissuaded, however.   By this time she had acquired a husband, Simon Raichenstein,&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt; and the two began selling French books, working from the landing between floors in a private apartment in the Kleist Street.&lt;ref name=FFlautMO/&gt;   In 1921, two years after [[Sylvia Beach]] had opened [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|"Shakespeare and Company"]], the first bookstore dedicated to English language literature in [[Paris]]&lt;ref name=FFlautDLR&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/francoise-frenkel-nichts-um-sein-haupt-zu-betten-eine.950.de.html?dram:article_id=361381| title=Eine Existenz am dünnen Faden|date=28 July 2016|author=Carsten Hueck| publisher=Deutschlandradio, Köln| accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now receiving support from the French diplomatic mission, Frenkel and Raichenstein opened the "Maison du Livre français" (''literally: "House of the French Book"'') along the [[:de:Passauer Straße (Berlin)|Passauer Street]] in a district of west-central Berlin with an above average number of Jewish residents.&lt;ref name=FFlautMO/&gt;

At least in the early years, Berlin's intellectual elite approached this new haven of francophone literature only with extreme caution, but at this time, in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], there were also around 100,000 Russian refugees living in Berlin, many of whom were well educated and welcomed the chance to read French classics in the original language rather than in translation.&lt;ref name=FFlautDLR/&gt;   As the 1920s progressed the German customers became more numerous, notably philologists. teachers and professors, students along with a few aristocrats left over from an age when the education of young Prussian noblemen was powerfully infiltrated by French culture.&lt;ref name=FFselonPM&gt;{{cite web|url= http://lereseaumodiano.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/patrick-modiano-fait-redecouvrir.html| title=Patrick Modiano fait redécouvrir l'unique livre de Françoise Frenkel |date=10 October 2015|publisher=|author=[[Patrick Modiano]] (from the preface he contributed to the 2015 edition of Françoise Frenkel's book)|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Diplomats and other workers from the French embassy and consulate were also frequent visitors.&lt;ref name=FFlautDLR/&gt;   The enterprise acquired a certain cachet, becoming a cultural focus, described by one source as "one of the top addresses for all francophiles" in the city.&lt;ref name=FFlautMO/&gt;   Frenkel organised presentations and receptions for French literary stars and any other fashionable French writers when they visited Berlin.   [[Claude Anet]], [[Henri Barbusse]], [[André Gide]], [[Julien Benda]], [[Aristide Briand]] and [[Colette]] herself were just a few among the notable guests welcomed at the Passauer Street bookshop during these years.&lt;ref name=FFlautDLR/&gt;

=== Régime change ===
A [[Machtergreifung|new government]] at the start of 1933 changed the political context brutally.   The [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] lost little time in [[Gleichschaltung|transforming Germany]] into a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Enabling Act of 1933|dictatorship]].   The shrill populism that the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] had preached in opposition now became a core underpinning of government strategy.   At the heart of this was [[antisemitism]], applied in ways that few at the time would have believed possible.   During the next couple of years many of Germany's Jews - especially those who had been politically active or for some other reason had high political or commercial profiles - fled abroad or were arrested.

Frenkel's husband was, like her, Jewish.&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;   He had been born in [[Mogilev]], and belonged to a community of Jewish Russian exiles among whom memories of [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|Anti-Jewish pogroms]] were still very much alive. Simon Raichenstein barely hesitated.   By November 1933&lt;ref name=FFperRFinIndy/&gt; he had fled to Paris with a [[Nansen passport]].&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;   The French authorities refused to issue him with an identity card, but they nevertheless seem to have given him some sort of residence permit.&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;   In any event, he remained in France till July 1942 when he was arrested and, a few weeks later, transported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and murdered on 19 August.&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;

Françoise Frenkel remained in Berlin.   It is not clear how much contact she retained with her husband, but she continued to run the "Maison du Livre français".    The shop was already facing an officially mandated boycott in 1933, but it remained open.&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt;   After 1935 practical problems increased, notably in respect of obtaining necessary French currency.   There was intervention from the censors and there were other political pressures.&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt;   Sources refer to an absence of practical backing from the French embassy.&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt;   On the other hand, as a Polish Jewess running a high-profile business in Berlin, apparently without influential contacts in the political establishment, it is remarkable that the book store was able to operate at all right through till 1939.   There are indications that the passionate bibliophile was able to remain in business for so long precisely because her activities enjoyed the support of powerful French publishing houses and French politicians, not all of whom were at this stage committed enemies of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=FFlautDLR/&gt;

She was still in Berlin in November 1938 to experience [[Kristallnacht|National Crystal Night (''"Reichskristallnacht"'')]] when synagogues and the premises of surviving Jewish businesses were attacked, smashed, and ransacked.   She experienced the officially sanctioned pogrom from the streets, then from her apartment, in a Jewish quarter of Berlin, and then from the front step of her book store which, miraculously, was spared.&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt;   As [[Second World War|war]] loomed she finally accepted that there was no future left for her in Germany, and August&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt; 1939 she finally gave way to the ever more urgent entreaties of the French consul in Berlin&lt;ref name=FFselonPM/&gt; and escaped [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|from Berlin]] as a passenger on a special train to Paris which had been organised by the French embassy.&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt;   She placed her personal belongings in a heavy suitcase which a friend sent on after her in the direction of France, where they were later seized by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt;   Back in Berlin, the remaining stock of the "Maison du Livre français" was also seized, on account of Frenkel's "racial affiliations" (''"Rassenzugehörigkeit"'').&lt;ref name=FFlautDLR/&gt;

=== France ===
Françoise Frenkel spent the next nine months in Paris where Simon Raichenstein was already living.   Sources speculate that wife and husband must have met up during this time, but Frenkel's own written record is completely silent on that question.&lt;ref name=FFselonFB/&gt;   With horror, Frenkel followed the [[Invasion of Poland|news from Poland]] during the Autumn/Fall of 1939, desperately hoping for some sign of life from her widowed mother there.&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt;    On 10 May 1940 German forces [[Battle of France|invaded France]] and on [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|22 June 1940 an armistice]] was agreed between the French and German governments.   [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Northern France]] was to be directly occupied by Germany while a [[Zone libre|Free zone]] in the south of the country was to be administered by a semi-autonomous [[Vichy France|puppet government]] (which during the next four years  became progressively less autonomous).

In May/June 1940, hundreds of thousands fled from Paris in order to avoid the rapidly advancing German army, hurrying to get across the new internal frontier into the [[Zone libre|Free zone]].   Having failed to find anywhere to spend the night, many of the more faint-hearted would-be refugees turned round and headed back to Paris, and the roads became hopelessly blocked.   Françoise Frenkel also drove south, reaching [[Vichy]], but she found the [[Spa town|health resort]] so overcrowded that she set off again, this time along the road towards [[Clermont-Ferrand]], a little further to the south.   However, this road had been blocked by a unit of the French military.   Then low flying fighter aircraft from the German army started to attack the lines of cars and everyone had to leap from the cars and take cover in the ditches by the roadside.&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt;

Initially French Jews enjoyed a certain level of protection under the [[Vichy France|so-called "Vichy-Régime"]] in the [[Zone libre|Free zone]], but as the Germans tightened their grip all Jews - whether French or foreign - faced the constant threat of arrest and deportation to the [[Extermination camp|death camps]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].  Frenkel's first weeks in Vichy France were spent living in [[Avignon]], after which she moved on to [[Nice]].   Her book described a Kafkaesque succession of encounters with demoralised and confused bureaucrats:  each day she was called upon to obtain a new identity document or temporary residence permit.   Information provided by officials was never complete, regulatory requirements changed every day, and the overall experience was characterised by a constantly changing mixture of acute anxieties, hopes and disappointments.   Eventually a friend arranged for a Frenchman to marry her in order to provide her with entitlement to permanent residence, but the scheme dissolved into tragi-comic farce when it turned out that the selected husband wanted not just the payment agreed, but also the woman.&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt; 
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFDEAD|align=right|width=45%|

Françoise Frenkel's memoire, 'Rien où poser ma tête', offers two things:  an exciting journey of discovery of Berlin between the wars, including insights into largely unknown areas - commercial processes, court actions and the media of cultural exchange, ''and'' a report from a woman's perspective of flight and persecution in occupied France during the dark years. ... the re-emergence of Frenkel's book indicates that the years of Nazi occupation, although in the past, continue to resonate in the French present - and that we should probably expect more "literary discoveries" of this nature to emerge.

Françoise Frenkels Erinnerungen Rien où poser ma tête bieten zweierlei: eine aufregende Entdeckungsreise in das Berlin der Zwischenkriegszeit, mit Einblicken in bislang weitgehend unbekannte Räume, Agenten, Prozesse und Medien des Kulturtransfers, und: einen Bericht aus weiblicher Perspektive von Flucht und Verfolgung im besetzten Frankreich der années noires. ...  die ‚Wiederkehr' von Frenkels Buch, dass die Okkupationszeit nicht aufhört, in die französische Gegenwart hineinzuwirken – und dass es vermutlich noch viele ‚Wiedergänger' dieser Art geben wird.&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{right|[[:de:Margarete Zimmermann|Margarete Zimmermann]]  ''2015''}}

It appears from at least one source that Françoise Frenkel had applied for and obtained a visa for Switzerland soon after her arrival in France in 1939, but having set her mind on living in France she did not attempt to make her way to [[Switzerland]] for another couple of years.&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt;   By that time, making her way to [[Switzerland]] while living in hiding and trying to avoid discovery and deportation by the [[Gestapo]] and their Vichy régime collaborators was no easy undertaking.   It may have been events in August 1942, when she narrowly avoided capture and deportation, that persuaded her that attempting to enter Switzerland was nevertheless a less life-threatening option than remaining in [[Vichy France]].   On 26 August 1942 the police carried out a raid on the little "Hotel Arche de Noe" (''"Noah's Ark Hotel"'') where she was living.   However, by the time they arrived she was out shopping in the town.  As she walked back towards the hotel she looked up to wave to her Viennese neighbour at her fourth floor window, but the neighbour was not there.&lt;ref name=FFperRFinIndy/&gt;   On a third floor balcony, however, her Polish neighbour, a Mr. Sigismund, was gesticulating along the street towards the hotel.  Following the direction in which he was indicating,  in the distance she spotted all the hotel's other Jewish guests being escorted into police trucks.&lt;ref name=FFperRFinIndy/&gt;   It was only with extreme difficulty that she resisted a mad urge to show solidarity with the other Jews and deliver herself to the policemen escorting the group, but resist it she did.   After this, as she spells out in some detail in her book, she lived "underground" and was dependent for survival on those French citizens who had not been infected by the antisemitic propaganda of the Vichy government.   As she later recalled, she met good French people and she met bad French people.   And quite a lot of each.&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt;   There were those who put their bourgeois existence on the line in order to protect Jews from the clutches of the gendarmes.   Others revealed themselves as opportunists or even as fanatical Jew hunters.   Frenkel offers the conclusion that "a sadistic core may well be hiding inside every person" (''"Ein sadistischer Kern muss wohl in jedem Menschen stecken"'').&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;   [[Battle for France|National defeat]] in the summer of 1940 profoundly traumatised the national psyche, and she permits herself the speculation that the manifestation of national weakness caused some of the young men to react by taking out their mental hurt on people demonstrably weaker than themselves.&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt;   On the administrative front, Frenkel's final months in occupied France were further complicated by a change whereby the eastern strip of the [[Zone libre|Free zone]] (including Nice/Nizza) was transferred to Italian control, as the [[Vichy France|Vichy based puppet régime]] had its powers ever more diminished.[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:France_map_Lambert-93_with_regions_and_departments-occupation_evolution.PNG]   Under the Italian officials Frenkel's presence even, at one stage, was granted a level of legal status.   Friends organised a Swiss visa for her.   However, she was still Jewish, which meant that from the perspective of the authorities in occupied France, she was not permitted to cross the French frontier&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt;   Her first attempt led to capture while she sat on the local bus waiting at the border crossing, and a brief prison sentence served in [[Annecy]],&lt;ref name=DasBuch/&gt; followed by a probationary period at conditional liberty.   She nevertheless made a second attempt to cross the frontier but was thwarted by an Italian border soldier, who then let her go.   She made her third attempt to cross the frontier into Switzerland in June 1943, just a few days before the expiry of her Swiss visa.   This time she succeeded.&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt;   Rolling down a high snow covered hillside slope in the mountains by [[Annecy]], her black dress&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt; by now bloodied and torn,&lt;ref name=FFlautMZ/&gt; she was grabbed by a soldier who delivered a reassuring message:  "Stehen Sie auf, Madame, Sie sind nicht verletzt."&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt; (''"Get up, Madame, you're not wounded. See, you are in Switzerland."''&lt;ref name=FFperRFinIndy/&gt;).

=== Later years ===
Françoise Frenkel was 53 when she crossed the frontier to safety near Annecy.   She lived for more than another thirty years, dying at Nice on 18 January 1975.   Very little is known about her final decades, but it appears that she settled in France.   She was in [[Berlin]] in 1959, however, visiting the divided city to apply for compensation in respect of the robust travel suitcase which the Nazis had arranged to have confiscated when she escaped from Berlin back in the late summer of 1939.   In [[West Berlin]] a notary insisted that she provide a list of every single item of clothing that she had packed in the hastily stuffed suitcase.   She managed, in the end, to list 24 items, from tailored outfits to cheap night shirts, along with two small type writers.   The list was valued at a rate deemed equivalent to 25 [[Reichsmark]]s per item.   In 1960 the West German government paid her [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 3,500 as a "reparation".   In the words of an unimpressed commentator, "for the Germans, the matter was thereby dealt with.   However, Françoise Frenkel had lost more than just one [hastily stuffed] suitcase".&lt;ref name=FFlautMD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Für die Deutschen war der Fall damit erledigt. Doch Françoise Frenkel hatte mehr als nur einen Koffer verloren."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;!---

1943 begann sie mit der Niederschrift des Manuskripts Nichts, um sein Haupt zu betten. Es erschien 1945 erstmals in der Schweiz im Verlag Jeheber. Die französische Neuausgabe kam 2015 mit einem Vorwort von Patrick Modiano heraus. In ihrem Buch stellt Françoise Frenkel dar, wie sie 1942 Zeugin von Razzien wird, permanent in der Bedrohung lebt und von Versteck zu Versteck zieht. Sie erlebt im Wechsel Hilfeleistung, Denunziation, Gefängnis und Freilassung. Die Verantwortung für den antijüdischen Verfolgungsapparat, den französische „Kollaborateure“ tatkräftig unterstützten, sieht sie eindeutig bei den deutschen Besatzern.[3]

Die Romanistin Margarete Zimmermann bezeichnete das Buch als „eine aufregende Entdeckungsreise in das Berlin der Zwischenkriegszeit, mit Einblicken in bislang weitgehend unbekannte Räume, Agenten, Prozesse und Medien des Kulturtransfers, und: einen Bericht aus weiblicher Perspektive von Flucht und Verfolgung im besetzten Frankreich der années noires.“[4]

Der Flohmarktfund von Nizza hat sich zu einer der wichtigsten Neuerscheinungen des französischen Bücherherbstes von 2015 gemausert und setzt einen starken Akzent innerhalb einer mehrheitlich nombrilistisch-unhistorischen französischen Gegenwartsliteratur. Françoise Frenkels Erinnerungen Rien où poser ma tête bieten zweierlei: eine aufregende Entdeckungsreise in das Berlin der Zwischenkriegszeit, mit Einblicken in bislang weitgehend unbekannte Räume, Agenten, Prozesse und Medien des Kulturtransfers, und: einen Bericht aus weiblicher Perspektive von Flucht und Verfolgung im besetzten Frankreich der années noires. Ähnlich wie die Wiederentdeckung von Hélène Berrs Journal. 1942-44 (2008) und die Neuauflage von Léon Werths 33 jours (2015) zeigt auch die ‚Wiederkehr’ von Frenkels Buch, dass die Okkupationszeit nicht aufhört, in die französische Gegenwart hineinzuwirken – und dass es vermutlich noch viele ‚Wiedergänger’ dieser Art geben wird.

When he stole even the plate on which his lunch was served to gamble, his sister, wishing to teach him a lesson, served his rice on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Jim (1981). ''Guide to enjoying Nepalese festivals: an introductory survey of religious celebration in Kathmandu Valley.'' Kali Press. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeply hurt, Kesh Chandra gathered up the food in a handkerchief and walked a long distance to the woods outside the city. Feeling hungry, he unwrapped the rice, and found that it had turned bad and there were maggots all over. So he spread the food to dry in the sun and dozed off.

===Droppings turn to gold===

When Kesh Chandra awoke, he found that pigeons had eaten everything. He was so saddened that he broke into tears. Taking pity on him, the pigeons left their droppings which turned into gold. There was so much gold that he couldn't carry it all. As he was pondering what to do, he saw Gurumapa, a man-eating giant that lived in the forest, approaching. He had been attracted by the smell of prey.

Kesh Chandran pacified him by calling him uncle, and persuaded him to carry the gold to his home with the promise of a feast and the right to take away children if their parents called him whenever they were bad. Kesh Chandra took Gurumapa home to Itumbaha and let him live in the attic. As the years passed, children started disappearing whenever their parents warned them that Gurumapa would come and get them.

===Banished to Tundikhel===
The local residents then decided that it was not safe to keep Gurumapa in the neighborhood. They promised to provide him an annual feast of boiled rice and buffalo meat if he agreed to live on the field of Tinkhya ([[Tundikhel]]). And so the giant was persuaded to move out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title= Polishing up the past|url= http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/2005/07/22/Arts/604|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper= Nepali Times|date= 22–28 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, the people of the locality prepare a feast on the day of Ghode Jatra for Gurumapa and leave it on the field which is now a parade ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Child| first = John| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://newsblaze.com/story/20110315112122chil.nb/topstory.html| title = Colors and Rituals Mark Holi in Nepal| work = | publisher = News Blaze| date=15 March 2011| accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bisht|first=Kapil|title=A walk into the heritage|url=http://ecs.com.np/features/a-walk-into-the-heritage|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=ECS Nepal|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henryk Pillati''' (19 January 1832 in [[Warsaw]] – 16 April 1894 in Warsaw) was a Polish illustrator, caricaturist and history painter, in the [[Classicism|Classical]] style.

== Biography ==
He was born to a wealthy family. In 1845, at the age of only thirteen, he entered the {{ill|School of Fine Arts (Warsaw)|pl|Szkoła Sztuk Pięknych w Warszawie|lt=School of Fine Arts}} in Warsaw. Three years later, both of his parents died during a [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics#Second, 1829–51|cholera epidemic]]. This forced him to leave school and find work to support his surviving younger siblings.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.pinakoteka.zascianek.pl/Pillati/Pillati_bio.htm Biographical notes] @ Pinakoteka.&lt;/ref&gt;

He managed to get by selling small paintings of [[Genre art|genre]] scenes and episodes from the [[Polish-Swedish wars]]. From 1852 to 1853, he created a series of large canvases, designed for decorating steamships owned by Count [[Andrzej Artur Zamoyski]], on the [[Vistula River]]. The ships were later confiscated by the Russians during the [[January Uprising]].&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

Later, he received private scholarships that enabled him to spend a year studying at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Four years later, he continued his studies at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], then spent some time in Rome.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

After 1860, although he continued to paint historical scenes, he was primarily engaged in providing illustrations for books (notably works by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] and [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]]) and several periodicals in Warsaw, including the ''[[Tygodnik Ilustrowany]]'', ''{{ill|Kłosy (magazine)|pl|Kłosy (czasopismo)|lt=Kłosy}}'' (Ears), ''{{ill|Wędrowiec|pl|Wędrowiec (czasopismo)}}'' (The Wanderer) and ''{{ill|Biesiada Literacka|pl}}'' (Literary Feast).&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/nowe/artists/pillati-henryk-polska-agra-art-aukcje-obrazy-antyki.html Brief biography] @ Agra Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, he moved to Saint Petersburg to work for a publishing house, but his increasing alcoholism ruined his health to the point that his younger brother, {{ill|Ksawery Pillati|pl|lt=Ksawery}}, who was also a painter, had to bring him home, where he spent his final years living in the residence of the Warsaw Charitable Society. His life was later given fictional treatment in the novel ''Malaria'' by {{ill|Wiktor Gomulicki|pl}}.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

'''''A History of the Book in America''''' is a five-volume series of scholarly books of essays published 2000–2010 by the [[University of North Carolina Press]], and edited by David D. Hall. Topics include [[printing]], [[publishing]], [[bookselling|book selling]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], and other aspects of [[print culture]] in [[colonial America]] and the United States. Among the contributing writers: Hugh Amory, Georgia B. Barnhill, [[Paul S. Boyer]], Richard D. Brown, Scott E. Casper, Charles E. Clark, [[James P. Danky]], [[Ann Fabian]], James N. Green, [[Robert A. Gross]], Jeffrey D. Groves, [[David D. Hall]], Mary Kelley, [[E. Jennifer Monaghan]], [[Janice Radway]], [[James Raven]], Elizabeth Carroll Reilly, Joan Shelley Rubin, [[Michael Schudson]], David S. Shields, [[Wayne A. Wiegand]], Michael Winship.

The five volumes in ''A History of the Book in America'' offer a sweeping chronicle of our country's print production and culture from colonial times to the end of the twentieth century. This interdisciplinary, collaborative work of scholarship examines the book trades as they have developed and spread throughout the United States; provides a history of U.S. literary cultures; investigates the practice of reading and, more broadly, the uses of literacy; and links literary culture with larger themes in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469621647/a-history-of-the-book-in-america-5-volume-set/|title=A History of the Book in America (5 volume set) {{!}} David D.

The '''Horror Writers Association''' ('''HWA''') is a worldwide non-profit organization of professional writers and publishing professionals dedicated to promoting the interests of [[Horror fiction|Horror]] and [[Dark fantasy]] writers.&lt;ref name="JoiningHWAname=JoiningHWA"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is The Horror Writer's Association?|url=http://www.horror.org/joinhwa.htm|work=HWA Website|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
HWA was formed in 1985 with the help of many of the field's greats, including [[Joe R. Lansdale]], [[Robert McCammon]], and [[Dean Koontz]], although it was not formally incorporated until 1987, the year it first gave [[Bram Stoker Award]]s. The group was originally called ''HOWL'' (Horror and Occult Writers League), but quickly changed to the ''Horror Writers of America'' when they formally organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horror.org/aboutus.htm#wiater|title=Horror Writers Association - About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HWA now has members and regional chapters throughout North America, Europe, Australia, South Africa, Russia, and Asia, which led to the current name of the organization.

One of HWA's missions is to encourage public interest in and foster an appreciation of quality [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[dark fantasy]] literature. To that end, HWA offers information on their Web site, they sponsor or take part in occasional public readings and lectures. They also maintain an official presence at many fan-based horror and fantasy conventions, such as the Bram Stoker Awards® Weekend, [[World Fantasy Convention]] and the [[World Horror Convention]].

HWA sponsors the annual [[Bram Stoker Awards]] for superior achievement in [[Horror fiction|Horror]] and [[Dark fantasy]]. HWA also presents an annual Lifetime Achievement Award to as many as three living people who have made significant contributions to the writing of [[Horror fiction|Horror]] and [[Dark fantasy]] over the course of a lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horror.org/awards/stokers.htm|title=Horror Writers Association - The Bram Stoker Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also a number of service Awards, including the Specialty Press Award and the [[HWA Silver Hammer Award|Silver Hammer Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horror.org/awards/hwaawards.htm|title=Horror Writers Association - Bram Stoker Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, HWA has produced a series of [[anthologies]] edited by a few of the more prestigious members and published in hardcover, [[Mass market paperback|mass-market]] or [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] by various publishers. Most have also had signed, [[Limited edition books|limited hardcover editions]]. These anthologies present new stories by the members of the Horror Writers Association. In addition, in 1997 HWA produced a volume of essays on the craft of horror writing, ''On Writing Horror: A Handbook by the Horror Writers Association'', edited by [[Mort Castle]], with contributions from dozens of well-known HWA members. In 2006, an [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1582974209/ updated and revised version] was issued. Their latest series of anthologies, ''Blood Lite'', collects darkly humorous tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HWA Books|url=http://www.horror.org/hwabooks.htm|work=HWA Website|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex''''' is a book by American writer [[Nathaniel Philbrick]] about the loss of the [[whaler]] [[Essex (1799 whaleship)|''Essex'']] in the Pacific Ocean in 1820. The book was published by [[Viking Press]] on May 8, 2000, and won the 2000 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]]. It was adapted into a [[In the Heart of the Sea (film)|film of the same name]], which came out in late 2015.

==Summary==
The ''[[Essex (1799 whaleship)|Essex]]'', an American [[whaleship]] from [[Nantucket]], [[Massachusetts]], sank after a [[sperm whale]] attacked it in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in November 1820. Having lost their ship, the crew of the ''Essex'' attempted to sail to [[South America]] in [[whaleboat]]s. After suffering from starvation and dehydration, most of the crew died before the survivors were rescued in February 1821.

In retelling the story of the crew's ordeal, Philbrick utilizes an account written by [[Thomas Nickerson]], who was a teenage [[cabin boy]] on board the ''Essex'' and wrote about the experience in his old age; his account was lost until 1960 but was not authenticated until 1980 before being published, abridged, in 1984. The book also utilizes the better known account of [[Owen Chase]], the ship's [[first mate]], which was published soon after the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | title = In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex  | author = Philbrick, Nathaniel  | publisher = Penguin Books  | year = 2001  | isbn = 0-14-100182-8  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jcarV199NhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover  | pages=xiv-xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was scheduled for release in the US on December 11, 2015, but was released in major markets like Brazil, Russia, India and 37 other countries, as well as parts of the US, on December 3, 2015 to avoid competition from ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

'''Jazz piano''' is a collective term for the techniques pianists use when playing [[jazz]]. The piano has been an integral part of the jazz idiom since its inception, in both solo and ensemble settings. Its role is multifaceted due largely to the instrument's combined melodic and harmonic capabilities. For this reason it is an important tool of jazz musicians and composers for teaching and learning jazz theory and set arrangement, regardless of their main instrument. (By extension the phrase 'jazz piano' can refer to similar techniques on any keyboard instrument.)

Along with the [[jazz guitar|guitar]], [[vibraphone]], and other keyboard instruments, the piano is one of the instruments in a jazz combo that can play both single notes and [[chord (music)|chord]]s rather than only single notes as does the [[saxophone]] or [[trumpet]].

==Beginning==
A new style known as “stride” or “Harlem stride” emerged during the 1920s, predominantly in New York. [[James P. Johnson]] was a prominent adherent. The left hand was used to establish rhythm while the right hand improvised melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jazz Piano Roots: A Short History of Early Jazz Piano - Part I|last=Lees|first=Gene|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=Katonah, NY|pages=Pg. 24|quote=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
===Learning jazz piano===

[[File:Bill Evans.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Bill Evans]] performing at the Montreux Jazz Festival.]]
Mastering the various chord voicings—simple to advanced—is the first building block of learning jazz piano.  Jazz piano technique uses all the chords found in Western art music, such as major, minor, augmented, diminished, seventh, diminished seventh, sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, suspended fourth, and so on.  A second key skill is learning to play with a [[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]] rhythm and "feel". In jazz, the roots are usually omitted from keyboard voicings, as this task is left to the [[double bass]] player. Jazz pianists also make extensive use of chord "extensions", such as adding the ninth, eleventh or thirteenth scale degree to the chord. In some cases, these extensions may be "altered" i.e. sharpened or flattened, as in the case of a "sharp 11" chord.

The next step is learning to improvise melodic lines using scales and chord tones. This ability is perfected after long experience, including much practice, which internalizes the physical skills of playing and the technical elements of harmony, and it requires a great natural 'ear' for extemporaneous music-making. When jazz pianists [[improvisation|improvise]], they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz piano. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised "by ear" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play "by ear." Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and guitar players, bebop-era jazz pianists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios.&lt;ref&gt;''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', by Robert Rawlins, Nor Eddine Bahha, Barrett Tagliarino. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005 {{ISBN|0-634-08678-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08678-6}}. Page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styles===
Jazz piano (the technique) and the instrument itself offer soloists an exhaustive number of choices. One may play the bass register in an [[ostinato]] pattern, popular in  [[boogie-woogie]] style, where the left hand repeats a phrase numerous times throughout a song, as performed by Rob Agerbeek in "Boogie Woogie Stomp." The left hand can also be played as a melodic counterline that emulates the walking of an [[upright bass]]. In [[stride piano]], (similar to the earlier [[ragtime]]) the left hand rapidly plays alternate positions between notes in the bass register and chords in the tenor register, while the right hand plays melody and improvises, as performed in George Gershwin's "Liza".  The right hand may play melodic lines, or harmonic content, chordally or in octaves. It may also be played in lockstep with the left hand, using a double melody [[block chord]] called "locked-hand" [[voicing (music)|voicing]], or [[Shearing voicing]]—a technique popularized, though not invented, by the pianist and set leader [[George Shearing]].

===Ensemble role===
[[File:ODJBcard.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, with Henry Ragas on piano.]]
Jazz piano has played a leading role in developing the sound of jazz.  Early on, black jazz musicians created [[ragtime]] on the piano.  As the genre progressed the piano was usually featured in the rhythm section of a band, which was typically configured as one or more of piano, guitar, bass, or drums, or other instruments, such as the vibraphone.

Over time, playing piano-accompaniment in ensemble sets, and then bands, changed from primarily time-keeping (consisting of repetitive left-hand figures) to a more flexible role. Ultimately, the skilled pianist was free both to lead and to answer the instrumental soloist, using both short and sustained, chordal and melodic, fragments—a technique known as '[[comping]]'. Good comping musicians were capable of many and different chord voicings, so to match the various moods the different soloists were aiming for. In the early days not all leading pianists were concerned to provide comping. Others—notably [[Duke Ellington]], who became famous during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] at the [[Cotton Club]]—earned great esteem among band members as well as other musicians. Ellington comped enthusiastically in support of the soloist and did much to develop the technique.

Jazz piano moved away from playing lead melody to providing foundation for song sets; soon, skilled jazz pianists were performing as soloists. In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of great piano players emerged. Pianists like [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Bud Powell]] helped create and establish the sound of [[bebop]]. [[Bill Evans]] built upon the style of Bud Powell while adding a distinct classical influence to his playing while [[Oscar Peterson]] pushed rhythmic variations and was influenced by the style of [[Art Tatum]], [[Teddy Wilson]] and [[Nat King Cole]]. [[Wynton Kelly]], [[Red Garland]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Keith Jarrett]] were also exceptional pianists who played with [[Miles Davis]].  [[Tommy Flanagan]] was featured by [[John Coltrane]] on his hit album ''[[Giant Steps]]''. [[McCoy Tyner]] is also an influential player who played with Coltrane.

'''Jennifer Kapoor''' (née '''Kendal''', 28 February 1933 – 7 September 1984) was an English actress and the founder of the [[Prithvi Theatre]]. She was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for the 1981 film ''[[36 Chowringhee Lane]]''. Her other film appearances included ''[[Bombay Talkie]]'' (1970), ''[[Junoon (1978 film)|Junoon]]'' (1978), ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' (1983), and ''[[Ghare Baire (film)|Ghare Baire]]'' (1984).

==Childhood==
Jennifer Kendal was born in [[Southport]], England, but spent much of her youth in India. She and younger sister [[Felicity Kendal]] were born to [[Geoffrey Kendal]] and Laura Liddell, who ran a travelling theatre company, "Shakespeareana",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Makeup/2559/jennifer_kendal023.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+08:09:53  Jennifer Kendal – Biography and images]&lt;/ref&gt; which travelled around India as depicted in the book and film, ''[[Shakespeare Wallah]]'' (in which Kendal appeared, uncredited, and which starred her husband [[Shashi Kapoor]], her parents and her sister).

==Shashi Kapoor==
Shashi Kapoor and Jennifer met for the first time in Calcutta, in 1956, where he was part of the [[Prithvi Theatre]] company, while she was playing Miranda in the play ''The Tempest'', as part of Shakespeareana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/09/06/stories/2004090600840300.htm A question of pedigree] [[The Hindu]], 6 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Shashi Kapoor started touring with the Shakespeareana Company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.junglee.org.in/jennifer.html Jennifer Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; and they married in July 1958. Kendal and her husband were also instrumental in the rejuvenation of Prithvi Theatre in [[Bombay]], with the opening of their theatre in the [[Juhu]] area of the city in 1978.&lt;ref name=ben&gt;{{cite news |title=Prithvi, pioneer in theatre  |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2003/11/07/stories/2003110701340600.htm |work=[[The Hindu]]|date=7 November 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kendal and Kapoor also starred in a number of films together, particularly those produced by [[Merchant Ivory Productions]].  Their first joint starring roles were in ''[[Bombay Talkie]]'' (1970), which was also one of the earlier films produced by Merchant Ivory.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

==Personal life==
The Kapoors had three children: sons [[Kunal Kapoor (actor)|Kunal Kapoor]] and [[Karan Kapoor]], and a daughter [[Sanjana Kapoor]], all erstwhile Bollywood actors. Kunal runs ad company ''Adfilms Valas''. Karan Kapoor (b. 18 January 1962) was a popular model made famous by [[Bombay Dyeing]] shooting and shirting advertisement, and he also acted in [[Sultanat]] (1986) opposite [[Juhi Chawla]] as well as later in [[Loha (1987 film)|Loha]] with [[Dharmendra]]. Karan now runs a photography company in UK. Their sister [[Sanjana Kapoor]] (b. 27 November 1967) runs ancestral [[Prithvi Theatre]]. Kunal was married to filmmaker [[Ramesh Sippy]]'s daughter Sheena, who is a well known photographer. They had two children together, Shaira and Zahan. Kunal and Sheena are now divorced.&lt;ref name=n18&gt;[http://www.news18.com/photogallery/movies/in-pics-meet-shashi-kapoors-family-992937-10.html Meet the Kapoors], [[Network 18]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kunstformen der Natur''''' (known in English as '''''Art Forms in Nature'''''&lt;!--boldface for redirect target--&gt;) is a book of [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[halftone]] prints by German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]].

==Publication==

Originally published in sets of ten between 1899 and 1904 and collectively in two volumes in 1904,&lt;ref name="KreinikArts2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Juliana D. Kreinik |author2=New York University. Institute of Fine Arts |title=The Canvas and the Camera in Weimar Germany: A New Objectivity in Painting and Photography of the 1920s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khRzA67DzkgC&amp;pg=PA232 |year=2008 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |isbn=978-0-549-58248-9 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; it consists of 100 prints of various organisms, many of which were first described by Haeckel himself.  Over the course of his career, over 1000 [[engraving]]s were produced based on Haeckel's [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es and [[watercolor]]s; many of the best of these were chosen for ''Kunstformen der Natur'', translated from sketch to print by lithographer Adolf Giltsch.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition of ''Kunstformen'', containing only 30 prints, was produced in 1924.

==Themes==

According to Haeckel scholar Olaf Breidbach, the work was "not just a book of illustrations but also the summation of his view of the world."  The over-riding themes of the ''Kunstformen'' plates are [[symmetry in biology|symmetry]] and [[Evolution of biological complexity|level of organization&lt;!--in evolution, not molecule/cell/tissue/organ level--&gt;]].  The subjects were selected to embody these to the full, from the scale patterns of [[boxfish]]es to the spirals of [[ammonite]]s to the perfect symmetries of jellies and microorganisms, while images composing each plate are arranged for maximum visual impact.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', pp. 229-231&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the notable prints are numerous [[radiolarian]]s, which Haeckel helped to popularize among amateur [[microscope|microscopists]]; at least one example is found in almost every set of 10.  [[Cnidaria]] also feature prominently throughout the book, including [[sea anemones]] as well as [[Siphonophorae]], [[Semaeostomeae]], and other [[medusa (biology)|medusae]].  The first set included ''Desmonema annasethe'' (now ''[[Cyanea (jellyfish)|Cyanea]] annasethe''), a particularly striking [[jellyfish]] that Haeckel observed and described shortly after the death of his wife Anna Sethe.&lt;ref name=Innes&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Innes |first1=Shelley |title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith, Religion, Theology, and Natural Science, Vol. 3 by Mario di Gregorio |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2006 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=214–216 | doi = 10.1007/s10739-006-0001-9 |jstor=4332000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

''Kunstformen der Natur'' was influential in early 20th-century art, architecture, and design, bridging the gap between science and art.  In particular, many artists associated with [[Art Nouveau]] were influenced by Haeckel's images, including [[René Binet (artist)|René Binet]], [[Karl Blossfeldt]], [[Hans Christiansen (artist)|Hans Christiansen]], and [[Émile Gallé]].  One prominent example is the [[Beurs van Berlage|Amsterdam Commodities Exchange]] designed by [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]]: it was in part inspired by ''Kunstformen'' illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', pp. 231, 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent research project at the [[University of Manchester]], [[UK]] has conceptualised the modern multifaith space as "an intentional space, designed to both house a plurality of religious practices, as well as address clearly defined pragmatic purposes."&lt;ref name=Manchester /&gt;

==Design concepts==
[[File:MultifaithAblutionFacility.jpg|thumb|[[Ritual purification|Ablution]] facility in the [[University of Toronto]]'s multifaith building]]
The Manchester University research highlighted two key factors for a multifaith space to work:

* There needs to be a balance achieved for the range of different users most likely to make regular use of the space, thus preventing conflict. All norms and values need to be considered and respected, which often leads to an "unstable equilibrium where divergent worldviews can be brought together." Social cooperation and openness must be possible within the space.
* Most multifaith spaces maintain a very basic design, in order to minimize the visibility of a single faith group, whilst remaining easily adaptable to the many different practices for which the space may be utilized. Each space raises question of ethics and "national style", in which different faith members are able to participate in a mutually respectful, yet cooperative, manner.&lt;ref name=Manchester /&gt;

The French '''perchman''' is equivalent to the U.S. [[boom operator (media)|boom operator]] in film production, also called the sound assistant or boomer, but differs regarding attributions. The perchman is the [[production sound mixer]]'s assistant and is in charge of the [[microphone]] placement, typically using a light and telescopic pole also called a fish pole or boom. &lt;ref&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/boom-operator getinmedia.com, Boom operator] &lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the perchman places and moves the microphone "in real time" in order to pick up the voices of each [[actor]] during filming. Being a perchman involves providing the best sound quality possible to the sound mixer while at the same time, not causing shadows or entering the camera frame. To accomplish this, the perchman works in collaboration with the [[camera operator]] and the [[cinematographer]] (who directs the camera movements and lights the scenes) and the [[gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]]. Other duties include the hiding of miniature [[wireless microphones]] (radio mics) on the actors, the placement of hidden auxiliary microphones, and the controlling of sound reflections by the use of furniture blankets and carpet. He readies the equipment at the beginning of each day and stores the gear when the day is "wrapped", or finished. The perchman manages the technical contingencies allowing the production sound mixer to concentrate on the artistic side of sound recording.

'''Peter Schjeldahl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|l|d|ɑː|l|}}; born 1942) is an [[United States|American]] [[art critic]], [[poet]], and [[educator]].

==Early life==
Schjeldahl was born in [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[North Dakota]]. He grew up in small towns throughout [[Minnesota]], and attended [[Carleton College]] and [[The New School]]. He began his professional writing career as a [[reporter]] in Minnesota, [[Iowa]] and [[New Jersey]].

==Art critic==
In 1964 he traveled to [[Paris]] for a year before settling in New York City in 1965. Since coming to New York he has worked as an art critic for ''[[ARTnews]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'' (1990 to 1998),&lt;ref name="ny-bio"/&gt; and 7 Days ([[The Cooper Union]]). In 1998 he joined ''[[The New Yorker]]'' where he is currently the head art critic.&lt;ref name="ny-bio"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Contributors: Peter Schjeldahl |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/peter_schjeldahl/search?contributorName=peter%20schjeldahl|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings have also appeared in [[Artforum]], [[Art in America]], ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;ref name="ny-bio"/&gt; During his career Schjeldahl has written several books of [[poetry]] as well as art criticism. He taught at [[Harvard University]] in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies for four years as well.

==Poet==
Schjeldahl’s [[poetry]] falls in line with many of the characteristic themes and styles of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].  As a contemporary [[postmodern]] poet, Schjeldahl believed that poetry should be enjoyed and understood by all readers.  In an interview with the Virginia Commonwealth University’s ''[[Blackbird (journal)|Blackbird]]'' Schjeldahl commented on how ''"there are no rewards in being obscure or abstruse or overbearing"''
&lt;ref name=Blackbird2004&gt;{{cite interview |last=Schjeldahl  |first=Peter |interviewer1=Howard Risatti|interviewer2=[[Susan Glasser]]|interviewer3=Mary Flinn |title=Interview with Peter Schjeldahl |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v3n1/gallery/schjeldahl_p/index.htm |date=Spring 2004 |volume=3 |number=1 |journal=[[Blackbird (journal)|Blackbird]] |accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His poetry succeeds without a great deal of complexity in language usage or style while maintaining seriousness and poignancy.  Schjeldahl’s poetry often addresses common experiences or familiar events. In his poem “My Generation” he opens: "Vietnam/ Drugs/ Civil Rights/ Rock/ Watergate/ (in that order?)/ Are the blows of history/ That have left my generation/ Its peculiar battered silhouette."  Schjeldahl fuels his poetry with historical and biographical context, allowing audiences to relate more intimately to his subject.
 
In an interview with ''Blackbird'', Schjeldahl stated, "''writing things that people want to read is my bread and butter".''&lt;ref name=Blackbird2004 /&gt;

==Awards==
Schjeldahl was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] fellowship in 1995.&lt;ref name="ga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/13026-peter-schjeldahl|title=Peter Schjeldahl|publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 he received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism by the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast |title=Awards - Frank Jewett Mather Award |publisher=The College Art Association |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute named Peter Schjeldahl the winner of the 2008 Clark Prize for Excellence in Arts Writing. The prize was established in 2006 to recognize writers who advance public appreciation of [[visual art]] in a way that "is grounded in scholarship yet appeals to a broad range of audiences." It comes with a $25,000 honorarium and an award designed by architect [[Tadao Ando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title= Peter Schjeldahl Wins Clark Prize for Arts Writing | publisher=ARTINFO  | date= April 25, 2008| url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/27456/peter-schjeldahl-wins-clark-prize-for-arts-writing/ | accessdate=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pitalkhora Caves''', in the Satamala range of the [[Western Ghats]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]], are an ancient [[Buddhist]] site consisting of 14 [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments which date back to the third century BCE, making them one of the earliest examples of rock-cut architecture in India.  Located about 40 kilometers from Ellora, the site is reached by a steep climb down a flight of concrete stairs, past a waterfall next to the caves.&lt;ref name=asipitalkhora/&gt;

==Description==
The caves are cut in a variety of [[basalt]] rock, but some of the caves have crumbled and are damaged. Out of the 14, four are [[chaitya]]s (one housing votive stupas, one apsidal and single-cell) and the rest are [[vihara]]s. All the caves belong to the [[Hinayana]] period, but the reasonably well preserved paintings are of the [[Mahayana]] period. The caves are in two groups, one of 10 caves and the second of four. It is believed that Pitalkhora can be identified with [[Ptolemy]]’s "Petrigala"  as well as the  "Pitangalya" of ''Mahamayuri'', a Buddhist chronicle. The inscriptions date from c. 250 BCE to the 3rd and 4th centuries CE.&lt;ref name=asipitalkhora&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_ellora_pitalkhora.asp Pitalkhora Caves] at Archaeological Survey of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site shows statues of elephants, two soldiers of which one is intact, a damaged [[Gaja Lakshmi]] icon, and an ancient [[rainwater harvesting]] system.&lt;ref name=asipitalkhora/&gt; These caves have been significant in helping establish the chronology of cave building in the Ajanta-Ellora region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Burgess|title=The Cave Temples of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HgTAAAAYAAJ |year=1880|publisher=W.H. Allen &amp; Company|pages=516–519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology of the Chaitya hall (Cave 3)==
The Chaitya hall, Cave 3 of Pitalkhora, represents an important marker in the chronology of the Chaitya hall design in western India. It is thought that the chronology of these early Chaitya Caves is as follows: first, in the 1st century BCE, Cave 9 at [[Mahakali Caves|Kondivite Caves]] and then Cave 12 at the [[Bhaja Caves]], which both predate Cave 10 of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]].&lt;ref name="Le 108"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Huu Phuoc|title=Buddhist Architecture|date=2010|publisher=Grafikol|isbn=9780984404308|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after Cave 10 of Ajanta, in chronological order: Cave 3 at Pitalkhora, Cave 1 at [[Kondana Caves]], Cave 9 at Ajanta, which, with its more ornate designs, may have been built about a century later, Cave 18 at [[Nasik caves|Nasik Caves]], and Cave 7 at [[Bedse Caves]], to finally culminate with the "final perfection" of the Great Chaitya at [[Karla Caves]].&lt;ref name="Le 108"/&gt;

The '''Poetry Society''' is a membership organisation, open to all, whose stated aim is "to promote the study, use and enjoyment of poetry".

The Society was founded in London in February 1909 as the Poetry Recital Society, becoming the Poetry Society in 1912. Its first President was Lady [[Margaret Sackville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.gov.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19090924.2.15 "Premiums for Poets"], ''Evening Post'', 24 September 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From its current Covent Garden, London, premises, The Poetry Society publishes ''[[Poetry Review]]'', Britain's leading poetry magazine, which provides a forum for poems from both new and established poets. Its current Editor is the poet [[Emily Berry]], who succeeded [[Maurice Riordan]] in 2017. The magazine's editor from 2005 to 2012 was [[Fiona Sampson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/publications/review/ "Publications"], The Poetry Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society organises several competitions, including the British [[National Poetry Competition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/competitions/ |title=The Poetry Society (Competitions) |publisher=Poetry Society |accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Foyle Young Poets of the Year Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foyleyoungpoets.org Foyle Young Poets]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Popescu Prize]], The Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry and the [[Geoffrey Dearmer Award]]. The society also ran the [[Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize]] from 1986 to 1997.

There is a '''Poetry Café''' on its Ground Floor, and performance space in the basement, rooms being available for hire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">The '''reveal''' (also known as the '''big reveal''') is a [[plot device]] in [[narrative structure]], and is the exposure to the reader or audience of a previously unseen key character or element of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] or of the [[performance]].

A reveal is different from Aristotle's ''[[anagnorisis]]'', in which something is revealed to a character rather than to the audience.

==Narrative==
The reveal may result in a [[plot twist]], and could be the key plot turn or unexpected [[Post-credits scene|coda]] in the story – in the [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] [[Literary genre|genre]], for example. It may also be used as a device (particularly in the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]) in [[stage magic]] by an [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]] or [[escape artist]].&lt;ref name=Clark_2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, James L. |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mekGtpHh5zUC&amp;pg=PT159&amp;dq=%22the+reveal%22+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qgz7T-bhF4uZiAfklsmABw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20reveal%22&amp;f=false |chapter=Performing the Corkscrew |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |title=Mind Magic and Mentalism for Dummies |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stage magic ==
In a magician's act, "the reveal" may refer to&lt;ref name=Clark_2012/&gt;
* the normal culmination of a trick
* the unexpected (to the [[audience]]) culmination of the trick
* an explanation of the trick – which itself may be immediately eclipsed by a version of the trick that the first reveal can't explain.

==Film==
''Reveal'' is also used for two distinct cinematographic techniques:
* A slow, theatrically presented image of an important character or item not seen previously in the film;
* A close-up, wide shot, or other unusual camera point-of-view that shows the audience an important visual clue not known to characters in the same scene.

In the sense of first-time showing of a character, a ''reveal'' is similar to, but usually not same as, the [[opening shot]] or [[Establishing shot]] that gives the location or context of a new scene.

{{One source|date=April 2018}}
A '''screen test''' is a method of determining the suitability of an [[actor]] or [[actress]] for performing on [[film]] or in a particular role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/screen+test|title=Definition of SCREEN TEST|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performer is generally given a scene, or selected lines and actions, and instructed to perform in front of a camera to see if they are suitable. The developed film is later evaluated by the relevant production personnel such as the casting director and the director. The actor may be asked to bring a prepared monologue or alternatively, the actor may be given a script to read at sight ("cold reading"). In some cases, the actor may be asked to read a scene, in which another performer reads the lines of another character.

==Types==
Screen tests can also be used to judge the suitability of [[costume]], [[make-up]] and other details, but these are generally called costume or make-up tests. Different types of actors can have different tasks for each individual test. For example, a lead for a musical theater-type movie could be requested to sing a popular song or learn a dance routine. Screen tests are routinely used in films and commercials. They are also used for short films.

International actors such as [[Bruce Lee]] were given screen tests to demonstrate that they are sufficiently articulate in the relevant language. In Lee's case, for the role of Kato in ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'', he was asked to converse about [[Chinese culture]] in [[English language|English]] to judge his grasp of the language, then to demonstrate some [[martial arts]] moves to show off his physical skills.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

A studio executive may be a [[Chief executive officer]], a [[Chief financial officer]], a [[Chief operating officer]], or be employed to serve in a variety of [[Vice president#Vice_presidents_in_business|Vice presidential]] capacities, such as Senior vice president of corporate relations.

A studio executive may oversee [[film production|production]] or may serve in a role identical to a corporation that is not involved in the [[entertainment industry]].

Studio executive is commonly used to describe someone who takes responsibility for all interests, financial or otherwise, between the film studio and the [[production company]] of a film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whartonmagazine.com/issues/1963.php Whartonmagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment'', [[Michelangelo]], c. 1500–1501. ]]
'''''Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment''''' is a drawing of c. 1500–1501  by [[Michelangelo]], now in the [[Louvre Museum]].  It is in black chalk, with pen and ink and white highlighting, on pink prepared (coloured) paper, and measures 26.6&amp;nbsp;cm x 15.1&amp;nbsp;cm.  It is a [[figure study]] made in preparation for his painting ''[[The Entombment (Michelangelo)|The Entombment]]'', and is Michelangelo's only surviving study that was probably drawn from a nude female model.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt; It also may be the earliest extant European drawing of a nude female model.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure in the drawing relates to a woman seated in the lower left foreground of the painting. Included in the study are narrative details such as the nails of the cross, held in her left hand, and the crown of thorns in her right. Although the drawing's attribution has been doubted, it is now accepted as authentic.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hirst, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The elaboration of the plaited hair suggests that the drawing was made from life using a young girl as the model.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hirst, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The drawing was made in three stages: first it was lightly laid down in black chalk, then gone over with pen and light [[bistre]], and finally drawn over completely with a finer pen and darker ink.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;Hirst, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Lateral strokes were placed at the bottom to indicate the ground plane, and touches of white body color were added to details of the figure. Rare for a drawing by Michelangelo is the pink ground,&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;Hirst, 64&lt;/ref&gt; in this case achieved by rubbing crushed red chalk onto the paper.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;Chapman, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the use of nude female models was controversial, relatively few such drawings were made before the 17th century, when academic life classes were established.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt; Before that boys or young men, typically studio apprentices, were used as models for figures of both sexes, as is sometimes rather apparent. Exceptions from the [[Italian Renaissance]] include [[Raphael]], who made nude drawings, apparently of his mistress, and [[Lorenzo Lotto]], who recorded in his account book having used women of ill repute as life models.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Florence]], Michelangelo and Raphael initiated the practice of making preparatory studies of the nude prior to painting the figure fully clothed, in order to better understand the underlying structure of the body.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dunkerton, et al, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been referred to as a "key voice standing up for the romantic comedy genre".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Early career ==
Morris was born and raised in [[Wandsworth]], London.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/leisure/filmandtv/14042656.Man_Up_writer_Tess_Morris_on_becoming_a_Bafta_Breakthrough_Brit_and_her_love_of_south_London/|title=Interview: Man Up screenwriter Tess Morris on romantic comedy, Simon Pegg, Bafta's Breakthrough Brits list and growing up in Wandsworth|last=Palmer|first=Jim|date=19 Nov 2015|website=News Shopper|publisher=|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended university in South London where she completed a TV and Film degree.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gant, Charles. "Man Up." ''Sight &amp; Sound'' 25.6 (2015): 14-15. ''Film &amp; Television Literature Index''. Web. 2 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, while she was still in university, Morris wrote a short film titled ''Beer Goggles''. The short was directed by [[David Mackenzie (director)|David Mackenzie]] as part of the Lloyds Bank/Channel Four Film Challenge. Her team's film won first place and was broadcast on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-writer-tess-morris-talks-man-up-starring-simon-pegg-lake-bell-and-her-favorite-rom-coms-20150529|title=Interview: Writer Tess Morris Talks 'Man Up' Starring Simon Pegg &amp; Lake Bell And Her Favorite Rom-Coms|last=Lyttelton|first=Oliver|date=29 May 2015|website=blogs.indiewire.com|publisher=Indie Wire|access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After university, Morris became a journalist for teen news publishers where she regularly interviewed the cast of ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', a British soap opera.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After hearing of scriptwriting job opportunities, Morris became a writer for ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' at the age of 23.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonscreenwritersfestival.com/speakers/tess-morris|title=Tess Morris: Screenwriter |website=London Screenwriters' Festival|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote 18 episodes over the following two years, gaining a reputation on the show for her comedic scripts.

Looking for work outside ''Hollyoaks'', Morris wrote a pilot for a sitcom based on her relationship with her Jewish grandmother titled ''Granny and Annie,'' but had no luck in getting it made. However, this pilot did get Morris noticed by the UK production company DLT Entertainment, who then hired her to write for their sitcom, ''[[My Family]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After writing for one season of ''[[My Family]]'', Morris spent a few years writing several spec scripts with different co-writers but never managed to sell any of them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Later career and ''Man Up'' ==
After struggling to sell her TV spec scripts, Morris got a job as a script reader for the [[BFI Production Board|BFI]] and [[Film4]]. During this time, she co-produced a short film called ''Rise of the Appliances'' with producer [[Richard Holmes (producer)|Richard Holmes]]. Morris claims she began to miss screenwriting and, based on some of the BFI script submissions she deemed were bad, she decided she would be able to write her own feature script.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After a break-up, Morris moved back in with her parents and promised them that if her feature script did not get picked up, she would find a "proper job".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/28/simon-pegg-i-find-it-very-hard-to-write-for-women-man-up-tess-morris|title=Simon Pegg: ‘I find it very hard to write for women’|last=Barton|first=Laura|date=2015-05-28|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, she was chosen for the [[BFI Production Board|BFI]]/Skillset Think Shoot Distribute Scheme for emerging talent in the British film industry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Morris came up with the premise for her feature, ''[[Man Up (film)|Man Up]],'' when she was approached by a stranger at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]] who asked her if she was his blind date, which made her wonder what may have happened if she had lied and told him yes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

She began writing ''[[Man Up (film)|Man Up]]'' in January 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her inspirations for this film were [[Nora Ephron]], [[Woody Allen]] and [[Nancy Meyers]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/06/interview-a-conversation-with-man-up-screenwriter-tess-morris.html|title=Interview: A conversation with Man Up screenwriter Tess Morris|last=Collinson|first=Gary|date=5 June 2015|website=flickeringmyth.com|publisher=Flickering Myth|access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films which inspired her the most are ''[[When Harry Met Sally...|When Harry Met Sally]]'', ''[[Moonstruck]]'' and ''[[As Good as It Gets|As Good as it Gets]]''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To help her build the cinematic structure, Morris read Billy Mernit's book, ''Writing for the Romantic Comedy''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Morris finished the spec script in three months then submitted it to [[Big Talk Productions]] who optioned it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Man Up was directed by [[Ben Palmer]], and starred [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Lake Bell]]. It was released in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2013/11/lake-bell-to-star-in-rom-com-man-up-opposite-simon-pegg-inbetweeners-ben-palmer-to-direct-638237/|title=Lake Bell To Star In Rom-Com ‘Man Up’ Opposite Simon Pegg; ‘Inbetweeners’ Ben Palmer To Direct|last=Yamato|first=Jen|date=2013-11-19|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the release of ''Man Up'', Morris has continued to work with Big Talk. She is writing a romantic comedy for Big Talk and [[BBC Films]] as well as a TV pilot for Lucky Giant and [[NBC]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Morris and Mernit host the romantic comedy-focused podcast ''You Had Us At Hello''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/you-had-us-at-hello/id1215934253?mt=2|title=You Had Us At Hello by Tess Morris on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, she joined the writing staff of [[Hulu]]'s comedy-drama series ''[[Casual (TV series)|Casual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jtmanagement.co.uk/clients/tess-morris/|title=Tess Morris|date=2015-05-21|work=JTM|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Back-up Plan''''' (previously known as '''''Plan B''''') is a 2010 American [[romantic comedy]] film, starring [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Alex O'Loughlin]].&lt;ref name=variety&gt;Siegel, Tatiana, and Michael Fleming. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997431.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 "Jennifer Lopez going with 'Plan B': CBS Films seeking director for project"], '[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was released theatrically in the U.S. on April 23, 2010, and later in other regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theback-upplan.com/ Official website]. Retrieved March 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This was [[Tom Bosley]]'s final acting role before his death in October that year.

==Plot==
Zoe ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) gives up on finding the man of her dreams, decides to become a single mother and undergoes artificial insemination. The same day she meets Stan ([[Alex O'Loughlin]]) when they both try to hail the same taxi. They run into each other twice more at a farmers market and a pet store. Stan convinces Zoe to go on a no-obligations date. Zoe is still uncertain whether she is pregnant or not and if she should tell Stan. The night she takes the test, Stan takes her for a romantic dinner in a garden. Things don't turn out as well as planned when he spills the wine and a fire occurs. At the end of the night Stan asks her to come to his farm during the weekend and Zoe finds out that she is pregnant.

She goes to the farm determined to tell him that she is pregnant. They have sex  and afterwards Stan is confused and angry that she didn't tell him before and Zoe leaves the next morning believing that things are over between them.  However, Stan decides he still wants to be with her and they reconcile. They go to the doctor and find out that Zoe is actually carrying twins. Overwhelmed, Stan goes to a children's playing area to figure out what it means to be a father, but is suspected to be a pervert; this is soon cleared up. He finds a friend there that he can talk to about the pregnancy throughout the movie, while Zoe gets little support from her Single Mothers and Proud group when the group members discover she is no longer single. Stan takes the next step to becoming a father and orders a stroller for the twins. After many misunderstandings and comedic revelations, Zoe and Stan are walking into the Market when they run into Stan's ex-girlfriend. Due to Stan's remark that the twins are not his, Zoe believes that he is not ready to become a father to them, and breaks off the relationship.

Later, the stroller that Stan ordered arrives and Zoe figures out that Stan was never planning to leave. At her grandmother's wedding, Zoe's water breaks and on the way to the hospital they make a pit stop at the Market. Zoe apologizes to Stan and they begin to work things out. He pulls out the penny that she turned over when they first met and Zoe promises to trust him more. Zoe gives birth to twin girls, one of whom they name Penny. In the end, Stan opens a store/restaurant next to Zoe's pet shop and after the Grand Opening speech Stan asks Zoe to marry him and she says yes. On their way home, she spontaneously throws up into a trash can and realizes that she may be yet again pregnant.

Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a positive review saying, "A winning performance by Jennifer Lopez overcomes a formulaic and predictable rom-com that involves a planned pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/the-back-up-plan-film-review-1004080985.story | title=The Back-Up Plan -- Film Review | author=Honeycutt, Kirk | date=2010-04-07 | work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] wrote that the film is "not very good" and "bland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/movies/23backup.html?8dpc | title=Movie Review - The Back-Up Plan - Love Means Having to Say, ‘I Feel ...’ | author=Dargis, Manohla | date=2010-04-22 | work=The New York Times | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amy Biancolli of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' praised the cast in her review writing "Lopez does a fine job mortifying herself in pursuit of physical humor, shifting her center of gravity in more ways than one. O'Loughlin, in the blander role, acts hurt or shocked or besotted where required, but the supporting players nearly steal the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/04/22/MVIK1D27U9.DTL#ixzz0lywtVyTa |author= Biancolli, Amy |title= Review: 'The Back-Up Plan' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]], Inc. |accessdate= 2010-04-23 |date= 2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 1/4 stars, claiming the film "plays like an unendurable TV commercial about beautiful people with great lifestyles and not a thought in their empty little heads."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100421/REVIEWS/100429995 | author= Ebert, Roger |title=The Back-up Plan :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media]] |work= rogerebert.com | date=2010-04-21 |accessdate= 2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Princess and the Marine''''' is a [[2001 in film|2001]] [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[Television film|made-for-television]] [[Romance film|romantic movie]] based on the true story of [[United States Marine Corps|American Marine]] Jason Johnson and [[Bahrain]] [[Princess]] [[Meriam Al-Khalifa]], with stars [[Mark-Paul Gosselaar]] and [[Marisol Nichols]] in the roles of Jason and Meriam.

==Plot==
[[Meriam Al Khalifa]] ([[Marisol Nichols]]) is a Bahraini royal who is not content to be in an arranged marriage, even though her strict [[Muslim]] parents would never allow a union with a non-Muslim. In the movie, Meriam is allowed to go to the local mall and watch and listen to American [[pop culture]].

One day, she desperately makes some random calls to strangers, including a Marine stationed at the U.S. embassy named Jason Johnson ([[Mark-Paul Gosselaar]]). After meeting, the two become friends and later fall in love, but Meriam doesn't tell anyone because of her parents. After being caught kissing at the [[Tree of Life (Bahrain)|Tree of Life]], her mother forbids any more contact between the two. Meriam and Jason exchange letters with the help of a jeweler in the mall, and plan to run away to America with a fake passport for Meriam and pass her off as a fellow Marine.

Once in America, Meriam is taken in by the local authorities for being an illegal immigrant and is separated from Jason. Meriam is released after asking for [[political asylum|asylum]], saying she'd be disowned or even killed if she returned to Bahrain. Meriam and Jason marry in Las Vegas, and he is stripped of his insignia and rank to Private in the Marines.

The film concludes with Meriam and Jason stationed at a base, looking outside at an American flag, while a Marine holding a copy of the [[Quran]] salutes. It is then that Meriam tells Jason that this is what she believes in (America - freedom).

'''Theatreworks USA''' is a professional, not-for-profit [[theatre]] for young and family audiences founded in 1961.  The company is based out of [[New York City]], but has touring productions that run through forty-nine states as well as parts of [[Canada]].  Plays and musicals produced by Theatreworks have reached over 90 million children, teachers and families since the company's founding.

==Free Summer Theatre==

Since 1989 Theatreworks USA's Free Summer Theatre has provided young people and families with original, professional theatre free of charge.

To date, over 300,000 children have attended free productions of some of the company's most popular shows, including ''[[Junie B. Jones]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[Sarah, Plain and Tall]]''.  According to its own literature, Theatreworks believes "all children should experience the excitement of going to the theatre, regardless of their financial circumstances."  Roma Torre, a [[NY1]] reporter, has said the following of the program:&lt;ref&gt;NY1 News; 2006-07-20; ''[http://www.ny1.com/content/pages/61180/where-to-go---if-you-give-a-mouse-a-cookie---arthur-s-great-summer--dirty-sock-funtime-band Where To Go: "If You Give A Mouse A Cookie," Arthur's Great Summer, Dirty Sock Funtime Band]''; NY1; Retrieved 2013-09-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|TWUSA has done it again.  Not only is the company's latest production yet another extremely delightful book adaptation for children—it's free.  It's one splendid hour of music, laughter, life lessons and the art of putting on a show.}}

The '''Theatre Royal''' is a historic theatre, a Grade I [[listed building]] situated on [[Grey Street, Newcastle|Grey Street]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

==History==
The theatre was designed by local architects [[John and Benjamin Green]] as part of [[Richard Grainger]]'s grand design for the centre of Newcastle, and was opened on 20 February 1837 with a performance of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.&lt;ref name ="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/happy-180th-birthday-newcastles-magnificent-12620352|date=20 February 2017|title=Happy 180th birthday to Newcastle's magnificent Theatre Royal|publisher=The Chronicle|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first managers here was Thomas Ternan who employed his wife, [[Frances Eleanor Jarman|Frances Ternan]] as the main actress.&lt;ref name=spart&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/ARTternanT.htm Thomas Ternan], John Simkin, Spartacus Educational, retrieved 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The shareholders of the Proprietors` Committee appointed lessees to manage and programme the theatre. The longest running individual lessee, before Ltd companies, was Edward D Davis from 1845 to 1870 during which in 1867 the interior was redesigned by architect [[Charles J. Phipps]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;  William Glover and George Francis, both of the [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow]] took over from 1871 to 1878; to be followed by Charles Bernard of the [[Gaiety Theatre, Glasgow]] until 1882. James Howard and Fred Wyndham of Edinburgh and Glasgow became lessees from 1883 to 1887. Due to their intention, carried out, of also leasing the [[Tyne Theatre and Opera House]], the shareholder committee did not renew their lease of the Royal. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Robert Arthur of Glasgow and now lessee of [[Her Majesty`s Theatre, Dundee]] took over in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Dundee/HerMajestysTheatreDundee.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After the fire of 1899 he instructed architect Frank Matcham to totally redesign the interior, re-opening in 1901. The venues of Robert Arthur Theatres Ltd in Scotland and England, which had many shareholders in Tyneside, prospered until losses overwhelmed the company in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Smith (2008),''The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation'', Glasgow Publications, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the Arthur shareholders, led by the family of [[Joseph Cowen]] MP, appointed a new chairman of the lessee company, Michael Simons, of Glasgow, who in 1895 had created [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1912 onwards the Theatre Royal Newcastle was an important part of the [[Howard &amp; Wyndham]] group, led successfully by chairman Simons, followed by the Cruikshank family, whose [[King's Theatre, Edinburgh]] joined the group in 1928. Newcastle City Council took over ownership in 1967. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Smith (2008),''The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation'', Glasgow Publications, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh formed a triangle of industry, commerce and entertainment business from the 1870s onwards. From 1962  and increasingly from the 1970s the interchange of shows and pantomimes was joined by tours each year of [[Scottish Opera]] and of [[Scottish Ballet]]. [[Opera North]] joined in.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Smith (2008), ''The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation'', Glasgow Publications, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a performance of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', a huge fire destroyed the interior of the building in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butcher |first=Joanne |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-theatre-royal-set-35m-4477317 |title=Newcastle Theatre Royal set for £3.5m restoration |publisher=The Journal |date= |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had its interior redesigned by [[Frank Matcham]]&lt;ref name = "guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/sep/09/theatre-royal-newcastle-frank-matcham-grey-street-wakefield-blackpool-firth-carpets|date=9 September 2011|publisher=The Guardian|title=Geordieland's theatrical phoenix spreads its bright new wings|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reopened on 31 December 1901.&lt;ref name ="chronicle"/&gt; Externally, the building is exactly as it was when it was first built.

It underwent a major refurbishment and restoration in the latter part of the 1980s, reopening on 11 January 1988 with a performance of ''[[A Man For All Seasons]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]].

The Theatre Royal went dark on 14 March 2011 due to a major restoration of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 [[Frank Matcham]] [[Edwardian]] interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The [[proscenium]] arch, tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style theatre seats in keeping with the restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. Wheelchair spaces were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes at the rear of the grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total number of boxes up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for [[opera]] and [[musicals]]. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New [[frescos]] for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This £4.75m project introduced higher standards of comfort and improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with [[Alan Bennett]]’s epic period drama ''[[The Madness of George III]]'';&lt;ref name = "guardian"/&gt; [[George III]] was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter.

The theatre currently hosts a variety of shows, including ballet, contemporary dance, drama, musicals and opera.The Christmas [[pantomime]] is one of the UK's most popular.

Almost all of the shows that come to the Theatre Royal are part of national British tours, and in a typical year the theatre will have 30 to 35 visiting shows.  For the annual pantomime, and any visiting musicals and opera performances, there is a sizeable orchestra pit available which can seat 60 musicians if necessary.  The stage itself is also of substantial size, and can house 50 singers, dancers, actors and musicians.

==The Original Theatre Royal==
Newcastle's original Theatre Royal opened on 21 January 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp229-231 |title=Public buildings: The Theatre Royal &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its location on Mosley Street obstructed plans for the redevelopment of the city centre (as it was on the route of [[Grey Street, Newcastle|Grey Street]]), so it was demolished to make way for the present building. One of the theatre's most successful managers at this time was [[Stephen Kemble]] of the famous [[Kemble family]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/18th-century-newcastle-theatre-royal-8635356&lt;/ref&gt; who managed the theatre from 1791 to 1806. The original theatre's final performance was on 25 June 1836.

==Technical details==
The current theatre has a [[proscenium stage]], and accommodates a variable orchestra pit on 2 lifts - which reduces the stall seating. The audience is seated on four levels: stalls (501), grand circle (252), upper circle (249) and gallery (247).

==Project A==
Project A is a one-year actor training programme led by an artistic director and supported by leading industry specialists. Delivered from within the Theatre Royal over an academic year (3 terms) participants gain professional standard actor training culminating in a production term to be performed in the Studio Theatre and toured nationally.

The course started in September 2015 with the first year free for the successful actors. The programme is seen as an alternative to drama school and is expected to lift the actors involved into the industry.

The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] have very strong ties to the theatre and are involved with the programme heavily in the second term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/taking-part/project-a Theatre Royal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912125220/http://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/taking-part/project-a |date=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodgson |first=Barbara |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/newcastle-theatre-royal-launches-young-9398928 |title=Newcastle Theatre Royal launches young actor training scheme |publisher=Chronicle Live |date=2015-06-05 |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time Transfixed''''' ('''''La Durée poignardée''''') is an [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by the Belgian [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]]. It is part of the permanent collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and is usually on display in the museum's new Modern Wing.&lt;ref name ="AIC1"&gt;{{cite web

The painting was one of many done for surrealist patron and Magritte supporter [[Edward James]]. This was the second painting delivered to James for his London ballroom. The first was the portrait of James, ''[[Not to be Reproduced]]''.&lt;ref name ="AIC2"&gt;{{cite web

The painting depicts an [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]{{cn|date=January 2016}} [[4-6-0|4-6-0 Locomotive]] jutting out of a [[fireplace]], at full steam, in an empty room. Above the mantelpiece is a tall mirror. Only the clock and one candlestick standing on the mantelpiece are reflected in the [[mirror]].&lt;ref name="AIC2" /&gt;

==The artist's perspective==
The title of the painting translates to English literally as '''''Ongoing Time Stabbed by a Dagger''''', and Magritte was reportedly unhappy with the generally accepted translation of ''Time Transfixed''.&lt;ref name="AMICA"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.davidrumsey.com/amica/amico649500-5784.html
 | title = René Magritte / Time Transfixed / 1938
 | website = The AMICA Library
 | date = 2007
 | publisher = Cartography Associates
 | access-date = 24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte hoped that James would hang the painting at the base of his staircase so that the train would "stab" guests on their way up to the ballroom. James instead chose to hang the painting above his own fireplace.&lt;ref name="AIC2" /&gt;

Magritte described his motivation for this painting:
:"I decided to paint the image of a locomotive... In order for its mystery to be evoked, another ''immediately'' familiar image without mystery—the image of a dining room fireplace—was joined."&lt;ref name="AIC2" /&gt;

'''Waterlow and Sons Limited''' was a major worldwide engraver of [[currency]], [[postage stamps]], [[stock]]s and bond certificates based in London, Watford and Dunstable in [[England]]. The company was founded as a family business in 1810. It was acquired in 1961 by [[De La Rue]].

==Early history==
Waterlow and Sons originated from the business of James Waterlow, who began producing lithographic copies of legal documents at Birchin Lane in London in 1810. The company gradually grew; it began printing stamps in 1852, and Waterlow' sons Alfred, Walter, [[Sir Sydney Waterlow, 1st Baronet|Sydney]] and Albert joined the business. James Waterlow died in 1876, and the company became a limited-liability company. In 1877, due to a family dispute, the company split, and Alfred and his sons formed Waterlow Bros. &amp; Layton. The two companies later reunited in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterlow and Sons Limited|work=NMSI|publisher=National Museums of Science &amp; Industry|url=http://collectionsonline.nmsi.ac.uk/detail.php?type=related&amp;kv=2719&amp;t=people|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterlow and Sons: 1934 Review|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Waterlow_and_Sons:_1934_Review|work=Grace's Guide|publisher=Grace's Guide|accessdate=10 March 2012}} Based on {{cite book|chapter=Printing by Every Process|title=British Commerce and Industry: The Post-War Transition 1919–1934|publisher=Russell-Square Press|year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the company printed 1, 5 and 10 [[Iranian toman|toman]] banknotes that bore the watermark of [[Lion and Sun]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Shargi|first1=Ali|title=ESKENĀS|date=15 December 1998|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskenas|volume=VIII/6|pages=615–624|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portuguese banknote crisis==
{{see|Alves dos Reis}}[[File:Quinhentos Escudos, 1922 - Emissão Alves dos Reis.png|thumb|250px]]Waterlow's was involved in the [[Portuguese Bank Note Crisis]] of 1925. The [[Bank of Portugal|Banco de Portugal]] sued Waterlow &amp; Sons in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in [[London]] because of [[counterfeiting]]. In one of the most complex trials in legal history, the case was finally settled in favour of the Bank in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/22338/|title=The Effects Of The 1925 Portuguese Bank Note Crisis|last=Wigan|first=Henry|date=February 2004|publisher=Department of Economic History, [[London School of Economics]]|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bank of England banknotes==
In 1921 the [[Bank of England]] gained a legal [[monopoly]] on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales, a process that started with the [[Bank Charter Act]] of 1844 when the ability of other banks to issues notes was restricted.

On 22 November 1928 the Bank issued notes for ten [[shilling]]s and one pound for the first time when the Bank took over responsibility for these denominations from the Treasury which had issued notes of these denominations three days after the declaration of [[World War I|war]] in 1914 in order to remove gold [[coin]]s from circulation. The treasury bills had been printed by Waterlows, and the loss of the contract contributed to the closure of Waterlow's operations at Milton Street in [[Watford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nunn|first=JB|title=The Book of Watford|publisher=Pageprint (Watford) Ltd|location=Watford|year=1987|isbn=0-9511777-1-0}} p171&lt;/ref&gt;

==De La Rue ownership==
Waterlow's was acquired by [[Purnell and Sons]] in 1961, but Purnell sold Waterlow's segment that printed banknotes, postage stamps, traveler's checks, and bonds to [[De La Rue]] soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Murray Teigh|title=The Man Who Stole Portugal|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 De La Rue acquired the [[banknote]] printing operations of the Bank of England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm Bank of England: Sale of Bank Note Printing Operations]&lt;/ref&gt; 75 years after Waterlow's had lost the business.

Waterlow and Sons Ltd was dissolved in January 2009.&lt;ref name=CoHo/&gt;
