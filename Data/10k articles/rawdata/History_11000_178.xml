      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7793">'''''Anonym[o]us Valesianus''''' (Excerptum Valesianum [I and II]) is the conventional title of a compilation of two fragmentary [[vulgar Latin]] [[chronicle]]s, named for its 17th-century editor, [[Henri Valois|Henri Valois, or Henricus Valesius]] (1603–76), who published the text for the first time in 1636, together with his first printed edition of the [[Ammianus Marcellinus|''Res Gestae'' of Ammianus Marcellinus]]. It took almost another fifty years when his brother Hadrian re-edited the work of Anonymus in the edition of Ammianus Marcellinus in 1681. It was the first time when Excerpta Valesiana, that is the edition of the Pars Posterior was clearly separated from other fragments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kovács|first=Tamás|year=2017|title=Some remarks on Anonymus Valesianus Pars Posterior|url=http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/12031/1/KOVACS_Some_remarks_on_Anonymus_Valesianus_Pars_Posterior.pdf|journal=Chronica: Annual of the Institute of History|volume=13|pages=5–16|via=SZTE Publicatio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts exist only in a single ninth-century manuscript in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Berolinensis 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection later turned up in the Jesuit ''Collège de Clermont'' in Paris. The parchment bundle, originally consisted of 34 flimsy layers – a manuscript prepared by nine different hands – was later ordered and attached together according to the hands. The collection appeared in the catalogue of the Jesuit college at the occasion of the sale of the library by auction in 1764. The collection was sold and transferred to a certain Johannes Meermann (''Codex Meermannus'' 794) in the Hague. Following the death of Meermann, the collection was possessed by an English collector Sir Thomas Phillipps (''Codex Phillippsianus 1885''). Later, through the heirs, it was taken by the German State Library in Berlin in 1887 where it is accessible today under the shelf-mark: ‘''Ms. Phill. 1885’''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are sometimes referred to as the '''''Excerpta Valesiani'''''.

The work of the Anonymus Valesianus is a debated issue of historiography for more than one hundred years, all the more so as both the identity of the author and the circumstances of the compilation of the work are obscure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek and Roman Historiography in the Late Antiquity Fourth to Sixth Century A.D.|last=Winkelmann|first=Friedhelm|last3=|publisher=Brill|year=2003|isbn=90 04 11275 8|location=Leiden - Boston|pages=3–43|chapter=Historiography int the Age of Constantine|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Anonymus Valesianus I ==
''Anonymus Valesianus'' I, sometimes given the separate conventional title '''''Origo Constantini Imperatoris''''' ("The Lineage of the Emperor Constantine") possibly dates from around 390, and is generally regarded as providing a reliable  source. The beginning of Origo already looks like the final sentence of an account on the rule of [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1963 Arnaldo Momigliano summarized the results of scholarship on Origo Constantini in the words that ''“All is in doubt about the first part of the Anonymus Valesianus”.'' There are questions left, with regard to the date of Origo’s editions, sources, and revisions, which have not yet found convincing answers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Anonymus Valesianus II ==
''Anonymus Valesianus'' II, sometimes referred to as the '''''Pars Posterior''''', written after 526 and probably between 540 and 550.&lt;ref&gt;"The Anonymous Valesianus covered the period 474-526 essentially from a Catholic-exarchate point of view and was probably written near Ravenna ca. 540-550" (Thomas S. Burns, ''The Ostrogoths: kingship and society'', 1980:66).&lt;/ref&gt; The text, which mostly deals with the reign of the [[Goth]]ic king in Italy, [[Theodoric the Great]]. The identity of the author and the circumstances of the compilation of the Pars Posterior is obscure, however a few scholars think it "based on a no longer extant chronicle by the [[bishop of Ravenna]], [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximianus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Nathan, "The fate of [[Romulus Augustulus]]", ''[[Classica et Mediaevalia|Classica et Mediaevalia: Revue Danoise de Philologie et d'Histoire]]'' 1993:268 note 23; the connection to Maximianus was made by Thomas Hodgkin, ''Italy and Her Invaders: The Ostrogothic invasion, 476-535''. 1896:261.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pars Posterior consists of 60 chapters and it presents the chain of events as a chronicle from Chapter 36 to 59: from the rule of [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]], through the decline of the power of [[Odoacer]], up to the succession of [[Theoderic the Great|Theodoric the Great]] in 493. In the next section, from Chapter 60 to 79, the description of the rule of [[Theodoric the Great]] – the Italian ruler of Germanic origin – can be found. Besides the description of political events the author dwells on portraying the major virtues of the ruler through different narratives. In the closing section (Chapter 80 to 96) the author describes the tragic years of [[Theoderic the Great|Theodoric's]] rule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The work was used by [[Edward Gibbon]] as a major source for the Roman perspective on the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic]] period in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awMQRkgTaKwC&amp;pg=PA143 |title=Edward Gibbon and Empire |author=T.S.Brown |chapter=Gibbon, Hodgkin and the invaders of Italy|isbn=9780521525053 |date=1991-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austin M. Woodbury''' (1899 near Spencer, in the [[Hawkesbury River|Hawkesbury]] Valley of [[New South Wales]] &amp;ndash; 1979) was an [[Australian]] [[Catholic]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
Woodbury joined the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marist Fathers]] and gained a doctorate in Rome, studying under the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosopher [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]]. In 1945, he founded the Aquinas Academy in [[Sydney]], a school of philosophy aimed mainly at lay people. He headed the Academy until 1975, teaching a strictly scholastic philosophy based on the teaching of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. A combative personality, he was often in conflict with the [[atheist]] Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]], [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]], whom Austin believed was corrupting Sydney's youth. Woodbury died in 1979.

The Aquinas Academy:

The Aquinas Academy was set up under the auspices of the Australian Province of the Marist Fathers by Fr Austin Woodbury SM in March 1945. The Academy began as a centre for the study of Philosophy and Theology in the Thomistic tradition.  For some twenty-nine years it continued in this capacity under Fr Woodbury's guidance, in premises at the back of St Patrick's Church, Gloucester Street, in The Rocks (Sydney, NSW).  For a short while the Academy offered a License in Philosophy under accreditation from the University of St Thomas in Rome.  Since its inception, a number of qualified priests, religious and laity have been part of the lecturing staff.  The Academy was one of the pioneers of Catholic adult education in Australia.

Since 1975, the Academy has increasingly focused on general adult education in the faith.  Perhaps the most popular of the programs mounted was the Christian Growth Program, offering basic education in theology, morality, psychology and spirituality.  During this time the Academy also developed a State-accredited program for religious education teachers, offering a Certificate in Religious Studies.  In these years, also, a wide array of seminars, special lecture series, summer schools and workshops were offered – with presenters from Australia and overseas.  All these programs were designed to contribute in some way to adult education in the faith.  One of the features of the Academy during these latter years has been its mobility – programs have been offered at various centres in and around Sydney and along the eastern seaboard.

Former Principals, Fr Kevin Bates SM and Fr John Thornhill SM with one of the Students to graduate with a Licentiate from the University of St Thomas through the Aquinas Academy, Sr Celestine Pooley RSM
Following the major renovations to the St Patrick’s Church and the surrounding buildings (1998-2001), the Aquinas Academy is now housed on the third and fourth floors – Levels 5 and 7 – of the building at 141 Harrington Street that for many years was St Patrick's Business College.  The first and second floors of that same building are used for parish meeting rooms and offices.

Aquinas Academy continues a significant commitment to adult education in the faith, still under the auspices of the Australian Province of the Marist Fathers.  Together with the Marists, a number of other priests, religious and laity continue to serve the community through the Academy. Aquinas Academy today continues its commitment to adult education within the Catholic tradition to assist people seeking to develop a mature faith.  Situated in Sydney's central business district, the Academy aims most particularly to become a school of spirituality in the heart of the city.

Fr Michael Whelan SM is currently the Director of the Academy. Sr Marie Biddle RSJ is a Lecturer and Coordinator of the Spirituality Program.  There are a number of other visiting and occasional Lecturers and Presenters of various programs, from Australia and overseas.

A '''blast valve''' is used to protect a shelter, such as a [[fallout shelter]] or [[bunker]], from the effects of sudden outside air pressure changes. A [[nuclear weapon]] creates a shock wave, which may produce sudden pressure changes of more than an atmosphere (about 1 bar or 15 pounds per square inch) even several kilometers or miles from the detonation point. After the shock wave passes, a sudden negative pressure follows.

If such pressure waves enter a shelter, they will likely do substantial harm to occupants and equipment. A blast valve is placed in air intake/exhaust pipes, that remains open normally, but automatically closes when strong pressure is applied in either direction. [[Blast damper]]s operate in the same fashion and are related or identical to blast valves, the former name however is generally used to describe blast mitigation devices, for more, [[conventional explosive]] events.

A typical blast valve has entries of 150–300&amp;nbsp;mm diameter (6-12"), and a larger center section. Within the center section is a disk mounted on an axle, with weak springs that keep it centered, away from both entries. Pressure displaces the disk along the axle, until it plugs one entry or the other. After the blast, the springs return the disk to the center, re-opening the valve.

Another type of blast valve employs rounded metal tubes held in place by springs. As pressure rises it pushes the tubes against the frame of the valve closing the opening. These valves are typically unidirectional in airflow and are employed in large wall structures where large amounts of airflow is required.

One form of blast valve, popularized by the book [[Nuclear War Survival Skills]] and tested by [[ORNL]] is worn flat rubber [[tire]] treads nailed or bolted to frames strong enough to resist the maximum overpressure, with tested closing times cited as being identical to commercial grade blast valves, however the use of this form of blast valve design must also take the risk of the flammable rubber catching fire into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p939.htm |title=App. D: Expedient Blast Shelters |publisher=Arnold Jagt |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles K. Bliss''' (1897–1985) was a chemical engineer and [[semiotics|semiotician]], and the inventor of [[Blissymbolics]]. He was born in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and later gained [[Australia]]n citizenship.

==Early life==
Bliss was born '''Karl Kasiel Blitz''', the eldest of four children to Michel Anchel and Jeanette Blitz, in [[Chernivtsi]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (current [[Ukraine]]). The family were impoverished and the senior Blitz supported the family as an [[optician]], [[mechanic]], and [[lathe (tool)|wood turner]].

Later on Bliss said that the symbols on his father's [[circuit diagram]]s made instant sense to him. They were a "logical language". He was similarly impressed by [[chemical symbols]], which he thought could be read by anyone, regardless of their [[first language|mother tongue]].

Bliss's early life was difficult. It was cold and his family were poor and hungry. Because the family was [[Jewish]], he suffered [[anti-Semitic]] taunts.

When Bliss was eight years old, Russia lost the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Russian [[pogrom]]s against the Jews accelerated, and refugees came into Bliss's town from the nearby Russian town of [[Chişinău|Kishinev]]. Also in 1905 Bliss saw a slide show of the [[Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition]] of [[Karl Weyprecht|Weyprecht]] and [[Julius von Payer|Payer]]. It inspired him to study engineering to improve technology for ordinary people.

==Detention and Second World War==
Bliss graduated from the [[Vienna University of Technology]] as a [[chemical engineer]] in 1922. He joined Telefunken, a German television and radio apparatus company, and rose to be chief of the patent department.

In March 1938, the [[Third Reich]] annexed [[Austria]] via the [[Anschluss]], and Bliss, as a Jew, was sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Later. he was moved to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. His wife, Claire, a German [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], made constant efforts to have him released. He was released but was required to leave the country for [[England]] immediately. In England, Bliss tried to bring his wife to him, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 made that impossible. It was there that, because the Nazi bombing of England was called the "blitz," he changed his surname to Bliss.

Bliss arranged for Claire to escape Germany via his family in Czernowitz, [[Romania]] (now called [[Chernivtsi]] and in the [[Ukraine]]). Needing to leave there, Claire moved on to [[Greece]] and safety, until October 1940 when [[Italy]] invaded Greece. The couple were reunited on Christmas Eve 1940, after Claire continued east to [[Shanghai]] and Charles went west to Shanghai via [[Canada]] and [[Japan]].

After the Japanese occupied Shanghai, Bliss and his wife were placed into the [[Hongkew ghetto]]. Claire, as a German and a Christian had the option of claiming her German citizenship, applying for a divorce and being released. She did not do so but accompanied Bliss into the ghetto.

In Shanghai, Bliss became interested in [[Chinese characters]], which he mistakenly thought were [[ideogram]]s. He studied them and learned how to read shop signs and Chinese newspapers. With some astonishment, he one day realised that he had been reading the symbols off not in Chinese, but in his own language, German. With ideograms for his inspiration, Bliss set out to develop a system of writing by pictures. At that time Bliss had not become aware of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s "[[characteristica universalis|Universal Symbolism]]".

==Australia==
Bliss and his wife migrated to [[Australia]] after the war, reaching Australia in July 1946. His semiotic ideas met with universal rejection. Bliss, without any Australian or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] qualifications had to work as a [[manual labour|labourer]] to support his family. He worked on his system of symbols at night. Bliss and his wife became Australian citizens.

Originally Bliss had called his system "World Writing" because the aim was to establish a series of symbols that would be understood by all, regardless of language. Bliss then decided an English-language name was too restricted and called the system Semantography. In Sydney in 1949 Bliss published the three-volume ''International Semantography: A non-alphabetical Symbol Writing readable in all languages''. There was no great positive reaction. For the next four years Claire Bliss sent 6,000 letters to educators and universities, to no better effect.

Bliss's wife died in 1961 after years of ill health.

In 1965 Bliss published a second edition of his work, ''Semantography (Blissymbolics)''.

==Partial success==
It was about this time that the increase in international tourism convinced many that only a pictorial symbol language could be understood by all. Bliss made sure his idea was attached to his name, hence Blissymbolics.

In 1971, Bliss learned that since 1965, a particular centre in Canada had been using his symbols to teach children with [[cerebral palsy]] to communicate. He was thrilled at first, but he became horrified when he learned that the center had extended his set of symbols and was using the symbols as a bridge to help the children learn to use spoken and written words in a traditional language, which were far from his vision for Blissymbolics. He badgered and eventually sued the center, at one time even threatening a nurse with imprisonment. After ten years of constant attacks from Bliss, the center came to a compromise with Bliss because it felt the publicity he drew to be bringing a bad name to the center. The world copyright for use of his symbols with handicapped children was licensed to the Blissymbolics Communication Foundation in Canada.

==Recognition==
Bliss was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (A.M.) in 1976 for "services to the community, particularly to handicapped children".&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/131822763 Awards in Order of Australia, ''The Canberra Times'', (Saturday, 12 June 1976)&lt; p8.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the basis of the recognition of the innovative nature of his work, Bliss was appointed an Honorary Fellow in Linguistics at the [[Australian National University]], by the (then) Head of the ANU School of Linguistics, [[R. M. W. Dixon|Professor Bob Dixon]], in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110937602 'Symbol Man' an ANU Fellow, ''The Canberra Times'', (Thursday, 29 March 1979), p.10.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a chronological summary of the major events of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The first matches in the group stages of the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Football events]] were played on Wednesday 3 August. The [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] took place on Friday 5 August. The last day of competition and the [[2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] was on Sunday 21 August. With 306 sets of medals, the games featured 28 [[Olympic sports]], including [[rugby sevens]] and [[golf]], which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city, and at five in [[São Paulo]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brasília]], and [[Manaus]].

Due to the [[European migrant crisis]] and other reasons, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) allowed athletes to compete under the [[Olympic Flag]] as part of the "[[Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Refugee Olympic Team]]" (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form this team.&lt;ref name="BBC-ROA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/35710578 |title=Rio 2016: Refugee team to compete at Olympics |accessdate=3 March 2016 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as "[[Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Athletes]]" (IOA).&lt;ref name="guardian-yuliya2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/01/russian-whistleblower-yulia-stepanova-cleared-neutral-athlete-rio|title=Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova to compete as ‘neutral athlete’ in Rio|website=The Guardian|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cinetrain "Soyuzkino"'''  - three railroad cars that during the first five-year plan have been adopted by director [[Aleksandr Medvedkin]] for rapid developing, processing and assembly of [[film]], as well as the entire crew accommodation. Field equipment was installed in one of the cars.

Like the armoured train of the Civil War, Cinetrain Medvedkin made "sweeping raids shock construction projects Five Year Plan" [1]. His goal Medvedkin seen in the creation of documentary film material as quickly as possible:&lt;blockquote&gt;The film is in one box! Acute! Taking her heart! Made quickly, he must cling to the big screen thriller as a burr in the dog's tail and go with him on any road film distribution [2].&lt;/blockquote&gt;The severity of raised topics and timely responses allow you to put shorts Medvedkin on a par with modern telehronikoy: "Arriving at an ordinary object, it is the move to remove" hot "subjects, they immediately showed, mounted and on the same day, or at least the next demonstrated at a local club or theatre, to the indescribable delight of the audience "[1]. The idea was to, exposing the shortcomings, to convince the audience of the need to improve the production process.

Medvedkinskiy's idea of cinetrain provoked a lively response among the French left the 1960s. Figures of the "Medvedkin" led by [[Chris Marker]] perceived Medvedkin as "Che Guevara of cinema" - "enthusiast combat propaganda created almost-partisan, in the shortest time and at the scene" [3]. All 60 films created in Cinetrain, considered at the time lost. Only in 1980 years, some of them found in the archive of a young film critic Nikolai Izvolov [4].

The '''CONSOL Energy Mine Map Preservation Project''' is a project to preserve and digitize maps of underground coal mines in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

The project is a joint venture between the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]], the [[United States Department of the Interior]] [[Office of Surface Mining]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]] University Library System, and [[CONSOL Energy]].&lt;ref name=aeb59&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Amy E. |title=CONSOL Energy Mine Map Preservation Project |work=www.pitt.edu |publisher= |date=2009-08-26 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~aeb59/index.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9UKXLTO?url=http://www.pitt.edu/~aeb59/index.html |archivedate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origin of the collection traces back to 1991, when the Pennsylvania-based coal company [[CONSOL Energy]] began depositing mine map materials at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] archives.&lt;ref name=aeb59 /&gt; By 2004, CONSOL Energy had donated a vast collection of records, survey books, photographs, and mining maps.&lt;ref name=partner&gt;{{cite web| title = ULS partners to preserve mining maps| work = University Times| publisher = | date = January 22, 2009| url = http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-DB=ustory&amp;-Format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;storyid=8474&amp;-Find| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5lcDOFASU?url=http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-DB=ustory&amp;-Format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;storyid=8474&amp;-Find| archivedate = 2009-11-28| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall,  the collection has grown to over 8,000 individual map sheets relating to mines operated by CONSOL Energy and its corporate subsidiaries throughout Southwestern Pennsylvania in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]], [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]], [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington]], [[Greene County, Pennsylvania|Greene]], [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette]], and [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset Counties]].&lt;ref name=aeb59 /&gt; The maps are needed for mine safety, transportation planning, mine subsidence insurance.&lt;ref name=aic08 /&gt; The program often consults with homeowners and developers building new properties or dealing with mine subsidence.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt;  The preservation of historic mine maps took on increased importance following the [[Quecreek Mine Rescue]] in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], where the rescue was hampered by faulty maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Smith |first=Craig |title=Project preserves, digitizes maps of thousands of mines |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Tribune Review]] |date=January 16, 2009 |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_607371.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9UL5lSn?url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_607371.html |archivedate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the project received $100,000 to be paid over five years from [[CONSOL Energy]], $75,000 from the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]] and $25,000 from the [[Office of Surface Mining]].&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt;

==Map collections==
The collection dates between 1854 and 2002, with most maps dating between 1880 and 1940.&lt;ref name=aeb59 /&gt; The project preservation and digitization efforts are focused on roughly 700 “hardback” maps, which are drafted by hand on heavyweight paper adhered to canvas. The hardback maps are generally oversized, sometimes 5&amp;nbsp;feet tall and 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;feet long. These maps, which were used as the "master copies" for other map reproductions, are generally considered the most complete, and sometimes the exclusive map of some abandoned mines.&lt;ref name=aeb59 /&gt;

==Conservation &amp; Digitization process==
In 2007, University Library System staff members began the process of surveying, cleaning, and repairing the maps in order to stabilize them.&lt;ref name=aeb59 /&gt; Maps are dry cleaned with soot sponges to remove surface dirt.
[[File:gastonvilleclean.jpg|thumb|alt= Map cleaned with soot sponges |A mine map that has been cleaned with soot sponges on the left half]]

The canvas backing of the maps are vacuumed; those with significant damage are repaired with muslin patches and an [[Ethylene vinyl acetate]] adhesive.&lt;ref name=treatment&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Amy E. |title=Treatment: CONSOL Energy Mine Map Preservation Project |work=www.pitt.edu |publisher= |date=2009-02-18 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~aeb59/treatment.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lcDUEJT1?url=http://www.pitt.edu/~aeb59/treatment.html |archivedate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to unroll brittle maps, some of which haven't been opened in over 100 years, the conservator and student assistants use a process of humidification, flattening, and drying to safely open the maps without causing additional damage.&lt;ref name=treatment /&gt; First, the maps are placed in a large humidity dome. After 5 or 6 hours of absorbing humidity the maps can be safely unrolled.&lt;ref name=treatment /&gt; The maps dry flat between polyester webbing and wool felts overnight.&lt;ref name=treatment /&gt; The majority of student assistants performing the preservation work are enrolled in the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences]].&lt;ref name=aic08&gt;{{cite web|last=Croft |first=Jean Ann |author2=Amy Baker |author3=Joseph Taranto |author4=James Welsh |title=What Lies Beneath: Treatment of Canvas-backed Pennsylvania Coal Mining Maps for Digitization |work=www.pitt.edu |publisher=University Library System |year=2008 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~aeb59/aic08.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lcDkxYVP?url=http://www.pitt.edu/~aeb59/aic08.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the maps are transferred to the [[Office of Surface Mining]] [[National Mine Map Repository]] in [[Green Tree]], [[Pennsylvania]], where they are catalogued and scanned into a digital format.&lt;ref name=aeb59 /&gt; The scanning process uses an overhead Cruse scanner that has a suction table for maps that do not lay flat.&lt;ref name=scanning&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Amy E. |title=Scanning:  CONSOL Energy Mine Map Preservation Project |work=www.pitt.edu |publisher= |date=2009-01-26 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~aeb59/scanning.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lcEGHDiy?url=http://www.pitt.edu/~aeb59/scanning.html |archivedate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scanned image files are recorded in [[Tagged Image File Format|.tiff]] file format.&lt;ref name=scanning /&gt;  The [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]] office in [[California, Pennsylvania]] [[Georeference|prepares]] then the digital files for use in [[geographic information system]] programs for use within the Pennsylvania Historical Underground Mine Maps Inventory System.&lt;ref name=aeb59 /&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite web|last=Blake |first=Sharon S. |title=Pitt’s ULS Gets $200,000 to Continue Restoring Century-old CONSOL Mining Maps |work=Pitt Chronicle |publisher= |date=January 20, 2009 |url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=2030 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616233759/http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=2030 |archivedate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original maps are returned to University of Pittsburgh archives for permanent storage.&lt;ref name=aeb59 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="163365">The [[writ]] of '''''coram nobis''''' (also known as ''writ of error coram nobis'', ''writ of coram vobis'', or ''writ of error coram vobis'') is a legal order allowing a court to correct its original judgment upon discovery of a [[fundamental error]] that did not appear in the records of the original judgment's proceedings and would have prevented the judgment from being pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2020995530047118426&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Mixon'', 983 S.W.2d 661, 672 (Tenn. 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "coram nobis" is Latin for "before us" and the meaning of its full form, ''quae coram nobis resident'', is "which [things] remain in our presence".  The writ of coram nobis originated in the [[England and Wales|English]] court of [[common law]] in the [[English legal system]] during the [[16th century|sixteenth century]].

The writ of coram nobis still exists today in a few courts in the United States. In 1907, the writ became obsolete in England and replaced by other means of correcting errors; however, the writ survives in the United States in various forms in the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]], in sixteen [[State court (United States)|state courts]], and the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia|District of Columbia courts]]. For those courts with the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis, the rules and guidelines differ – sometimes significantly.  Each state is free to operate its own coram nobis procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system.  In other words, the criteria required to issue the writ in one state (or federal) court system are different from the criteria required to issue the writ in a different court system.  A writ can be granted only by the court where the original judgment was entered, so those seeking to correct a judgment must understand the criteria required for that specific court.

==History==

===England===
The ''writ of error coram nobis'' originated in England over 500 years ago. The name of the writ combines three terms: writ, writ of error, and coram nobis. '''Writ''' is an official written command. '''Writ of error''' provides a superior court the means to correct errors of a lower court. Writ of error '''''coram nobis''''' is a variation of the writ of error and provides a court the means to correct its own errors.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Edward N. [https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&amp;context=dlj ''The Writs of Error Coram Nobis and Coram Vobis''.] Duke Bar Journal 2.1 (1951): 29-39. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Writ ====
Sometime before the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|tenth century]], officials in England began utilizing writs to convey orders.&lt;ref&gt;Harper-Bill, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FaI5tE6z07gC ''Anglo-Norman Studies, XXVII: Proceedings of the Battle Conference, 1994.''] Boydell Press (1995). 114-116.&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[writ]]" was simply a short written command issued by a person in authority. It was customary for the sender to [[Great Seal of the Realm|seal]] this written command as proof of its authenticity. In the days when writing was a rare art, a writ was revered because the person receiving the command was unlikely to deny or question its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, Edward. [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2956&amp;context=ylj ''The Prerogative Writs in English Law''.] The Yale Law Journal 32.6 (1923): 523-534.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066 led to the establishment of a strong, centralized monarchy. The first [[Normans|Norman]] [[King of England]], [[William the Conqueror]], modified writs to become mainly framed in Latin, increased the number of writs to cover additional royal commands, and established the ''[[Curia Regis]] '' in England.&lt;ref&gt;D. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (London 1966) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Curia Regis'', a Latin term meaning "royal council", consisted of the King of England and his loyal advisors. The ''Curia Regis'' accompanied the King as he travelled. This council administered all of the King's governmental activities, including judicial matters.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law.]'' Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. p 32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important members of the ''Curia Regis'' was the [[Lord Chancellor]]. The Lord Chancellor led the chancery. [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]] is a general term for a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] writing office that was responsible for the production of official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Corèdon, Christopher, and Ann Williams. [https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Dictionary_of_Medieval_Terms_and_Phras.html?id=RxJlQgAACAAJ ''A Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'']. Cambridge, England: D.S. Brewer, 2004. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor wrote writs on behalf of the King, maintained all official documents, and acted as the keeper of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|royal seal]]. This position, in effect, placed the Lord Chancellor as the head of the English legal system. The King, however, was the ultimate leader of the kingdom; therefore, the Lord Chancellor issued writs under the guidance of what he believed to be the best interests of the King.  Between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Lord Chancellor had a large control over issuance of all original writs. An original writ began a legal proceeding, while a judicial writ was issued during a legal proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. p 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Writ of error ====
One such "original" writ was the writ of error. In medieval England, the word "[[appeal]]" was not the term used to describe a request to review the legality of a lower court's decision. Instead, a "petition of error" requested higher courts to review the legality of an order or sentence.  Petitioners brought a petition of error before the Lord Chancellor. Due to his position and close relationship with the law, the Lord Chancellor could naturally determine if the petition provided sufficient evidence of an error and, if so, the type of writ most appropriate to correct the error. If a lower court committed an error of law, the Lord Chancellor would issue a writ of error. A writ of error required the lower court to deliver the "records"&lt;ref&gt;The record only contained information on the arraignment, the plea, the issue, and the verdict. The record did not include the most material parts of a trial, including the evidence and the judge's direction to the jury. See Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. pp. 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt; of the case to a [[superior court]] where the court reviewed the case for legal errors. Because a writ of error was only available for a higher court to determine if a lower court committed an [[Question of law|error of law]], courts needed another type of writ to correct its own decision upon an [[Question of law|error of fact]]. To rectify this issue, the Lord Chancellor created a new writ - the writ of error coram nobis. Thus, the original writ of coram nobis provided the means to correct errors that the writ of error could not correct. Unlike the writ of error, the writ of coram nobis:
#corrected only factual errors that were not raised in the original case proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7239470899724667152&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Bronson v. Schulten''], 104 U.S. 410, 416 (1882)&lt;/ref&gt;
#allowed the same court that presided over the original case to correct its own error, and
#required the original case records to remain with the court that presided over the original case.&lt;ref&gt;Archbold, John Frederick.[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=yJVKAQAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=234#v=onepage&amp;q=coram%20nobis&amp;f=false ''The Practice of the Court of King's Bench in Personal Actions, and Ejectment'']. No. 57603-57612. EB Gould, 1827 p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Writ of error coram nobis ====
“Coram nobis” is Latin for “before us”. Initially, when the Lord Chancellor issued orders on behalf of the King and the royal court, the word “us” simply referred to the King, the Lord Chancellor, and other judges of this court. The royal court originated within the ''Curia Regis'', which began during the [[England in the High Middle Ages|twelfth and thirteenth centuries]], under the realm of [[Henry II of England|Henry the Second]] (Henry II). Henry II made writs available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice, thus initiating a vast expansion of writs within the [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 305 and p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt; The increased demand of judicial maters before the ''Curia Regis'' in the twelfth century led to the establishment of two central courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] and the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. These courts became the superior courts to all other courts in England, including local and tribunal courts such as the [[Hundred (county division)|Hundred Courts]] and [[Court of Piepowders]].

*'''The Court of King's Bench''' heard all complaints and pleas addressed to the King. This court was also known as the Court of Queen's Bench during the reign of a female monarch. Members of this court included the King and his closest advisors. This court always travelled with the King as he travelled throughout England and into other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Frederick Bernays. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/abaj59&amp;div=161&amp;id=&amp;page= ''Tracing the Origins of the Court of King's Bench''] ABAJ 59 (1973): 753-754.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lord Chancellor issued the writ to the court of King's Bench, the original full name of the writ was '''''quae coram nobis resident''''' or "Let the record remain before us". The words "let the record remain" indicate the court record of the original case remained with the court of King's Bench, unlike a writ of error, where the record moved to a different court. The words "coram nobis" ("before us") referred to the role of the King who served on the King's Bench. The King's place on the court of King's Bench became increasingly irregular; and by 1421, the King's Bench became a fixed court rather than one that followed the King. Although the King's presence was theoretical, the Lord Chancellor and his office continued to issue writs as if the King continued to as part of this court.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. H. ''An Introduction to English Legal History''. (2002). Butterworths LexisNexis. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Court of Common Pleas''' was authorized by [[Magna Carta]] to sit in a central, fixed location.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Common Pleas, Court of|volume=6|page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt; This court heard complaints and pleas that did not require the King's presence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. (1977). [https://jstor.org/stable/844792 ''The Origins of Common Pleas and King's Bench'']. The American Journal of Legal History, 21(3), 245.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lord Chancellor issued the writ to the court of Common Pleas, the original full name was '''''quae coram vobis resident''''', or "Let the record remain before you". These words indicate that the records of the original case remained with the judges of the Court of Common Pleas so that it may review a case it previously decided to determine if an error of fact occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Prickett, Morgan. [https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1744&amp;context=lawreview ''The Writ of Error Coram Nobis in California'']. (1990). Santa Clara L. Rev. 30: 1-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the authority to issue writs shifted from the Lord Chancellor to the courts.  Although the King was no longer part of the court issuing the writ, the name "coram nobis" continued because courts associated the name with its function rather than its original Latin meaning. Thus, in English law, the definition of "coram nobis" evolved and is now redefined as a remedy for a court to correct its own error.&lt;ref&gt;Piar, Daniel F. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nkenlr30&amp;div=28&amp;id=&amp;page= ''Using Corum Nobis to Attack Wrongful Convictions: A New Look at an Ancient Writ'']. N. Ky. L. Rev. 30 (2003): p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abolition in English courts====
The first case involving the writ of coram nobis is unknown due to incomplete historical records prior to the sixteenth century; however, the first recorded case involving the writ of coram nobis occurred in 1561 in the case of ''Sir Gilbert Debenham and Another v. Bateman''.&lt;ref&gt;2 Dyer 195(b), See also Green, W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I0QwAAAAIAAJ The English Reports. ''Debenham v. Bateman''] v4; v. 73. (1907) p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1705, the writ of error was originally a matter entirely up to the discretion of either the monarch or those with the authority to make decisions on behalf of the monarch; but in 1705, the court held that the writ was a matter of right instead of a matter of discretion.  Despite making writs of error a matter of right, courts rarely used these writs because of their cumbersome and impractical procedure.  A writ of error moved the record from the original court to a higher court; however, the record only contained information on the arraignment, the plea, the issue, and the verdict.  The record did not include the most material parts of a trial, including the evidence and the judge's direction to the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. pp. 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, England abolished all writs of error, including the writs of coram nobis and coram vobis, and replaced them with appellate procedures encompassing all rights previously available through these writs.  Thus, the abolition of the writ of coram nobis in England was due mostly to administration difficulties with the writ of error, and not because of administration difficulties with the writ of coram nobis itself.  The law abolishing the writ in civil cases was the Common Law Procedure Act 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Common Law Procedure Act, 1852, 15 &amp; 16 Vict., ch. 76, s. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws abolishing the writ in criminal cases was the Criminal Appeal Act of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Appeal Act 1907, 7 Edw., ch. 23, s. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
After arriving in North America in the [[17th century|seventeenth century]], [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlers]] established [[Thirteen Colonies|English colonies]]. Within these colonies, the settlers created colonial courts that adhered to the [[English Law|English legal system]] and issued writs in the same manner as English courts. After the United States obtained [[American Revolution|independence from England]], state governments, as well as the federal government, [[Reception statute|provided courts the authority to continue to rely]] upon writs as a source of law unless issuing the writ violated the state or federal constitution or if either the state or federal government subsequently enacted a statute restricting the writ.&lt;ref&gt;Chemerinsky, E. (1986).[https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1667&amp;context=faculty_scholarship ''Thinking About Habeas Corpus'']. Case W. Res. L. Rev., 37, 748, 751.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of allowing courts to issue writs was to fill a void whenever the state constitution, state statutes, the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes did not address an issue to be decided before the court.  Writs were especially important when the federal government, as well as each state, first established its judicial system.  During those times, there were very few (if any) statutes or case laws for courts to rely upon as guidance. In those circumstances, the English writs provided fledgling federal and state courts an important source of law.
Over time, writs became significantly less important as Congress and state legislatures enacted more statutes and further defined rules for its judiciary.  Writs also evolved independently in the federal judicial system and each state's judicial system so that a writ within one judicial systems may have a vastly different purpose and procedures from the same writ in other judicial systems.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, Donald E., ''Federal and State Postconviction Remedies and Relief''. Harrison Company, 2001. p. 55-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Different characteristics of a writ from one judicial system to another is the result of the [[Federalism|federal]] system of government prescribed within the United States Constitution.  [[Federalism in the United States]] is a mixed system of government that combines a [[Federal government of the United States|national federal government]] and [[State governments of the United States|state governments]].  While federal courts are superior to state courts in federal matters, the Constitution limits the reach of federal courts; thereby, providing state courts general sovereignty and law-making authority over a wider range of topics. This sovereignty allows each judicial system to decide whether to adopt writs and the function and purpose of each writ it adopts. Thus, the use and application of writs, including the writ of coram nobis, can vary within each of these judicial systems.

Legislation authorizes a judicial system to issue the writ of coram under one of two conditions:
#Where legislation permits courts to issue writs, but the legislation does not specifically mention the writ of coram nobis. Courts throughout the United States generally have the authority to issue writs whenever the constitution or statutes encompassing a court's jurisdiction do not address an issue before the court and issuance of the writ is necessary to achieve justice.  This authority was especially important for earlier courts when there were few statutes or case law to rely upon.  Over time, legislatures enacted statutes encompassing almost all issues that could arise before a court.  As a result, courts today rarely need to rely on writs as a source of law to address an issue not covered by statute. One example of a rare issue where courts have the occasion to issue the writ of coram nobis is the issue of former federal prisoners who have new information and this new information would have resulted in a different verdict if the information were available at the time of trial. Whenever this specific issue comes before a federal court, there is no federal statute that specifically guides or regulates how the court must proceed; however, federal courts have determined that the writ of coram nobis is the proper vehicle to achieve justice under this specific issue.
#Where legislation specifically permits courts to issue, by name,  the writ of coram nobis. The use of writs in the United States is more common when legislation has authorized a writ by name and regulated its use by courts.  For earlier courts, the practice of issuing writs was an integral part of the judicial system's proceedings. Therefore, when legislatures enacted laws to regulate issues associated with writs, some legislatures adopted the exact name of the writ within its rules while other legislatures chose to abolish the names of the writ but provided an alternative remedy under a different name.  Tennessee is an example of a state where its legislature enacted a statute expressly authorizing courts to issue, by name, the “Writ of Error Coram Nobis” and regulated how this writ should be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2017/title-27/chapter-7/ Tenn.Code Ann. § 27-7 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other states replaced the writ of coram nobis with other post-conviction remedies. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a law on January 25, 1966 that expressly abolished the name “writ of coram nobis” and encated the state's Post Conviction Relief Act, which is now the sole means for obtaining post-conviction relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4875028688006369069&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Commonwealth v. Descardes'', 136 A.3d 493, 497-502 (Pa. 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coram nobis in United States federal courts==
[[File: Coram nobis Timeline in US federal courts.png |thumb|500px|right|Historical dates for the writ of coram nobis in federal courts and post-conviction remedies for former federal prisoners.]]
In 1789, Congress passed the Judiciary Act to establish the judicial courts in the United States. This Act also allows courts to issue writs, including the writ of coram nobis. Originally, federal courts applied the writ of coram nobis only to correct technical errors, such as those made by a clerk of the court in the records of the proceedings.  The 1914 Supreme Court case ''United States v. Mayer'', expanded the scope of the writ of coram nobis to include [[fundamental error]]s, but the Court declined in this case to decide whether federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3748662799506034506 ''United States v. Mayer'', 235 U.S. 35, 69 (1914)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the Supreme Court determined in ''United States v. Morgan'' that federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of coram nobis to correct fundamental errors, such as those where discovery of new information is sufficient to prove a convicted felon is [[Actual innocence|actually innocent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799 ''United States v. Denedo'', 129 S. Ct. 2213, 2220 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Morgan'' case, federal courts traditionally issue a writ of coram nobis whenever a former federal prisoner petitions the original sentencing court to set aside the conviction based upon new information that was not available when the petitioner was in-custody and where this new information demonstrates that the conviction was a result of a fundamental error.

===History of the writ of coram nobis in federal courts from 1789 to 1954===
====The Judiciary Act of 1789====
The history of the writ of coram nobis in United States federal courts began in 1789 when Congress enacted the [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act]]. Under Section 14 of the Judiciary Act, federal courts have the authority to issue a [[writ]] whenever the court deems it necessary to achieve justice and whenever no congressional law covers the issues before the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=204  1st Congress, 1st Session, 1 Stat. 81-82.]&lt;/ref&gt; This section was known as the “All-Writs Provision” of the Judiciary Act until 1948 when it became more commonly known as the “All-Writs Act” after Congress modified the Judicial Code and consolidated this provision into {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9932283031886059336 ''Pa. Bureau of Correction v. U.S. Marshals Service'', 474 U.S. 34, 40-41 (1985)] Since 1789, there have been only a few subtle amendments to the act, but none of the amendments have significantly changed the substance of the act from its original form.  In 1911, Congress adopted the [[Judicial Code of 1911|Judicial Code]] which organized all laws, or statutes, into the ''Code of Laws of the United States of America'' (commonly known as [[United States Code]] and abbreviated U.S.C.).  In 1948, Congress modified the code for the All Writs Act under 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a) where it remains today.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the All Writs Act, federal district courts have the “power to issue writs of [[scire facias]], [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], and all other writs not specifically provided for by [[statute]].” Congress had not specifically provided by statute the authority for federal courts to issue a writ of coram nobis; therefore, the All Writs Act provides federal courts this authority.&lt;ref&gt;The All-Writs Act only provides federal district courts the ''authority'' to issue writs; but, it does not provide federal district courts the ''jurisdiction'' to hear and issue writs. District courts have the jurisdiction to entertain writs, including a petition for the writ of coram nobis, under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|3231}} which confers on the district court original jurisdiction over "all offenses against the laws of the United States." See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6762057459713035389&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Wilkozek'', 822 F. 3d 364, 368 (7th Cir. 2016)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first case in a federal court to address the writ of coram nobis was ''Strode v. The Stafford Justices'' in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;23 F. Cas. 236 (C.C.D. Va. 1810) (No. 13,537). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ljhFAAAAYAAJ ''Reports of Cases Decided in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Fourth Circuit: (1792-1883)'']. Volume 1. (1837) p. 162-165.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Supreme Court Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote the opinion in this Circuit Court case and held that the writ of coram nobis is distinguishable from the writ of error and therefore not subject to the writ of error's statute of limitations. The first Supreme Court case mentioning the writ of coram nobis (using the term coram vobis) is the 1833 case, ''Pickett's Heirs v. Legerwood''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=134783638943220731&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Pickett's Heirs v. Legerwood'', 32 U.S. 144, 147-148 (1833)]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Court determined that the writ was available to correct its own errors, but the same remedy was also available using the preferred method of submitting a motion to the court.  Eighty years later, in 1914, the Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in ''United States v. Mayer''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3748662799506034506&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Mayer'', 235 U.S. 55, 67 (1914)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, while federal courts confirmed the writ of coram nobis was available to federal courts, this remedy was rarely necessary or appropriate in federal courts throughout the nineteenth century for the following two reasons:
#Courts generally considered the writ of coram nobis to be restricted to correct only technical errors, such as discovery of a defendant being under age, evidence that a defendant died before the verdict, or errors made by the court clerk in the recording of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799 ''United States v. Denedo'', at  2220.]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Petitioners could raise a “motion to amend” to correct most of errors also corrected by the writ of coram nobis. Although courts recognized that the writ of coram nobis could also reverse the judgement on such defects, the preferred practice was to present the court with a motion to amend.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Plumer'', 3 Cliff. 28 (Circuit Court of Massachusetts, 1859) published by {{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yl1GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA538&amp;lpg=PA538#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Federal Decisions: Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court and District Courts of the United States, Volume 1|date=1884|page=541|last=Myer|first=William G.|publisher=The Gilbert Book Company |website=books.google.com |access-date= July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1946 amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure ====
In 1946, Congress amended the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in federal [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil cases]]. Prior to enactment of these amendments, Congress reviewed all relief previously provided for civil cases through the writ of coram nobis and adopted those avenues of relief into the rules; therefore, eliminating the need for the writ in federal civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/archives/committee-reports/advisory-committee-rules-civil-procedure-june-1946|title= Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure - June 1946|date= June 1, 1946|website= uscourts.gov|access-date= July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the amendment, Congress expressly abolished the writ of coram nobis in Rule 60(b). Later, in 2007, Congress restructured the format of Rule 60, and moved the language expressly abolishing the writ of coram nobis in civil proceedings from Rule 60(b) to Rule 60(e) in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60] The Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure proposed the amendments in June 1946. Congress passed the proposed amendments in December 1946, and the amendments became effective March 19, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of post-conviction remedies available to former federal prisoners from 1789 to 1954===
====Post-conviction remedies for former federal prisoners prior to 1867====
In 1790, one year after Congress passed the Judiciary Act establishing federal courts, Congress enacted the [[Crimes Act of 1790|Crimes Act]] which created the first comprehensive list of federal offenses. From 1790 until 1867, there are few, if any, records of individuals challenging a federal criminal conviction after completion of the prison sentence.  Two primary reasons explains the absence of any challenges to a conviction by former federal prisoners:
#The Crimes List provided only twenty-three federal crimes.  Seven of these crimes, including treason and murder, were punishable by death. (In comparison, today there are approximately 3,600 to 4,500 federal statutes that impose criminal punishments.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds|first=Glenn Harlan|date=2015-03-29|title=When lawmakers don't even know how many laws exist, how can citizens be expected to follow them?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/crime-law-criminal-unfair-column/70630978/|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company |access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 500,000 former federal prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bonczar|first=Thomas P.|date=August 2003|title=Prevalence of Imprisonment in the U.S. Population, 1974-2001|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/prisontime.pdf|newspaper=CBS News|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|access-date=2018-07-21}} See also {{cite web |url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_releases.jsp|title=Federal Bureau of Prisons Release Numbers|date=June 2018|website=bop.gov|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this large population, recent cases where a former federal prisoner is able to find new information sufficient to reverse the conviction is exceedingly rare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9698546469454281177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. George'', 676 F. 3d 249, 254 (1st Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the chances of this type of case arising prior to 1867, when the federal prisoner popular was significantly smaller, are even more remote.&lt;ref&gt;The government first reported a census of prisoners in 1880. In 1880, the federal prison population was 2,162. See {{cite web |url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcsus5084.pdf|title=''Historical Corrections Statistics in the United States, 1850- 1984''|page=29|date=December 1986|website=bjs.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Statistics|access-date=July 23, 2018}}. In comparison, the federal prison population in 2013 was 219,298. See {{cite web |url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp|title=''Past Inmate Population Totals''|website=bop.gov|publisher=Federal Bureau of Prisons|access-date=July 23, 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
#There were few [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|collateral consequences]] stemming from a conviction at this time. Generally, the reason former convicted felons seek a writ of coram nobis is to eliminate collateral consequences ensuing the challenged conviction.  Collateral consequences are indirect consequences of a conviction.  While direct consequences of a conviction are usually issued by a judge in the [[Criminal sentencing in the United States|sentencing]] phase of a case (such as a prison sentence, probation, fines and restitution); indirect consequences of a conviction are not contained within a court sentence. Collateral consequences may include loss of voting privileges, loss of professional licenses, inability to qualify for some employment and housing opportunities, and damage to the person's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://individual.utoronto.ca/dinovitzer/Publications/Hagan_Dinovitzer_1999.pdf Hagan, J., &amp; Dinovitzer, R. (1999). ''Collateral consequences of imprisonment for children, communities, and prisoners'', Crime and Justice 26 (1999): pp. 121-162.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867====
The [[American Civil War]] is historically significant upon the rights of former federal prisoners in two ways.  First, Congress enacted the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 to prevent abuses following the civil war. This Act expanded the writ of habeas corpus to any person, including former prisoners. Second, states began imposing more collateral consequences upon those convicted of crimes; thus, providing more reasons why a person would want to have a wrongful conviction overturned. The loss of voting privileges was one of the most significant collateral consequence of a felony conviction. In 1800, no state prohibited convicted felons from voting; but by end of the U.S. Civil War, nearly eighty percent of state legislatures had passed laws barring felons the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ir.stthomas.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=ustjlpp Clegg, R., Conway III, G. T., &amp; Lee, K. K. (2008). ''The case against felon voting.'' U. St. Thomas JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y, 2, 3 n.17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery was legal in the United States until the 1860s.  In the 1860 [[United States presidential election, 1860|U.S. presidential election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], supported the elimination of slavery. This controversial issue was the catalyst for the [[American Civil War]] that began in 1861 following the election of Lincoln and concluded in 1865. On March 3, 1865, President Lincoln signed a joint resolution declaring wives and children of persons in the armed forces to be free; and on December 18, 1865 the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] became effective. This Amendment abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]] in the United States. The purpose of the Habeas Act was to provide "what legislation is necessary to enable the courts of the United States to enforce the freedom of the wife and children of soldiers of the United States, and also to enforce the liberty of all persons."&lt;ref&gt;Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 4151 (1866). See also [https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3451&amp;context=uclrev ''The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867: The Supreme Court as Legal Historian''], Mayers L., 33 U.Chi.L.Rev. 31 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 expanded the jurisdiction of the writ of habeas corpus to any person.  As a result, this act eliminated the writ of coram nobis in criminal cases because any person challenging a conviction, regardless of whether the person is in prison or not, could have raised the claim through the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;The writ of coram nobis has many similarities in origin and purpose with the [[writ]] of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]. ''Habeas corpus'' is a Latin phrase meaning "you have the body", where the English courts ordered officials to produce the body or deliver the prisoner to the court. See Robertson, J. (2008). [http://buffalolaw.org/past_issues/55_4/Web_Robertson%20Final%20Book%20Proof.pdf ''Quo Vadis, Habeas Corpus?''], Buffalo L. Rev., 1066.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Act of June 25, 1948====
In 1946, Congress abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases; and the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 provided a remedy for jurisdictional and constitutional errors at the trial at any time, regardless of whether the person was in prison or had completed their sentence. For all practical purposes, the writ of coram nobis had no purpose in federal courts.  In fact, the Supreme Court commented on the writ of coram nobis in a 1947 case and determined "it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where this writ would be necessary or appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15350111847978931898&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Smith''], 331 U.S. 469, 475 n.4 (1947). This statement was quoted by the Supreme Court in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11483498398561074985&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Carlisle v. United States''], 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996) regarding whether coram nobis petitions are ever appropriate from those who are in custody from the sentence begin challenged. In these cases, [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] are controlling.&lt;/ref&gt; But, on June 25, 1948, Congress passed legislation that would lead to the resurrection of the writ. The Act of June 25, 1948 combined two pieces of legislation:
#Congress passed the Act to organize all laws of the United States into a single source of reference, known as the [[United States Code]] (abbreviated U.S.C.). Any law (or statute) ever passed by Congress can be found in the United States Code.  The U.S.C. is divided into 50 titles. Within each title is a chapter, and within each chapter is a section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/safe_doses_act|title= How the US Code is Built.|website= law.cornell.edu|access-date= July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the titles created in the Act was Title 28 – Judiciary and Judicial Procedure. Chapter 153 of this title is the chapter on Habeas Corpus. Section 2255 of this title is the section providing how prisoners can challenge a conviction. In legal documents, this section is commonly abbreviated 28 U.S.C. §2255.
#Congress passed the Act to solve a problem with habeas corpus petitions. The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 instructed prisoners to file a writ of habeas corpus with the district court whose territory included the prison.  For example, those imprisoned at [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz Island]], California were required to file a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, even if the prisoner's conviction and sentence originated from a federal court in another district or state.  This rule led to administrative difficulties, especially for the district courts whose territorial jurisdiction included major federal prisons. The Act of June 25, 1948 codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and judicial habeas practice at 28 U.S.C. §2255 and changed the jurisdiction from the district of confinement to the district of sentence; however, the jurisdictional change was the only change Congress intended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17192799817576536682&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hayman'', 342 U.S. 205, 220-221 (1952)], ("the sole purpose [of §2255 ] was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.")&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite legislative intentions for §2255 to only change the jurisdiction of the district courts, the language of the statute restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. Consequently, former prisoners had no statutory avenue to challenge a conviction.  As a result, this act indirectly resurrected the writ of coram nobis to former prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502, 505-506 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''United States v. Morgan'' (1954) provides writ of coram nobis to former federal prisoners===
[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In 1954, the United States Supreme Court held in ''United States v. Morgan'' that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.]]
The Act of June 25, 1948 reworded the habeas corpus sections of the United States Code to provide only those individuals in-custody (as a result of a criminal conviction in federal court) access to the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=62&amp;page=967# Act of June 25, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt; For those who had been convicted of a federal crime but were no longer in-custody, the question was whether the 1948 Act abolished all post-conviction review of a former prisoner's conviction.

In 1952 Robert Morgan, a former federal prisoner who had completed his sentence, petitioned to have his conviction overturned based on information he claimed to be unavailable at the time of his conviction. Although the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 would have allowed Morgan to challenge his conviction using the writ of habeas corpus, the Act of June 25, 1948 restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. The district court denied his petition because Morgan was no longer in custody for the conviction he sought to overturn. Morgan appealed that decision. In 1953, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and determined that the writ of coram nobis was available to Morgan.  The government appealed the appellate court's decision to the US Supreme Court.

The first question in ''United States v. Morgan'' was whether Congress intended to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners when it restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. If the Supreme Court decided that Congress did not intend to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners, then the second question in ''United States v. Morgan'' was whether the writ of coram nobis was available to challenge a conviction after completion of the petitioner's sentence. On January 4, 1954, the Supreme Court announced its decision. The Court first determined that Congress did not intend within the 1948 Act to eliminate all reviews of criminal convictions for petitioners who had completed their sentence.  Although the 1948 Act restricted former prisoners from challenging a conviction with a writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined by reviewing the legislative notes that Congress did not intend to abolish post-conviction challenges to a sentence from former prisoners.  Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], who authored the [[majority opinion]] for the Court, wrote;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he purpose of § 2255 was "to meet practical difficulties" in the administration of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction. [] Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. We know of nothing in the legislative history that indicates a different conclusion. We do not think that the enactment of § 2255 is a bar to this motion, and we hold that the District Court has power to grant [the writ of coram nobis].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', at 510-511 (citations removed)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Congress did exclude former prisoners from challenging a conviction through the writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined that the All Writs Act provides federal courts the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis to former prisoners whenever new evidence proves the underlying conviction was a result of a fundamental error. Thus, ''Morgan'' officially revived the writ of coram nobis as the sole means for post-incarceration judicial review of federal convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers Wolitz, D. (2009). ''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name'', The BYU L. Rev., 1277.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of rules and procedures governing coram nobis proceedings===
''United States v. Morgan'' provides broad, general guidance to courts on the rules and procedures in coram nobis proceedings, but since the ''Morgan'' case in 1954, the Supreme Court and Congress seldom provide lower courts additional guidance. Thus, Appellate courts generally fill in the gaps and provide guidance for rules and procedures unclarified by Congress and the Supreme Court; however, the interpretations of rules and procedures of coram nobis may differ in each appellate court. Thus, for a former federal prisoner who is attempting to decide whether to file a petition for the writ of coram nobis, it is necessary to understand the source of the rules and procedures.

The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One of the Constitution]] creates the legislature and provides Congress the means to create and enact laws.  [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three of the Constitution]] creates the judiciary and provides courts the means to interpret laws. Other than the writ of habeas corpus, the Constitution has no language permitting or restricting courts from issuing specific writs, including the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Section 9 of Article One]] states that “the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”&lt;/ref&gt;

====Congressional enactments====
The [[United States Congress]] enacts laws or [[Statutory law|statutes]], and codifies these statutes in the [[United States Code]].  In contrast to the writ of habeas corpus, Congress has seldom enacted statutes regulating the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;Congress authorized and regulated the writ of habeas corpus in four important acts:
*The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1867|Habeas Corpus Act of February 5, 1867]] expanded federal courts' habeas jurisdiction by extending federal habeas corpus relief to "any person," including state prisoners, detained "in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States.
*The Act of June 25, 1948 where Congress established 28 U.S.C. sections 2241 to 2255 which restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners and changed the court where a habeas petition is directed from the district court where the prisoner was held to the district court where the prisoner was sentenced. See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17192799817576536682&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hayman'', 342 U.S. 205, 220-221 (1952).]
*In the Act of Nov. 2, 1966, Congress amended habeas statutes to provide “a greater degree of finality of judgments in habeas corpus proceedings.” See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13596761522993185173&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''McCleskey v. Zant'', 499 U.S. 467 (1991).]
*The [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] was incorporated to "curb the abuse of the statutory writ of habeas corpus, and to address the acute problems of unnecessary delay and abuse in [[Capital punishment|capital cases]]." See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3514851794987003120&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Souter v. Jones'', 395 F. 3d 577, 599 (2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; Statutes enacted by Congress regulating the writ of coram nobis are:
*In 1789, Congress enacted the Judicial Act.  The [[All Writs Act]] section of the Judiciary Act provides federal courts the authority to issue “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” The All Writs Act gives courts the ability to decide which specific writs utilized in English courts are available and appropriate in U.S. federal courts. While Congress provides federal courts the authority to issue writs, it does not provide courts the authority to issue specific writs by name, such as writs of mandamus or writs of coram nobis. The code for the All Writs Act is {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}.
*In 1946, Congress amended the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] to abolish the writ of coram nobis in federal [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil cases]]. Prior to enacting this statute, Congress reviewed all issues previously addressed by federal courts in writ of coram nobis proceedings, and incorporated remedies for those issues within the procedures. Rule 60(e) of this Procedure originated from this statute and states, “The following are abolished: bills of review, bills in the nature of bills of review, and writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, and audita querela.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In  2002, Congress enacted Rule 4(a)(1)(C) of the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] to resolve a conflict among the federal appellate courts regarding the time limitations to file an appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_4 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1)(C)].&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this amendment, the federal appellate courts were divided on whether coram nobis appeals have a 10-day time limit or a 60-day time limit.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Johnson'', 237 F. 3d 751, 754 (6th Cir. 2001)] The United States Court of Appeals for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts determined that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts relied upon the statement in ''Morgan'' that a writ of coram nobis is a "step in a criminal case" and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals.  Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 4(a)(1)(C) resolved the conflict and established a 60-day time limit to file the notice of appeal from a district court’s judgement in a coram nobis proceeding.

====United States Supreme Court decisions====
Following the Constitution and Congressional statutes, the next highest source for direction and guidance of rules and procedures is the United States Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court is the highest federal court. Lower courts, such as federal appellate courts and federal district courts, must follow the decisions of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has discretionary appellate jurisdiction, meaning the Court chooses to hear cases for reasons it deems “compelling reasons” (such as resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or resolving an important matter of law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://litigation.findlaw.com/legal-system/how-does-the-u-s-supreme-court-decide-whether-to-hear-a-case.html |title= How Does the U.S. Supreme Court Decide Whether to Hear a Case?|website=litigation.findlaw.com|access-date= July 8, 2018}} See also [[Supreme Court of the United States#Case Selection|U.S. Supreme Court Case Selection]]. See also [[certiorari#United States law|certiorari]].&lt;/ref&gt; Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, cannot override any law enacted by Congress unless the law violates the Constitution. Federal courts also cannot repeal a statute unless Congress clearly intended to repeal the statute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5251920236993815863 ''Branch v. Smith'', 538 U.S. 254, 273 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1954, ''United States v. Morgan'' provides writ of coram nobis to former federal prisoners.  The Court determined coram nobis relief “should be allowed . . . only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502, 505-506 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the circumstances must include all three of these conditions:
*to remedy errors ‘of the most fundamental character’
*when “no other remedy [is] then available”
*“sound reasons [exist] for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers Wolitz, D. (2009). ''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name'', The BYU L. Rev., 1286.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1954, the Supreme Court granted review of only one other coram nobis case.  In 2009, the Court clarified that [[Federal tribunals in the United States|Article I military courts]] have jurisdiction to entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations that an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a fundamental respect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Denedo'', 129 S. Ct. 2213, 2224 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other than providing military courts the authority to issue the writ, the Supreme Court has declined to provide federal courts additional guidance in coram nobis proceedings. Appellate courts have occasionally criticized the Supreme Court for failing to provide this additional guidance.  The Seventh Circuit called the writ of coram nobis, “a phantom in the Supreme Court's cases”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2409262715757082555&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v.

[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts]]

====Federal courts of appeals decisions====
While the United States Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States federal court system, the United States courts of appeals, or circuit courts, are the intermediate appellate courts.  There are thirteen U.S. courts of appeals. Eleven courts of appeals are numbered First through Eleventh and have geographical boundaries of various sizes.  For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of all federal courts in only three states: Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of nine western states and two U.S. territories.  There is also a Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Other tribunals also have "Court of Appeals" in their titles, such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which hears appeals in court-martial cases.

Congressional statutes and Supreme Court decisions are controlling over courts of appeals.  Absent statutory rules or Supreme Court case law, a court of appeals decision establishes a binding precedent for the courts in its circuit; however, a court of appeals decision is not binding for courts in other circuits. Generally, when a court of appeals hears an issue raised for the first time in that court, it arrives at the same conclusion as other courts of appeals on identical issues raised before those courts.  However, whenever the courts of appeals arrive at different conclusions on the same issue, it creates a “circuit split”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1166&amp;context=articles|title=Constitutional Cacophony: Federal Circuit Splits and the Fourth Amendment|date=2012|page=1139|last=Logan|first=Wayne A.|publisher=Vanderbilt Law Review|website=ir.law.fsu.edu|access-date= July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court receives thousands of petitions each year, but only agrees to hear less than 100 of these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/16-2_Wachtell.pdf|title=An Empirical Analysis of Supreme Court Certiorari Petition Procedures: The Call for Response and the Call for the Views of the Solicitor General|date=2008|page=241|last= Thompson|first=David C.|last2=Wachtell|first2=Melanie F.|publisher=George Mason Law Review|website=georgemasonlawreview.org |access-date= July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most compelling reasons for the Supreme Court to accept a case is to resolve a circuit split. Currently, a circuit split exists in coram nobis cases involves the definition of “adverse consequences”  The Supreme Court determined in ''United States v. Morgan'' that a petition for a writ of coram nobis must demonstrate that adverse consequences exist from the criminal conviction. Some courts of appeals determined adverse consequences occur with any collateral consequence of a conviction while other courts of appeals have limited “adverse consequences” to only a few collateral consequence of a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2880&amp;context=flr |title=Post-McNally Review of Invalid Convictions Through the Writ of Coram Nobis|date=1990|page=986|last=Duszak|first=M.

====Federal district court decisions====
District courts must abide by congressional statutes, Supreme Court decisions, and decisions of the court of appeals in the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located. Whenever a district court hears an issue that is not specifically addressed by statute or by case law of a higher court, district courts often “develop the record”. In case of an appeal, the higher courts have the district court's reasoned decision as guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1309191511695911726 ''White v. White'', 886 F. 2d 721, 731 (4th Cir. 1989) (Murnaghan, C.J., dissenting)]&lt;/ref&gt; A developed record not only greatly facilitates the process of appellate review but also ensures that the district court has carefully considered the issues and applied the applicable law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1377706004517212105 ''Jones v. Morris'', 777 F. 2d 1277, 1281 (7th Cir. 1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria for the writ===
====Rules for petitioners====
Writs of coram nobis are rare in U.S. federal courts due to the stringent criteria for issuance of the writ. ''Morgan'' established the following criteria required in a coram nobis [[petition]] in order for a federal court to issue the writ:&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis is a collateral attack on a [[Judgment (law)|judgement]] in a federal criminal case.''' A “collateral attack” is defined as an attack on a judgement in a proceeding other than a [[Appellate procedure in the United States#Appellate review|direct appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13423175293489651929&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Wall v. Kholi'', 131 S. Ct. 1278, 1284 (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis in a federal court must seek to vacate a federal criminal conviction.''' A writ of coram nobis is not available in federal courts to challenge a conviction in a state court. The federal government operates its own coram nobis procedures independent from state courts. Those seeking to attack a state judgment must follow the post-conviction remedies offered by that state. A writ of coram nobis is also not available for civil cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis may only be filed after a sentence has been served and the petitioner is no longer in custody.''' A person who is on probation is considered "in custody".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4710853263548376302&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Brown'', 117 F.3d 471, 475 (11th Cir. 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone filing a coram nobis petition while in custody will have their petition either denied for lack of jurisdiction or categorized as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (or successive 28 U.S.C. § 2255 if the petitioner has previously filed a § 2255 petition).
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must be addressed to the sentencing court.''' To challenge a conviction, the petitioner must send a request for a writ of coram nobis to the court clerk of the district court where the petitioner's conviction originated. In other words, a petitioner must request for the writ in the sentencing court, rather than any convenient federal court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3493090275204032030&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Rawlins v. Kansas'', 714 F. 3d 1189 (10th Cir.2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must provide valid reasons for not attacking the conviction earlier.''' Petitioners need to show "reasonable diligence", where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels (such as a §&amp;nbsp;2255 petition while in custody). A delay may be considered reasonable when the applicable law was recently changed and made retroactive, when new evidence was discovered that the petitioner could not reasonably have located earlier, or when the petitioner was improperly advised by counsel not to pursue habeas relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14233123309617983670&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Riedl'', 496 F. 3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' A petition for a writ of coram nobis must raise new issues of law or fact that could not have been raised while the petitioner was in custody.''' In ''Morgan'', the Court announced the writ was available where no other remedy is available. However, petitioners occasionally misinterpret this statement as an opportunity to re-raise arguments from previous post-conviction petitions. Appellate courts have consistently determined that the writ of coram nobis cannot be used as a "second chance" to challenge a conviction using the same grounds raised in a previous challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1102942438273961168&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Keane'', 852 F. 2d 199, 203 (7th Cir. 1988)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Petitioners who filed a § 2255 motion and it was denied while in custody must obtain authorization from the district court in order to file a coram nobis petition.''' Currently, this rule only applies to those in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.  In 2018, the Eighth Circuit became the first appellate court to decide whether a petition for writ of coram nobis is governed by the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] ("AEDPA") restrictions on successive relief as defined in § 2255(h)(1) and (2). The Eighth Circuit held that coram nobis petitioners who filed a § 2255 motion, while in custody and the motion was denied while the petitioner remained in custody, is restricted by AEDPA from filing a coram nobis petition without first obtaining authorization from the ''district court'' to file the coram nobis petition. This requirement is different from those in custody who are required to obtain authorization from the ''appellate court'' in order to file a successive § 2255 motion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=970640436455318595&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Baranski v. United States'', 880 F. 3d 951, 956 (8th Cir. 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal appellate courts have yet to issue an opinion on this question.
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must provide adverse consequences which exist from the conviction.''' A “circuit-split” exists on this requirement. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts administer a "civil disabilities test" which requires a coram nobis petitioner to prove that his conviction produced ongoing collateral consequences; however, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits have held that the petitioner need not show that he is suffering from an ongoing "civil disability" because "collateral consequences flow from any criminal conviction".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9698546469454281177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. George'', 676 F. 3d 249, 254 (1st Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]] circuit has granted coram nobis relief without mentioning this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7014365937918134888&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Blanton v. United States'', 94 F. 3d 227, 233 (6th Cir. 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The writ of coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy to correct errors of the most fundamental character.''' The error to be corrected must be an error which resulted in a complete [[miscarriage of justice]]. In other words, the error is one that has rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6561912920734236978&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Bereano v. United States'', 706 F. 3d 568, 576-577 (4th Cir. 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the same errors that are deemed grounds for Section 2255 habeas relief also justify coram nobis relief.&lt;ref&gt;Wolitz, D. (2009).

Rev., 1277 p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For those claiming actual innocence, a fundamental miscarriage of justice occurs where a constitutional violation has resulted in the conviction of one who is [[Actual innocence|actually innocent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16402025009521187784&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Murray v. Carrier'', 477 U. S. 478, 495-496 (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Procedural rules in federal district courts====
*'''District court clerks should file petitions for writs of coram nobis under the original case number''' In ''Morgan'', the Supreme Court provided that the writ of coram nobis is a step in the criminal case and not the beginning of a separate civil proceeding. As a result, district courts, such as those in the Ninth Circuit, file petitions for writs of coram nobis under the original criminal case number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12030576678750000031&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Telink, Inc. v. United States'', 24 F.3d 42, 46 (9th Cir. 1994)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''District courts should construe incorrectly titled petitions with the appropriate title.''' Whenever a [[United States district court|federal district court]] receives an incorrectly labeled or incorrectly titled petition, the court should construe the petition correctly.  District courts should construe a coram nobis petition from a federal prisoner as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Similarly, district courts should construe a habeas corpus petition from a former federal prisoner as a petition for writ of coram nobis. Federal courts have determined that a person on probation is still a federal prisoner; therefore, petitioners in this category must file a petition for writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8072550880880865091&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Scruggs'', 691 F.3d 660, 662 n.1 (5th Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; A federal prisoner convicted of more than one federal crime may file a petition for writ of coram nobis to challenge any conviction where the sentence is complete; but the prisoner must file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge any conviction where the sentence is not complete.

====Procedural rules in federal appellate courts====
*'''Appeals from coram nobis orders are subject to a 60-day filing period''' Until 2002, two provisions in ''Morgan'' divided the [[United States courts of appeals|federal appellate courts]] interpretation on the time limits to file an appeal from a [[United States district court|district court's]] decision on a coram nobis petition. First, ''Morgan'' held that "the writ of ''coram nobis'' is a step in the criminal case". Second, ''Morgan'' held that "the writ of ''coram nobis'' is of the same general character as the writ of ''habeas corpus''". This created a conflict in the courts of appeals regarding the time limits that applied to appeals from coram nobis orders. In 2002, Congress added language to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure that clarified an application for a writ of error coram nobis is subject to a 60-day filing period.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12743813748652182589&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Trenkler'', 536 F. 3d 85, 95 (1st Cir. 2008)]. Prior to the 2002 enactment of Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(C), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts have held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts relied upon the statement in ''Morgan'' that a writ of coram nobis is a "step in a criminal case" and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals. Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal. [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Johnson'', 237 F. 3d 751, 754 (6th Cir. 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Appeals from coram nobis orders do not require a certificate of appealability ''' In 1996, Congress enacted the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] ("AEDPA") which included language that limits the power of federal judges to grant motions for habeas relief, including motions for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. AEDPA requires a [[Certificate of Appealability]] in order to appeal a district court's ruling on a habeas corpus petition. Unlike the writ of habeas corpus, a Certificate of Appealability is not required in order to appeal a district court's ruling on a coram nobis petition. Neither the [[All Writs Act|28 U.S.C. § 1651(a)]] statute making the writ of coram nobis available in federal courts in criminal matters nor any [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure|Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure]] requires a certificate of appealability before an appeal may be taken, nor does such a requirement appear in the case law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=404840111229367794&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Baptiste'', 223 F.3d 188, 189 n. 1 (3d Cir.2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some prisoners have attempted to file coram nobis petitions if AEDPA prevents the petitioner from filing under § 2255. However, federal courts have consistently held that prisoners may not resort to the writ of coram nobis in order to bypass AEDPA's gatekeeping requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6470098108909325880&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Barreto-Barreto v. United States'', 551 F. 3d 95, 103 (1st Cir. 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The [[standard of review]] from a district court's denial of a coram nobis petition is similar to the standard of review from a district court's denial of a habeas corpus petition.''' Generally, the standard of review is that any district court's determinations on questions of law are reviewed [[Standard of review#De novo|de novo]], but that district court's determinations on questions of fact are reviewed for clear error (or clearly erroneous error).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15607438945352724251&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Orocio'', 645 F. 3d 630, 635 (3rd Cir. 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Under de novo review of federal coram nobis cases, the appellate court acts as if it were considering the question of law for the first time, affording no deference to the decision of the district court. Under Clear Error review of federal coram nobis cases, the appellate court must have a "definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed" by the district court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1246627282965570135 ''Concrete Pipe &amp; Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal.'', 508 U.S. 602, 622 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. state courts==

Only sixteen state courts and District of Columbia courts recognize the availability of writs of coram nobis or coram vobis. Each state is free to operate its own coram nobis procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system. The writ of coram nobis is not available in a majority of states because those states have enacted uniform [[Post conviction|post-conviction]] acts that provide a streamlined, single remedy for obtaining relief from a judgment of conviction, and that remedy is available to petitioners who are no longer in custody.  States that have replaced writs of coram nobis with remedies within their post-conviction proceedings are also independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system.  These proceedings enacted by state legislatures may either be more or less stringent than the writs it replaced or the post-conviction proceedings of other states.

===Alabama===
Alabama state courts strictly follow the common law definition of the writ of ''coram nobis'' where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]].  The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The writ has only been applied to juveniles.  The [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines for ''coram nobis'' petitions for state courts in Alabama (citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11531273481429194505&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''W.B.S. v. State'', (2017) ___ Ala. ___ No. CR-15-0956 (decided April 28, 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=Rule 32, Ala. R. Crim. P. is applicable only to a "Defendant convicted of a criminal offense". Under Alabama law, a juvenile is not convicted of a criminal offense so as to be able to take advantage of the provisions of Rule 32. The writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy known more for its denial than its approval. Even so, Alabama Courts allow the writ of error coram nobis to attack judgments in certain restricted instances.
When no rule or statute controls, "[t]he common law of England, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws and institutions of this state, shall, together with such institutions and laws, be the rule of decisions, and shall continue in force, except as from time to time it may be altered or repealed by the Legislature." § 1-3-1, Ala. Code 1975.
The writ of error coram nobis was one of the oldest remedies of the common law. It lay to correct a judgment rendered by the court upon errors of fact not appearing on the record and so important that if the court had known of them at the trial it would not have rendered the judgment. The ordinary writ of error lay to an appellate court to review an error of law apparent on the record. The writ of error coram nobis lay to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the contested judgment. Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to the docket for new trial.
An evidentiary hearing must be held on a coram nobis petition which is meritorious on its face. An evidentiary hearing on a coram nobis petition are required upon meritorious allegations:
*that counsel was denied.
*that the State used perjured testimony.
*that petitioner was not advised of right to appeal or right to transcript.
*of an ineffective assistance of counsel, specifically, failing to present alibi witnesses and failing to subpoena witnesses.
*of the denial of effective assistance of counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8703479901951317264&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Ex parte Boatwright'', 471 So. 2d 1257 (Ala. 1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A writ of error coram nobis is also the proper procedural mechanism by which a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent may collaterally challenge that adjudication.}}

===Arkansas===
Arkansas state courts may issue a writ of coram nobis for only four types of claims: [[Insanity defense|insanity]] at the time of trial, a coerced guilty plea, material evidence withheld by the prosecutor, or a third-party confession to the crime during the time between conviction and appeal. The [[Arkansas Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Arkansas]] provides the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Arkansas (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13777911819159056273&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Thompson v. State'', 531 S.W.3d 393 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=An Arkansas trial court can entertain a petition for writ of error coram nobis after a judgment has been affirmed on appeal only after the Arkansas Supreme Court grants permission to recall the case's [[Mandate (criminal law)|mandate]]. A writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinarily rare remedy. Coram nobis proceedings are administered with a strong presumption that the judgment of conviction is valid.  The function of the writ is to secure relief from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact that would have prevented its rendition if it had been known to the trial court and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not brought forward before rendition of the judgment. The petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a fundamental error of fact extrinsic to the record. The court is not required to accept at face value the allegations of the petition.

Due diligence is required in making application for relief, and, in the absence of a valid excuse for delay, the petition will be denied. The mere naked allegation that a constitutional right has been invaded will not suffice. The application should make a full disclosure of specific facts relied upon and not merely state conclusions as to the nature of such facts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6174293652468987304&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Larimore'', 341 Ark. 397, 17 S.W.3d 87 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of the writ of coram nobis is that it is addressed to the very court that renders the judgment where injustice is alleged to have been done, rather than to an appellate or other court. The writ is allowed only under compelling circumstances to achieve justice and to address errors of the most fundamental nature.  A writ of coram nobis is available to address certain errors of the most fundamental nature that are found in one of four categories:
# Insanity at the time of trial, 
# A coerced guilty plea, 
# Material evidence withheld by the prosecutor, or 
# A third-party confession to the crime during the time between conviction and appeal.

To warrant coram nobis relief, the petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a fundamental error extrinsic to the record that would have prevented rendition of the judgment had it been known and, through no fault of the petitioner, was not brought forward before rendition of judgment. Moreover, the fact that a petitioner merely alleges a ''Brady'' violation is not sufficient to provide a basis for coram nobis relief.  To establish a [[Brady disclosure|''Brady'']] violation, three elements are required: (1) the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or because it is impeaching; (2) that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; (3) prejudice must have ensued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13777911819159056273&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Thompson'' at 396]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===California===
California state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[Supreme Court of California]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in California (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4523633501752438352&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v. Kim'', (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1078, 1091-96]&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is a non-statutory, common law remedy whose origins trace back to an era in England in which appeals and new trial motions were unknown. Far from being of constitutional origin, the proceeding designated "coram nobis" was contrived by the courts at an early epoch in the growth of common law procedure to provide a corrective remedy because of the absence at that time of the right to move for a new trial and the right of appeal from the judgment. The grounds on which a litigant may obtain relief via a writ of coram nobis are narrower than on habeas corpus.  The writ's purpose is to secure relief, where no other remedy exists, from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact which would have prevented its rendition if the trial court had known it and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not then known to the court.

The principal office of the writ of coram nobis was to enable the same court which had rendered the judgment to reconsider it in a case in which the record still remained before that court. The most comprehensive statement of the office and function of this writ which has come to our notice is the following: The office of the writ of coram nobis is to bring the attention of the court to, and obtain relief from, errors of fact, such as the death of either party pending the suit and before judgment therein; or infancy, where the party was not properly represented by guardian, or coverture, where the common-law disability still exists, or insanity, it seems, at the time of the trial; or a valid defense existing in the facts of the case, but which, without negligence on the part of the defendant, was not made, either through duress or fraud or excusable mistake; these facts not appearing on the face of the record, and being such as, if known in season, would have prevented the rendition and entry of the judgment questioned.

The writ of coram nobis does not lie to correct any error in the judgment of the court nor to contradict or put in issue any fact directly passed upon and affirmed by the judgment itself. If this could be, there would be no end of litigation. The writ of coram nobis is not intended to authorize any court to review and revise its opinions; but only to enable it to recall some adjudication made while some fact existed which, if before the court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; and which without fault or negligence of the party, was not presented to the court. It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a criminal charge merely because the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.

With the advent of statutory new trial motions, the availability of direct appeal, and the expansion of the scope of the writ of habeas corpus, writs of coram nobis had, by the 1930's, become a remedy practically obsolete except in the most rare of instances and applicable to only a very limited class of cases. The statutory motion for new trial has, for most purposes, superseded the common law remedy; and, until recent years, coram nobis was virtually obsolete in California.

The seminal case setting forth the modern requirements for obtaining a writ of coram nobis is ''People v. Shipman''&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9828531622292540314&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v. Shipman'' (1965) 62 Cal.2d 226]&lt;/ref&gt; which stated the writ of coram nobis may be granted only when three requirements are met:
# The petitioner must show that some fact exists which, without any fault or negligence on his part, was not presented to the court at the trial on the merits, and which if presented would have prevented the rendition of the judgment.
# The petitioner must show that the newly discovered evidence does not go to the merits of issues tried; issues of fact, once adjudicated, even though incorrectly, cannot be reopened except on motion for new trial.  This second requirement applies even though the evidence in question is not discovered until after the time for moving for a new trial has elapsed or the motion has been denied.
# The petitioner must show that the facts upon which he relies were not known to him and could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered by him at any time substantially earlier than the time of his motion for the writ.
Several aspects of the test set forth in ''Shipman'' illustrate the narrowness of the remedy. Because the writ of coram nobis applies where a fact unknown to the parties and the court existed at the time of judgment that, if known, would have prevented rendition of the judgment, the remedy does not lie to enable the court to correct errors of law.  Moreover, the allegedly new fact must have been unknown and must have been in existence at the time of the judgment.

For a newly discovered fact to qualify as the basis for the writ of coram nobis, courts look to the fact itself and not its legal effect. It has often been held that the motion or writ is not available where a defendant voluntarily and with knowledge of the facts pleaded guilty or admitted alleged prior convictions because of ignorance or mistake as to the legal effect of those facts.

Finally, the writ of coram nobis is unavailable when a litigant has some other remedy at law. A writ of coram nobis is not available where the defendant had a remedy by (a) appeal or (b) motion for a new trial and failed to avail himself of such remedies. The writ of coram nobis is not a catch-all by which those convicted may litigate and relitigate the propriety of their convictions ad infinitum. In the vast majority of cases a trial followed by a motion for a new trial and an appeal affords adequate protection to those accused of crime. The writ of coram nobis serves a limited and useful purpose. It will be used to correct errors of fact which could not be corrected in any other manner. But it is well-settled law in this and in other states that where other and adequate remedies exist the writ is not available.

The writ was issued by state courts in California in these types of situations:
*Where the defendant was insane at the time of trial and this fact was unknown to court and counsel.
*Where defendant was an infant and appeared by attorney without the appointment of a guardian or guardian ad litem.
*Where the defendant was a feme covert and her husband was not joined.
*Where the defendant was a slave and was tried and sentenced as a free man.
*Where the defendant was dead at the time judgment was rendered.
*Where default was entered against a defendant who had not been served with summons and who had no notice of the proceeding.
*Where counsel inadvertently entered an unauthorized appearance in behalf of a defendant who had not been served with process.
*Where a plea of guilty was procured by extrinsic fraud.
*Where a plea of guilty was extorted through fear of mob violence.
*Where defendants and their counsel were induced by false representations to remain away from the trial under circumstances amounting to extrinsic fraud.

By contrast, the writ of coram nobis was found unavailable by state courts in California in the following situations:
*Where trial counsel improperly induced the defendant to plead guilty to render him eligible for diversion and the trial court eventually denied diversion.
*Where the defendant pleaded guilty to having a prior felony conviction when he was eligible to have the prior reduced to a misdemeanor.
*Where the defendant discovered new facts that would have bolstered the defense already presented at trial. The court concluded that although the new facts would have been material and possibly beneficial to the defendant at trial, they would not have precluded entry of the judgment.
*Where the defendant mistakenly believed his plea to second degree murder meant he would serve no more than 15 years in prison.
*Where the defendant claimed neither his attorney nor the court had advised him before he pleaded that his convictions would render him eligible for civil commitment under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA).
*Where the defendant challenged the legality of his arrest, the identity of the informant, and the failure of the court to make findings on the prior convictions. Coram nobis denied on the ground that "all of these matters could have been raised on appeal".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4523633501752438352&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v.

===Connecticut===
Connecticut state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[Connecticut Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Connecticut]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Connecticut (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10252557976990208200&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Henderson'', 259 Conn. 1, 3, 787 A.2d 514 (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=A writ of coram nobis is an ancient common-law remedy which is authorized only by the trial judge.  The same judge who presided over the trial of the defendant is the only judge with the authority to entertain a writ of coram nobis unless the judge who presided over the case was not available, such as retirement or reassignment. If the original presiding judge is not available, then a judge of the same court must entertain the writ.

The writ must be filed within three years of conviction. This limitation is jurisdictional, so trial courts must dismiss petitions filed after the three-year limitations for lack of jurisdiction. This limitations period for coram nobis petitions has been the law in Connecticut since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;''Jeffery v. Fitch'', 46 Conn. 601, 604 (1879)&lt;/ref&gt;

The facts must be unknown at the time of the trial without fault of the party seeking relief. The writ must present facts, not appearing in the record, which, if true, would show that such judgment was void or voidable.

A writ of coram nobis lies only in the unusual situation in which no adequate remedy is provided by law. Moreover, when habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the writ of coram nobis will not lie. Prisoners who are in custody may only attack their conviction or sentence through habeas corpus and they are not eligible to file writs of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10252557976990208200&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Henderson'' at 3]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===District of Columbia===
District of Columbia courts were established in 1970.  The court's authority is derived from the United States Congress rather than from the inherent sovereignty of the states. District of Columbia courts may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either [[Question of fact|errors of fact]] or [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for District of Columbia courts (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17954759657369994288&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hamid'', 531 A.2d 628, 634 (D.C.1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis in the District of Columbia is similar to the US Federal Court's interpretation of the writ where the writ of coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy that can be used to correct a legal or factual error.

The primary function of the writ of coram nobis at common law was to correct errors of fact on the part of the trial court, not attributable to the negligence of the defendant, when the errors alleged were of the most fundamental character; that is, such as rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.  The writ of provides a petitioner the opportunity to correct errors of fact not apparent on the face of the record and unknown to the trial court. In reviewing a petition for such a writ, there is a presumption that the proceeding in question was without error, and the petitioner bears the burden of showing otherwise.

The writ of coram nobis is available under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651(a) (2006), and the petitioner must show:
# The trial court was unaware of the facts giving rise to the petition; 
# The omitted information is such that it would have prevented the sentence or judgment; 
# The petitioner is able to justify the failure to provide the information;
# The error is extrinsic to the record; and 
# The error is of the most fundamental character.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17954759657369994288&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hamid'' at 634]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Maryland===
Maryland state courts may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either [[Question of fact|errors of fact]] or [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Maryland (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5814012533990339974&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Skok v. State'', 361 Md. 52, 760 A.2d 647 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=A convicted petitioner is entitled to relief through the common law writ of coram nobis if and only if:
# The petitioner challenges a conviction based on constitutional, jurisdictional, or fundamental grounds, whether factual or legal;
# The petitioner rebuts the presumption of regularity that attaches to the criminal case;
# The petitioner faces significant collateral consequences from the conviction;
# The issue as to the alleged error has not been waived or "finally litigated in a prior proceeding, [absent] intervening changes in the applicable law"; 
# The petitioner is not entitled to another statutory or common law remedy (for example, the petitioner cannot be incarcerated in a State prison or on parole or probation, as the petitioner likely could then petition for post-conviction relief).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5814012533990339974&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Skok'' at 661-62 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, the Maryland Code (2014 Supp.), § 8-401 of the Criminal Procedure Article ("CP § 8-401") clarified that the failure to seek an appeal in a criminal case may not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18438526815994401263&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Smith'', 443 Md. 572, 576, 117 A.3d 1093, 1097 (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A writ denied in a lower state court may be appealed. A writ of coram nobis remains a civil action in Maryland, independent of the underlying action from which it arose.  As a coram nobis case is an independent civil action, an appeal from a final judgment in such an action is authorized by the broad language of the general appeals statute, Code § 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.  An appeal under the general appeals statutes would lie from a final trial court judgment in a coram nobis proceeding.  Although the Post Conviction Procedure Act precludes appeals in coram nobis cases brought by an incarcerated person "challenging the validity of incarceration under sentence of imprisonment", neither the Post Conviction Procedure Act nor any other statute which has been called to our attention restricts the right of appeal for a convicted person who is not incarcerated and not on parole or probation, who is suddenly faced with a significant collateral consequence of his or her conviction, and who can legitimately challenge the conviction on constitutional or fundamental grounds. Such person should be able to file a motion for coram nobis relief regardless of whether the alleged infirmity in the conviction is considered an error of fact or an error of law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18438526815994401263&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Smith'' at 1097]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Nebraska===
Nebraska state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].

{{quote|1=The common-law writ of coram nobis exists in Nebraska under Nebraska Revised Statutes § 49-101 (Reissue 2010), which adopts English common law to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, the organic law of this state, or any law passed by the Nebraska Legislature.

The purpose of the writ of error coram nobis is to bring before the court rendering judgment matters of fact which, if known at the time the judgment was rendered, would have prevented its rendition. The writ reaches only matters of fact unknown to the applicant at the time of judgment, not discoverable through reasonable diligence, and which are of a nature that, if known by the court, would have prevented entry of judgment. The writ is not available to correct errors of law.

The burden of proof in a proceeding to obtain a writ of coram nobis is upon the applicant claiming the error, and the alleged error of fact must be such as would have prevented a conviction. It is not enough to show that it might have caused a different result.

A writ of coram nobis reaches only matters of fact unknown to the applicant at the time of judgment, not discoverable through reasonable diligence, and which are of a nature that, if known by the court, would have prevented entry of judgment.

===Nevada===
Nevada state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Supreme Court of Nevada]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Nevada (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7404177734099015049&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Trujillo v. State'', 310 P.3d 594, 597 (Nev. 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=Nevada Revised Statute 1.030, recognizes the applicability of the common law, and the all-writs language in Article 6, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution. This statute provides that the common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to or in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or the Constitution and laws of Nevada, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of Nevada. The post-conviction remedy authorized by Nevada statute, NRS 34.724(2)(b), provides that the petitioner must be in actual custody or have suffered a criminal conviction and not completed the sentence imposed pursuant to the judgment of conviction. Therefore, this statute is not available for those who are no longer in custody. Therefore, the common-law writ of coram nobis is available for a person who is not in custody on the conviction being challenged.

The writ of coram nobis may be used to address errors of fact outside the record that affect the validity and regularity of the decision itself and would have precluded the judgment from being rendered. The writ is limited to errors involving facts that were not known to the court, were not withheld by the defendant, and would have prevented entry of the judgment. A factual error does not include claims of newly discovered evidence because these types of claims would not have precluded the judgment from being entered in the first place. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel also involves legal error and is therefore not available.

Any error that was reasonably available to be raised while the petitioner was in custody is waived, and it is the petitioner's burden on the face of his petition to demonstrate that he could not have reasonably raised his claims during the time he was in custody.

In filing the petition in the trial court is a step in the criminal process; however, the writ of coram nobis should be treated as a civil writ for appeal purposes. The writ is a discretionary writ and so a lower court's ruling on a petition for the writ is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard in the appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7404177734099015049&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Trujillo'' at 597]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New Hampshire===
New Hampshire courts may issue a writ of coram nobis to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. It is currently undetermined whether the writ may be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in New Hampshire (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2017/2017017santamaria.pdf ''State v. Santamaria'', 169 N.H. 722, 157 A.3d 409 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is an ancient writ that developed in sixteenth century England. The writ addresses errors discovered when the petitioner is no longer in custody and therefore cannot avail himself of the writ of habeas corpus. Granting such an extraordinary writ is reserved for the rarest of cases.

Because the writ of coram nobis existed within the body of English common law prior to adoption of our constitution, it continues to exist as a matter of New Hampshire common law so long as it is not "repugnant to the rights and liberties contained in [our] constitution". N.H. CONST. pt. II, art. 90. The common law writ of coram nobis is available in New Hampshire courts, because it was in force at the time of the New Hampshire constitution and there is no conflict between the writ of coram nobis and the constitution. The standard of appellate review of the denial of coram nobis is the same as the standard of review for a habeas corpus petition.

Coram nobis is available to correct a constitutional violation. A requirement to bringing a petition for a writ of coram nobis is that sound reasons exist for failing to seek appropriate earlier relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2017/2017017santamaria.pdf ''Santamaria'', at 411-412]&lt;/ref&gt;

New Hampshire courts rely upon habeas corpus procedures to guide its approach to coram nobis proceedings, given the similarities between these avenues for relief. Similarly to habeas petitions, a trial court may deny a petition for a writ of coram nobis without holding an evidentiary hearing if the record clearly demonstrates that the defendant is not entitled to coram nobis relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3522506785478977461&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v.

===New York===
New York state courts may issue a writ of coram nobis only for claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The [[New York Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals of the State of New York]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in New York (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17787332307960618177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v Syville'', 15 N.Y.3d 391, 400 (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In New York courts, the writ of coram nobis is available but its application is considerably different than the writ's application in other courts. In 1971, most of the common-law, coram nobis types of relief were abrogated when the New York Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 (CPL 440.10) was enacted to embrace the deprivation of constitutional rights outside the record; however, the specific category of "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" was not specified by the Legislature at the time of its enactment.

The U.S. Constitution provides that a criminal defendant must be provided a right to appeal an unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel.  Consistent with the demands of due process, a criminal defendant must be allowed to assert that a right to appeal was extinguished due solely to the unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel in failing to file a timely notice of appeal.

CPL 460.30 contains a significant restriction as it imposes a one-year limit for the filing of a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal.  Consistent with the due process mandate, CPL 460.30 should not categorically bar an appellate court from considering that a defendant's application to pursue an untimely appeal whenever:
# An attorney has failed to comply with a timely request for the filing of a notice of appeal and 
# The defendant alleges that the omission could not reasonably have been discovered within the one-year period, the time limit imposed in CPL 460.30.

Whenever these two criteria are met, the proper procedure is a coram nobis application to the Appellate Division. After CPL 440.10 was enacted, common-law coram nobis proceeding brought in the proper appellate court became the only available and appropriate procedure and forum to review a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17787332307960618177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Syville'' at 400]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Oregon===
In November 2018, the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] determined that the writ of coram nobis is available in rare cases where newly discovered evidence provides clear and convincing evidence of actual innocence.  The Oregon Court of Appeals provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Oregon (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3987948060500791131&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Reeves v. Nooth'', 294 Or. App. 711 (2018)] Note: this is a recent case and is subject to review by the Oregon Supreme Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1= The process that now governs Oregon post-conviction relief claims, the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), was enacted in 1959. Before its enactment, Oregon had a complex and confusing array of post-conviction remedies, including writs of habeas corpus (as provided both in the Oregon Constitution and in statutes), writs of coram nobis, motions to correct the record, and motions to vacate the judgment. The PCHA was intended to provide a detailed, unitary procedure to persons seeking postconviction relief.

From the time that it was enacted, there were questions as to whether the PCHA addressed claims of factual mistake based on newly discovered evidence—and the extent to which the PCHA altered the remedies available under preexisting law to a convicted person seeking to establish innocence through evidence discovered after the person's criminal trial. Two lawyers who participated in drafting the bill that became the PCHA, Jack Collins and Carl Neil, authored a law review article shortly after the act was adopted. In it, they suggested that innocence claims predicated on newly discovered evidence of innocence were not covered by the act (unless the evidence had been withheld from the petitioner by the prosecutor in a manner that violated the Fourteenth Amendment.) Collins and Neil observed that one of the remedies abolished by the PCHA, coram nobis, "might have been available" in the case of newly discovered evidence establishing innocence. Coram nobis was a procedural tool to correct errors of fact in judicial proceedings, and it functioned as a delayed motion for a new trial. However, Collins and Neil noted that the PCHA forecloses this possibility by abolishing coram nobis in criminal cases. Collins and Neil suggested that the problem of newly discovered evidence should be the subject of additional legislation. More than a half century has passed, and the legislature has not enacted such additional legislation or amended the text of ORS 138.530. Thus, the statutory bases for relief under the PCHA remain essentially as they were in 1959—with no more clarity as to whether the PCHA provides a mechanism for advancing a claim of innocence based on newly discovered evidence.

To the extent the constitution may protect the right of a convicted person to collaterally challenge a conviction based on new evidence of actual innocence, that remedy likely would take the form of coram nobis, a remedy that, historically, demanded proof of an extraordinary circumstance of innocence based on newly discovered evidence. Thus, in Oregon state courts
*The writ of coram nobis, or "motion in the nature of coram nobis," is an elastic but extraordinary remedy to correct mistakes of fact that occurred at trial. 
*The writ of coram nobis or motion in the nature of coram nobis allows courts to avoid manifest injustice or fraud on the court.
*Coram nobis is available only if it appears from the petition that the facts tendered as a basis for a new trial would have prevented the judgment entered.
*The standard for any cognizable actual-innocence claim under Oregon law, whether based on underlying constitutional or common-law principles, would necessarily reflect the same hesitance toward reopening a criminal proceeding based on anything less than reliable and compelling evidence calling into question, as a factual matter, the convicted person's guilt.
*The principles governing claims of actual innocence in federal court, to the extent those principles foreshadow the parameters of a federal constitutional claim of actual innocence, likewise indicate that a federal claim would be governed by similar exacting standards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3987948060500791131&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Reeves v.

===South Dakota===
South Dakota state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].

Class'', 1998 S.D. 106, ¶ 18, 584 N.W.2d 873, 878]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis has traditionally been used to present facts extrinsic to the record in circumstances where no other remedy was available. An elementary restriction to the writ is that it will not permit a new examination of questions previously determined. Nor may it be employed as an alternative for direct appeal or habeas corpus.

In South Dakota, the jurisdiction of a court to grant relief under coram nobis is of limited scope. Any proceeding which is challenged by the writ is presumed to be correct and the burden rests on its petitioner to show otherwise. Relief will be granted only when circumstances compel such action to achieve justice. With one significant exception, coram nobis deals only with errors of fact. The exception is that the writ can reach certain constitutionally significant errors like jurisdictional defects.

The writ permits review of new evidence only if it was discovered after entry of the judgment and could not have been discovered and produced during the period when a statutory remedy was available. Any factual errors which have been, could have been, or should have been reviewed with another available remedy cannot be examined in coram nobis. On the other hand, facts incapable of being brought out earlier due to fraud or coercion may form the basis for coram nobis relief.

Those seeking coram nobis relief must carefully study the procedural history of the case, because past events control over which issues may or may not be raised and trial records have to be examined in order to ascertain whether a claim is barred.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18353172842810443075&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Gregory'' at 878]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tennessee===
Tennessee courts may issue a writ of coram nobis only for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment had it been presented at the trial. The [[Tennessee Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Tennessee]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Tennessee (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7728047675978746326&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Nunley v. State'', ___ S.W.3d ___ (Tenn. 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In Tennessee, the writ of coram nobis was recognized at common law but was not available in criminal cases. In 1858, the Tennessee General Assembly codified the procedure for petitioning for a writ of error coram nobis. This early codification of the writ was very limited in scope and could not be used to challenge judgments in criminal cases. In 1955, Tennessee's General Assembly extended the writ of error coram nobis to apply specifically to criminal proceedings. However, the new statutory writ could not be used to collaterally challenge a conviction based on newly discovered evidence. Finally, in 1978, the legislature broadened the scope of the writ to permit it to be used to challenge a judgment in a criminal case based on newly discovered evidence. Though the writ of coram nobis in civil cases was superseded when Rule 60 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure became effective in 1971, the adoption of Rule 60 did not supersede the statute which extended the writ as an available remedy in criminal proceedings. Currently the Tennessee statute on the writ of coram nobis provides:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|Upon a showing by the defendant that the defendant was without fault in failing to present certain evidence at the proper time, a writ of coram nobis will lie for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment, had it been presented at the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2017/title-27/chapter-7/section-27-7-102/ TN Code § 27-7-102 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decision whether to grant or deny a petition for writ of coram nobis lies within the discretionary authority of the trial court. The writ of coram nobis is not available for attacking a guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13756889861943887747&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Frazier v. State'', 495 SW 3d 246 (Tenn. 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; Before granting a writ of coram nobis, the trial court must be satisfied with the reliability of the newly discovered evidence and determine that the defendant is without fault in timely discovering such evidence. The trial court must then review the evidence presented at trial and at the coram nobis proceeding and determine whether a reasonable basis exists for concluding that had the new evidence been presented at trial, the result of the proceedings might have been different. Coram nobis claims are not easily resolved on the face of the petition and often require a hearing; however, an evidentiary hearing is not statutorily required in every case. Coram nobis petitions with inadequate allegations are susceptible to summary dismissal on the face of the petition, without discovery or an evidentiary hearing.

The writ of error coram nobis cannot be used to advance claims under ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9550433126269674519 ''Brady v. Maryland'', 373 U.S. 83 (1963)]&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''Brady'' claim is a claim that a defendant’s right to a fair trial was violated because the State withheld exculpatory evidence that it is constitutionally required to provide to defendants. ''Brady'' claims must instead be litigated through the Tennessee Post-Conviction Procedure Act.  Timeliness under the statute of limitations is also an essential element of a coram nobis claim.  Unless time is [[Tolling (law)|tolled]] by a court, a writ of error coram nobis must be filed within one year of the date of a defendant’s conviction.

Since a petition for writ of error coram nobis is untimely unless filed within one year of the time a judgment becomes final in the trial court, a timely petition for writ of error coram nobis will almost always be filed while the defendant’s [[Appellate procedure in the United States#Direct Appeal|direct appeal]] is pending.  Therefore, when a convicted defendant files a petition for writ of coram nobis in the trial court while the direct appeal is pending, he or she must simultaneously file a motion in the appellate court to stay the appeal as of right until conclusion of the coram nobis proceeding in the trial court. On the same day that a petition for writ of coram nobis is filed in the trial court, the petitioner should also file in the appellate court a motion requesting that the appellate proceedings be stayed pending the trial court's decision on the writ of coram nobis. A copy of the petition should be attached to the motion. Under most circumstances, the motion to stay should be granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2020995530047118426&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v.

An appellate court will find an abuse of discretion only when the trial court applied incorrect legal standards, reached an illogical conclusion, based its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or employed reasoning that causes an injustice to the complaining party.}}

===Vermont===
Vermont state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Vermont Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Vermont]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Vermont (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10849612183104217504&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Sinclair'', 191 Vt. 489, 492, 49 A.3d 152, 154 (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ was designed to fill this gap somewhat to correct errors of fact affecting the validity and regularity of the judgment. It was commonly used in civil cases, but seldom in criminal cases. Vermont decisions have long recognized the general availability of coram nobis. In 1830, the Vermont Supreme Court explained that a writ of coram nobis will lie for error in fact, but it does not lie for error in law. The function of the writ is to call to the attention of the trial court facts and circumstances outside the record which would have precluded the entry of judgment had such facts been known and established at the time of the conviction.

In 1971, the writ was explicitly abolished in civil cases following adoption of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure. When the PCR statute was enacted, it provided a means for those "in custody under sentence" to vacate, set aside or correct an invalid sentence, but the statute does not mention the writ of coram nobis. Similarly, the criminal rules set out various forms of post-judgment relief do not address coram nobis explicitly. Because the Vermont PCR statute and the criminal rules are silent on the issue, the common law remedy of coram nobis is a viable means for challenging criminal convictions. It may be used when no other remedy is available, but may not be used to supplant relief through direct appeal, post-judgment motion or PCR petition.

The Vermont Supreme Court has provided that a petition for a writ of coram nobis must be brought in the court that rendered judgment; however, the court has not reached the question as to the scope of the writ of coram nobis in state courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10849612183104217504&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Sinclair'' at 154]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Virginia===
Virginia state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram vobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Supreme Court of Virginia]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram vobis petitions for state courts in Virginia (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2076285305325782298&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Neighbors v. Commonwealth'', 274 Va. 503, 508, 650 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In Virginia, state courts use the term "coram vobis" instead of "coram nobis", although both writs are identical in nature. Virginia state courts are the last remaining courts known to incorporate the five-hundred year-old term, "writ of coram vobis".

The term "coram vobis" is Latin for "before you".  The full name is quae coram vobis resident ("Let the record remain before you"). It was called coram vobis (before you — the king's justices) in Common Pleas, where the king was not supposed to reside. It was called coram nobis (before us) in King's Bench because the king was supposed to preside in person in that court. The difference related only to the form appropriate to each court and the distinction disappeared in the United States when the need for the distinction ended.

In 1776, Virginia incorporated all of English common law by an ordinance of the Virginia convention. With the incorporation of English common law, Virginia recognized two ways in which a litigant could approach a trial court to challenge a final judgment. This could be done by 1) motion or 2) writ of coram nobis. The first Virginia case to recognize that a motion could be used to achieve the result of the writ of coram nobis was the 1795 decision in ''Gordon v. Frazier''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon v. Frazier'', 2 Va. 130 (1795)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gordon'', the use of a motion to have a trial court revisit a final judgment was the general practice at that time, even though the writ of coram nobis was available for the same purpose. It appears that the reason litigants used a motion to challenge a judgment, instead of the writ, was because filing a motion was less expensive than instituting a new proceeding by filing a petition for a writ. The court in Gordon summarized this matter as follows:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|This case tho' depending upon a practice not common in this country is by no means a difficult one. I have no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon'' at 130&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1957, the writ was substantially limited by the General Assembly through Code § 8.01-677, which provides that {{nowrap|"[f]or}} any clerical error or error in fact for which a judgment may be reversed or corrected on writ of error coram vobis, the same may be reversed or corrected on motion, after reasonable notice, by the court."  In other words, the Code restricted a writ of error coram vobis only to clerical errors and certain errors in fact.

The principal function of the writ in Virginia is to afford to the court in which an action was tried an opportunity to correct its own record with reference to a vital fact not known when the judgment was rendered, and which could not have been presented by a motion for a new trial, appeal or other existing statutory proceeding.  In order to qualify for a writ of coram vobis:
* The petitioner must attack his conviction for an error of fact not apparent on the record.
* The discovery of factual errors must not be attributable to the applicant's negligence.
* The facts, if known by the court at the time of trial, would have prevented rendition of the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2076285305325782298&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Neighbors v. Commonwealth'', 274 Va. 503, 508, 650 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===West Virginia===
West Virginia state courts may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either [[Question of fact|errors of fact]] or [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in West Virginia (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14674575394383273578&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Hutton'', 235 W.Va. 724, 776 S.E.2d 621 (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is only granted as a remedy of last resort where an error is of the most fundamental character and there exists no other available remedy. The writ is narrowly limited to extraordinary cases presenting circumstances compelling its use to achieve justice.

In West Virginia, the common law writ of coram nobis was abolished in civil cases in 1960 pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure. No provision equivalent to the relief mechanism of Rule 60(b) exists in the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure.

West Virginia courts are authorized to issue the writ in criminal proceeding using criteria similar to the criteria established by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]]. The criteria established a four-part test. A petitioner seeking this relief must show that:
# A more usual remedy is not available. In other words, a petition for a writ of coram nobis may only be filed after a sentence has been served and the petitioner is no longer in custody.  
# Valid reasons exist for not attacking the conviction earlier. Petitioners need to show reasonable diligence, where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels.
# Adverse consequences exist from the conviction; however, West Virginia courts have not yet established what constitutes "adverse consequences"'
# The error is of the most fundamental character. The error to be corrected must be an error which resulted in a complete miscarriage of justice. In other words, the error is one that has rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14674575394383273578&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hutton'' at 639]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wisconsin===
Wisconsin state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Wisconsin (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2396685506548555162&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Jessen v. State'', 95 Wis. 2d 207, 212, 213-14, 290 N.W.2d 685, 687, 688 (1980)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is a common law remedy which empowers the trial court to correct its own record. The writ of coram nobis was given statutory recognition by the enactment of the 1949 Revision of the Wisconsin Code of Criminal Procedure. That section 958.07 of this statute provided:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|The writ of coram nobis may be issued by the trial court at any time upon the verified petition of the defendant showing sufficient grounds therefor, which may be supported by one or more affidavits. The petition and writ shall be served on the district attorney, who may move to quash the writ or make return thereto, or both. The court may hear and determine the writ either upon the affidavits submitted by the parties or upon testimony or both, in its discretion. The party aggrieved may have the determination of the trial court reviewed by the supreme court upon appeal or writ of error.}}

The Advisory Committee's comment to section 958.07 expressly acknowledged the fact that sec. 958.07 merely gave "statutory recognition to the common-law writ of coram nobis". This statute prescribed the procedure to be followed in granting the writ of coram nobis but did not state the grounds for issuing the writ, leaving that aspect to be determined from the cases.

The courts have established that the writ of coram nobis is of very limited scope. It is a discretionary writ which is addressed to the trial court.  The purpose of the writ is to give the trial court an opportunity to correct its own record of an error of fact not appearing on the record and which error would not have been committed by the court if the matter had been brought to the attention of the trial court.

In order to constitute grounds for the issuance of a writ of coram nobis there must be shown the existence of an error of fact which was unknown at the time of trial and which is of such a nature that knowledge of its existence at the time of trial would have prevented the entry of judgment. The writ does not lie to correct errors of law and of fact appearing on the record since such errors are traditionally corrected by appeals and writs of error.  Where the writ of habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the writ of coram nobis will not be granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2396685506548555162&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Jessen'' at 213-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

The petitioner must establish that no other remedy is available. In other words, the petitioner must no longer be in custody. The petitioner must also establish the factual error that the petitioner wishes to correct must be crucial to the ultimate judgment and the factual finding to which the alleged factual error is directed must not have been previously visited or passed on by the trial court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13451560097554862497&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v.

==Notable cases==

===Gordon Hirabayashi, Minoru Yasui, and Fred Korematsu===
[[File: Korematsu Yasui Hirabayashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|(L-R) [[Fred Korematsu]], [[Minoru Yasui]], and [[Gordon Hirabayashi]]]][[Gordon Hirabayashi]], [[Minoru Yasui]], and [[Fred Korematsu]] are best known for their principled resistance to the [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]]. All three had their convictions overturned through writs of coram nobis, and they were each awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s administration concluded that [[Japanese Americans]] living in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] were a security threat and thus authorized the military to secure areas from which "any or all persons may be excluded". As a result, Japanese Americans were subject to curfew and other restrictions before being forced into internment camps. Hirabayashi, Yasui, and Korematsu, who were not acquainted with each other at the time, each defied the internment and were convicted for their resistance. Their convictions would be affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] between 1943 and 1944. Four decades after the Court's rulings, lawyers, including civil rights attorney, [[Peter Irons]], re-opened their wartime convictions on the basis of newly discovered evidence of governmental misconduct. The new evidence indicated the government intentionally withheld ''The Ringle Report'', a report drafted by the Office of Naval Intelligence, which would have undermined the administration's position of the military actions, as it finally concluded that most Japanese Americans in the West Coast were not a national security threat at the time of Pearl Harbor.

'''Gordon Hirabayashi''' was born in April 1918 in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]. He was a senior student at the [[University of Washington]] at the time when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to internment camps. Although he first considered accepting internment, he ultimately defied it. In May 1942, Hirabayashi turned himself in to the FBI. After being convicted in October 1942 for the [[curfew]] violation, he was sentenced to 90 days in prison. He also served a one-year sentence at [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|McNeil Island Penitentiary]] for [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]] violations when he refused to answer questions which singled out Japanese Americans on the basis of race alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artsci.washington.edu/news/2000-03/45-years-later-apology-us-government ''45 Years Later, an Apology from the U.S. Government'']. Newsletter of the University of Washington College of Arts and Sciences, Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He appealed to the Supreme Court where, in 1943, his conviction was upheld in ''Hirabayashi v. United States''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5939600273001810074&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hirabayashi v.

'''Minoru Yasui''' was born in 1916 in [[Hood River, Oregon]]. He attended law school at the [[University of Oregon]] and became the first Japanese American lawyer in Oregon in 1939. Upon the declaration of war, Yasui attempted to report for military duty, but his services were refused nine times. After hearing the news of internment, Yasui planned his legal challenge to the government's policies. In March 1942, he deliberately disobeyed the military implemented curfew in Portland, Oregon by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm in order to test the curfew's constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/minoru-yasui-1916-1986/#.WENeto-cG3A Biographies: Minoru Yasui]", ''The Oregon History Project''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted in November 1942. Yasui appealed to the Supreme Court where, in 1943, his conviction was upheld in ''Yasui v. United States''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18295645142744551903&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Yasui v.

United States'', No. 83-151 (D. Or. Jan. 26, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Yasui died in 1986, and he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hirono.senate.gov/press-releases/hirono-honda-praise-awarding-of-presidential-medal-of-freedom-to-civil-rights-leader-minoru-yasui ''Hirono, Honda Praise Awarding Of Presidential Medal Of Freedom To Civil Rights Leader Minoru Yasui'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred Korematsu''' was born in 1919 in [[Oakland, California]]. He attempted to enlist with the [[United States Navy]] when called for military duty under the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]], but he was rejected due to stomach ulcers. In March 1942, when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to assembly centers, he refused and went into hiding in the Oakland area. He was arrested in May 1942, and held at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] military detention center until his conviction in September 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Fournier, Eric Paul (Director). (2000).

===George Stinney===
[[File: George Stinney mugshot.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[George Stinney]]]]
In December 2014, a writ of ''coram nobis'' was granted by a federal court to posthumously vacate the conviction of [[George Stinney]], a 14-year-old black boy who was convicted of murder and executed in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Campbell|title=South Carolina Judge Vacates Conviction of George Stinney in 1944 Execution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/us/judge-vacates-conviction-in-1944-execution.html|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stinney was convicted in 1944 in a one-day trial of the first-degree murder of two white girls: 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 8-year-old Mary Emma Thames. After being arrested, Stinney was said to have confessed to the crime; however, there was no written record of his confession apart from notes provided by an investigating deputy, and no transcript of the brief trial. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed as a result of the conviction. On December 17, 2014, Stinney's conviction was posthumously [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] 70 years after his execution, because the federal court judge ruled that he had not been given a fair trial; he had no effective defense and therefore his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights had been violated.&lt;ref name=wis&gt;{{cite web |last=Turnage |first=Jeremy |date=December 17, 2014 |url=http://www.wistv.com/story/27651255/george-stinney-14-year-old-convicted-of-44-murder-exonerated |title=George Stinney, 14-year-old convicted of '44 murder, exonerated|publisher=[[WIS]] |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223031/http://www.wistv.com/story/27651255/george-stinney-14-year-old-convicted-of-44-murder-exonerated |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The common law writ of error ''contra nobis'' and its equitable equivalent, the supplemental bill of review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208045043/https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; do not appear to have survived the reforms to English law made in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

Writs of error as a separate proceeding were abolished by  section 148 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict., c.76), which instead provided that "the Proceeding to Error Shall be a Step in the Cause". Error was finally abolished 23 years later in 1875, when Schedule I, Order 58, rule 1 of the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]] was brought into force and the Court of Appeal was created.

===Fresh evidence===
The modern practice at English law where a litigant seeks to rely upon evidence not known at trial is to bring an appeal.

In civil proceedings, CPR 52.11(1)(b) contains a presumption that civil appeals shall be limited to a review of a decision of the lower court, and CPR 52.11(2)(b) contains a presumption that the Court of Appeal shall not receive fresh evidence. The Court of Appeal will exercise its discretion to hear fresh evidence according to the over-riding objective in civil cases to deal with cases justly: however, three key criteria laid down by the Court of Appeal in ''Ladd v Marshall''&lt;ref&gt;''Ladd v Marshall'', [1954] 1 WLR 1489&lt;/ref&gt; continue to be of relevance:

*the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;
*the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive;
*the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed; it must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible.&lt;ref&gt;''Terluk v Berezovsky'' [2011] EWCA Civ 1534&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, where it is "necessary to do so in order to avoid real injustice", in "exceptional" circumstances, and where "there is no alternative effective remedy", CPR 52.17(1) permits both the High Court and the Court of Appeal to re-open a final determination of an appeal.

In criminal proceedings, the Court of Appeal also has a discretion to admit fresh evidence on appeal.  If it does so, the Court must ask itself whether, in light of the fresh evidence, the conviction is unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, s.2(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1968; ''R. v. Pendleton'' [2002] 1 WLR 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special case of fraud===
Soon after the passage of the [[Judicature Acts]], it was thought that, when a judgment had been obtained by wilful fraud of the victorious party, the aggrieved party's proper recourse was to bring a new action for fraud, because to try the alleged fraud required original jurisdiction, which the Court of Appeal did not have.&lt;ref&gt;''Flower v. Lloyd'' (1877) 6 Ch D 297, ''per'' Jessell MR at 300, and approved by the House of Lords in ''Jonesco v Beard'' [1930] AC 298&lt;/ref&gt;

In so ruling, Jessell MR made specific references to the supplemental bill of review, the equitable equivalent of the writ of error ''contra nobis.'' However, the Court drew an analogy with the old law, rather than preserving it: in agreeing with Jessell MR, James LJ observed, "if it is true that there was a fraud practised upon the Court, by which the Court was induced to make a wrong decree, the way to obtain relief will be to bring a ''fresh action'' to set aside the decree on the ground of fraud" [emphasis added].

Since the coming into force of the Civil Procedure Rules, the law has evolved further.  In ''Noble v Owens'',&lt;ref&gt;''Noble v Owens'' [2010] 1 WLR 2491&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal held that the modern position is that it is now not necessary to commence a fresh action to cure a judgment fraudulently obtained. Instead, the powers of the Court of Appeal under CPR 52.10 are sufficiently broad to permit the Court of Appeal to refer the determination of the issue of fraud to a Judge of the High Court as part of the appeal proceedings, with a consequent saving of costs.&lt;ref&gt;''per'' Smith LJ, para. [29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In criminal cases, the Court of Appeal has allowed appeals and quashed convictions on the basis of misconduct by Crown witnesses analogous to fraud, e.g., where prosecution witnesses had subsequently been convicted for giving perjured evidence during the original trial;&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Cummins and Perks'' (1987) 84 Cr App R 71&lt;/ref&gt; or where police officers who took confessions from the appellants had subsequently been discredited in later proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Williams and Smith'' [1995] 1 Cr App R 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent attempts to resurrect the procedure===
In ''Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/9.html |website=[[Bailii]] |title=''Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd'' [2008] EWCA Civ 9 |at=Paras. 78{{ndash}}104 |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unsuccessful attempt was made to resurrect the supplemental bill of review. Jacob LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that an attempt to invoke the old bill of review could not succeed because, for generations, applications for rehearing on the basis of fresh evidence had been made to the Court of Appeal and, if the bill of review procedure had survived the Judicature Acts, it had long since lapsed. The judge observed that "it would make for better justice in principle for a prior decision to be impugnable on the grounds for which a bill of review once lay, namely that there was fresh evidence not discoverable by reasonable diligence, which 'entirely changes the aspect of the case{{'"}} (para. [100]). However, he also observed that the Court of Appeal had not been asked to consider its powers under CPR 52.17 to re-open a final appeal in "exceptional circumstances" and therefore could not say whether such an application would have succeeded.

Moreover, in a Northern Ireland case, ''Walsh's Application'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm ''Walsh's Application'' &amp;#91;2012&amp;#93; NIQB 82] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208045043/https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |date=December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which an application was made for a writ of error ''coram nobis'' following an unsuccessful judicial review, Weatherup J followed the Court of Appeal in ''Cinpres'' by observing, "While the Writ developed at Common Law, I doubt if the procedure survived the appeals process introduced by the Judicature (Ireland) Act 1875", before referring to the provision of that Act dealing with the abolition of proceedings in error. The court concluded that it did not have the jurisdiction to alter the decision made on judicial review.

The above cases indicate that the Judicature Acts and the Civil Procedure Rules provide for a comprehensive system of appeals which effectively ousts the function served by the former bill of review and writ of error ''coram nobis'', which may now be extinct in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

A '''cybersecurity regulation''' comprises directives that safeguard [[information technology]] and [[computer systems]] with the purpose of forcing companies and organizations to protect their systems and information from [[cyberattack]]s like [[computer virus|viruses]], [[computer worm|worms]], [[computer trojan|Trojan horses]], [[phishing]], [[DoS attack|denial of service (DOS) attacks]], [[data breach|unauthorized access (stealing intellectual property or confidential information)]] and [[resilient control systems|control system attacks]].{{ref|howstuffworks}} There are numerous measures available to prevent cyberattacks.

[[Cybersecurity]] measures include [[firewall (networking)|firewall]]s, [[anti-virus software]], [[intrusion detection]] and [[intrusion prevention|prevention]] systems, [[encryption]], and login [[password]]s.{{ref|gordon}} There have been attempts to improve cybersecurity through regulation and collaborative efforts between the [[government]] and the private sector to encourage voluntary improvements to cybersecurity. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Industry regulators, including [[bank regulation|banking regulators]], have taken notice of the risk from cybersecurity and have either begun or planned to begin to include cybersecurity as an aspect of regulatory examinations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/cyberrisk.pdf |title= Cyber: Think risk, not IT |website= pwc.com |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, April, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2011 the DoD released a guidance called the ''Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace'' which articulated five goals: to treat cyberspace as an operational domain, to employ new defensive concepts to protect DoD networks and systems, to partner with other agencies and the private sector in pursuit of a "whole-of-government cybersecurity Strategy", to work with international allies in support of collective cybersecurity and to support the development of a cyber workforce capable of rapid technological innovation. A March 2011 [[GAO]] report "identified protecting the federal government's information systems and the nation's cyber critical infrastructure as a governmentwide high-risk area" noting that federal information security had been designated a high-risk area since 1997. As of 2003 systems protecting critical infrastructure, called cyber critical infrastructure protection of cyber CIP have also been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Social Science Research Network| last1 = Schooner| first1 = Steven L.| last2 = Berteau| first2 = David J.| title = Emerging Policy and Practice Issues (2011)| location = Rochester, NY| accessdate = 2018-07-12| date = 2012-03-01| url = https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2014385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, the DoD put forward the new cybersecurity rule (78 Fed. Reg. 69373), which imposed certain requirements on contractors: compliance with certain [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] IT standards, mandatory reporting of cybersecurity incidents to the DoD, and a "flow-down" clause that applies the same requirements to subcontractors.&lt;ref name=schooner2014&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schooner| first1 = Steven| last2 = Berteau| first2 = David| title = Emerging Policy and Practice Issues| journal = GW Law Faculty Publications &amp; Other Works| url=https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/faculty_publications/1056/ |date = 2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2013 Congressional report found there were over 50 statutes relevant to cybersecurity compliance. The [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002]] (FISMA) is one of the key statutes governing federal cybersecurity regulations.&lt;ref name=schooner2014 /&gt;

==United States==
===Federal government===
There are few federal cybersecurity regulations, and the ones that exist focus on specific industries. The three main cybersecurity regulations are the 1996 [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), the 1999 [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], and the 2002 [[Homeland Security Act]], which included the [[Federal Information Security Management Act]] (FISMA). The three regulations mandate that healthcare organizations, financial institutions and federal agencies should protect their systems and information.{{ref|heiman}} For example, FISMA, which applies to every government agency, "requires the development and implementation of mandatory policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security." However, the regulations do not address numerous computer related industries, such as [[Internet Service Provider]]s (ISPs) and software companies.{{ref|lemos}} Furthermore, the regulations do not specify what cybersecurity measures must be implemented and require only a "reasonable" level of security. The vague language of these regulations leaves much room for interpretation.  [[Bruce Schneier]], the founder of Cupertino's Counterpane Internet Security, argues that companies will not make sufficient investments in cybersecurity unless government forces them to do so.{{ref|kirby}} He also states that successful cyberattacks on government systems still occur despite government efforts.{{ref|lemos}}

It has been suggested that the [[Data Quality Act]] already provides the [[Office of Management and Budget]] the statutory authority to implement [[critical infrastructure protection]] regulations by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] rulemaking process. The idea has not been fully vetted and would require additional legal analysis before a [[rulemaking]] could begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Agencies Already Have the Authority to Issue Critical Infrastructure Protection Regulations?|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20120820_agencies_authority_to_issue_critical_infrastructure_protection/|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State governments===
State governments have attempted to improve cybersecurity by increasing public visibility of firms with weak security. In 2003, [[California]] passed the Notice of Security Breach Act, which requires that any company that maintains personal information of California citizens and has a security breach must disclose the details of the event. Personal information includes name, [[social security number]], driver's license number, [[Payment card number|credit card number]] or financial information.{{ref|privacy}}  Several other states have followed California's example and passed similar security breach notification regulations.{{ref|privacyrights}} Such security breach notification regulations punish firms for their cybersecurity failures while giving them the freedom to choose how to secure their systems. Also, the regulation creates an incentive for companies to voluntarily invest in cybersecurity to avoid the potential loss of reputation and the resulting economic loss that can come from a successful cyber attack. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 2004, the [[California State Legislature]] passed California Assembly Bill 1950, which also applies to businesses that own or maintain personal information for California residents. The regulation dictates for businesses to maintain a reasonable level of security and that they required security practices also extend to business partners.{{ref|rasmussen}} The regulation is an improvement on the federal standard because it expands the number of firms required to maintain an acceptable standard of cybersecurity. However, like the federal legislation, it requires a "reasonable" level of cybersecurity, which leaves much room for interpretation until case law is established.{{ref|rasmussen}}

===Proposed regulation===
The [[US Congress]] has proposed numerous bills that expand upon cybersecurity regulation. The [[Consumer Data Security and Notification Act]] amends the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] to require disclosure of security breaches by financial institutions. Congressmen have also proposed "expanding Gramm-Leach-Bliley to all industries that touch consumer financial information, including any firm that accepts payment by a credit card."{{ref|schmitt}} Congress has proposed cybersecurity regulations similar to California's Notice of Security Breach Act for companies that maintain personal information. The Information Protection and Security Act requires that data brokers "ensure data accuracy and confidentiality, authenticate and track users, detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and mitigate potential harm to individuals."{{ref|epic}}

In addition to requiring companies to improve cybersecurity, Congress is also considering bills that criminalize cyberattacks. The Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass Act ([[SPY ACT]]) was a bill of this type. It focused on phishing and [[spyware]] bill and was passed on May 23, 2005 in the [[US House of Representatives]] but died in the [[US Senate]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr29|title=Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass Act (2005; 109th Congress H.R. 29) – GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill "makes unlawful the unauthorized usage of a computer to take control of it, modify its setting, collect or induce the owner to disclose [[personally identifiable information]], install unsolicited software, and tamper with security, anti-spyware, or [[anti-virus software]]."{{ref|epic}}

On May 12, 2011, US [[Barack Obama]] proposed a package of [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/12/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-legislative-proposal cybersecurity legislative reforms] to improve the security of US persons, the federal government, and critical infrastructure. A year of public debate and Congress hearings followed, resulting in the House of Representative passing an [https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/26/u-s-house-passes-cispa-248-to-168/%20 information sharing bill] and the Senate developing a [http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/07/26/Cybersecurity-bill-wins-key-Senate-vote/UPI-57801343345113/ compromise bill] seeking to balance national security, privacy, and business interests.

In July 2012, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 was proposed by Senators [[Joseph Lieberman]] and [[Susan Collins]].{{ref|Rizzo}} The bill would have required creating voluntary "best practice standards" for protection of key infrastructure from cyber attacks, which businesses would be encouraged to adopt through incentives such as liability protection.{{ref|Rosenzweig}} The bill was put to a vote in the Senate but failed to pass.{{ref|OKeefe}} Obama had voiced his support for the Act in a ''Wall Street Journal'' op-ed{{ref|Fitzpatrick}}, and it also received support from officials in the military and national security including [[John O. Brennan]], the chief counterterrorism adviser to the White House.{{ref|OKeefe}}{{ref|Rizzo}} According to ''The Washington Post'', experts said that the failure to pass the act may leave the United States "vulnerable to widespread hacking or a serious cyberattack." {{ref|OKeefe}} The act was opposed by Republican senators like [[John McCain]] who was concerned that the act would introduce regulations that would not be effective and could be a "burden" for businesses.{{ref|Sasso}} After the Senate vote, Republican Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] stated that the opposition to the bill was not a partisan issue but it not take the right approach to cybersecurity.{{ref|Vijayan}}The senate vote was not strictly along partisan lines, as six Democrats voted against it, and five Republicans voted for it.{{ref|Franzen}} Critics of the bill included the [[US Chamber of Commerce]],{{ref|Fitzpatrick2}} advocacy groups like the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],{{ref|Franzen}} cybersecurity expert Jody Westby, and [[The Heritage Foundation]], both of whom argued that although the government must act on cybersecurity, the bill was flawed in its approach and represented "too intrusive a federal role."{{ref|Rosenzweig}}

In February 2013, Obama proposed the Executive Order Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.  It represents the latest iteration of policy but is not considered to be law as it has not been addressed by Congress yet. It seeks to improve existing public-private partnerships by enhancing timeliness of information flow between DHS and critical infrastructure companies. It directs federal agencies to share cyber threat intelligence warnings to any private sector entity identified as a target. It also tasks DHS with improving the process to expedite security clearance processes for applicable public and private sector entities to enable the federal government to share this information at the appropriate sensitive and classified levels.  It directs the development of a framework to reduce cyber risks, incorporating current industry best practices and voluntary standards. Lastly, it tasks the federal agencies involved with incorporating privacy and civil liberties protections in line with Fair Information Practice Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity|title=Executive Order – Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity|work=whitehouse.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Obama announced a new cybersecurity legislative proposal. The proposal was made in an effort to prepare the US from the expanding number of cyber crimes. In the proposal, Obama outlined three main efforts to work towards a more secure cyberspace for the US. The first main effort emphasized the importance of enabling cybersecurity information sharing. By enabling that, the proposal encouraged information sharing between the government and the private sector. That would allow the government to know what main cyber threats private firms are facing and would then allow the government to provide liability protection to those firms that shared their information. Furthermore, that would give the government a better idea of what the US needs to be protected against. Another main effort that was emphasized in this proposal was to modernize the law enforcement authorities to make them more equipped to properly deal with cyber crimes by giving them the tools they need in order to do so. It would also update classifications of cyber crimes and consequences. One way this would be done would be by making it a crime for overseas selling of financial information. Another goal of the effort is to place cyber crimes prosecutable. The last major effort of the legislative proposal was to require businesses to report data breaching to consumers if their personal information had been sacrificed. By requiring companies to do so, consumers are aware of when they are in danger of identity theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/13/securing-cyberspace-president-obama-announces-new-cybersecurity-legislat|title=SECURING CYBERSPACE – President Obama Announces New Cybersecurity Legislative Proposal and Other Cybersecurity Efforts|date=2015-01-13|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Obama developed a Cybersecurity National Security Action Plan (CNAP). The plan was made to create long-term actions and strategies in an effort to protect the US against cyber threats. The focus of the plan was to inform the public about the growing threat of cyber crimes, improve cybersecurity protections, protects personal information of Americans, and to inform Americans on how to control digital security. One of the highlights of this plan include creating a "Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity." The goal of this is to create a Commission that consists of a diverse group of thinkers with perspectives that can contribute to make recommendations on how to create a stronger cybersecurity for the public and private sector. The second highlight of the plan is to change Government IT. The new Government IT will make it so that a more secure IT can be put in place. The third highlight of the plan is to give Americans knowledge on how they can secure their online accounts and avoid theft of their personal information through multi-factor authentication. The fourth highlight of the plan is to invest 35% more money that was invested in 2016 into cybersecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-national-action-plan|title=FACT SHEET: Cybersecurity National Action Plan|date=2016-02-09|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other government efforts===
In addition to regulation, the federal government has tried to improve cybersecurity by allocating more resources to research and collaborating with the private sector to write standards. In 2003, the President's [[National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace]] made the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) responsible for security recommendations and researching national solutions. The plan calls for cooperative efforts between government and industry "to create an emergency response system to cyber-attacks and to reduce the nation's vulnerability to such threats
"{{ref|lemos}} In 2004, the US Congress allocated $4.7 billion toward cybersecurity and achieving many of the goals stated in the President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.{{ref|heiman}} Some industry security experts state that the President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is a good first step but is insufficient.{{ref|lemos}} Bruce Schneier stated, "The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace hasn't secured anything yet." {{ref|kirby}} However, the President's National Strategy clearly states that the purpose is to provide a framework for the owners of computer systems to improve their security rather than the government taking over and solving the problem.{{ref|whitehouse}} However, companies that participate in the collaborative efforts outlined in the strategy are not required to adopt the discovered security solutions.

In the United States, the [[US Congress]] is trying to make information more transparent after the Cyber Security Act of 2012, which would have created voluntary standards for protecting vital infrastructure, failed to pass through the Senate.&lt;ref name="FT Cyber"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5adfe5cc-c938-11e2-9d2a-00144feab7de.html#axzz2W2Vy3xSG|title=Secrecy hampers battle for web|last=FT Special Report|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, the [[White House]] issued an executive order, titled "Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity," which allows the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] to share information about threats with more companies and individuals.&lt;ref name="FT Cyber" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Order – Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity|work=The White House|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, the House of Representatives passed the [[Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act]] (CISPA), which calls for protecting against lawsuits aimed at companies that disclose breach information.&lt;ref name="FT Cyber" /&gt; The [[Obama administration]] said that it might veto the bill.&lt;ref name="FT Cyber" /&gt;

==India==
In the light of the hacking of the website of the [[Indian Space Agency]]'s commercial arm in 2015, Antrix Corporation and government's Digital India programme, a cyberlaw expert and advocate at the [[Supreme Court of India]], Pavan Duggal, stated that "a dedicated cyber security legislation as a key requirement for India. It is not sufficient to merely put cyber security as a part of the IT Act. We have to see cyber security not only from the sectoral perspective, but also from the national perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computer.financialexpress.com/magazine/dedicated-legislation-for-cyber-security-is-needed-pavan-duggal/13378/|title=Dedicated legislation for Cyber Security is needed: Pavan Duggal – Express Computer|date=31 August 2015|work=Express Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
Cybersecurity standards have been of great prominence in today's technology driven businesses. To maximize their profits, corporations leverage technology by running most of their operations by the internet. Since there are a large number of risks that entail internetwork operations, such operations must be protected by comprehensive and extensive regulations. Existing cybersecurity regulations all cover different aspects of business operations and often vary by region or country in which a business operates. Because of the differences in a country's society, infrastructure, and values, one overarching cyber security standard is not optimal for decreasing risks. While US standards provide a basis for operations, the [[European Union]] has created a more tailored regulation for businesses operating specifically within the EU. Also, in light of [[Brexit]], it is important to consider how the UK has chosen to adhere to such security regulations.

Three major regulations within the EU include the ENISA, the NIS Directive and the EU GDPR.

===ENISA===
The [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] (ENISA) is a governing agency that was originally set up by the Regulation (EC) No 460/2004&amp;nbsp;of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 for the Purpose of Raising Network and Information Security (NIS) for all internetwork operations in the EU. ENISA currently runs under Regulation (EU) No 526/2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&amp;qid=1397226946093&amp;from=EN|title=L_2013165EN.01004101.xml|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has replaced the original regulation in 2013. ENISA works actively with all member states of the EU to provide a range of services. The focus of their operations are on three factors:
* Recommendations to member states on the course of action for security breaches
* Policy making and implementation support for all members states of the EU
* Direct support with ENISA taking a hands-on approach to working with operational teams in the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa|title=About ENISA — ENISA|website=www.enisa.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ENISA is made up of a management board that relies on the support of the executive director and the Permanent Stakeholders Group. Most operations, however, are run by the heads of various departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization|title=Structure and Organisation — ENISA|website=www.enisa.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ENISA has released various publications that cover all major issues on cybersecurity. ENISA's past and current initiatives include the EU Cloud Strategy, Open Standards in Information Communications Technology, a Cyber Security Strategy of the EU and a Cyber Security Coordination Group. ENISA also works in collaboration with existing international standard organizations like the [[ISO]] and the [[ITU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purser|first=Steve|year=2014|title=Standards for Cyber Security|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/articles/standards-for-cyber-security|journal=IOS Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIS Directive===
On July 6, 2016, the European Parliament set into policy the '''Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems''' (the '''NIS Directive'''). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC|title= Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union|website=EUR Lex|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive went into effect in August 2016, and all member states of the European Union were given 21 months to incorporate the directive's regulations into their own national laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive|title=The Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive)|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the NIS Directive is to create an overall higher level of cybersecurity in the EU. The directive significantly affects digital service providers (DSPs) and operators of essential services (OESs). Operators of essential services include any organizations whose operations would be greatly affected in the case of a security breach if they engage in critical societal or economic activities. Both DSPs and OES are now held accountable for reporting major security incidents to Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/07/the_network_and_information_security_directive_who_is_in_and_who_is_out/|title=The Network and Information Security Directive – who is in and who is out?|last=09:36|first=7 Jan 2016 at|last2=tweet_btn()|first2=OUT-LAW COM|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While DSPs are not held to as stringent regulations as operators of essential services, DSPs that are not set up in the EU but still operate in the EU still face regulations. Even if DSPs and OES outsource the maintenance of their information systems to third parties, the NIS Directive still holds them accountable for any security incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2016/07/nis-directive-published-eu-member-states-have-just-under-two-years-to-implement/|title=NIS Directive Published: EU Member States Have Just Under Two Years to Implement – Data Protection Report|date=2016-07-21|work=Data Protection Report|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The member states of the EU are required to create a NIS directive strategy, which includes the CSIRTs, in addition to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Such resources are given the responsibility of handling cybersecurity breaches in a way that minimizes impact. In addition, all member states of the EU are encouraged to share cyber security information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/risk/articles/agreement-new-eu-network-information-security-directive.html|title=Agreement reached on EU Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive {{!}} Deloitte Luxembourg {{!}} Technology {{!}} Insight|website=Deloitte Luxembourg|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security requirements include technical measures that manage the risks of cybersecurity breaches in a preventative manner. Both DSP and OES must provide information that allows for an in depth assessment of their information systems and security policies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2017/january/network-and-information-security-directive-will-be-implemented-in-the-uk-despite-brexit-vote-government-confirms/|title=Network and Information Security Directive will be implemented in the UK despite Brexit vote, government confirms|website=www.out-law.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; All significant incidents must be notified to the CSIRTs. Significant cybersecurity incidents are determined by the number of users affected by the security breach as well as the longevity of the incident and the geographical reach of the incident.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===EU GDPR===
{{main|General Data Protection Regulation}}
The EU [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR) was set into place on 14 April 2016, but the current date of enforcement is set to be on 25 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eugdpr.org|title=Home Page of EU GDPR|website=EU GDPR Portal|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDPR aims to bring a single standard for data protection among all member states in the EU. Changes include the redefining of geographical borders. It applies to entities that operate in the EU or deal with the data of any resident of the EU. Regardless of where the data is processed, if an EU citizen's data is being processed, the entity is now subject to the GDPR.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eugdpr.org/key-changes.html|title=Key Changes with the General Data Protection Regulation|website=EU GDPR Portal|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fines are also much more stringent under the GDPR and can total €20 million euros or 4% of an entity's annual turnover, whichever is higher.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, like in previous regulations, all data breaches that effect the rights and freedoms of individuals residing in the EU must be disclosed within 72 hours.

The overarching board, the EU Data Protection Board, EDP, is in charge of all oversight set by the GDPR.

Consent plays a major role in the GDPR. Companies that hold data in regards to EU citizens must now also offer to them the right to back out of sharing data just as easily as when they consented to sharing data.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/|title=Overview of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|date=2017-03-03|website=ico.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, citizens can also restrict processing of the data stored on them and can choose to allow companies to store their data but not process it, which creates a clear differentiation. Unlike previous regulations, the GDPR also restricts the transfer of a citizen's data outside of the EU or to a third party without a citizen's prior consent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The proposed [[ePrivacy Regulation (European Union)|ePrivacy Regulation]] is also planned to be applicable from 25 May 2018.

==Reactions==
While experts agree that cybersecurity improvements are necessary, there is disagreement about whether the solution is more government regulation or more private-sector innovation.

===Support===
Many government officials and cybersecurity experts believe that the private sector has failed to solve the cybersecurity problem and that regulation is needed. [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] states that "industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If industry does not respond [to the threat], you have to follow through."{{ref|free2innovate}} He believes that software companies must be forced to produce more secure programs.{{ref|pbs}} [[Bruce Schneier]] also supports regulation that encourages software companies to write more secure code through economic incentives.{{ref|free2innovate}}  US Representative [[Rick Boucher]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D–]][[Virginia|VA]]) proposes improving cybersecurity by making software companies liable for security flaws in their code.{{ref|menn}} In addition, to improving software security, Clarke believes that certain industries, such as utilities and ISPs, require regulation.{{ref|free2innovate}}

===Opposition===
On the other hand, many private-sector executives and lobbyists believe that more regulation will restrict their ability to improve cybersecurity. Harris Miller, a [[lobbyist]] and president of the [[Information Technology Association of America]], believes that regulation inhibits innovation.{{ref|free2innovate}} Rick White, former corporate attorney and president and [[CEO]] of the lobby group TechNet, also opposes more regulation. He states that "the private-sector must continue to be able to innovate and adapt in response to new attack methods in cyber space, and toward that end, we commend President Bush and the Congress for exercising regulatory restraint."{{ref|free2innovate}}

Another reason many private-sector executives oppose regulation is that it is costly and involves government oversight in private enterprise. Firms are just as concerned about regulation reducing profits as they are about regulation limiting their flexibility to solve the cybersecurity problem efficiently.

'''Daniel Garrison Brinton''' (May 13, 1837{{snd}}July 31, 1899) was an American [[archaeologist]] and [[ethnologist]].

==Biography==
Brinton was born in [[Thornbury Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania]]. After graduating from [[Yale University]] in 1858, Brinton studied at [[Jefferson Medical College]] for two years and spent the next year travelling in Europe. He continued his studies at [[Paris]] and [[Heidelberg]]. From 1862 to 1865, during the [[American Civil War]], he was a surgeon in the Union army, acting during 1864-1865 as surgeon-in-charge of the U.S. Army general hospital at [[Quincy, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Brinton, Daniel Garrison |volume=4|page=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brinton was [[Hyperthermia|sun-stroked]] at [[Missionary Ridge]] ([[Third Battle of Chattanooga]]) and was never again able to travel in very hot weathers. This handicap affected his career as an ethnologist.

After the war, Brinton practiced medicine in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]] for several years; was the editor of a weekly periodical, the Medical and Surgical Reporter, in [[Philadelphia]] from 1874 to 1887; became professor of ethnology and archaeology in the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]] in Philadelphia in 1884; and was professor of American [[linguistics]] and archaeology in the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1886 until his death.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He was a member of numerous learned societies in the United States and in Europe and was president at different times of the [[Numismatic]] and [[Antiquarian]] Society of Philadelphia, of the [[American Folklore Society]], the [[American Philosophical Society]], and of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

At his presidential address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in August 1895, Brinton advocated theories of [[scientific racism]] that were pervasive at that time. As [[Charles A. Lofgren]] notes in his book, ''The [[Plessy v. Ferguson|Plessy Case]],'' although Brinton "accepted the 'psychical unity' throughout the human species," he claimed "all races were 'not equally endowed,' which disqualified [some of] them from the atmosphere of modern enlightenment."   He asserted some have "...an inborn tendency, constitutionally recreant to the codes of civilization, and therefore technically criminal."  Further, he said the characteristics of "races, nations, tribes...supply the only sure foundations for legislation, not ''a priori'' notions of the rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fuXX4wQXYlsC&amp;dq=The+Plessy+Case:+A+Legal-historical+Interpretation&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=KiuZR_tX3L&amp;sig=1uhOSr9XFR50WbEgXnz73rheEm0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result    Charles A. Lofgren, "The Plessey Case: A Legal-Historical Interpretation,'' Oxford University Press (1988), pp. 104-5.]  {{ISBN|0-19-505684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brinton was an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] during his last several years of life. In April 1896, he addressed the Ethical Fellowship of Philadelphia with a lecture on "What the Anarchists Want," to a friendly audience. In October 1897, Brinton had dinner with [[Peter Kropotkin]] after the famous anarchist's only speaking engagement at Philadelphia. Kropotkin had refused invitations from all of the city's elites.&lt;ref&gt;''The Conservator,'' October 26th, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letters, Brinton to Horace Traubel, April 26 &amp; 27, 1896. Special Collections Dept., Temple University&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of his memorial meeting on October 6, 1900, the keynote speaker Albert H. Smyth stated: "In Europe and America, he sought the society of anarchists and mingled sometimes with the malcontents of the world that he might appreciate their grievances, and weigh their propositions for reform and change." &lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' January 16, 1900, keynote address by Albert H. Smyth.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

An '''earasaid''',&lt;ref name=Dwelly&gt;"[http://www.cairnwater.co.uk/gaelicdictionary/index.aspx?txtSearch=earasaid Earasaid]" at ''[[Dwelly's Gaelic Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or '''arasaid'''&lt;ref name=Dwelly/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The traditional Gaelic spelling is ''earasaid'' or ''earrasaid'', though in modern English usage the variation ''arasaid'' and the misspelling ''arisaid'' are both very common.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[draped garment]] worn in Scotland as part of traditional female [[highland dress]]. It may be a [[belted plaid]] (literally, a belted blanket), or an unbelted wrap. Traditionally, earasaids might be plain, striped &lt;ref name=lachdan&gt;"The arisaid was usually of lachdan, or of a saffron hue, but it was also striped, with various colours according to taste." ''The Clans of the Scottish Highlands'', James Logan, 1845, quoted by the [http://www.tartansauthority.com/highland-dress/ancient/highland-dress-for-women/ Scottish Tartan Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; or tartan;&lt;ref name=mull&gt;“The usual habit of both sexes is the pladd;  the women’s much finer, the colours more lively, and the square much larger than the men’s, and put me in the mind of the ancient Picts.  This serves them for a veil and covers both head and body.” William Sachceverell, of the [[Isle of Mull]], in 1688; quoted in [http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan/the-growth-of-tartan/tartan-timeline A chronological list of tartan-related source texts]&lt;/ref&gt; it might be brightly coloured&lt;ref name=mull/&gt; or made of ''lachdan'' (dun or undyed) wool.&lt;ref name=lachdan/&gt; Some colours were more expensive than others.&lt;ref name=musings&gt;http://www.scottishtartans.co.uk/Musings_on_the_arisaid_and_other_female_dress.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Modern highland dress makes earasaids from the same [[Tartan#Clan tartans|heraldic tartan]] cloth used for [[kilt]]s.

==Overview==
In cut, it is a rectangle, longer than the wearer is tall, and wider than the wearer's waist circumference. The bottom edge is ankle length and the top edge, when not being used as a hood, may hang cape-like behind. The width may be pleated until it will wrap around the waist, and the pleats held under a belt. In this case, the cloth below the belt hangs like a skirt; the cloth above the belt may be pinned or pulled over the head. The plaid may also be worn unbelted; and it seems it was also later worn at waist-width (see images below).

Near the end of the seventeenth century, [[Martin Martin]] gave a description of traditional women's clothing in the [[Hebrides|Western Islands]], including the ''earasaid'' and its [[brooch]]es and [[buckle]]s.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ancient dress wore by the women, and which is yet wore by some of the vulgar, called ''arisad'', is a white [[Full plaid|plaid]], having a few small stripes of black, blue and red; it reached from the neck to the heels, and was tied before on the breast with a buckle of silver or brass, according to the quality of the person. I have seen some of the former of an hundred [[Merk (coin)|mark]]s value; it was broad as any ordinary pewter plate, the whole curiously [[Animal style|engraven with various animals]] etc. There was a lesser buckle which was wore in the middle of the larger, and above two [[ounce]]s weight; it had in the centre a [[Smoky quartz|large piece of crystal]], or some finer stone, and this was set all around with several finer stones of a lesser size. The plaid being [[pleat]]ed all round, was tied with a [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] below the breast; the belt was of leather, and several pieces of silver intermixed with the leather like a [[chain]]. The lower end of the belt has a piece of plate about eight [[inch]]es long, and three in breadth, curiously engraven; the end of which was adorned with fine stones, or pieces of [[red coral]]. They wore [[sleeve]]s of scarlet cloth, closed at the end as men's [[Waistcoat|vest]]s, with gold [[lace]] round them, having plate [[Button (clothing)|button]]s with fine stones. The head dress was a fine [[kerchief]] of [[linen]] strait (tight) about the head, hanging down the back taper-wise; a large lock of hair hangs down their cheeks above their breast, the lower end tied with a knot of [[ribband]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'', (1703), pp.208-209: quoted in Robertson, ed., ''Inventaires de la Royne Desscosse'', Bannatyne Club, (1863) p.lxviii footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1845 illustration is a reconstruction based on this description, then a century and a half old. Somewhat older drawings from life do not show details of the garment:&lt;ref name=musings/&gt;

[[File:Basire1745.jpg|thumb|Town lady in a waist-width plaid with a chequered midsection and striped ends. Engraving by [[James Basire]], 1745]]
One early (early 19th century) dictionary definition of "earasaid" describes it, in the past tense, as full-length and worn without underclothing.&lt;ref name=musings/&gt; Martin Martin describes it a full-length and worn over a sleeved top. Later descriptions (notably Burt) use the word "plaid" to describe, at first, wraps that cover the whole body, and then garments that cover only from head to waist. Poorer people are described as wearing full-length blankets.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Ladies drefs as in ''England'', with this Difference, that when they go abroad, from the higheft to the loweft, they wear a Plaid, which cover Half of the Face, and all their Body. In ''Spain'', ''Flanders'', and ''Holland'', you know the Women go all to Church and Market, with a black Mantle over their Heads and Body: But thefe in ''Scotland'' are all ftrip'd with Green, Scarlet, and other Colours, and moft of them lin'd with Silk ; which in the Middle of a Church, on a ''Sunday'', looks like a ''Parterre de Fleurs''.

  — John Macky, ''A Journey through Scotland'', written 1722, published 1729&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Macky,+John,+-1726|title=John Macky (Macky, John, -1726) - The Online Books Page|website=onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Burt earasaid.png|thumb|Detail of an illustration from Burt's ''Letters'', 1754]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Minister here in Scotland would have the Ladies come to Kirk in their Plaids, which hide any loose Dress, and their Faces, too, if they would be persuaded, in order to prevent the wandering Thoughts of young Fellows, and perhaps some young old ones too; for the Minister looks upon a well-dressed Woman to  be an Object unfit to be seen in the Time of Divine Service, especially if she be handsome.

The before-mentioned Writer of a "Journey through Scotland, " has borrowed a Thought from the Tatler or Spectator, I do not remember which of them.

Speaking of the Ladies' Plaids, he says — "They are striped with Green, Scarlet, and other Colours, which, in the Middle of a  Church on a Sunday, look like a Parterre de Fleurs.'" Instead of striped he should have said chequered, but that would not so well agree with his Flowers ; and I must ask Leave to differ from him in the Simile, for at first I thought it a very odd sight ; and as to outward Appearance, more fit to be compared with an Assembly of Harlequins than a Bed of Tulips. 

The Plaid is the Undress of the Ladies; and to a genteel Woman, who adjusts it with a good Air, it is a becoming Veil. But as I am pretty sure you never saw one of them in England, I shall employ a few Words to describe it to you. It is made of Silk or fine Worsted, chequered with various lively colours, two Breadths wide, and three Yards in Length; it is brought over the Head, and may hide or discover the Face according to the Wearer's Fancy or Occasion; it reaches to the Waist behind; one corner falls as low as the Ankle on one side; and the other Part, in Folds, hangs down from the opposite arm.

— Burt's ''Letters from the North of Scotland'', 1754&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/burtslettersfrom01burt|title=Burt's letters from the north of Scotland; with facsimiles of the original engravings|first=Edward|last=Burt|date=29 June 1876|publisher=Edinburgh : W. Paterson|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Peat cart Burts Letters.png|thumb|Woman leading a peat [[travois|"cart"]]. She wears a blanket and a kerch. Detail of an illustration from Burt's ''Letters'', 1754]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some of these [peat] Carts are led by Women, who are generally bare-foot, with a Blanket for the covering of their Bodies, and in cold or wet Weather they bring it quite over them. At other times they wear a Piece of Linen upon their Heads, made up like a Napkin-Cap in an inn, only not tied at top, but hanging down behind....

When they [female servants] go Abroad, they wear a Blanket over their Heads, as the poor Women do, something like the Pictures you may have seen of some bare-footed Order among the Romish Priests.
	And the same Blanket that serves them for a Mantle by day, is made a Part of their bedding at Night, which is generally generally spread upon the floor; this, I think, they call a ''Shakedown''.

— Burt's ''Letters from the North of Scotland'', 1754&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The women's drefs is the kirch, or a white piece of linnen, pinned over the foreheads of thofe that are married, and round the hind part of the head, falling behind over their necks. The fingle women wear only a ribband round their head, which they call a fnood. The ''tanac'' or plaid, hangs over their fhoulders, and is faftened before with a brotche; but in bad weather is drawn over their heads: I have alfo obferved during divine fervice, that they keep drawing it forward in proportion as their attention increafes; infomuch as to conceal at laft: their whole face, as if it was to exclude every external object that might interrupt their devotion.

'''George Rudé''' (8 February 1910 – 8 January 1993) was a  British [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[historian]], specializing in the [[French Revolution]] and "[[history from below]]", especially the importance of [[The Crowd in History|crowds in history]].&lt;ref name=crowd&gt;George Rudé (1964). ''The Crowd in History. A Study of Popular Disturbances in France and England, 1730–1848''. New York: Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Oslo]], Norway, the son of Jens Essendrop Rude, a Norwegian engineer, and Amy Geraldine Elliot, an English woman educated in Germany, Rudé spent his early years in Norway.  After World War I, his family moved to England, where he was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. A specialist in modern languages, he taught at [[Stowe School|Stowe]] and [[St Paul's School (London)|St. Paul's]] schools. After completing university, Rudé took a trip to the Soviet Union with friends. When he returned he was a "committed Communist and anti-Fascist", despite his family’s fairly conservative political views.
&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite news

  | first = Harvey J
  | title = Obituary: George Rudé
  | work = The Independent   | pages = 12
  | date = 16 January 1993
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Rudé joined the [[British Communist Party]]. Communism awoke in Rudé an interest in history in which he pursued during the 1930s and 1940s attending London University part-time. During this time he taught at the preparatory schools of Stowe and St Paul’s. When the war broke out he joined the London Fire Service where he extinguished fires caused by German bombs.

He received his doctorate at the [[University of London]] in 1950 for a thesis on crowd action during the French Revolution. He taught modern languages in English secondary schools while publishing. His first book, ''The Crowd in the French Revolution'', soon became a classic.

Rudé was actively involved with the Communist party, an affiliation which caused him many hardships during his life. In 1949, he was relieved of his duties at St Paul’s for the activities of the political party which he was affiliated with. He accepted teaching positions at [[Sir Walter St John's Grammar School for Boys]] and later at [[Holloway Comprehensive School]]. Rudé, making his new academic focus history, and with very little to back his research in Paris of revolutionary France, became a leading British historian of the French Revolution. Rudé contributed to the "history from below" view of history, which is history from the view of the oppressed. He focused especially on those who participated in the riots and rebellions. He is credited by [[Eric Hobsbawm]] as having been the only member of the Historians' Group of the English Communist Party to write 18th-century history, exploring the chronological "no-man's land between the Group's two most flourishing sections".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hobsbawm]], 'The Historian's Group of the Communist Party' in ''Rebels and their Causes'' (Southampton: Humanities Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; After writing an article about rioters during the French Revolution, he was awarded the esteemed Alexander Prize by the [[Royal Historical Society]] in 1956. Rudé wrote and was featured in a number of journals and created a scholarly name for himself under the wing of his mentor, [[Georges Lefebvre]].

Hobsbawm alleged that Rudé's thesis advisor, ([[Alfred Cobban]], a political conservative), blocked any chances Rudé may have had at getting an appointment at a University, but Friguglietti says there is no evidence of that.&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite news

In 1959, he was appointed senior lecturer at the [[University of Adelaide]] in Australia, in his wife Doreen's home town. He took the opportunity of his time in Australia, to research 19th-century British and Irish political prisoners [[Convicts in Australia|transported to Australia]] as convicts. This later resulted in a major work, ''Protest and Punishment: The Story of Social and Political Protesters Transported to Australia, 1788–1868''.

Rudé, like most prominent communists in Australia, was put under surveillance by the government's domestic security agency, [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]].&lt;ref name=B/&gt; However, they found little of interest to record. One agent noted: "history books of which he is the author and reports of his class work at schools in England all show that he is objective in his approach to his teaching subject and has not let his own personal politics intrude in any way".

Rudé accepted an offer of a foundation chair of history, at the new [[University of Stirling]], in Scotland, during 1967. However, he fell out with the university administration and returned to Adelaide in 1969, as professor of history at [[Flinders University]]. In 1970, Rudé moved to [[Montreal]], Canada, where he taught at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|George Williams University]] (later Concordia University) until he retired in 1987. He founded the Inter-University Center for European Studies.  Rudé was also a visiting professor at the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]] and the [[college of William and Mary]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite news

  | date = 12 January 1993
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While he was at Concordia, he also taught in the Graduate Programme of Social and Political Thought at York University, Toronto.

Rudé suffered deteriorating health after the early 1970s and had a brain tumour removed in 1983. After retiring, he returned to England, eventually dying in hospital at [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] on 8 January 1993. His widow Doreen placed his ashes in the garden behind their home in [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]]. A tall, handsome and athletic man, he always retained the manners of an English gentleman as well as his [[left-wing]] sympathies.

==Works==
George Rudé’s historical work focused primarily on the [[French Revolution]] and crowd behaviour in France and Great Britain, during the 18th and 19th centuries. Rudé utilizes the method of reporting and analyzing history from the "bottom up," focusing on the people, not the leaders and elites. Rudé’s most notable works include ''The Crowd in the French Revolution'', ''[[The Crowd in History]]'', ''Revolutionary Europe: 1783–1815'', ''Ideology and Popular Protest'', ''Paris and London in the Eighteenth Century'', ''Debate on Europe: 1815–1850'' and ''[[Captain Swing]]: A Social History of the great English Agricultural Uprising of 1830'' (co-authored with [[Eric Hobsbawm]]).

One of Rudé’s most influential works is ''[[The Crowd in History]]'', focusing on 18th- and 19th-century dissidents and revolutionaries in France and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;George Rudé, ''The Crowd in History, A study of Popular Disturbances in France and England, 1730 – 1848'' (Serif, London, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Rudé analyzes the impact and importance of various uprisings between 1730 and 1848. He identifies grain shortages in France and industrialisation in Britain as the two recurring catalysts for disturbance. In this work Rudé employs a clear and precise prose style, beginning with specific examples of disturbances in Part 1, and moving on in Part 2 to "a critical analysis of the crowd in its various manifestations".&lt;ref&gt;''The Crowd in History,'' p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his introduction Rudé expresses a hope that other historians will be inspired by his new bottom-up approach to write crowd-centric histories of other eras. He made no secret of his sympathy for the underdog, and this history offers a robust defence of popular uprisings in this period.

In ''The Crowd in the French Revolution'', Rudé examines the historically neglected crowd of the French Revolution. He explains that the Revolution was not only political but more importantly a social upheaval in which the common Frenchmen played a tremendous role in the course and outcome of the Revolution. Most significantly, Rudé analyzes the French crowds in great depth to understand their composition and force on history.

Rudé wrote a broad survey ''Revolutionary Europe: 1783-1815'' in traditional fashion. In is he portrays France and Europe before, during and after the French Revolution. He examines the significance of the Revolution in context to the rest of the European world. The broader focus of this work was a shift from his crowd studies, which would resume in his later works.

Rudé’s ''Paris and London in the 18th Century'' explains the popular protests and revolts of Paris and London during the 18th century. Rudé compares and contrasts the time, place, social, political and economic factors of Paris and London. He examines the pre-industrial stages and the turbulent events that occurred in both European capitals. While this work is not predominately a history from the "bottom up," Rudé does incorporate the impact of each class in Paris and London during the 18th-century events.

In ''Ideology and Popular Protest'', Rudé defines the theory behind the ideology of protest beginning with its origins in [[Marx]] and [[Engels]]. He explains his theory of ideology through various situations in pre-industrial Europe. Rudé also utilizes his explained ideology in the event of the English protests of the 18th and early 19th century and the development of the English industrial society, and closing with the possibly implications of industry on society.

Rudé, in ''Debate on Europe: 1815-1850'', attempts to utilize the views and interpretations of other historians to argue the significant period of the first half of the 19th century. He examines the rise of national powers, the impacts of the Industrial Revolution, differences of political opinions and the various revolutions throughout Europe during this period. In addition, Rudé inserts his own argument based on the impressive and extraordinary change in Europe during this era as well as inferring at what point this change began.

''Captain Swing: A Social History of the great English Agricultural Uprising of 1830'' is a prime example of George Rudé’s focus on history "from below" and the examination of common people. In ''Captain Swing'', Rudé examines the people of the 1830 agricultural uprising and the impacts of these events. The entire focus of this work is on the crowd and their history, revealing a historical interpretation of history from the "bottom up."

==Influence==
George Rudé’s influence was his emphasis and development of "history from below". Following the new [[Annales School]] of thought, Rudé strove to cast off the idea that history was only about nation-states and the men who ruled them. Accompanying Rudé in this shift was the ‘new left’, which according to Mark Gilderhus these liberal historians, "showed the feasibility of doing history while incorporating attitudes and viewpoints other than those associated with white male elites".&lt;ref name =D&gt;{{cite book

  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Rudé was not part of this movement directly, he was firmly inside their ideas and helped to promote them. He believed, along with the ‘new left’ that it was the neglected people who could be used to reshape the face of history. The historian James Friguglietti comments that Rudé’s work, "displayed sympathy for the lower classes, whether laborers or convicted criminals".&lt;ref name =E&gt;{{cite journal

  | id = 
  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on lower classes Rudé hoped to create a new understanding of histories major events.

Rudé’s communist ties shaped his way of perceiving history and opened him up to the idea of looking at the history of protesters.  Revolutions were transforming events, and Rudé sought to bring light to why someone would join in such an endeavor. Marxist theory believes that everyone’s primary motives for acting are always linked with their material need.&lt;ref name =F&gt;{{cite journal

  | publisher =

  | url = 
  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this frame of reference Rudé places it on the people of the French Revolution and created specific faces in the crowds. He sought to dismantle the myth that the crowd in the revolution is seen as a great evil mass of people bent on destruction of order. As Rudé paints it, "those who took to the streets were ordinary, sober citizens, not half-crazed animals, not criminals".&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; By taking such a view the history of the French revolution was transformed. Common people were suddenly being taken as important historical actors in their own context.

In the decades that Rudé was writing, his new way of looking at history fit well into the social scene. It was the age of liberation, as the oppressive systems that segregated classes, genders, and races were being torn down. People were in need of a new history that included all aspects of society. Writing "history from below", brought in those forgotten yet not unimportant members of history into the narrative. Rudé did this by showing the common people in the revolutions and protests as key players who actively sought to change history. By focusing on such groups, historians have, "inspired new debates over the roles of class, gender, and race in accounting for human divisions and inequalities."&lt;ref name =G&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Gilderhus

  | title = History and Historians: A Historiographical Introduction

  | year = 2007
  | location = New Jersey
  | id =
  | page = 108  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In helping bring a voice to prisoners and protesters, George Rudé contributed significantly to the study of history.

Rudé is not without his detractors. From the start, his Marxist view of history made teaching in Great Britain very difficult at the height of [[Cold War]] fervour and brought him severe criticism. The main criticism that continues on after his death was that after developing his initial thesis of the crowd in history, he continued using that model in every case to prove his point.&lt;ref name =H&gt;{{cite journal

  | publisher = 
  | date =

  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Rudé’s work became less highly regarded after the collapse of the USSR, but, overall, his contributions to social history and the understanding of protests greatly enhanced how historians look at the past and its actors.

The '''''History Workshop Journal''''' was launched in 1976 by [[Raphael Samuel]] and others involved in the History Workshop movement. It is a [[scholarly journal]] published by [[Oxford University Press]]. Originally sub-titled "A Journal of Socialist Historians", it later changed the sub-title to "A Journal of Socialist and Feminist Historians" before dropping the sub-title in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=B.|title=History on the Move: Reflections on History Workshop|journal=[[Radical History Review]]|date=1 October 1993|volume=1993|issue=57|page=207|doi=10.1215/01636545-1993-57-203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal "publishes a wide variety of essays, reports and reviews, ranging from literary to economic subjects, local history to geopolitical analyses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hwj.oxfordjournals.org/?code=hiwork&amp;.cgifields=code Oxford Journals.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' website, ''History Workshop Journal'' is ranked number 9 in the top 20 [[history journals]] worldwide, ranked by their five-year [[impact factor]]s, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}. This information was presented in [[Thomson Reuters]]’ ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'' for the social sciences for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=414798 ''Times Higher Education''], 13 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The History Workshop movement ==
The main aim of the History Workshop movement was to promote the [[historiography|historiographical]] tradition known variously as [[people's history|history from below]], [[social history]], the history of everyday life, or simply people's history. [[Bill Schwarz]] wrote that the "History Workshop functioned in Britain as an effective alternative historical apparatus. It countered the intellectual and political conservatism of the dominant historical profession, setting up an alternative means for producing historical knowledge which had roots deep in the subordinate groups of British society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=|title=History on the Move |journal=Radical History Review|date= 1993|volume=1993|issue=57|pages=203–220|doi=10.1215/01636545-1993-57-203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel defined the movement as being "the belief that history is or ought to be a collaborative enterprise, one in which the researcher, the archivist, the curator and the teacher, the 'do-it-yourself' enthusiast and the local historian, the family history societies and the individual archaeologist, should all be regarded as equally engaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Samuel |editor-first=Raphael|title=History Workshop: A Collecteana, 1967–1991, Documents, Memoirs, Critique and cumulative index to History Workshop Journal|year=1991|publisher=Ruskin College|page=1V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the History Workshop movement grew in popularity, which saw the foundation of a number of local History Workshops and a series of pamphlets, books and journals, including the ''History Workshop Journal''. The British movement also inspired several international History Workshops in Europe, South Africa and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Barbara|title=History of the History Workshop|url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/the-history-of-history-workshop/|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History Workshop Online ==

An associated website, the History Workshop Online, was launched by the editorial collective of the ''History Workshop Journal'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History Workshop Online: ''About''|url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/about-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This moderated website publishes shorter and more contemporary-focused articles than appear in ''History Workshop Journal'', as well as editorials, debates, news and events, and a series of articles on "Radical Objects". These "Radical Objects" are tangible objects, such as badges or pamphlets, with direct relationships to events or themes in radical history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History Workshop Online: ''Radical Objects''|url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/category/radical-objects/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, the History Workshop Online, in collaboration with the [[Bishopsgate Institute]], launched an online archive of material from the History Workshop Movement, which includes background information about each History Workshop and associated events from the 1960s to the 1990s. The material available on the History Workshop archive also includes scans of images, tickets and pamphlets and audio recordings from the History Workshops themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=: History Workshop Online: ''History of the History Workshop''|url=http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/category/history-of-the-history-workshop/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of National Remembrance''' – '''Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation''' ({{lang-pl|Instytut Pamięci Narodowej – Komisja Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu}}; '''IPN''') is a [[Polish government]]-affiliated [[research institute]] with [[lustration]] prerogatives,&lt;ref name="1998_law_updated"/&gt; as well as [[prosecution]] powers.&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt; It was created by legislation enacted by the [[Parliament of Poland]].&lt;ref name="1998_law_updated"/&gt; The Institute specialises in the legal and historical examination of the 20th century [[history of Poland]] in particular.&lt;ref name="resinst"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bazy.opi.org.pl/raporty/opisy/instyt/6000/i6575.htm |title=Nauka polska: Instytucje naukowe – identyfikator rekordu: i6575 |access-date=22 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516153339/http://bazy.opi.org.pl/raporty/opisy/instyt/6000/i6575.htm |archive-date=16 May 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; IPN investigates both [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Communist crime]]s committed in Poland between 1939 and the [[Revolutions of 1989]], documents its findings and disseminates the results of its investigations to the public.&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt;

The Institute was [[Act on the Institute of National Remembrance|established in law]] by the Polish Parliament on 18 December 1998,&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt; and incorporated the earlier 1991-passed '''Main Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation''' (which itself had replaced a 1945-passed body on Nazi crimes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOkVDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243|title=Remembrance, History, and Justice: Coming to Terms with Traumatic Pasts in Democratic Societies|last=Tismaneanu|first=Vladimir|last2=Iacob|first2=Bogdan|date=2015|publisher=Central European University Press|year=|isbn=978-9-63386-092-2|location=|pages=243|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began its activities on 1 July 2000. During the first fifteen years following its inception the IPN collected over {{convert|90|km}} of archives, released 1,794 publications, organized 453 exhibits, held 817 conferences, and launched 30 educational internet portals. In the same period, the Institute researchers held interviews with over 103,000 witnesses and interrogated 508 individuals charged with criminal offences, leading to 137 sentences by the courts of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Instytut Pamięci Narodowej |title=15 lat Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej w liczbach |work=Komunikaty |url=http://ipn.gov.pl/wydzial-prasowy/komunikaty/briefing-prezesa-ipn-dr.-lukasza-kaminskiego-w-zwiazku-z-15-leciem-dzialalnosci-instytutu-pamieci-narodowej-warszawa,-12-czerwca-2015 |date=12 June 2015 |access-date=28 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622210338/http://ipn.gov.pl/wydzial-prasowy/komunikaty/briefing-prezesa-ipn-dr.-lukasza-kaminskiego-w-zwiazku-z-15-leciem-dzialalnosci-instytutu-pamieci-narodowej-warszawa,-12-czerwca-2015 |archive-date=22 June 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a new law which went into effect on 15 March 2007, IPN was to be mandated to carry out [[Lustration#Policies and laws|lustration]] procedures prescribed by Polish law.&lt;ref name="1998_law_updated"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/305/4792/ Nowelizacja ustawy z dnia 18 grudnia 1998 r. o Instytucie Pamięci Narodowej – Komisji Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu oraz ustawy z dnia 18 października 2006 r. o ujawnianiu informacji o dokumentach organów bezpieczeństwa państwa z lat 1944–1990 oraz treści tych dokumentów.] Last accessed on 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, key articles of that law were judged unconstitutional by [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland|Poland's constitutional court]] on 11 May 2007, so the role of IPN in the lustration process is at present unclear.&lt;ref name="BBClust"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6648435.stm | title=Polish court strikes down spy law | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date= May 11, 2007 | accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPN is a founding member of the [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]] organisation.&lt;ref name="Platform"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2011/10/20/czech-prime-minister-petr-necas-the-years-of-totalitarianism-were-years-of-struggle-for-liberty/ |title=The years of totalitarianism were years of struggle for liberty |author=Czech Prime minister [[Petr Nečas]] |date=14 October 2011 |publisher=[[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]] |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
IPN's main areas of activity,&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt; in line with its original [[mission statement]],&lt;ref name="IPNabout"&gt;[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/en/1/2/ About the Institute] From IPN English website. Last accessed on 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; include researching and documenting the losses which were suffered by the Polish Nation as a result of World War II and during the post-war totalitarian period.&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt; The Institute informs about the patriotic traditions of resistance against the occupational forces,&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt; and the Polish citizens' fight for sovereignty of the nation, including their efforts in defence of freedom and human dignity in general.&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt; IPN investigates crimes committed on Polish soil against Polish citizens as well as people of other citizenships wronged in the country. War crimes which are not affected by [[statute of limitations]] according to [[Polish law]] include:&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt;
# crimes of the Soviet and Polish communist regimes committed in the country from [[Soviet invasion of Poland|17 September 1939]] until [[fall of communism]] on 31 December 1989,&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt;
# [[deportation]]s to the [[Soviet Union]] of Polish soldiers of [[Armia Krajowa]],&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt; and other [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance organizations]] as well as Polish inhabitants of the [[Eastern Borderlands|former Polish eastern territories]],
# pacifications of Polish communities between [[Vistula]] and [[Bug River|Bug]] Rivers in the years 1944 to 1947 by UB-[[NKVD]],&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt;
# crimes committed by the law enforcement agencies of the [[Polish People's Republic]], particularly [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland]] and [[Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army]],&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt;
# crimes under the category of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt;
It is the IPN's duty to prosecute crimes against peace and humanity, as much as war crimes.&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt; Its mission includes the need to compensate for damages which were suffered by the repressed and harmed people at a time when human rights were disobeyed by the state,&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt;
and educate the public about recent [[history of Poland]].&lt;ref name="resinst"/&gt; IPN collects, organises and archives all documents about the Polish communist security apparatus active from 22 July 1944 to 31 December 1989.&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt;

==Organisation==
[[Image:Wejście do Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej ul. Wołoska 7.JPG|thumb|Main entrance]]
IPN was created by special legislation on 18 December 1998.&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt; IPN is governed by the chairman. This chairman is chosen by a [[supermajority]] (60%) of the Polish Parliament ([[Sejm]]) with the approval of the [[Senate of Poland]] on a request by a Collegium of IPN. The chairman has a 5-year [[term of office]]. The first chairman of the IPN was [[Leon Kieres]], elected by the [[Sejm]] for five years on 8 June 2000 (term 30 June 2000 – 29 December 2005). The second chairman was [[Janusz Kurtyka]], elected on 9 December 2005 with a term that started 29 December 2005 until his death in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk airplane crash]] on 10 April 2010. [[Franciszek Gryciuk]] was acting chairman from 2010 to 2011, when the current chairman, [[Łukasz Kamiński]], was elected by the Sejm.

The IPN is divided into:&lt;ref name="1998_law_updated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPNabout"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPNabout_pl"&gt;{{pl icon}}[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/6/2262/ About the Institute] From IPN Polish website. Last accessed on 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
IPN is involved in dissemination of its research results in the form of publications, particularly the IPN Bulletin (Biuletyn IPN, ''Pamięć.pl'') and the ''Remembrance and Justice'' periodicals, exhibitions, seminars, panel discussions, [[film review]]s, workshops and school curricula.&lt;ref name="IPNabout_research"/&gt; Since December 2000 IPN has organized over 30 academic conferences (particularly the [[Warsaw Congress of Science]] organized every year in September); 22 exhibitions in various museums and educational competitions involving thousands of students.&lt;ref name="IPNabout_research"/&gt; "IPN Bulletin" is of an informative and [[popular science|popular-scientific]] character and contains articles pertaining to the history of Poland in the years 1939–1990 as well as describes the current IPN activities.&lt;ref name="IPNabout_research"/&gt; ''Remembrance and Justice'' appears every half a year and is a scientific historical magazine.&lt;ref name="IPNabout_research"/&gt; IPN also publishes books which are usually edited as collections of documents, reports and memories, but also scientific elaborations (78 of such publications have appeared till April 2007).&lt;ref name="IPNabout_research"/&gt;

The Public Education Office co-operates on a permanent basis with the [[Ministry of National Education and Sport (Poland)|Ministry of National Education and Sport]], having signed a Co-operation Agreement in 2001.&lt;ref name="IPNabout_research"/&gt; IPN gives opinions of [[curricula]] and [[textbooks]] on history that are used in [[education in Poland|Polish schools]] and is involved in teacher training activities.&lt;ref name="IPNabout_research"/&gt; The IPN also co-organizes [[postgraduate diploma studies]] on history at the [[Jagiellonian University]] and the [[University of Maria Curie-Skłodowska]].&lt;ref name="IPNabout_research"/&gt;

====Board games====
The Institution of National Remembrance has created several board games to help educate people about recent Polish history
* ''303'' – a game about the [[Battle of Britain]] that focuses on the [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron|Polish 303 Squadron]]
* ''[[Kolejka (game)|Kolejka]]'' – a game about being forced to queue for basic household products during the Communist era.

===Lustration===
{{details|Lustration in Poland}}

On 18 December 2006 [[Polish law]] regulating IPN was changed and came into effect on 15 March 2007. This change gave IPN new [[lustration]] powers.&lt;ref name="15March2007"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/305/4870/ Najważniejsze wiadomości – Informacje i materiały pomocnicze dla organów realizujących postanowienia ustawy lustracyjnej] IPN News. Last accessed on 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, key articles of that law were judged unconstitutional by Poland's Constitutional Court on 11 May 2007, making the role of IPN in lustration unclear and putting the whole process into question.&lt;ref name="BBClust"/&gt;

==Criticism==

===Politicization===
{{confusing section|small=no|date=March 2018}}
In 2008, [[Adam Michnik]] said that the IPN is "engaging in activities that destroy this memory. Today's memory police resort to the hateful methods of the communist secret services and direct them at a victim of this very secret service. These policemen violate the truth and fundamental ethical principles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/09/25/on-the-side-of-geremek/ On the Side of Geremek], New York Review of Books, 25 September 2008, [[Adam Michnik]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised of politicization of the IPN, starting with its legal mandate (no comparable institution in any other European country holds prosecutorial power) and continuing to its choice of staff, which at times tended towards particular political views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cultures-of-history.uni-jena.de/politics/poland/remaking-polish-national-history-reenactment-over-reflection/ |title= Remaking Polish National History: Reenactment over Reflection |last=Peters |first=Florian |work=Cultures of History Forum |publisher=[[Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena]]|language=en |access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mink |first=Georges |title=Is there a new institutional response to the crimes of Communism?

===Role in lustration and Wildstein list===
One of the most controversial aspects of IPN is a by-product of its role in collecting and publishing previously secret archives from the Polish communist security apparatus, the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]]: revealing secret agents and collaborators (a process called ''[[lustration]]'').&lt;ref name="ChicTrib"&gt;Tom Hundley, [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/news/article/8307/poland-looks-back-in-anger/ Poland looks back in anger], 1 December 2006, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt; One incident which drew criticism involved the so-called [[Wildstein list]]; a partial list of names of people who allegedly worked for the communist era Polish intelligence service, which was copied from IPN archives (without IPN permission) in 2004 by journalist [[Bronisław Wildstein]] and published in the Internet in 2005. The list gained much attention in Polish media and politics, and during that time IPN security procedures and handling of the matter came under criticism.&lt;ref name="Wild"&gt;Wojciech Czuchnowski, ''[http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/wyborcza/1,68586,3339691.html Bronisław Wildstein: człowiek z listą]'', [[Gazeta Wyborcza]], last accessed on 12 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPN presidential election===
The election of a new IPN president in December 2005 was controversial. [[Janusz Kurtyka]], the incumbent IPN president, was contested by [[Andrzej Przewoźnik]]. Przewoźnik's candidature received a severe setback after documents were found which suggested his possible co-operation with [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]], Communist Poland's internal intelligence agency and secret police. Przewoźnik was cleared of the accusations only after he had lost the election.&lt;ref name="PAPKP"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,statp,cG93aWF6YW5l,wid,8120626,wiadomosc.html ''Olejniczak: Kurtyka powinien zrezygnować''], [[Polish Press Agency]], 13 December 2005, last accessed on 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Przewoźnik and Kurtyka both died in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash]].

===Employee incidents===
{{undue weight section|date=March 2018}}
In September 2017, a historian in charge of education in [[Lublin]] for the IPN, wrote in a column in ''[[Gazeta Polska]]'' that "after the aggression of Germany into Poland, the situation of the Jews did not look very bad" and "although the [Nazi] occupation authorities took over, they ordered the wearing of armbands with the star of David, charged them heavy taxes, began to designate Jews-only zones only for the Jews, but at the same time permitted the creation of [[Judenrat]], that is, organs of self-government."&lt;ref name="JTA20171024"/&gt; In 2014, the same historian said in an expert opinion to a Polish court that the Nazi party was a leftist party and that the [[swastika]] is an ambiguous symbol.&lt;ref name="JTA20171024"/&gt; These statements were widely criticized by other historians including [[Dariusz Libionka]], and the IPN issued a statement saying that the "In connection with the thesis in the article by Tomasz Panfil in the Gazeta Polska, the Institute of National Remembrance declares that position presented there is in no way compatible with the historical knowledge about the situation of the Jewish population in Poland after September 1, 1939." and that it expects the historian "will, in his scientific and journalistic activities, show diligence and respect to the principles of historical and research reliability."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/polish-institute-rebuffs-historian-who-said-nazi-invasion-not-that-bad-for-jews/ Polish institute rebuffs historian who said Nazi invasion not that bad for Jews], ''[[Times of Israel]]'' (JTA), 5 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, education minister [[Anna Zalewska]] presented the historian with a medal for "for special merits for education".&lt;ref name="JTA20171024"&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/poland-honors-historian-who-said-nazi-invasion-wasnt-so-bad-for-jews/ Poland honors historian who said Nazi invasion wasn’t so bad for Jews], Times of Israel (JTA), 24 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] urged the IPN to fire the deputy director of its publishing office because he had published several books by [[Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]]. The IPN responded that the official "is not a Holocaust denier himself so there is no reason to dismiss him".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apnews.com/28bf4c4b4faf4fea87eb8989896c8b84/Poland-urged-to-fire-publisher-of-works-by-Holocaust-denier Poland urged to fire publisher of works by Holocaust denier], AP, 3 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/polish-body-urged-to-sack-official-who-published-david-irvings-books/ Polish body urged to sack official who published David Irving’s books], Jewish News, 3 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise==

IPN actions have also attracted support. In 2006 an [[open letter]] was published, declaring that:&lt;ref name="PAPdefends"&gt;[http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,57194,wid,8491912,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=1257d List w "obronie historyków z IPN"], [[Polish Press Agency]] article reprinted on [[Wirtualna Polska]]. Last accessed on 20 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[History of Solidarity]] and [[anti-communist resistance in Poland]] cannot be damaged by scientific studies and resulting increase in our knowledge of the past. History of opposition to [[totalitarianism]] belongs to millions of Poles and not to one social or political group which usurps the right to decide which parts of national history should be discussed and which forgotten.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This letter was signed by a former [[Prime Minister of Poland]], [[Jan Olszewski]]; the Mayor of [[Zakopane]], Piotr Bąk; Polish-American Professor and member of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Council]] [[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]]; Professors [[Maria Dzielska]], Piotr Franaszek and Tomasz Gąsowski of the [[Jagiellonian University]]; Professor Marek Czachor of [[Gdańsk University of Technology]], journalist and writer [[Marcin Wolski]]; [[Solidarity]] co-founder [[Anna Walentynowicz]] and dozens of others.&lt;ref name="PAPdefends"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tez"&gt;[http://openforum.tezeusz.pl/openforum/forum_entry.php?id=4640&amp;page=0&amp;category=all&amp;order=time Copy of a letter], Tezusz, Last accessed on 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Created in 1946, the '''International Council of Museums''' ('''ICOM''') is a [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisation]] maintaining formal relations with UNESCO&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/movable-heritage-and-museums/museums/unescoicom-museum-studies-training-package/|title=UNESCO/ICOM Museum Studies Training Programme|publisher=''unesco.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/movable-heritage-and-museums/illicit-traffic-of-cultural-property/partnerships/|title=ICOM among UNESCO’s Partners |publisher=''unesco.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and having a consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]. 
ICOM also partners with entities such as the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/center/specific-sectors/art/icom/rules/|title=Partnership between ICOM and WIPO|publisher=''wipo.int''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[INTERPOL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/fr/Criminalit%C3%A9/%C5%92uvres-d'art/ICOM-Red-Lists|title=Partnership between ICOM and INTERPOL|publisher=''interpol.int''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Customs Organization]] in order to carry out its international public service missions, which include fighting illicit traffic in cultural goods and promoting risk management and emergency preparedness to protect world cultural heritage in the event of natural or man-made disasters. Members of the ICOM get the ICOM membership card, which provides free entry, or entry at a reduced rate, to many museums all over the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimuset/members/benefits/|title=Benefits|website=network.icom.museum|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Code of ethics for museums==
ICOM adopted its ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/professional-standards/code-of-ethics/ |title=ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums|publisher=''icom.museum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986, a reference tool that sets standards of excellence to which all members of the organisation must adhere. The ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums, translated into 39 languages and revised in 2006, establishes values and principles shared by ICOM and the international museum community. These standards of self-regulation by museums include basic principles for museum governance, the acquisition and disposal of collections, and rules for professional conduct.

==Fighting illicit traffic==
[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|Illicit traffic in cultural goods]] causes significant damage to heritage, particularly in regions of the world where cultural objects are most susceptible to theft and looting. Supporting the fight against illicit traffic in cultural goods is among ICOM’s highest priorities. In this context, ICOM publishes its Red List series&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/programmes/fighting-illicit-traffic/|title=ICOM’s actions in Fighting Illicit Traffic|publisher=''icom.museum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; to raise awareness on smuggling and illicit trade in cultural objects. The ICOM Red Lists are tools designed to help police and customs officials, heritage professionals, and art and antiquities dealers to identify the types of objects that are most susceptible to illicit trafficking.

ICOM has already published Red Lists for many different countries and regions:

==Museums emergency programme==
ICOM is committed to providing cultural institutions with the necessary support and risk prevention tools when faced with conflict situations or [[natural disasters]]. Through its Disaster Relief for Museums Task Force (DRTF), its Museums Emergency Programme (MEP) and its active role in the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]] (ICBS),&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_5vqfWYRCM|title=Julien Anfruns, ICOM Director General, at the International Conference of ICBS, December 2011|publisher=''youtube.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICOM assists museums worldwide by mobilising its resources quickly and efficiently to provide support in both the prevention and the aftermath of disaster situations.

The [[Getty Conservation Institute]] and [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) took part in this programme and helped develop training tools for MEP. ICOM’s action programme offers a long-term global response that strengthens the International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS) dynamism.

==International Museum Day==
Every year since 1977, ICOM has organised [[International Museum Day]], a worldwide event held around 18 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url= http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite4_1_16/05/2012_442466|title=International Museum Day in Greece|year=2012|publisher=''ekathimerini.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; From America and Oceania to Europe, Asia and Africa, International Museum Day aims to increase public awareness of the role of museums in developing society.

==CIDOC conceptual reference model==
{{main|CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model}}
CIDOC, ICOM's International Committee for Documentation, provides the museum community with standards and advice on museum documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIDOC - Supporting Museum Documentation|url=http://network.icom.museum/cidoc/|publisher=International Council of Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), formalised as the official international standard [[ISO 21127]], is used to map cultural heritage information to a common and extensible semantic framework. This "semantic glue" can be used to connect between different sources of cultural heritage information published by museums, libraries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIDOC CRM Home page|url=http://www.cidoc-crm.org/|publisher=[[CIDOC|CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4148">'''Julia de Lacy Mann''' (22 August 1891 – 23 May 1985) was an English economic historian. She was principal of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]] for 27 years, from 1928 to 1955.

==Early life and education==
Julia de Lacy Mann was born in London in 1891, the daughter of James Saumarez Mann, a classical scholar, and Amy Bowman Mann, the daughter of a classical scholar. Julia's only sibling, James Saumarez Mann, was killed by a sniper in Iraq in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;James Saumarez Mann, [https://archive.org/details/administratorinm00mannuoft ''An Administrator in the Making: James Saumarez Mann, 1893-1920''] (Longmans, Green &amp; Co. 1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3355">&lt;small&gt;''They are not to be confused with the [[Kankali]] in India.''&lt;/small&gt;

'''Kankalis''', '''Qanqlis''', or '''Kangly''' (''Kanglı/Qangli'') were a [[Turkic people]] of [[Eurasia]]. They were supposedly related or part of the [[Pechenegs]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Porphyrogenitus, ca 950, ''De Administrando Imperio'', http://faculty.washington.edu/dwaugh/rus/texts/constp.html&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively they could have been [[Kipchaks]].&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, Volume 1, Denis Sinor, pg 272&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of the "Kangars" (allies of the Eastern Turk Khahanate against the Western Turk Khaganate), if any, to the Kankalis, is unclear. [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Konstantinos Porphyrogennetos]] (aka, Constantine VII) notes in his ''De Administrando Imperio'' that three groups of the Pechenegs are called Kangar. The name "Kangar" is associated with the ''Kang'' territory and probably with the Kangaris people and the city of Kangu Tarban, mentioned in the Kul Tigin inscription of the Orkhon Turkic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, Volume 1, Denis Sinor, pg 272&lt;/ref&gt;

They first appear in history as a minor branch of the ancient [[Oghuz Turks]]. They formed one of the five sections into which the Oghuz khan divided his subjects. After the fall of the Pecheneg Khanate in the early 10th century, the role of the Kankali Turks became prominent. They were closely related to the [[Kypchaks]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Allsen, "Prelude to the western campaigns: Mongol military operations in the Volga- Ural region, 1217- 1237", ''Architum Eurasiae Medii Aevi'', pp. 5-24&lt;/ref&gt; They may have been a separate nomadic people earlier but the Turkic peoples on the Pontic-Steppe became assimilated into each other by the 13th century.

Many Kankali warriors joined the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] in the 11th century. In 1175 they, or some of them, lived north of [[Lake Balkhash]] and transferred their allegiance from the [[Kara Kitai]] to the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Biran, Empire of the Kara Kitai, page 57&lt;/ref&gt; They suffered [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|heavy losses]] from [[Genghis Khan]] in 1219-1223. For example, all Kankalis in [[Bukhara]] who were taller than a wheel, were slain by the Mongols. Jochi subdued their relations who still lived in the land of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrghyz]] and Kipchak steppes in 1225. Khwarizmi Kankali remnants submitted to [[Great Khan]] [[Ögedei]] after a long resistance under [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]] against his general [[Chormaqan]] and governor Chin-temur. After the Mongol conquest, the remaining Kankalis were absorbed into other [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongols]]. Some of them who served in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] became [[Kharchin]]s.

There are Kankali clans among the [[Kazakhs]], the [[Uzbeks]], [[Bashkirs]], the [[Nogais]] and the [[Karakalpaks]].

The '''Kit-Cat Club''' (sometimes '''Kit-Kat Club''') was an early 18th-century English club in London with strong political and literary associations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  |chapter=The Kit-Kat Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; committed to the furtherance of [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] objectives, meeting at the Trumpet tavern in London, and at [[Water Oakley]] in the [[Berkshire]] countryside.

The first meetings were held at a tavern in Shire Lane (parallel with Bell Yard and now covered by the Royal Courts of Justice) run by an innkeeper called '''Christopher Catt'''. He gave his name to the [[Scotch pie|mutton pie]]s known as "Kit Cats" from which the name of the club is derived.

The club later moved to the Fountain Tavern on [[Strand, London|The Strand]] (now the site of [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]]), and latterly into a room especially built for the purpose at [[Barn Elms]], the home of the secretary [[Jacob Tonson]].&lt;ref&gt;Greater London. A Narrative of Its History, Its People, and Its Places. Volume 2 – Edward Walford {{ISBN|0-543-96787-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer, the club met at the [[Upper Flask]], [[Hampstead Heath]].

==Origins==
The origin of the name "Kit-Cat Club" is unclear. In&amp;nbsp;1705 [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]] wrote:
"The Kit Cat Club got its name from Christopher Catling. [Note, a Pudding Pye man.]." Other sources give his surname as Catt (or some variant such as Cat or Katt): John Timbs ("Club Life of London"), Ophelia Field ("The Kit-Kat Club"), John Macky ("A Journey Through England.")

A nickname for Christopher is "Kit". Christopher Catt was the keeper of a pie-house in Shire Lane, by [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]], where the club originally met. His famous mutton pies ("Kit-Kats") were named after him, and formed a standing dish at meetings of the club; the pie is thus itself sometimes regarded (e.g., by [[Joseph Addison|Addison]] in [[The Spectator (1711)|the Spectator]]) as the origin of the club's name.

It is possible that the club began at the end of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century as the so-called "Order of the Toast". Indeed, a famous characteristic of the Kit-Kat was its toasting-glasses, used for drinking the healths of the reigning beauties of the day, on which were engraved verses in their praise. If so, one can place the date before 1699, when [[Elkanah Settle]] wrote a poem "To the most renowned the President and the rest of the Knights of the most Noble Order of the Toast." It was this very habit of "toasting" that led [[Dr.&amp;nbsp;Arbuthnot]] to produce the following [[epigram]], which hints at yet another possible origin of the Club's name:&lt;ref name=Swift&gt;The Works of Jonathan Swift, D.D., Containing Additional Letters &amp;c. (1727), p. 386. Revised, Edinburgh: Walter Scott (1814)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Whence deathless Kit-Kat took his name&lt;br&gt;Few critics can unriddle&lt;br&gt;Some say from pastrycook it came&lt;br&gt;And some from Cat and Fiddle.&lt;br&gt;From no trim beaus its name it boasts&lt;br&gt;Grey statesmen or green wits&lt;br&gt;But from the pell-mell pack of toasts&lt;br&gt;Of old Cats and young Kits.&lt;ref name=Swift/&gt;}}

== Possible earlier objectives ==
John Vanbrugh's modern biographer [[Kerry Downes]] suggests that the club's origins go back to before the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688; and that its political importance for the promotion of Whig objectives was greater before it became known. Those objectives were a strong [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], a limited monarchy, resistance to France, and the [[Protestant]] [[Order of succession|succession]] to the throne. Downes cites [[John Oldmixon]], who knew many of those involved, and who wrote in 1735 of how some club members "before the Revolution [of 1688] met frequently in the Evening at a Tavern, near [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]], to unbend themselves after Business, and have a little free and cheerful Conversation in those dangerous Times". [[Horace Walpole]], son of Kit-Cat [[Robert Walpole]], refers to the respectable middle-aged 18th&amp;nbsp;century Kit-Cat club as "generally mentioned as a set of wits, in reality the patriots that saved Britain".

== Prominent members ==
Amongst the club's membership were writers such as [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]], [[John Locke]], [[Sir&amp;nbsp;John Vanbrugh]], &lt;!-- [[Dean Swift|Jonathan Swift]] --&gt; and [[Joseph Addison]], and politicians including &lt;!-- the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], --&gt; [[Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Earl of Burlington]], [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st&amp;nbsp;Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|The Earl of Stanhope]], [[Richard Temple, 1st&amp;nbsp;Viscount Cobham|Viscount Cobham]], [[Abraham Stanyan]] and [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]].

Other notables included [[Samuel Garth|Garth]], [[Charles Dartiquenave]], [[Count Saint Germain]], [[Richard Steele|Steele]], and the [[Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton|Dukes of Grafton]], [[William Cavendish, 2nd&amp;nbsp;Duke of Devonshire|Devonshire]], [[Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull|Kingston]], [[Charles Lennox, 1st&amp;nbsp;Duke of Richmond|Richmond]], [[Charles Montagu, 1st Duke of Manchester|Manchester]], [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Dorset]]&lt;!-- and [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Newcastle]] --&gt;, and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lords Sunderland]] and [[Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton|Wharton]]. Of some notoriety were [[Lord Mohun]] and the [[James Berkeley, 3rd&amp;nbsp;Earl of Berkeley|Earl of Berkeley]]. The artist Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Godfrey Kneller]] was also a member, his 48&amp;nbsp;portraits in a standard [[Kit-cat portrait|"kit-cat" format]] of 36 by 28&amp;nbsp;inches, painted over more than twenty years, form the most complete known members list of the club. Many of these portraits currently hang in galleries created in a partnership between the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] and the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] at [[Beningbrough Hall]] in Yorkshire.

== Toasts ==
The toasts of the Kit-Kat Club were famous at the time, and were drunk to the honour of a reigning beauty, or lady to whom the Club wished to do particular honour. We know by name some of those who were toasted: [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]]; [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd&amp;nbsp;Duchess of Marlborough|Lady Godolphin]], [[Anne Churchill|Lady Sunderland]], [[Lady Bridgewater]], and [[Lady Monthermer]], all daughters of [[John Churchill, 1st&amp;nbsp;Duke of Marlborough]], except Lady Mary Wortley Montagu who was the daughter of [[Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull|Evelyn Pierrepont, 5th&amp;nbsp;Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull]] and only 7&amp;nbsp;years old when toasted;&lt;ref name=Bradley1912&gt;{{cite book|first=Rose|last=Bradley||title=The English Housewife in the Seventeenth &amp; Eighteenth Centuries|url=https://archive.org/stream/englishhousewife00braduoft#page/204/mode/2up|year=1912|publisher=E.

[[Image:La Grange expedition.jpg|thumbnail|''Discovery of the remains of the explorers Messrs Panter, Harding &amp; Goldwyer'', from the ''Inquirer and Commercial News'', 1864]]
The '''La Grange expedition''' was a search expedition carried out in the vicinity of [[Lagrange Bay]] in the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]] region of [[Western Australia]] in 1865.  Led by [[Maitland Brown]], the expedition searched for three settlers who had failed to return from an earlier [[exploration|exploring]] expedition. The three men were eventually found dead, having been speared and clubbed to death in their sleep by [[Indigenous Australians]]. A number of Indigenous people were subsequently killed by members of the expedition in a controversial incident that is often now referred to as the "'''La Grange Massacre'''", although the fairness of this term remains a matter of some debate.

==Background==
In 1864, an expedition was organised to investigate the story of a [[convict]] named [[Henry Wildman]], who claimed to have found [[gold]] near [[Camden Harbour, Western Australia|Camden Harbour]].  The expedition found no gold, but good [[pastoralism|pastoral]] land was found, and as a result a small pastoral venture was later established at [[Roebuck Bay]].  In November 1864, three settlers, [[Frederick Panter]], [[James Harding (explorer)|James Harding]] and [[William Goldwyer]], set out from the settlement to explore the land around La Grange Bay.  The [[Panter, Harding and Goldwyer expedition of 1864|expedition]] party had provisions to last only two to three weeks, so when they had not returned three weeks later, another settler, [[Lockier Burges (1841-1929)|Lockier Burges]], set out to find them.  He tracked them as far as the [[mangrove]] swamp around La Grange, but there lost all trace of them.

When news of the missing men reached the [[Government of Western Australia]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], a search party was immediately organised, with [[Maitland Brown]] appointed leader.  There was some speculation that the three men had been killed by natives, and there were calls for their deaths to be avenged.  [[George Walpole Leake]], for example, wrote:
:"They have fallen in the service of their fellow-subjects, and it is our bounden duty to ascertain how and where they have fallen: and if by violence, avenge them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forrest|first=Kay|date=1996|title=The Challenge and the Chance: The Colonisation and Settlement of North West Australia 1861&amp;ndash;1914|publisher=Hesperian Press|place=Victoria Park, Western Australia|isbn=0-85905-217-6}} quoting ''The Inquirer'', 8 February 1865&lt;/ref&gt;
For this reason the expedition is sometimes referred to as a "punitive party".

==The search==
A boat, the ''[[Clarence Packet]]'' was chartered, and the party, led by [[Maitland Brown]] and including [[David Francisco]] and [[Lockier Burges (1841-1929)|Lockier Burges]], left [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] on 16 February 1865. On 25 February, the ''Clarence Packet'' anchored at the mouth of the [[De Grey River, Western Australia|De Grey River]].  Members of the party visited [[Walter Padbury]]'s [[ranch|station]] for news on the missing men, but there was none.  The party then spent nearly two weeks waiting for a native named [[Dutchmanchum]] to be found.  Dutchmanchum was said to speak the language of the tribes in the Roebuck Bay area, so he was desired to guide the party.  When Dutchmanchum was eventually brought in, he related a story that three white men had been attacked and murdered at a river called ''Boola Boola'' in the vicinity of La Grange Bay.  Over the next few days, a number of other Aborigines were encountered that corroborated Dutchmanchum's story.

On 13 March, the party sailed for [[Roebuck Bay, Western Australia|Roebuck Bay]], anchoring off [[Cape Villaret, Western Australia|Cape Villaret]] on the 18th.  Four days later, Brown took a number of members of the party over the [[Race Course Plains, Western Australia|Race Course Plains]], where they captured five more Aborigines.  These Aborigines again corroborated Dutchmanchum's story, and one of them, Lear-a-ban, stated that some Aborigines who were involved in the killings were camped near [[Cape Latouche Treville, Western Australia|Cape Latouche Treville]].  Brown then decided to seek out these Aborigines.

Brown's treatment of the Aboriginal people encountered up until then had been harsh, and at this point he wrote in his journal that he was prepared to arrest any Aboriginal people whom he thought guilty of the killings, but added:
:"But I trust that throughout the whole trip there will be no necessity for capture &amp;mdash; that not only amongst this lot, but also amongst all others we may meet, the guilty natives, if such there are, will either attack us or resist us in such a manner as will of itself justify us in exterminating them."

The ''Clarence Packet'' was directed to proceed to Cape Latouche Treville, and Brown's landed party set out for the location on 27 March.  Three more Aboriginal people were captured that day, and a large group the following day.  Brown thought some of these men guilty of involvement in the attack, and sent ten of them aboard ship.  One of the natives, Karimba, said that he could guide the search party to the remains of the murdered men, but after leading them to Boola Boola, he was unwilling to reveal any more, and guided them back and forth through the thickets for most of a day.  Karimba had also managed to call to an Aborigine to bring men to rescue him, and the party found themselves being followed by a large group of armed Aborigines.  

Eventually, Karimba was sent on board ship, and two other Aboriginal people, who were thought most likely to have been involved in the killings, were brought on shore to act as guides.  These guides led them directly to the site of the killings.  The three white settlers were found all dead. Two of them, Panter and Harding, had obviously been speared and clubbed to death in their sleep, as they still had their handkerchiefs tied over their eyes.  The nature of Goldwyer's death was harder to interpret, but there were no signs of a struggle.  The dead men's journals indicated that they had fought a number of battles with natives, and that they were expecting further hostilities.

Brown had the bodies wrapped and packed for removal to the ship.  While this was being carried out, the two guides tried to escape and were shot dead by Tommy, one of the native assistants brought with the party to act as guides.

==The "La Grange Massacre"==
Instead of returning to the ship, the expedition continued to examine the country.  Brown described this as further "exploration", but most scholars now agree that the evidence points to a [[punitive expedition]].  On 6 April 1865, Brown's party became engaged in a conflict with a large group of Aboriginal people.  Most accounts state that the party walked into an ambush, but at least one account&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scates|first=Bruce|date=1989|title=A Monument to Murder: Celebrating the Conquest of Aboriginal Australia}} in {{cite book|editors=Layman, Lenore and Tom Stannage|title=Celebrations in Western Australian History (Studies in Western Australian History X)|publisher=University of Western Australia|place=Nedlands, Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that they attacked a native camp.  Regardless of the cause, the outcome is not in dispute: at least six, and possibly as many as twenty Aboriginal people were killed, whereas the expedition party suffered no injuries.

==Aftermath==
The search party returned to Perth in May 1865.  Panter, Harding and Goldwyer were given a public funeral.  It was the largest ever seen in Western Australia; the funeral train consisted of some 750 people, and thousands of spectators lined the streets on the way to the [[East Perth, Western Australia|East Perth]] Cemetery, where the men were buried.

Maitland Brown returned home to public acclaim, both for successfully finding the men, and for avenging their deaths.  Indeed, many settlers felt "the requital Mr. Brown had inflicted on the murderers utterly inadequate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forrest|first=Kay|date=1996|title=The Challenge and the Chance: The Colonisation and Settlement of North West Australia 1861&amp;ndash;1914|publisher=Hesperian Press|place=Victoria Park, Western Australia|isbn=0-85905-217-6}} quoting ''Perth Gazette and W.A. Times'', 19 May 1865&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[England|English]] Government, however, expressed the view that "force had been exercised towards the natives without sufficient warranty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forrest|first=Kay|date=1996|title=The Challenge and the Chance: The Colonisation and Settlement of North West Australia 1861&amp;ndash;1914|publisher=Hesperian Press|place=Victoria Park, Western Australia|isbn=0-85905-217-6}} quoting [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies|Secretary of State]] to [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] [[John Hampton|Hampton]], 10 August 1865&lt;/ref&gt; and urged the necessity of maintaining friendly relations with the Aborigines.

Maitland Brown died in 1904 and was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery, but in 1911 his remains were removed from Karrakatta and reinterred with the remains of Panter, Harding and Goldwyer at East Perth.  Shortly afterwards, [[Pietro Porcelli]] was commissioned to create a memorial to Brown.  The result was the [[Explorers' Monument]], a [[bronze]] head and shoulders [[statue]] of Brown, on a [[granite]] base to which is attached plaques portraying the murdered men and describing the circumstances of their death.  During the 1990s, the biased nature of the original plaques was recognised, and another plaque was added that describes the circumstances of the murders from the point of view of the Aboriginal people.

==Plot==
In 1958, Johann Radmann is a young and idealistic public prosecutor who takes an interest in the case of Charles Schulz, a former [[Auschwitz]] extermination camp commander, who is now teaching at a school in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Radmann is determined to bring Schulz to justice, but finds his efforts frustrated because of the many former Nazis serving in the government looking out for one another.

Radmann's boss, the prosecutor-general [[Fritz Bauer]], puts him in charge of investigating former workers at the Auschwitz camp. The U.S. occupation forces give him access to their files and he discovers there were 8,000 of them. He goes after [[Josef Mengele]], who lives in Argentina but flies back to West Germany at will to visit his family. After the authorities block Radmann's attempt to issue an arrest warrant, his boss warns him off and orders him to concentrate on less high profile suspects. The department invites [[Mossad]] agents to visit, and shares its information with them. As a result, [[Adolf Eichmann]] is kidnapped and spirited away to Israel where he was tried, convicted and executed for his crimes. Having pulled off this coup Israel declines to pursue Mengele.

Meanwhile, Radmann allows himself to be seduced by Marlene, a seamstress who benefiting from his connections is able to start a business as a dress designer. Radmann reaches a crisis when he discovers that his own father was in the Nazi party. When he tells Marlene that her father too was in the Nazi Party, she breaks off their relationship. By the end of the film however, there is a chance she will have him back. He resigns his official post and goes to work for an industrialist. There he is again confronted with the question: do what is right; or do what the system needs and requires you to do.

When he finds this means working with a colleague who had defended a former Nazi he was investigating, he walks out, his idealism suffering from hard encounters with the real world - at every turn the "system" wants compliance, but he wants justice. He comes to understand that the only thing that can hope to confront the horror is not "justice", but attention to the lives and stories of those who suffered injustice. Growing out of the simplistic right/wrong moralizing, he comes to understand life as more complex and seeks to repair all the damage, large and small, he inflicted in his zeal.

After going to Auschwitz to say [[kaddish]], the Jewish mourning prayer, for a friend's two daughters who were killed there, he goes back to work for the West German state prosecutor. The film ends with the opening of the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials|trial of several hundred former Auschwitz workers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2461">[[File:Leandro Alberti De viris illustribus.jpg|thumb|''De viris illustribus'' (1517).]]

'''Leandro Alberti''' (1479&amp;ndash;1552) was an Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] historian.
 
==Life==
Alberti was born and died at [[Bologna]]. In his early youth he attracted the attention of the Bolognese rhetorician, [[Giovanni Garzoni]], who volunteered to act as his tutor. He entered the [[Dominican Order]] in 1493, and after the completion of his philosophical and theological studies was called to [[Rome]] by his friend, the [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]], [[Francesco Silvestri]]. He served him as secretary and ''socius'' until the death of Silvestri in 1528.

==Works==
In 1517, Alberti published in six books a treatise on the famous men of his order. This work has gone through numerous editions and been translated into many modern tongues. Besides several lives of the saints, some of which [[Papebroch]] embodied in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'', and a history of the [[Madonna di San Luca]] and the adjoining monastery, he published (Bologna, 1514, 1543) a chronicle of his native city (''Istoria di Bologna, etc.'') to 1273. It was continued by [[Lucio Caccianemici]] to 1279.

The fame of Alberti rests chiefly on his ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (Bologna, 1550) a book in which are found many valuable topographical and archaeological observations. Many of the [[heraldic]] and historical facts are useless, however, since Alberti followed closely the uncritical work written by [[Annius of Viterbo]] on the same subject. The work was translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] in 1567, after having been three times enlarged in the Italian. He also wrote a chronicle of events from 1499 to 1552, and sketches of famous Venetians. 

His explanations of the prophecies of [[Joachim of Fiore]] and his treatise on the beginnings of the [[Venetian Republic]] indicate the current of historical criticism of his day. He was a close friend of most of the contemporary literati, who frequently consulted him. He often mentioned in the letters of the poet [[Giannantius Flamino]], who dedicated the tenth book of his poems to the friar.

}}'''''Liberality and Prodigality''''' (''A Pleasant Comedie, shewing the contention betweene Liberalitie and Prodigalitie'', also known as ''Contention between Liberality and Prodigality'') is a [[morality play]] by an unknown author from c.[[1567 in literature|1567]].&lt;ref&gt;Southern (1973, 306, 506-508).&lt;/ref&gt; Its title page also reads: "As it was played before her Maiestie. London Printed by Simon Stafford for George Vincent, and are to be sold at the signs of the Hand in hand in Wood-street over against S. Michaels Church."

The copy of this play in the [[Garrick Collection]] appears to be the only one known. There is some internal evidence, from the allusion to the 43rd year of Queen Elizabeth, that the production was performed before her Majesty in 1600; and it seems likely that it was a revival of a more ancient piece. [[Edward Phillips]], author of the ''Theatrum Poetarum'', assigned it to [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], but this attribution is dubious.

{{Other uses|Merrie England (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:Poor little birdie teased by Richard Doyle.jpg|thumb|''Poor little birdie teased'', by the 19th-century [[England|English]] illustrator [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]. Traditional English fairytales depicting [[elves]], [[fairy|fairies]] and [[pixie]]s are set on a "Merrie England" setting of woodland and cottage gardens.]]

"'''Merry England'''", or in more jocular, archaic spelling "'''Merrie England'''" (also styled as "'''Merrie Olde England'''"), refers to an [[England|English]] [[autostereotype]], a [[utopia]]n conception of [[English culture|English society and culture]] based on an [[idyll]]ic [[pastoral]] way of life that was allegedly prevalent in [[Early Modern Britain]] at some time between the [[Middle Ages]] and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. More broadly, it connotes a putative [[essentialism|essential]] [[Englishness]] with nostalgic overtones, incorporating such [[cultural icon|cultural symbols]] as the [[thatched cottage]], the [[country inn]] and the [[Sunday roast]].

"Merry England" is not a wholly consistent vision but rather a revisited England which [[Oxford]] [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] Roy Judge described as "a world that has never actually existed, a visionary, mythical landscape, where it is difficult to take normal historical bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Roy Judge, "May Day and Merrie England" ''Folklore'' '''102'''.2 (1991, pp. 131-148) p 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be treated both as a product of the sentimental [[nostalgic]] imagination and as an ideological or political construct, often underwriting various sorts of [[Conservatism|conservative]] world-views. Favourable perceptions of Merry England reveal a nostalgia for aspects of an earlier society that are missing in modern times.

==Medieval origins==

The concept of ''Merry England'' originated in the Middle Ages, when [[Henry of Huntingdon]] around 1150 first coined the phrase ''Anglia plena jocis''.&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His theme was taken up in the following century by the encyclopedist [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], who claimed that "England is full of mirth and of game, and men oft-times able to mirth and game".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Ronald Hutton]]'s study of churchwardens' accounts&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merrie England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700''.&lt;/ref&gt; places the real consolidation of "Merry England" in the years between 1350 and 1520, with the newly elaborative annual festive round of the liturgical year, with candles and pageants, processions and games, [[boy bishop]]s and decorated [[rood loft]]s. Hutton argued that, far from being [[Paganism|pagan survivals]], many of the activities of popular piety criticised by sixteenth-century reformers were actually creations of the later Middle Ages: "Merry England" thus reflects those historical aspects of rural English customs and folklore that were subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hodgkinson, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2006/nov/17/merryenglandwasrealenough 17 November 2006] - "Hutton's work confirms my belief that Britain was a merrier place before the Puritans came along with their black hats and hatred of fun. Merry England was not a myth. They really did used to dance around the maypole, feast all day and drink beer all night. And not only was it more merry, the merry-making was actually encouraged by the Church, particularly in the later medieval period. This was because the Church had realised that merry-making could be a source of funds - the profits of the bar went to church upkeep - and also because it helped bind communities."&lt;/ref&gt;  

The same concept ''may'' have also been used to describe a [[utopia]]n state of life that peasants aspired to lead (see [[Cockaigne]]).{{citeneeded|date=April 2017}} Peasant revolts, such as those led by [[Wat Tyler]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]] invoked a [[visionary]] idea that was also [[egalitarian]] – [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] arguing for "wines, spices, and good bread...velvet and camlet furred with grise"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. B. Bury ed, ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol VII'' (Cambridge 1932) p. 739&lt;/ref&gt; all to be held in common. Tyler's rebels wished to throw off the feudal aristocracy (though the term "[[Norman yoke]]" belongs to a later period) and return to a perceived time where the Saxons ruled in equality and freedom.  The main arguments of Tyler's rebels were that there was no basis for aristocratic rule in the Bible, and that the plague had demonstrated by its indiscriminate nature that all people were equal under God. 

Even in relatively peaceful times, medieval existence was for the majority a harsh and uncertain one – [[Lawrence Stone]] describing rural life as “at the mercy of disease and the weather...with money to burn today from the sale of a bumper crop, plunged into debt tomorrow because of harvest failure”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. H. Hexter, ''On Historians'' (London 1979) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rural community was clearly prepared to play hard, as well as work hard (even if much of the surviving evidence for this comes in the form of official censure, ecclesiastical or secular). The festival calendar provided some fifty holy days for seasonal and communal coming-together and merry-making.&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''Th stripping of the Altars'' (London 1992) p. 42;L. Marcus, ''The Politic of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  Complaints against the rise in levels of drunkenness and crime on holidays, of flirting in church or on pilgrimage, of grievous bodily harm from the “abominable enough...foot-ball-game”&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 95, p. 192 and p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; all testify (however indirectly) to a vital, if unofficial medieval existence. [[William Langland|Langland]] might castigate, but also provided a vivid picture of, those who “drink all day in diverse taverns, and gossip and joke there”, of the field-workers who “sat down to drink their ale and sing songs – thinking to plough his field with a ''Hey-nonny-nonny''”.&lt;ref&gt;J. F Goodridge ed., ''Piers the Ploughman'' (Penguin 1966) p. 41 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The wandering scholar, or [[goliard]], who posed the mock questions of whether it was better to eat meat or fish, to court Agnes or Rose,&lt;ref&gt;H. Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (Fontana 1968) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; belonged to a similar fraternity.

More legitimised recreation came in the form of archery, ice-skating, wrestling, hunting and hawking,&lt;ref&gt;D. Baker ed., ''The Early Middle Ages'' (London 1966) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; while there was also the medieval angler, who “atte the leest hath his holsom walke and mery at his ease”.&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Berners, quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 596&lt;/ref&gt; Above the town or village itself stood a semi-approved of layer of nomadic entertainers – minstrels, jugglers, [[mummers]], morris-dancers, actors and jig-makers,&lt;ref&gt;S Greenblatt, ''Will in the World'' (London 2005) pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; all adding to first stirrings of mass entertainment.

Thus there was certainly ''merriment'' in Medieval England, even if always found in an unidealized and conflictual social setting. If there was a period after the [[Black Death]] when labour shortages meant that agricultural workers were in stronger positions, and [[serfdom]] was consequently eroded, the growing commercialisation of agriculture – with enclosures, rising rents, and pasture displacing arable, sheep men – meant that such social and economic hardship and conflict continued in the countryside through into Tudor times.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''History of England'' (London 1926) pp. 242, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Reformation conflicts==

The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] set in motion a debate about popular festivities that was to endure for at least a century and a half – a culture war concerning the so-called politics of mirth.&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the move away from Catholicism, Henry VIII had slashed the number of saint day holidays, attacking the "lycencyous vacacyon and lybertye of these holy days",&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''The Stripping of the Alatars'' (London 1992) p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and Edward VI had reduced them further to a bare twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shapiro, ''1599'' (London 2005) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The annual festal round in parish society – consolidated between 1350 and 1520&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400–1700'' (Oxford 1994) Ch II. For methodological criticism, see however Katherine L. French, ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'' (1995), 247-248&lt;/ref&gt; and including such customs as [[Parish ale|church ales]], may games, maypoles and local plays, came under severe pressure in Elizabeth's reign.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 118-122&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious austerity, opposed to catholic and pagan hangovers, and economic arguments against idleness, found common ground in attacking communal celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

However a reaction quickly set in, [[John Caius]] in 1552 deploring the loss of what he called "the old world, when this country was called merry England".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; James I in 1618 issued his [[Book of Sports]], specifically defending the practice of sports, dancing, maypoles and the like after Sunday Service;&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and his son Charles took a similar line. The question of "Merry England" thus became a focal point dividing Puritan and Anglican, proto-Royalist and proto-Roundhead, in the lead-up to the Civil War.  Unsurprisingly, the [[Long Parliament]] put an end to ales, the last of which was held in 1641, and drove [[Christmas]] underground, where it was kept privately, as a form of protest; while the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] saw the revival of such pastimes (if not on the Sabbath itself) widely and popularly celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural revivals==
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Gate of Calais|O the Roast Beef of Old England (The Gate of Calais)]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] contrasts English plenty with French and Jacobite Highlander misery.]]

At various times since the Middle Ages, authors, propagandists, romanticists, poets and others have revived or co-opted the term. The celebrated [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] engraving illustrating the patriotic song "[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]" (''see illustration''), is as anti-French as it is patriotic.

[[William Hazlitt]]'s essay "Merry England", appended to his ''Lectures on the English Comic Writers'' (1819),&lt;ref&gt;It was often reprinted in collections of Hazlitt's essays, and, tellingly, included in Ernest Rhys' compilation of sentimental patriotism ''The Old Country: a Book of  Love and Praise of England'', first published in  1917, as the First World War was coming to an end, and republished in 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; popularised the specific term, introduced in tandem with an [[allusion]] to the iconic figure of [[Robin Hood]], under the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] "St George for merry England!":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The beams of the morning sun shining on the lonely glades, or through the idle branches of the tangled forest, the leisure, the freedom, 'the pleasure of going and coming without knowing where', the troops of wild deer, the sports of the chase, and other rustic gambols, were sufficient to justify the appelation of [[Sherwood Forest|'Merry Sherwood']], and in like manner, we may apply the phrase to ''Merry England''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazlitt's subject was the traditional sports and rural diversions native to the English. In ''Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England'' (1844: translated as ''The Condition of the Working Class in England''), [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote sarcastically of [[Young England]] (a ginger-group of young aristocrats hostile to the new industrial order) that they hoped to restore "the old 'merry England' with its brilliant features and its romantic feudalism. This object is of course unattainable and ridiculous ..."  The phrase "merry England" appears in English in the German text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me02/me02_486.htm|title=Friedrich Engels - Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England - Die Stellung der Bourgeoisie zum Proletariat|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CRANE a garland for mayday 1895.jpg|thumb|left|"A Garland for May Day 1895" woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]

[[William Cobbett]] provided conservative commentary on the rapidly changing look and ''mores'' of an industrialising nation&lt;ref&gt;William Sambrook, ''William Cobbett'' (1973), ch. I "Merry England?"&lt;/ref&gt; by invoking the stable social hierarchy and prosperous working class of the pre-industrial country of his youth in his ''[[Rural Rides]]'' (1822–26, collected in book form, 1830). The later works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] also subscribed to some extent to the "Merry England" view. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]'' also made the case for Merrie England; the conclusion of ''[[Crotchet Castle]]'' by [[Thomas Love Peacock]]  contrasts the mediaevalism of Mr. Chainmail to the contemporary social  unrest. Barry Cornwall's patriotic poem. "Hurrah for Merry England", was set twice to music and printed in ''[[The Musical Times]]'', in 1861 and 1880.

In the 1830s, the [[Gothic revival]] promoted in England what once had been a truly international European style. Its stages, though, had been given purely English antiquarian labels—"Norman" for the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], "[[Early English Period|Early English]]", etc.—and the revival was stretched to include also the succeeding, more specifically ''English'' style: a generic English Renaissance revival, later named "[[Jacobethan]]". The revival was spurred by a series of lithographs by [[Joseph Nash]] (1839–1849), illustrating ''The Mansions of England in the Olden Time'' in picturesque and accurate detail. They were peopled with jolly figures in ruffs and [[farthingale]]s, who personified a specific "Merry England" that was not Catholic (always an issue with the Gothic style in England), yet full of lively detail, in a golden pre-industrial land of Cockaigne.

Children's storybooks and [[fairytales]] written in the [[Victorian period]] often used Merry England as a setting as it is seen as a mythical utopia. They often contain nature-loving mythological creatures such as [[elves]] and [[fairy|fairies]], as well as [[Robin Hood]]. In popular culture, the adjective ''Dickensian'' is sometimes used in reference to the same mythical era, but [[Charles Dickens]]'s view of the rural past evoked [[nostalgia]], not [[fantasy]]. [[Samuel Pickwick|Mr. Pickwick]]'s world was that of the 1820s and 1830s, of the [[stagecoach]] before the advent of the [[railway]]s.

The London-based [[Anglo-Catholic]] magazine of prose and verse ''Merry England'' began publication in 1879. Its issues bore a sonnet by [[William Wordsworth]] as epigraph, beginning "They called thee 'merry England' in old time" and characterizing ''Merry England'' "a responsive chime to the heart's fond belief":
&lt;poem&gt;
'''...Can, I ask,'''
    This face of rural beauty be a mask
    For discontent, and poverty, and crime?—
    These spreading towns a cloak for lawless will?—
    Forbid it, Heaven! —that Merry England still
    May be they rightful name, in prose or rhyme.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the late Victorian era, the Tory [[Young England]] set perhaps best reflected the vision of "Merry England" on the political stage. Today, in a form adapted to [[political conservatism]], the vision of "Merry England" extends to embrace a few urban artisans and other cosmopolitans; a flexible and humane [[clergy]]; an interested and [[altruism|altruistic]] [[Squire#Present status (England)|squirearchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[royal family|royalty]]. Solidity and good cheer would be the values of [[yeoman farmer]]s, whatever the foibles of those higher in the hierarchy.

The idea of Merry England became associated on one side with the [[Anglo-Catholic]]s and [[Catholicism]], as a version of life's generosity; for example [[Alice Meynell|Wilfrid Meynell]] entitled one of his magazines ''Merrie England''. The pastoral aspects of [[William Blake]], a Londoner and an actual craftsman, lack the same mellow quality. [[G. K. Chesterton]] in part adapted it to urban conditions. [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and other left-inclined improvers. [[Walter Crane]]'s "Garland for May Day 1895"  is lettered "Merrie England" together with progressive slogans ("Shorten Working Day &amp; Lengthen Life", "The Land for the People", "No Child Toilers") with socialism ("Production for Use Not for Profit"). For a time, the ''Merry England'' vision was a common reference point for rhetorical [[Tories]] and utopian [[socialist]]s, offering similar alternatives to an industrialising society, with its large-scale movement off the land to jerry-built cities and gross [[social inequality]].
This was also the theme of the journalist Robert Blatchford, editor of the ''Clarion'', in his booklet ''Merrie England'' (1893) In it he imagined a new society much on the basis of William News from Nowhere, in which capitalism had disappeared and people lived in a small self sufficient communities. The book was deeply nostalgic for a pastoral England of the past before industrial capitalism and factory production. It was widely and enjoyed worldwide sales, and probably {{what?|date=November 2018}} more working class readers to socialism than William Morris or Karl Marx. 

Another variant of ''Merry England'' was promoted in the ''organic community'' of [[F. R. Leavis]] by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the [[industrial revolution]]. Historians of the era say that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Bilan R. R. (1979) ''The Literary Criticism if F. R. Leavis'' (Cambridge University Press) pages 14–18, {{ISBN|978-0-521-22324-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] in 1951 mocked both planning, and the concept of a revived Merry England, by envisioning a 'Merrie Board' with powers to set up 'Merrie Areas' in rural England – intended to preserve "this hard core of Merriment".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime propaganda is sometimes taken to reflect a generalised view of a rural Deep England, but this is perhaps to ignore both the competing views of ruralism, and the mix of rural and non-rural actually offered for a post-war vision of a better Britain.&lt;ref&gt;D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Little England'' and propaganda==

In Angus Calder's re-examination of the ideological constructs surrounding "[[Little Englander|Little England]]" during the [[Second World War]] in ''The Myth of the Blitz'', he puts forward the view that the story of Deep England was central to wartime [[propaganda]] operations within the [[United Kingdom]], and then, as now, served a clearly defined political and cultural purpose in the hands of various interested agencies.

Calder cites the writer and broadcaster [[J. B. Priestley]] whom he considered to be a proponent of the Deep England world-view. Priestley's wartime [[BBC]] radio "chats" described the beauty of the English natural environment, this at a time when rationing was at its height, and the population of London was sheltering from the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] in its [[London Underground|Underground]] stations. In reference to one of Priestley's bucolic broadcasts, Calder made the following point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Priestley, the socialist, gives this cottage no occupant, nor does he wonder about the size of the occupant's wage, nor ask if the cottage has internal sanitation and running water. His countryside only exists as spectacle, for the delectation of people with motor cars." (Angus Calder, ''The Myth of the Blitz'', London 1991)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in ''Journey Through England'', Priestley identified himself as a [[Little Englander]] because he despised imperialism and the effect that the capitalist industrial revolution had on the people and environment.

Part of the imagery of the 1940 patriotic song "[[There'll Always Be an England]]" seems to be derived from the same source:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a country lane,
:Wherever there's a cottage small
:Beside a field of grain.

The continuation evokes, however, the opposite image of the modern industrialised society:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a busy street,
:Wherever there's a turning wheel,
:A million marching feet.

The song seems therefore to offer a synthesis and combine the two Englands, the archaic bucolic one and the modern industrialised one, in the focus of patriotic loyalty and veneration.

Some of the nostalgia associated with Merry England is reminiscent, both in its origins and its artistic influences, of the 19th-Century [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic Nationalism]] which flourished in continental Europe and became integral to Nazi ideology.  However, the Merry England vision never motivated hostility towards foreigners, nor nationalism, as did Romantic Nationalism before and during the German Nazi era.

==Literature and the arts==

The transition from a literary locus of ''Merry England'' to a more obviously political one cannot be placed before 1945, as the cited example of J. B. Priestley shows. Writers and artists described as having a Merry England viewpoint range from the radical visionary poet [[William Blake]] to the evangelical Christian [[Arthur Mee]]. The [[Rudyard Kipling]] of ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' is certainly one; when he wrote it, he was in transition towards his later, very conservative stance. Within art, the fabled long-lost merrie England was also a recurring theme in the Victorian-era paintings of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. The 1890 [[News from Nowhere]] by [[William Morris]] portrays a future England that has reverted to a rural idyll following a [[socialism|socialist]] revolution.

Reference points might be taken as children's writer [[Beatrix Potter]], [[John Betjeman]] (more interested in [[Victoriana]]), and the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whose [[hobbit]] characters' culture in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]] embodied many aspects of the Merry England point of view.

In his essay "[[Epic Pooh]]", [[Michael Moorcock]] opined:

{{quote|The little hills and woods of that [[Surrey]] of the mind, [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], are 'safe', but the wild landscapes everywhere beyond the Shire are 'dangerous'. Experience of life itself is dangerous. The ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' is a pernicious confirmation of the values of a declining nation with a [[morally bankrupt]] class whose cowardly self-protection is primarily responsible for the problems England answered with the ruthless logic of [[Thatcherism]]. Humanity was derided and marginalised. Sentimentality became the acceptable substitute. So few people seem to be able to tell the difference.}}

Here the shift has taken place: Tolkien was profoundly conservative with respect to cultural traditions, as Moorcock is quite aware, but not at all an imperialist. He set an area based upon the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region within [[Middle-earth]], but made it apparent that its perimeter was maintained by external allies. The Shire seems to represent the comfort of childhood which Tolkien's characters must leave in order to grow into maturity and wisdom. In addition, in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', both [[Gandalf]] and Frodo express frustration with hobbits' staidness and dislike of anything foreign or out of the ordinary, and even in ''Concerning Hobbits'' the narrator shows a certain degree of impatience with hobbits' general narrow-mindedness.  Rather than a celebration of a narrow, anachronistic idealism, Tolkien's works hinge upon his characters moving beyond that place of idealism into a broader, more complex interaction with the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Furthermore, in the chapters "Homeward Bound" and "The Scouring of the Shire" of Tolkien's "The Return of the King" the Shire is depicted as being far from idyllic or safe, largely due to the actions of lax, greedy, and venal hobbits, with the character of Sam Gamgee describing the Shire upon his homecoming as "This is worse than Mordor." Of particular note with respect to the naturally corrupt nature of hobbits is the final chapter of The Hobbit, where "The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr Baggins was admitted to be alive again. The people who had got specially good bargains at the sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture."

''[[The Pyrates]]'', the 1983 spoof historical novel by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], sets its scene with a page-long sentence composed entirely of (immediately demolished) Merry England [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]]:
{{quote|It began in the old and golden days of England, in a time when all the hedgerows were green and the roads dusty, when hawthorn and wild roses bloomed, when big-bellied landlords brewed October ale at a penny a pint ...}}

The novel ''[[England, England]]'' by [[Julian Barnes]] describes an imaginary, though plausible, set of circumstances that cause modern England to return to the state of Deep England.  The author's views are not made explicit, but the characters who choose to remain in the changed nation are treated more sympathetically than those who leave.

In [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', Professor Welch and his friends are devotees of the Merry England legend, and Jim's "Merrie England" lecture somehow turns into a debunking of the whole concept (a position almost certainly reflecting that of Amis).

A few popular music artists have used elements of the Merry England story as recurring themes; [[The Kinks]] and their leader [[Ray Davies]] crafted ''[[The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'' as a homage to English country life and culture: it was described by [[AllMusic]] senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] as an album "lamenting the passing of old-fashioned English traditions";&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11011|pure_url=yes}} ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'']. Allmusic.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' also contains similar elements. [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] has often alluded to an anti-modern, pre-industrial, agrarian vision of England in his songs ([[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the band's namesake]] was himself an agrarian, the inventor of the seed drill).

''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' is a [[comic opera]] by [[Edward German]].

[[Richmal Crompton]]'s "William the Bad'" [1930] contains a chapter, 'The Pennymans Hand On The Torch',  about an idealist couple who wish to return to Merrie England, as a staging post towards their ideal of living at "the morning of the world", which means dressing in flowing robes and (incongrously with the Merrie England concept, bearing in mind the traditions of English Ale and The Roast Beef Of Old England) being vegetarian and teetotal.  The pageant they organise becomes a fiasco, largely, needless to say,  on account of William's involvement as part of the dragon who fights Mr Pennyman's St George. "The Pennymans'... pageant for May Day which involves [[St. George and the Dragon]] ... proves to be the first time ever that the Dragon (played by William) ever came out on top in the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justwilliamnotes.blogspot.co.uk/|title=Just William|author=Pip|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Netiva Ben Yehuda''' ({{lang-he-n|נתיבה בן-יהודה}}; July 1928, Tel Aviv – 28 February 2011) was an Israeli author, editor and media personality. She was a commander in the pre-state [[Jewish]] underground [[Palmach]].

==Early life==
Netiva ("Tiva") Ben-Yehuda was born in [[Tel Aviv]], in [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]], on 26 July 1928. Her father was Baruch Ben-Yehuda, director general of the first [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Israeli ministry of education]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28019760_ITM | work=Prooftexts: A Journal of Jewish Literary History | title=Hebrew Gender and Zionist Ideology: The Palmach Trilogy of Netiva Ben Yehuda | date=1 January 2000 |first=Yael| last=Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime experience==
Ben-Yehuda joined the Palmach at the age of 18 and was trained in demolition, bomb disposal, topography, and scouting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pennington|first=Reina|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots: a Biographical Dictionary of Military Women|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0313327076|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her duties included transferring ammunition, escorting convoys, and training recruits.

The Palmach generally opposed women fighting at the front, however Ben-Yehuda was a commander and participated in several battles by performing sabotage operations.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pennington |first=Reina |title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots: a Biographical Dictionary of Military Women|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0313327076|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 11, 1948, Ben-Yehuda and her comrades planted a mine for a busload of Arabs. This event and the ensuing death impacted Ben-Yehuda psychologically.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
[[File:Netiva Ben-Yehuda.jpg|thumb|Photo of Netiva Ben-Yehuda with [[Dahn Ben-Amotz]] from Palmach Archive]]

== Later life ==
Ben-Yehuda considered competing in [[discus throwing]] at the [[Olympics]], but a bullet injury to her arm kept her from pursuing an athletic career.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; She studied at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Jewish philosophy]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

===Literary and media career===
Ben Yehuda was a freelance editor, and in 1972 published ''The World Dictionary of Hebrew Slang''. Between 1981 and 1991 she published her Palmah trilogy, a series of three novels based on her own experience in the War of Independence (see "Published works").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Netiva Ben Yehuda|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/ben-yehuda-netiva|first=Yael|last=Feldman|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a resident of Palmach Street in the capital, and the local cafe she patronized on that street became known as "Cafe Netiva." &lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/radio-host-netiva-ben-yehuda-passes-on-at-83-1.346226|title=Radio Host Netiva Ben Yehuda Passes on at 83|first=Nir|last=Hasson|date=28 February 2011|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Yehuda wrote over 30 books, including a [[Hebrew]] slang dictionary, coauthored with [[Dahn Ben-Amotz]]. Ben-Yehuda was the host of a late-night [[Israel Radio]] show for 14 years. She played old-time Israeli songs and talked with callers.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2004, Ben Yehuda received the [[Yakir Yerushalayim]] (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem) award from the city of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=YYawards&gt;{{Cite web| title = Recipients of Yakir Yerushalayim award (in Hebrew)| url = http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_main/TopSiteJeru.asp?newstr=3&amp;src=/jer_sys/publish/HtmlFiles/1030/results_pub_id=12594.html&amp;cont=895| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022034528/http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_main/TopSiteJeru.asp?newstr=3&amp;src=%2Fjer_sys%2Fpublish%2FHtmlFiles%2F1030%2Fresults_pub_id%3D12594.html&amp;cont=895| archivedate = 2013-10-22| df = }} City of Jerusalem official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Yehuda died on 28 February 2011 at the age of 82.

===Quotes===
On the subject of the Palmach: "I don't think that there has ever been any other underground movement in the world in which 'male chauvinism' triumphed so powerfully and so proudly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLfdWDMOMSEC&amp;pg=PA177|title=No Room of Their Own: Gender and Nation in Israeli Women's Fiction|first=Yael S.|last=Feldman|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar}}
An '''Old Calendarist''' is any [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] or any Eastern Orthodox Church body which uses the historic [[Julian calendar]] (called "Old Style Calendar" or "Church calendar" or "Old Calendar"), proposed by the [[Paganism|pagan]] Roman general [[Julius Caesar]], and whose Church body is not in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Churches that use the New Calendar.

==Overview==
The "Old Calendarists" (who are also sometimes styled "Old Calendar") are to be distinguished from Eastern Orthodox Christians or Eastern Orthodox Church bodies which are ''on the'' Old Calendar. The latter use the historic Julian calendar cited above, but ''are'' in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Churches that use the New Calendar (the [[Revised Julian calendar]]). Thus, to be "Old Calendarist" or "Old Calendar" is not the same thing as being "on the Old Calendar".  The [[Russian Orthodox Church]], for instance, is not Old Calendarist (or Old Calendar), but it is on the Old Calendar. There are a great many Eastern Orthodox Christians who are (or who belong to Churches that are) ''on the Old Calendar'', but far fewer in number are the Eastern Orthodox Christians who are ''Old Calendar'' or ''Old Calendarist.'' It also should not be confused with the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, all of which are either ''on'' the Old Calendar or use their own calendar, but who are not in communion with either the Old Calendarists or mainstream [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], although they are currently engaged in ecumenical dialogue with the latter. Nevertheless, inside the Armenian Apostolic Church, the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] uses the Old Calendar in contrast to rest of the Armenian Church, which adopted the Gregorian Calendar while no member of the Armenian churches are using today the [[Armenian calendar]]. The [[Indian Orthodox Church]] uses the Gregorian calendar along with their autonomous Syriac Orthodox counterparts in India, the [[Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church]], in contrast to the rest of the Syriac Church which uses its own calendar. The [[Ancient Church of the East]] (Julian Calendar) emerged as the result of a schism when Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai introduced the Gregorian Calendar into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. 

The [[Julian calendar]], proposed by the pagan Roman general Julius Caesar, is commonly opposed to the [[Gregorian calendar]] introduced to Christianity by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] during the 16th century. An improved form of the Gregorian calendar, originally developed in 1785 and modified in 1923 by the [[Serbia|Serbian]] astronomer [[Milutin Milanković]], was first introduced by Greece for civil purposes only and later adopted by some Orthodox churches. In its present form it is known as the Revised Julian calendar and it will not diverge from the Gregorian until AD 2800 (see [[Greek Old Calendarists#History]]). A minority of Eastern Orthodox Christians regarded this as a surrender of the Eastern Orthodox Church to [[the Pope]] and continued following the old calendar.  Some of these also broke communion with those who had adopted the new calendar, thus [[Schism (religion)|creating their own]] church, or [[Christian denomination|denomination]], which means in Latin "to take a new name".

This schism is the beginning of the Old Calendar Churches which suspended [[full communion]] or [[concelebration]] with other Eastern Orthodox churches ("[[New Calendarists]]") over the adoption by the latter of the Revised Julian calendar (called "New Calendar," although some churches did not specify the details of which ''New calendar'' they were adopting). This is the most common use of the term.

Those Orthodox Churches which remain in full communion with the New Calendarists and yet continue to use the Julian calendar include the [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. (The Julian calendar is also used by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]] which has reunited with the Russian Orthodox Church.) [[Mount Athos]], subordinate to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, also follows the Julian calendar.

In recent years both Old Calendar congregations and monasteries, as well New Calendar congregations and monasteries inside the Churches on the Old Calendar have been accepted into the official churches maintaining their own Calendar. Even some Russian [[Old Believers]] groups have been accepted into the official Russian Church while keeping their own traditions.

'''''Paphnutius''''' or '''''The Conversion of the Harlot Thaïs''''' is a play originally written in Latin by [[Hrotsvitha|Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim]] (935-1002). It concerns the relationship between [[Thaïs (saint)|Saint Thaïs]], once a [[courtesan]] of [[Alexandria]] in [[Roman Egypt]], and [[Paphnutius the Ascetic]],&lt;ref&gt;Or alternatively [[Paphnutius of Thebes]]. Both are revered as saints.&lt;/ref&gt; the hermit who offered her conversion to Christianity. The characters of the play lived during the 4th century. Much later in Europe, beginning in the early [[middle ages]], the story of St. Thaïs also enjoyed a wide popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/whthaintro.htm ''The Life of St. Thaïs'': Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630182317/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/whthaintro.htm |date=2015-06-30 }} re "R.H.Robbin Library, Camelot Project".

Evidently Hrotsvitha employed as a source for her play the ''Vita Thaisis'', a several-centuries-old translation into Latin of the life of Saint Thaïs (the original in Greek). The playwright, a [[Benedictine]] [[Canoness]] of [[Lower Saxony|Saxony]] (northwest Germany), drawing on the tradition, apparently created a narrative line and a distinctive character for St. Thaïs appropriate to the [[Medieval Christianity|medieval Christian]] worldview.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine N. Wilson (translated with an introduction), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim'' (Saskatoon: Peregina Publishing Co. 1985), the drama ''The Converstion of the Harlot Thais'' at 92-112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katherine N. Wilson (translator), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim'' (New York: Garland Publishing Co. 1989), the play ''Pafnutius'' at 93-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
Perhaps unexpectedly, the play begins with a somewhat scholarly dialogue between [[clerics]] regarding the harmony inherent in the created world. The subject of concord sets the stage for the drama of the disordered life of the courtesan Thaïs. "She shines forth in wondrous beauty" yet she also "threatens men with foul shame."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985) at 98. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989) at 102-103. She "is ready to ensnare all men with allurement of her beauty and drag them along with her to eternal perdition." ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the play Thaïs is presented as someone "who was always eager to accumulate wealth".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985) at 103. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989) at 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The saint Pafnutius explains to his disciples that "not only frivolous youth dissipate their families' few possessions on her but even respected men waste their costly treasures by lavishing gifts on her... ."&lt;ref name="Wilson 1985"&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985) at 110-111. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989) at 122.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern writer observes: "Hrotsvit's Thaïs became a prostitute because of her love of money. The root of her immorality is avarice, which in combination with her great beauty, resulted in her choice of prostitution as a career."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Wailes, ''Spirituality and Politics in the Works of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim'' (Selingrove: Susquehanna University Press 2006), chapter on Thaïs at 181-189, above quote at 185. "The root of her lechery is her cupidity, ''radix enum luxuriae cupiditas'', and so she has been the ruin of many men whose senuality led them down the path to poverty." ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

After her conversion to Christianity she "destroys" 400 pounds of gold and burns other articles of treasure before her former patrons. Pafnutius exclaims to Thaïs, "O how you have changed from your prior condition when you burned with illicit passions and were inflamed with greed for possessions!"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985) at 102. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989) at 110, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of her [[Religious conversion|conversion]], her transition from courtesan to Christian, may appear rather truncated to a modern audience. Afterwards Pafnutius would describe the event to a brother religious: "I visited her, disguised as a lover, secretly, and won over her lascivious mind first with admonitions and flattery, then I frightened her with harsh threats."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985) at 118. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989) at 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first meeting is presented in part as follows:

:Pafnutius: Isn't there another room where we can converse more privately, one that is hidden away?

:Thaïs: There is one so hidden, so secret, that no one besides me knows its inside except for God.

:Pafnutius: What God?

:Thaïs: The true God.

:Pafnutius: Do you believe He knows what we do?

:Thaïs: I know that nothing is hidden from His view.

:Pafnutius: Do you believe that He overlooks the deeds of the wicked or that He metes out [[justice]] as is due?

:Thaïs: I believe that He weighs the merits of each person justly in His scale and that each according to his deserts receives reward or travail from Him."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985) at 100. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989) at 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pafnutius then bluntly condemns her actions as meriting [[damnation]]. Thaïs acquiesces to the view of Pafnutius without protest; she becomes anxious. Apparently, she had managed to hide from herself her knowledge of her sin. When Pafnutius confronts her, quickly Thaïs realizes her self-deception. Then she came to hear the discord within her that had caused her unbalanced life, with its disruptive results. She repents.&lt;ref&gt;Wailes, ''Spirituality and Politics in the Works of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim'' (2006), his chapter on Thaïs at 181-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

After entering a process of spiritual transformation, Thaïs tells Pafnutius that "All angels sing His praise and His kindness, because He never scorns the humility of a contrite soul."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985) at 109-110. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989) at 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Thaïs burns her ill-gotten treasures; she then follows Pafnutius into the desert, to a [[convent]] where she will live under the guidance of the [[abbess]] for several years. There, in solitude, [[cloistered]] and [[penitent]], she reviewed in a new light her former life and sought [[forgiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985) at 104. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989) at 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pafnutius here, in delivering the newly converted Thaïs to her to the place of her spiritual refuge and retreat, addresses the [[abbess]] of the convent in the Egyptian desert, concerning her recent past and her proper care:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have brought you a half-dead little she-goat, recently snatched from the teeth of wolves. I hope that by your compassion [her] shelter will be insured, and that by your care, [she] will be cured, and that having cast aside the rough pelt of a goat she will be clothed with the soft wool of the lamb."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (tr.), ''The Dramas of Hrotsvit'' (1985), at 104. Wilson (tr.), ''The Plays of Hrotsvitha'' (1989), at 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later as death approaches her, Thaïs prays to God: "Thou who didst create me have mercy on me... ." Pafnutius also prays "that Thaïs be resurrected exactly as she was, a human being, and joining the white lambs may enter eternal joys."&lt;ref name="Wilson 1985"/&gt;

==Commentary==

"The philosophical ideas of [[harmony]] throughout creation" presented early in the play oblige us "to interpret the sinfulness of Thaïs not as the triumph of evil but as an imbalance or discord between parts of her created being. Hrotsvit looks at this woman, who acts as a volcano of lust... . What she sees is... the discord of her ''musica humana'' of body and soul... . Once Pafnutius has guided Thaïs to actions that bring her body and its behavior into agreement with her knowledge of God" there is "concord between body and soul as the essence of the human being."&lt;ref&gt;Wailes, ''Spirituality and Politics in the Works of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim'' (2006) at 188-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Hrotsvitha's play is not without subtlety.

{{See also|epistemological break}}

A '''paradigm shift''', a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], is a fundamental change in the basic [[concept]]s and [[experiment]]al practices of a [[:Category:Scientific disciplines|scientific discipline]]. Kuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a [[scientific revolution]], to the activity of [[normal science]], which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word "paradigm" is used in its original [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning, as "example".

The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by [[Modern Philosophy|modern philosophy]] since [[Immanuel Kant]] used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787). Kant used the phrase "revolution of the way of thinking" ({{lang|de|Revolution der Denkart}}) to refer to [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of [[Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis|mathematics]], [[Theory of relativity|physics]], and [[Life#Biology|biology]] revitalized interest in the question among scholars.

Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). As one commentator summarizes:

{{quote|text=Kuhn acknowledges having used the term "paradigm" in two different meanings. In the first one, "paradigm" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton’s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls "normal science". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term "paradigm", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/files/2014/03/Agamben-What-is-a-paradigm1.pdf |author= Agamben, Giorgio |authorlink= Giorgio Agamben |title=What is a Paradigm? |accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.

== Kuhnian paradigm shifts ==
[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kuhn used the [[Rabbit–duck illusion|duck-rabbit optical illusion]], made famous by [[Wittgenstein]], to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An [[epistemology|epistemological]] paradigm shift  was called a "scientific revolution" by epistemologist and [[history of science|historian of science]] Thomas Kuhn in his book ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.

A scientific revolution occurs, according to Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire [[World view|worldview]] in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.

There are anomalies for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject [[Karl Popper]]'s model of [[falsifiability]] as the key force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put it in the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|Mercury's perihelion]] more troubling than the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the [[logical positivists]] in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.

When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of ''crisis,'' according to Kuhn. During this crisis, new ideas, perhaps ones previously discarded, are tried. Eventually a ''new'' paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers, and an intellectual "battle" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm. Again, for early 20th century physics, the transition between the [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwellian]] [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetic worldview]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm, and instead involved a protracted set of "attacks," both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments, by both sides, with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run. Again, the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve: some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling, while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished. Some found [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling, while some questioned their accuracy and meaning. Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes, Kuhn said, using a quote from [[Max Planck]]: "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a ''scientific revolution'' or a ''paradigm shift''. It is often this final conclusion, the result of the long process, that is meant when the term ''paradigm shift'' is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.

In a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn,&lt;ref&gt;''Paradigm Shift: How Expert Opinions Keep Changing on Life, the Universe and Everything'', Imprint Academic 2015, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] describes the notion of the paradigm shift as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.

== Science and paradigm shift ==

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305–20. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (3rd ed.): p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another—that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes—so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "''On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme''" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973–1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

Paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system. 

In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote, "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science." (p.&amp;nbsp;12) Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a "paradigm shift" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.

Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} {{See also|Science and Theosophy#New paradigm}}

== Examples of paradigm shifts ==

=== Natural sciences ===
Some of the "classical cases" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:

* 1543 – The transition in [[cosmology]] from a [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic cosmology]] to a [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] one.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 154 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1543 – The acceptance of the work of [[Andreas Vesalius]], whose work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by [[Galen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=[Vesalius and De humani corporis fabrica: Galen's errors and the change of anatomy in the sixteenth century] | pmid=11625189 | journal=Hippokrates (Helsinki) | pages=98–112 | last1 = Joutsivuo | first1 = T| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1687 – The transition in [[mechanics]] from [[Aristotelian mechanics]] to [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 148 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1783 – The acceptance of [[Lavoisier]]'s theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of [[phlogiston theory]], known as the [[chemical revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradigm Shifts: Technology &amp; Culture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
* The transition in [[optics]] from [[geometrical optics]] to [[physical optics]] with [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s wave theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1826 – The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trudeau|first1=Richard J|title=The non-Euclidean revolution|date=1987|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1859 – The revolution in [[evolution]] from goal-directed change to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1880 - The [[germ theory of disease]] began overtaking Galen's [[miasma theory]].
* 1905 – The development of [[quantum mechanics]], which replaced [[classical mechanics]] at microscopic scales.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 83–84, 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1887 to 1905 – The transition from the [[luminiferous aether]] present in [[space]] to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in [[spacetime]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1919 – The transition between the worldview of [[Newtonian gravity]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[General Relativity]].

=== Social sciences ===
In Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a "tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuhn | first= Thomas N. |authorlink= Thomas Kuhn |editor1-last= Lakatos |editor1-first= Imre |editor2-last= Musgrave |editor2-first= Alan |editor1-link= Imre Lakatos |editor2-link= Alan Musgrave |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |edition= second |origyear= 1970 |year= 1972 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-09623-2 |page= 6 |chapter= Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

* The movement known as the [[cognitive revolution]] moved away from [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] approaches to [[Psychology|psychological]] study and the acceptance of [[cognition]] as central to studying human behaviour.
* The [[Keynesian revolution]] is typically viewed as a major shift in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Laidler]]. ''Fabricating the Keynesian Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Say's Law]] dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbraith |first=John Kenneth |year=1975 |title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went |page=223 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-19843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzdkAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, [[John A.

* Later, the movement for [[monetarism]] over [[Keynesian]]ism marked a second divisive shift. Monetarists held that fiscal policy was not effective for stabilizing [[inflation]], that it was solely a monetary phenomenon, in contrast to the [[Keynesian]] view of the time was that both fiscal and monetary policy were important.  Keynesians later adopted much of the monetarists' view of the [[quantity theory of money]] and shifting [[Phillips curve]], theories they initially rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Michael D., Schwartz, Anna J.

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ''Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* First proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in 1879, the [[laryngeal theory]] in [[Indo-European linguistics]] postulated the existence of "laryngeal" consonants in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), a theory that was confirmed by the discovery of the [[Hittite language]] in the early 20th century. The theory has since been accepted by the vast majority of linguists, paving the way for the [[internal reconstruction]] of the syntax and grammatical rules of PIE and is considered one of the most significant developments in linguistics since the initial discovery of the [[Indo-European language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indo European Linguistics: An Introduction|author=James Clackson|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied sciences ===
More recently, paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences:
* In medicine, the transition from "clinical judgment" to [[evidence-based medicine]]
* In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=Paul|title=The two paradigms of software development research|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=January 2018|volume=156|pages=68–89|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2018.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
In the later part of the 1990s, 'paradigm shift' emerged as a [[buzzword]], popularized as [[marketing speak]] and appearing more frequently in print and publication.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999). http://www.robertfulford.com/Paradigm.html Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Mind The Gaffe'', author [[Larry Trask]] advises readers to refrain from using it, and to use caution when reading anything that contains the phrase.  It is referred to in several articles and books&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6275610-1.html Cnet.com's Top 10 Buzzwords]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Complete Idiot's Guide to A Smart Vocabulary"&gt;[http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp "The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Smart Vocabulary" pp. 142–43, author: Paul McFedries publisher: Alpha; 1st edition (May 7, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215012026/http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp |date=December 15, 2007 }} {{ISBN|978-0-02-863997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as abused and overused to the point of becoming meaningless.

== Other uses ==
The term "paradigm shift" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern—a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:
* M. L. Handa, a professor of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. [[University of Toronto]], Canada, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines what he means by "paradigm" and introduces the idea of a "social paradigm". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as "paradigm shift". In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy ([[Carlota Perez]]; earlier work only on technological paradigms by [[Giovanni Dosi]]). This concept is linked to [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s idea of [[creative destruction]]. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.&lt;ref http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/4/779.full.pdf&gt;2009. "Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms", Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 34, No.1, pp. 185–202&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two photographs of the Earth from space, "[[Earthrise]]" (1968) and "[[The Blue Marble]]" (1972), are thought to have helped to usher in the [[environmentalist]] movement which gained great prominence in the years immediately following distribution of those images.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Christopher H. "Global Warming and the Problem of Policy Innovation: Lessons from the Early Environmental Movement". 2009. http://www.lclark.edu/org/envtl/objects/39-2_Schroeder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Stewart Brand#NASA image of Earth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hans Küng]] applies Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm change to the entire history of Christian thought and theology. He identifies six historical "macromodels": 1) the apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity, 2) the Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period, 3) the medieval Roman Catholic paradigm, 4) the Protestant (Reformation) paradigm, 5) the modern Enlightenment paradigm, and 6) the emerging ecumenical paradigm. He also discusses five analogies between natural science and theology in relation to paradigm shifts. Küng addresses paradigm change in his books, Paradigm Change in Theology&lt;ref&gt;Kung, Hans &amp; Tracy, David (ed). ''Paradigm Change in Theology''. New York: Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''.&lt;ref&gt;Küng, Hans. ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''. New York: Anchor Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Barth''' (also '''Ernst Emil Paul Barth'''; born 1 August 1858 in Baruthe near [[Oels]], [[Silesia]]; died 30 September 1922 in [[Leipzig]]) was a German [[sociology|sociological]] writer.

==Biography==
He edited the ''Vierteljahrsschrift für wissenschaftliche Philosophie'' (Quarterly Journal for Scholarly Philosophy), and was extraordinary professor in the [[University of Leipzig]]. He wrote on philosophical subjects, but is known above all for his ''Philosophie der Geschichte als Sociologie'' (Philosophy of History as Sociology), the first volume of which appeared in 1897. This book is one of the most authoritative historical sketches of the development of sociological theory which had been published in Germany. Among Barth's other writings were:
* ''Geschichtsphilosophie Hegels und die Hegelianer bis auf Marx und Hartmann'' ([[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history and the Hegelians up to [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|Hartmann]]; 1890)
* ''[[Tiberius Gracchus]]'' (2d ed., 1893)
* ''Beweggründe des sittlichen Handelns'' (Motives for acting ethically; 1889)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3464">Fr.  '''Peadar Livingstone''' (1932 – 8 December 1987) was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] in the [[Diocese of Clogher (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Clogher, Ireland]].

==Biography ==
Peadar Livingstone was born in 1932 and raised in [[Castleblayney]], [[County Monaghan]]. His father was a jeweller. He entered [[St. Macartan's College]], Monaghan in 1945. Following his secondary school education, he enter [[Maynooth College]] to study for the priesthood for the diocese. He studied Celtic languages — Gaelic and Welsh.  He then completed a second degree in theology.  He was ordained a priest in 1957.  Fr. Livingstone continued his studies at Maynooth; however, he was recalled to the diocese in 1957 before he completed his Higher Diploma in Education.  He was appointed to the teaching staff of [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's College]] in [[Enniskillen]], a [[Diocesan College (Definition)|diocesan seminary]] in Northern Ireland.  At St. Michael's, he taught Irish, history and religious education.

Fr. Livingstone was a renowned scholar in both the Irish language and local history.  In 1969, he published ''The Fermanagh Story'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Fermanagh Story'': a documented history of the County Fermanagh from the earliest times to the present day - Enniskillen: Cumann Seanchais Chlochair, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; a comprehensive history of the county of Fermanagh.  In 1979, his work ''The Monaghan Story''&lt;ref&gt;''The Monaghan Story'': a documented history of the County Monaghan from the earliest times to 1976, was published. Enniskillen: Clogher Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; was published. He also wrote a regular column for ''[[Fermanagh Herald|The Fermanagh Herald]]'', a local newspaper, under the name "Ernesense."

In 1977, Fr. Livingstone was appointed president of St. Michael's College where he introduced some disciplinary measures, including mandatory uniforms.  He was appointed a curate to the parish of Donaghmoyne in 1977.  In 1987, he was assigned to the parish of Clogher in County Tyrone where he died suddenly that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clogher Record|date=1987|publisher=Cloger Diocesan Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2noMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Peadar+Livingstone%22+1932&amp;dq=%22Peadar+Livingstone%22+1932&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm35-Du_TUAhVV0WMKHZSwBh4Q6AEIJzAB|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en|quote=The sudden death of Fr Peadar Livingstone at Clogher.

The '''[[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']]''' in 1912 attracted so much controversy that several alternative theories about its sinking have gained support.

One version is that the sunken ship was actually the [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']], near-identical sister-ship of the ''Titanic'', which was the subject of a large insurance claim, and that the two vessels were secretly switched before the voyage. Another was that the ''Titanic''{{'}}s owner, [[J.P. Morgan]], wanted to eliminate several prominent bankers who were opposing his plan for the creation of a U.S. central bank.

==Accepted version==
The ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg, leaving a hole in her starboard side long enough to flood her front compartments to above the water line. The ship then sank, causing about 1500 fatalities.

==Pack ice==
In 2003, Captain L. M. Collins, a former member of the Ice Pilotage Service, published ''The Sinking of the Titanic: The Mystery Solved'' proposing, based upon his own experience of ice navigation and witness statements given at the two post-disaster enquiries, that what the ''Titanic'' hit was not an iceberg but low-lying [[pack ice]]. He based his conclusion upon three main pieces of evidence.

#At 11.30pm on the night of the sinking, the two lookouts spotted what they believed to be haze on the horizon, extending approximately 20° on either side of the ship's bow, despite there being no other reports of haze at any time. Collins believes that what they saw was not haze but a strip of pack ice, {{convert|3|-|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} ahead of the ship.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite book | author=L.M. Collins| title=The Sinking of the Titanic: The Mystery Solved | publisher= Souvenir Press| year=2003 | isbn=0-285-63711-8 | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The ice was variously reported as {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} high by the lookouts, {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} high by Quartermaster Rowe on the  deck, and only very low in the water by [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Boxhall]], on the starboard side near the darkened bridge. Collins believes that this was due to 'an optical phenomenon that is well known to ice navigators' where the flat sea and extreme cold distort the appearance of objects near the waterline, making them appear to be the height of the ship's lights, about {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the surface near the bow, and {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} high alongside the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;
#A ship such as the ''Titanic'' turned by pivoting about a point approximately a third of the ship's length from the bow, with the result that with her rudder hard over, she could not have avoided crushing her entire [[starboard]] side into an iceberg were such a collision to occur, with the result that 'the hull and possibly the superstructure on the starboard side would have been rent.  In all probability, the ship would have flooded, capsized, and sunk within minutes.'&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;
==''Olympic'' exchange theory==
One of the most controversial&lt;ref name="Beveridge-Hall"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bruce Beveridge and Steve Hall| title=Olympic &amp; Titanic: The Truth Behind the Conspiracy | publisher= Infinity Publishing| year=2004 | isbn=978-0-7414-1949-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chirnside"&gt;{{cite web | title=''Olympic &amp; Titanic'' – An Analysis of the Robin Gardiner Conspiracy Theory| url=http://www.markchirnside.co.uk/pdfs/Conspiracy_Dissertation.pdf|format=PDF|year=2006| author=Mark Chirnside|accessdate=4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and complex theories was put forward by [[Robin Gardiner]] in his book, ''Titanic: The Ship That Never Sank?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robin Gardiner| title=Titanic: The Ship That Never Sank? | publisher= Ian Allan Publishing | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-7110-2633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Gardiner draws on several events and coincidences that occurred in the months, days, and hours leading up to the sinking of the ''Titanic'', and concludes that the ship that sank was in fact ''Titanic''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] {{RMS|Olympic||2}}, disguised as ''Titanic'', as an [[Insurance fraud|insurance scam]] by her owners, the International Mercantile Marine Group, controlled by American financier [[J.P. Morgan]] that had acquired the [[White Star Line]] in 1902.

''Olympic'' was the slightly older sister of ''Titanic'', built alongside the more famous vessel but launched in October 1910. Her exterior profile was nearly identical to ''Titanic'', save for minor details such as the number of portholes on the forward C decks of the ships, the spacing of the windows on the B decks, and the forward section of the A deck promenade on ''Titanic'' that had been enclosed only a few weeks before she set sail on her ill-fated maiden voyage. Both ships were built with linoleum floors, but shortly before she was due to set sail [[J. Bruce Ismay]], managing director of the White Star Line, inexplicably ordered the floors aboard ''Titanic'' carpeted over.

On 20 September 1911, the ''Olympic'' was involved in a collision with the Royal Navy Warship {{HMS|Hawke|1891|6}} in the Brambles Channel in [[Southampton Water]] while under the command of a [[harbour pilot]]. The two ships were close enough to each other that ''Olympic's'' motion drew the ''Hawke'' into her aft starboard side, causing extensive damage to the liner – both above and below its waterline (HMS Hawke was fitted with a re-inforced 'ram' below the waterline, purposely designed to cause maximum damage to enemy ships). An Admiralty inquiry assigned blame to the ''Olympic'', despite numerous eyewitness accounts to the contrary.

Gardiner's theory plays out in this historical context. ''Olympic'' was found to be at blame in the collision (which, according to Gardiner, had damaged the central turbine's mountings and bent the [[keel]], giving the ship a slight permanent list to port). Because of this finding, White Star's insurers [[Lloyd's of London]] allegedly refused to pay out on the claim. White Star's [[flagship]] would also be out of action during the extensive repairs, and the ''Titanic''{{'}}s completion date, which was already behind schedule due to ''Olympic''{{'}}s return to the yard after her loss of a propeller blade, would have to be delayed. All this would amount to a serious financial loss for the company. Gardiner proposes that, to make sure at least one vessel would be earning money, the badly damaged ''Olympic'' was patched up and then converted to become the ''Titanic''. The real ''Titanic'' when complete would then quietly enter service as the ''Olympic''.

The ''Titanic'' indeed had a list to port leaving Southampton. Inadequate trimming of cargo and bunkers would likely result in such and the crew seems to have demonstrated a lack of proficiency on several occasions. A list to port was noted by several ''Titanic'' survivors including [[Lawrence Beesley]] who wrote in his book about the sinking: "I then called the attention of our table to the way the ''Titanic'' listed to port (I had noticed this before), and we watched the skyline through the portholes as we sat at the purser's table in the saloon." (The dining saloon windows were double rows of portholes covered on the inside with screens of leaded decorative glass with no clear view of the outdoors.) This was echoed by survivor Norman Chambers, who testified that after the collision: "However, there was then a slight list to starboard, with probably a few degrees in pitch; and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon, I decided to remain up."

Gardiner states that few parts of either ship bore the name, other than the easily removed lifeboats, bell, compass binnacle, and name plates. Everything else was standard White Star issue and was interchangeable between the two ships, and other vessels in the White Star fleet. While all other White Star Line Ships had their name engraved into the hull, the Titanic alone had its name riveted over top.

The plan, Gardiner suggests, was to dispose of the ''Olympic'', which had allegedly been damaged beyond economic repair in a way that would allow White Star to collect the full insured value of a brand new ship. He supposes that the [[seacock]]s were to be opened at sea to slowly flood the ship. If numerous ships were stationed nearby to take off the passengers, the shortage of lifeboats would not matter as the ship would sink slowly and the boats could make several trips to the rescuers.

Gardiner uses as evidence the length of ''Titanic''{{'}}s sea trials. ''Olympic''{{'}}s trials in 1910 took two days, including several high speed runs, but ''Titanic''{{'}}s trials reportedly only lasted for one day, with (Gardiner alleges) no working over half-speed. Gardiner says this was because the patched-up hull could not take any long periods of high speed. Perhaps this was due to the fact that ''Titanic'' as a nearly identical twin sister of the ''Olympic'' was expected to handle exactly the same, or perhaps the Board of Trade inspectors were in on the scheme.

Gardiner maintains that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) was on the bridge because he was one of the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a watch out for the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the ''Titanic'' did not strike an iceberg, but an [[International Mercantile Marine Co.|IMM]] rescue ship that was drifting on station with its lights out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the ''Titanic'' because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the ''Titanic''.

Gardiner further hypothesises that the ship that was hit by the ''Titanic'' was the one seen by the ''[[SS Californian]]'' firing distress rockets, and that this explains the perceived inaction of the ''Californian'' (which traditionally is seen as failing to come to the rescue of the ''Titanic'' after sighting its distress rockets). Gardiner's hypothesis is that the ''Californian'', another IMM ship, was not expecting rockets but a rendezvous. The ice on the deck of the ''Titanic'' is explained by Gardiner as ice from the rigging of both the ''Titanic'' and the mystery ship she hit. As for the true ''Titanic'', Gardiner alleges that she spent 25 years in service as the ''Olympic'' and was scrapped in 1935.

Researchers Bruce Beveridge and Steve Hall took issue with many of Gardiner's claims in their book, ''Olympic and Titanic: The Truth Behind the Conspiracy''.&lt;ref name="Beveridge-Hall"/&gt; Author Mark Chirnside has also raised serious questions about the switch theory.&lt;ref name="Chirnside"/&gt;

==Purposely sunk==

Some conspiracy theorists believe that the ''Titanic'' was sunk on purpose to eliminate opposition to the creation of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. Some of the wealthiest men in the world were aboard the Titanic for its maiden voyage, several of whom, including [[John Jacob Astor IV]], [[Benjamin Guggenheim]], and [[Isidor Straus]], were allegedly opposed to the creation of a U.S. [[central bank]]. All three men died during the sinking. Conspiracy theorists suggest that [[J.P. Morgan]], the legendary 74-year-old financier who set up the investment banking firm that still bears his name, arranged to have the men board the ship and then sink it to eliminate them. Morgan, nicknamed the “Napoleon of Wall Street”, had helped create [[General Electric]], [[U.S. Steel]], and [[International Harvester]], and was credited with almost single-handedly saving the U.S. banking system during the [[Panic of 1907]]. Morgan did have a hand in the creation of the Federal Reserve, and owned the [[International Mercantile Marine]], which owned the White Star Line, and thus the Titanic.&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/seven-famous-people-who-missed-the-titanic-101902418/#PODpDOtwrWUc0xYc.99|title=Seven Famous People Who Missed the Titanic|last=Daugherty|first=Greg|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan, who had attended the Titanic's launching in 1911, had a personal suite aboard the ship with his own private [[promenade deck]] and a bath equipped with specially designed cigar holders. He was reportedly booked on the ship's maiden voyage but instead canceled the trip and remained at the French resort of [[Aix-les-Bains]] to enjoy his morning massages and sulfur baths.&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"/&gt; His last-minute cancellation has fueled speculation among conspiracy theorists that he knew her fate.

==Closed watertight doors==
Another theory involves ''Titanic''{{'}}s watertight doors. This theory suggests that if these doors had been opened, the ''Titanic'' would have settled on an even keel and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments,{{clarify|date=May 2012}} thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No. 4 would have resulted in capsizing of the ''Titanic'', which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking.&lt;ref name=BedHack&gt;Hacket C. and Bedford, J.G. (1996). ''The Sinking of the S.S. Titanic – Investigated by Modern Techniques''. The Northern Ireland Branch of the Institute of Marine Engineers and the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, 26 March 1996 and the Joint Meeting of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects and the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, 10 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms.&lt;ref name=BedHack/&gt; Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.

Later, in a 1998 documentary titled ''Titanic: Secrets Revealed'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158274/|title=Titanic: Secrets Revealed (TV Movie 1998)|author=famousgir1|date=3 April 1998|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Discovery Channel]] ran model simulations which also rebutted this theory. The simulations indicated that opening ''Titanic''{{'}}s watertight doors would have caused the ship to capsize earlier than she actually sank by more than one half hour, confirming the findings of Bedford and Hacket.

==Expansion joints theory==
[[File:Titanic-sinking.png|thumb|Breakup suspected by Long]]
''Titanic'' researchers continued to debate the causes and mechanics of the ship{{'}}s breakup. According to his book, ''[[A Night to Remember (book)|A Night to Remember]]'', [[Walter Lord]] described ''Titanic'' as assuming an "absolutely perpendicular" position shortly before its final plunge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Walter Lord| title=A Night to Remember| publisher= Bantam| year=1956 | page=79 | isbn=0553010603}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view remained largely unchallenged even after the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck's discovery]] by [[Robert Ballard]] in 1985 confirmed that ''Titanic'' had broken in two pieces at or near the surface; paintings by noted marine artist [[Ken Marschall]] and in [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', both of which depicted the ship attaining a steep angle prior to the breakup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Don Lynch and Ken Marschall| title=Titanic: An Illustrated History| publisher= Hyperion| year=1992| isbn=1562829181 | pages = 136, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most researchers acknowledged that ''Titanic''{{'}}s after expansion joint—designed to allow for flexing of the hull in a seaway—played little to no role in the ship's breakup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert D.

In 2005, a History Channel expedition to the wreck site scrutinised two large sections of ''Titanic''{{'}}s keel, which constituted the portion of the ship's bottom from immediately below the site of the break. With assistance from naval architect Roger Long, the team analysed the wreckage and developed a new break-up scenario&lt;ref name="Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.titanic2006.com |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] |title=The Break Up |accessdate=2008-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103110923/http://www.titanic2006.com/ |archivedate=3 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was publicised in the television documentary ''Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces'' in 2006. One hallmark of this new theory was the claim that ''Titanic''{{'}}s angle at the time of the breakup was far less than had been commonly assumed—according to Long, no greater than 11°.
 
Long also suspected that ''Titanic''{{'}}s breakup may have begun with the premature failure of the ship's after expansion joint, and ultimately exacerbated the loss of life by causing ''Titanic'' to sink faster than anticipated. In 2006, the History Channel sponsored dives on ''Titanic''{{'}}s younger sister ship, {{HMHS|Britannic||2}}, which verified that the design of ''Britannic''{{'}}s expansion joints was superior to that incorporated in the ''Titanic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=titanic-model.com|url=http://titanic-model.com/articles/markchirnside3/index.shtml|title=The Olympic’ Class’s Expansion Joints|author=Mark Chirnside|access-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131220722/http://titanic-model.com/articles/markchirnside3/index.shtml#|archive-date=31 January 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further explore Long's theory, the History Channel commissioned a new computer simulation by JMS Engineering. The simulation, whose results were featured in the 2007 documentary ''Titanic's [[Achilles' heel|Achilles Heel]]'', partially refuted Long's suspicions by demonstrating that ''Titanic''{{'}}s expansion joints were strong enough to deal with any and all stresses the ship could reasonably be expected to encounter in service and, during the sinking, actually outperformed their design specifications.&lt;ref name="Ship Structure Committee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipstructure.org/case_studies/RMSTitanic.pdf|format=PDF|title=RMS Titanic: Complete Hull Failure Following Collision with Iceberg|author=JMS Engineering study|accessdate=2012-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909163257/http://www.shipstructure.org/case_studies/RMSTitanic.pdf#|archive-date=9 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, most important is that the expansion joints were part of the superstructure, which was situated above the strength deck (B-deck) and therefore above the top of the structural hull girder. Thus, the expansion joints had no meaning for the support of the hull. They played no role in the breaking of the hull. They simply opened up and parted as the hull flexed or broke beneath them.

Brad Matsen's 2008 book ''Titanic's Last Secrets'' endorses the expansion joint theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Titanic's Last Secrets|author=Brad Matsen|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|date=October 2008|isbn=9780446582056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common oversight is the fact that the collapse of the first funnel at a relatively shallow angle occurred when the forward expansion joint, over which several funnel stays crossed, opened as the hull was beginning to stress. The opening of the joint stretched and snapped the stays. The forward momentum of the ship as it took a sudden lurch forward and downward sent the unsupported funnel toppling onto the starboard bridge wing.

One theory that would support the fracturing of the hull is that the ''Titanic'' partly grounded on the shelf of ice below the waterline as she collided with the iceberg, perhaps damaging the keel and underbelly. Later during the sinking, it was noticed that Boiler Room #4 flooded from below the floor grates rather than from over the top of the watertight bulkhead. This would be consistent with additional damage along the keel compromising the integrity of the hull.

== Fire in coal bunker ==
A fire began in one of ''Titanic'''s [[coal bunker]]s approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/titanic-doomed-by-fire-raging-below-decks-says-new-theory-808472.html Titanic doomed by fire raging below decks, says new theory] – The Independent. 12 April 2008.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4575">In [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], '''Rheda''' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] from [[Old English]] ''*Hrêðe'' or ''*Hrêða'', possibly meaning "the famous" or "the victorious"&lt;ref name=SIMEK159&gt;Simek (2007:159).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[goddess]] connected with the month '"Rhedmonth"' (from Old English ''*Hrēþmōnaþ''). Rheda is attested solely by [[Bede]] in his 8th century work ''[[De temporum ratione]]''. While the name of the goddess appears in Bede's Latin manuscript as ''Rheda'', it is reconstructed into Old English as ''*Hrēþe'' and is sometimes modernly [[anglicization|anglicized]] as '''Hretha''' (also "Hrethe" or "Hrede"). ''Hrēþmōnaþ'' is one of three events (apart from the [[Weekday names#Germanic languages|days of the week]]) that refer to deities in the Anglo-Saxon calendar—the other two being ''[[Ēostre|Ēostermōnaþ]]'' and ''[[Mōdraniht]]''.

==''De temporum ratione''==
In chapter 15 of his work ''[[De temporum ratione]]'', Bede provides information about English months and celebrations. Bede records that ''Hrēþmōnaþ'' is analogous to March, and details that "Hrethmonath is named for their goddess Hretha, to whom they [[Blót|sacrificed]] at this time" (''Rhed-monath a Dea illorum Rheda, cui in illo sacrificabant, nominatur…''). Bede notes that ''Hrēþmōnaþ'' occurs between ''Solmōnaþ'' (February), so named due to the offerings of cakes to the gods during the month, and ''Ēostermōnaþ'' (April), named after the goddess [[Ēostre]].&lt;ref name=WALLISANDLATIN&gt;English translation by Wallis (1999:53–54). Original Latin from Giles (1843:179).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
19th-century scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] notes, while no other source mentions the goddesses Rheda and Ēostre, saddling Bede, a "father of the church, who everywhere keeps heathenism at a distance, and tells us less than he knows" with the invention of the goddesses Rheda and Ēostre would be uncritical, and that "there is nothing improbable in them, nay the first of them [Rheda] is justified by clear traces in the vocabularies of the [[Germanic peoples|German tribes]]." Grimm proposes a connection between ''*Hrēþe'' and the [[Old High German]] female personal name ''Hruada''. Grimm theorizes that the Old High German form of the goddess name ''Rheda'' was ''*Hrouda''.&lt;ref name=GRIMM288-290&gt;Grimm (1882:288–290).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Simek]] notes that Grimm's derivation of the name Rheda means that Rheda "could have a similar meaning to the eponymous [[Roman god]] of the same month, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]."&lt;ref name=SIMEK159/&gt; David Raoul Wilson comments that while "Bede gives us no clues as to the rituals involved during ''Rhedmonath'' and ''Eosturmonath'', it is reasonable to assume that they related to the beginning of [[Spring (season)|spring]], the new growing season, and fertility."&lt;ref name=WILSON36&gt;Wilson (1992:36).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern influence==
Appendix D of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' contains a presentation of the [[Shire calendar]], the calendar used by the fictional society of [[Hobbits]]. The calendar is generally based on the Anglo-Saxon one, and its third month is called "Rethe", modeled after ''Hrēþmōnaþ'', projected into the form the word would have taken in Modern English.&lt;ref name=STAVER209&gt;Staver (2005:209).&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Bethlehem star|star over Bethlehem]] was a luminous flying saucer

Dione believed that [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] could track a particular person on earth and beam in thoughts to control them by using "God's radio frequency". Dione claimed that the God was upset with [[Russia]] because of its atheism, so God manipulated [[Hitler]] by sending Hitler electromagnetic brain signals to overthrow the Russian Empire. Dione also claimed in the book that Jesus did not perform any miracles in the Bible, the miracles were actually due to mind manipulation caused by alien technology. According to Dione, “By the use of hypnotism He (Saucerian God) created the twisted, blind and insane subjects Jesus was to cure at a later date.”

'''Talavera de la Reina'''&lt;ref&gt;''Talavera of the Queen'' distinguishes it from Talavera, Lleida, in Segarra, [[Catalonia]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a city and [[municipality]] in the western part of the [[province of Toledo]], which in turn is part of the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Castile–La Mancha]], Spain. It is the second-largest population center in [[Castile–La Mancha]]. Its population of 83,303&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ine.es/nomen2/index.do?accion=busquedaDesdeHome&amp;nombrePoblacion=Talavera%20de%20la%20Reina Instituto Nacional de Estadística'', Spanish National Statistics Institute].&lt;/ref&gt; makes it the fourth largest town in the region of Castilla la Mancha, after Albacete, Guadalajara and Toledo.

The city is settled along the river [[Tagus]] (Tajo in Spanish) at a broad bank. There are two islands in the center of the city called Isla Grande and Chamelo Island. The city is surrounded by two ranges of mountains, in the north the Sierra de San Vicente, and in the south Montes de Toledo.

The city is divided in two by the river [[Tagus]]. The northern part is the larger and more populated; both parts are connected by three bridges, one of them built in the Middle Ages.

Talavera has a transition climate between the harsher continentalized mediterranean climate of the central table land and the mild-winter mediterranean climate of nearby Extremadura; Summers are hot and extremely dry and winters are moderately mild cool. Overall the climate is slightly warmer than Madrid. The area is very fertile with Mediterranean forests, elms, olive trees and cork forests.

==Pottery==
{{stack|[[File:TalaveraDeLaReina Azulejos.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The famous Talavera pottery]]}}
The city is internationally known for its [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], which [[Philip II of Spain]] used as tiled revetments in many of his works, such as the monastery of [[El Escorial]]. The nickname of Talavera de la Reina is 'The City of Pottery' (''La Ciudad de la Cerámica'', in Spanish). [[Mexico]]'s famous [[talavera (pottery)|Talavera]] pottery was named after the city.

==Toponymy==
[[File:Monasterio de San Benito 2 - Talavera.jpg|thumb|left|An [[albarrana tower]] of the ancient city walls]]
There are remnants of prehistoric cultures in the area. The village was founded by the [[Celt]]s as a ford of the Tagus. The first mention of the city (with the name ''Aebura'') occurs in [[Livy]]'s  description of a battle between the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and the Carpetanoi, a [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] tribe.  After the Roman conquest of Hispania, it was known as ''Caesarobriga'', one of many Celtic [[toponym]]s preserved in Roman Hispania, with a name connoting "fortified" that was extended to many non-fortified rowns: "Caesarburg".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_15/garcia_alonso_6_15.html Juan Luis García Alonso, "-Briga Toponyms in the Iberian Peninsula," ''e-Keltoi'' '''6''']&lt;/ref&gt; Caesarobriga served as an important center for agriculture and ceramics in the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE  During the Visigothic period, Talavera reverted to a variant of its [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] name: ''Elbora'' or ''Ebora''.  Its modern name is derived from ''Talabayra'', the Muslim rendering of this Visigothic name.  The city was conquered by Muslim forces in 713 and conquered by Christian forces under [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] in 1083.

Talavera de la Reina was founded at the confluence of the rivers [[Alberche]] and [[Tagus]]. This area of great ecological wealth was the settlement of Celtic people who built the most ancient ruins of the area.

===Roman Empire and Visigothic Age===
During the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the name of the city was Caesarobriga. In 182 BCE [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 179 BCE)|Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]] conquered the city, establishing it as part of the Roman province of Lusitania as a city that would pay a stipend, and as the capital of an extended area included in the legal convent of the city of [[Emerita Augusta]]. The leader [[Viriato]], in his war against the Romans, lived in this territory between 145 and 139 BCE.  In this period Talavera de la Reina was a rich city with cattle markets and commercial exchange. Christianity came early to the city, and with the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] the Visigoths established in the city. Talavera was known then as (Aküis) or (Aibura). In the year 602, King [[Liuva II]] made a present to the city: the sculpture of the Virgin Mary, who was from then to the present day the symbol of the Christians in Talavera de la Reina, and the substitute for the goddess Ceres. In honour of the goddess Ceres, Talaverian Romans celebrated the spring festival called [[Mondas]], which is still celebrated for the Virgin Mary.

===Muslim conquest===
The [[al-Andalus|Muslims]] conquered Talavera in 712. They built new walls and a castle in Talavera. They also brought the use of fountains, water mills and new products brought from Africa and Asia. The fertile soil produced quality vegetables, fruits and grass for animal feed. The markets gained new strength, and the population, a mixture of Christians, Muslims and Jews, lived in harmony for some centuries.  Medina Al Talavayra took part in different wars between the kingdoms of Spain, becoming allied with [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] and [[Badajoz]]. Talavera was the capital of an ephemeral kingdom or ''[[taifa of Talavera|taifa]]'' (principality). After the city was reconquered in the 11th Century by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI]], it was an important trade center in medieval Spain.

===High Middle Ages===
King [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] gave the royal privilege to hold two royal markets each year.

===15th and 16th centuries===
During the 15th and 16th centuries, Talavera achieved great recognition, thanks to its pottery. 
Wonderful pieces of pottery and Talavera tiles are found in the main museums of the world and in the most luxurious palaces all over Europe.

Talaverian people participated in the conquest of America, like [[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]], [[Juan de Orellana]] and Jofrén de Loaisa.

Other important Talaverian people were [[Hernando de Talavera]], [[Isabella I of Castile]]'s confessor, and the Admiral [[Francisco Verdugo]]. 
The beginning of the 16th century saw the release of the most important theater work in Spanish literature, ''The  Tragicomedy of Calixto and Melibea'', or ''[[La Celestina|Celestina]]'', written by the Talaverian mayor [[Fernando de Rojas]].

===17th century===
During this century the city lived in a golden age of arts and culture. Its main exponent is the father of Spanish History, [[Juan de Mariana]], who wrote several books about history, law and politics, and who was very important for French revolutionary theories.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Upon the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]] in November 1700, two powerful nations fought for the Spanish Crown.  Talavera supported [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]'s French faction, which was the winner.
In 1750 the king founded the Royal Seeds Factories in Talavera, and 4,000 people worked there.

The war of independence against Napoleon's army had great consequences for Talavera.  On July 27 and July 28, 1809 the [[Battle of Talavera]] took place between the Anglo-Spanish army and the French.  During the fight the city was hardly damaged.  The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]'s army expelled the French from the city.

===Civil War and Franco period===
The city was getting large during the beginning of the 20th century.  The railroad brought new opportunities for improvement.  In 1931 the Republic was the new political system in Spain. Talavera changed its name to Talavera del Tajo.  On July 18, 1936, when the Nationalists had risen in arms, the Republicans opened a period of terror in Talavera, killing people.  On September 3 the Nationalist army [[Battle of Talavera de la Reina (1936)|conquered Talavera]] and reopened the terror, this time against communists and socialists. During the rest of the war Talavera de la Reina was damaged by the Republican bombing attacks.

During the Franco period there was a recovery project by the [[Instituto Nacional de Colonización]] that created a large irrigated zone in Talavera, following which two new municipalities were created, called [[Talavera la Nueva]] and [[Alberche del Caudillo]], the latter located in neighboring [[Calera y Chozas]] municipal term. During the 1960s a baby boom caused an increase in the population, added to by the immigrants coming from the nearby villages and poor areas of Extremadura.

[[File:Talavera pzatrinidad.jpg|thumb|left|Trinidad Square]]

===Today===
In 1975 Franco died, and democracy came to Spain. Talavera's first democratic mayor tried to create the province of Talavera, but the idea was not successful.  The next mayor, Pablo Tello from the Socialist Party, made large projects such as the Alameda Park.

In 1989 a feeling of marginalization enveloped the city, and a group of people called "Nosotros Talavera" (we Talavera) started fighting for the creation of a University Campus and other projects for the city.

The University started classes in 1994.

==Transportation==
The city is located at the intersection of [[Autovía A-5]] (part of [[European route E90]]) and N-502. It is on the railway route between [[Madrid]] and [[Badajoz]]. Talavera de la Reina's city bus system is [http://www.eborabus.com/ Eborabus].

==Notable people==
Talavera de la Reina is the birthplace of footballer [[Manu Trigueros]] who plays for [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] and poet [[Rafael Morales (poet)|Rafael Morales]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23709">'''Theodore H. "Ted" Draper''' (September 11, 1912 – February 21, 2006) was an American [[historian]] and political writer. Draper is best known for the 14 books he completed during his life, including work regarded as seminal on the formative period of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], the [[Cuban Revolution]], and the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. Draper was a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the 1990 recipient of the [[Herbert Feis]] Award for Nonacademically Affiliated Historians from the [[American Historical Association]].

==Biography==

===Early years===

Theodore Draper was born Theodore Dubinsky on September 11, 1912, one of four children.&lt;ref name=TimeObit&gt;Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/22/national/22DRAPER.html?ex=1298264400&amp;en=02fae410a9cf122b&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss "Theodore Draper, Freelance Historian, Is Dead at 93,"] ''New York Times,'' February 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother was [[Hal Draper]], who became a noted Marxist historian. Theodore's parents were ethnic [[Jews]] who emigrated to [[New York City]] from [[Ukraine]], then part of the [[Russian empire]].&lt;ref name=PostObit&gt;Adam Bernstein, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/22/AR2006022202411.html "Scholar, Historian Theodore Draper,"] ''Washington Post,'' February 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Samuel Dubinsky, was the manager of a shirt factory who died in 1924.&lt;ref name=TimeObit /&gt; His mother, Annie Kornblatt Dubinsky, ran a candy store to make ends meet following her husband's death.&lt;ref name=TimeObit /&gt;

He was raised in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and graduated from the borough's [[Boys and Girls High School|Boys High School]]. His mother insisted they change the family name to the "American-sounding" surname "Draper" when Ted was 20 so that the children could avoid [[anti-semitism]] during pursuit of their careers.&lt;ref name=TimeObit /&gt;

===Political career===

In 1930, Draper enrolled at the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]], better known as "City College."&lt;ref name=PrefaceIX&gt;Theodore Draper, "Preface" to the paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia.'' New York: Vintage Books, 1986; pg. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that he joined the [[National Student League]] (NSL), a [[mass organization]] of the [[Communist Party USA]] targeted at organizing and mobilizing college students.&lt;ref name=PrefaceIX /&gt; This marked the start of a decade during which Draper chose to remain reliably within the Communist Party's orbit.

Draper later recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"My initiation came in the National Student League, which I joined in 1930... Most of its leaders were members of the [[Young Communist League]], but I was not. I preferred being a '[[fellow-traveler]],' which was how I came to be around it. I was enough of a true believer to be convinced that whatever its faults or shortcomings, only the [[communism|Communist]] movement was capable of making the 'Revolution'; a revolutionary, therefore, had to be close to it. Nevertheless, I was unwilling to give up a measure of freedom or absence of discipline, such as I could enjoy as a fellow-traveler."&lt;ref name=PrefaceIX /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Draper noted that his non-party status "may even have helped me, because it could show that one did not have to be a card-carrying Communist to hold a leading position in the NSL."&lt;ref name=PrefaceX&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership did come at a cost, however, as a decision was made by the Communist Party to distribute NSL members from City College, where the organization was strong, to other campuses where the fledgling organization had no presence.&lt;ref name=PrefaceX /&gt; Draper was instructed to enroll at the Brooklyn branch of City College, forerunner of [[Brooklyn College]], a decision which he later remembered as "one of the saddest days of my life."&lt;ref name=PrefaceX /&gt;

Draper graduated from Brooklyn College with a [[B.S.]] in [[philosophy]] in 1933; by this time, the College's National Student League organization "was so large and influential that it could virtually close down the school on [[May Day]]."&lt;ref name=PrefaceX /&gt; Upon graduation he enrolled in the graduate program in history at [[Columbia University]], which he attended for two years without taking a degree.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXI&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending a social function in 1935, Draper was approached by [[Harry Gannes]], the foreign editor of the Communist Party's newspaper, ''[[Daily Worker|The Daily Worker]].''&lt;ref name=PrefaceXI /&gt; The editor asked Ted whether he would be willing to put his prospective academic career aside and to instead come to work at the paper as his assistant.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXI /&gt; After giving the matter careful consideration, Draper decided to accept the offer and went to work at the ''Daily Worker,'' where he remained for two years as assistant foreign editor,&lt;ref name=PrefaceXI /&gt; writing for publication under the name Theodore Repard.&lt;ref&gt;Note that "Repard" is "Draper" spelled backwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1936 Draper was tapped to go to [[Moscow]] as the ''Daily Worker's'' correspondent there. He was ready to travel to Russia when he was suddenly told he couldn't leave because the party had learned that his brother, [[Hal Draper]], was a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], causing Soviet authorities to regard Ted as a security risk. The position of Moscow correspondent was subsequently offered to another ''Daily Worker'' journalist.

In 1937, Draper moved to the Communist Party's literary-artistic weekly, ''[[New Masses|The New Masses]],'' where he took a position as foreign editor and wrote for publication under his real name.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXI /&gt; The magazine sent Draper to Europe in 1938 to cover the tense geopolitical situation there. Draper spent time in [[Paris]], in [[Czechoslovakia]] covering the crisis which led to the "[[Munich Agreement]]" between [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]], and in [[Spain]] covering the last days of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=PrefaceXI /&gt;

Upon returning from Europe in 1939, Draper was approached by a new fellow-traveling publishing house called Modern Age Publishers with an offer for Ted to write a book on the European political situation.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXI /&gt; Draper used the book advance as an excuse to quit ''The New Masses'' and he headed for Paris to conduct further research.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pp. xi-xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Draper returned to the United States in November 1939, but the changing political situation — and the changing political line of the Communist Party in response to this — ultimately scrapped Draper's book project despite multiple re-writes.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXII&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1939 and 1940 Draper continued to periodically write for the ''New Masses'' on various topics at the request of the editors.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXII /&gt; With [[Fall of France|France falling]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in the summer of 1940, Draper was urgently requested to contribute an article for publication on the significance of the event.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXII /&gt; An article entitled "New Moment in France" was produced and published in the July 9, 1940 issue, in which Draper argued that the French collapse had altered the balance of power in Europe and hinted that the [[Soviet Union]] would be a likely next target of the Nazis in their pursuit of "an ever widening circle of expansion for easy booty."&lt;ref&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pp. xii-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Draper remembered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The article was delivered just before the deadline and must have gone in without much editorial deliberation. With everyone stunned by the French debacle, and no party line on it immediately established, my article had squeaked through. I was asked to write another article on the same subject for the following issue and attempted to say the same thing in even stronger form. But this time the party line caught up with me as a result of word from Moscow. The Soviet press let it be known that nothing had changed, there were no new problems or new conditions, no 'new moment in Europe.'... My second article was never published. It was the first time that any article of mine had been rejected. I was suddenly faced with the kind of personal political crisis that so many had confronted before and were to confront afterwards."&lt;ref name=PrefaceXIII&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Draper refused to write any more articles for the ''New Masses'' after that date, limiting himself to a few book reviews so as to avoid a total severing of connections with the Communist movement.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXIV&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent a six-month stint as correspondent for the Soviet news agency [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]], before joining the staff of a short-lived French language weekly newspaper based in New York City.&lt;ref name=PostObit /&gt; Despite being invited back into the fold after the June 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]] validated his earlier prognostications, Draper felt this impossible and instead worked at a series of temporary jobs to make ends meet.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXIV /&gt;

In 1943, Draper was inducted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and was thereby "saved from thinking any more about American Communism, at least for the next three years."&lt;ref&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pp. xiv-xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Draper was put to work in the Historical Section of the [[84th Division (United States)|84th Infantry Division]], ultimately writing the Division's official history of its activities during the [[Battle of the Ardennes]] in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Sgt. Theodore Draper, ''The 84th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Ardennes, December 1944-January 1945,''  Liege, Belgium: Historical Section, 84th Infantry Division, April 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 Draper also saw the publication at last of a book on French affairs, when mainstream publisher [[Viking Press|The Viking Press]] released a book by Draper called ''The Six Weeks' War.''&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Draper, ''The Six Weeks' War: France, May 10 - June 25, 1940.'' New York: Viking Press, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Draper's transition from a political journalist to a historian had begun.

===Historian===

Following World War II, Draper worked as a [[freelance journalist]], writing extensively for ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine, a new publication of the [[American Jewish Committee]], among other publications.&lt;ref name=PostObit /&gt; In 1950 he began to write for a new bi-weekly news magazine called ''[[The Reporter (magazine)|The Reporter]],'' founded by [[Max Ascoli]].&lt;ref&gt;

With the growth of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare]], the subject of communism in America began to loom large in the public consciousness. Draper began to think of writing a "traditional" history of the American Communist Party based upon documentary sources and meeting scholarly standards and slowly began work on the project in his spare time.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXV&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; He was set free to work on the task full-time in 1952 by a grant from the newly established [[Fund for the Republic]], set up as an autonomous organization by the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref name=PrefaceXVI&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of political scientist [[Clinton Rossiter]] of [[Cornell University]], the Fund for the Republic determined to publish a full-scale history of American communism. [[David A. Shannon]] of the [[University of Wisconsin]] was tapped to write the history of the CPUSA during the post-war period, while Draper was chosen to produce a monograph on the party's early years.  [[Robert W. Iverson]] wrote ''The Communists and the Schools'' (1959) in that series&lt;ref name=PrefaceXVI /&gt;

Rossiter allowed Draper two years to complete the entire project, the history of American communism from its origins in 1919 until the sacking of party leader [[Earl Browder]] at the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXVI /&gt; Draper set to work, mustering sources and conducting interviews with living participants of the formative period of the American Communist Party. One of those with whom he conducted an extensive correspondence was [[James P. Cannon|James P. "Jim" Cannon]], a midwesterner who was sacked from the organization in 1928 for supporting [[Leon Trotsky]] and the Russian "Left Opposition." Draper noted that Cannon's letters soon became "more formal, better organized, each a little gem of its kind."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Draper, "Preface" to ''The First Ten Years of American Communism.'' New York: Lyle Stuart, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; These letters of Jim Cannon to Ted Draper were ultimately published in book form as  ''The First Ten Years of American Communism'' in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Cannon,  ''The First Ten Years of American Communism.'' New York: Lyle Stuart, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Draper finished his book for Rossiter and the Fund for the Republic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Two years later, I finished a book, but not ''the'' book.... I woke up one day to realize that I had written a book which ended in 1923, a turning-point in the story.... I was faced with a problem; 1923 was too far from 1945 to make up a plausible alibi. I could not expect anyone else to know what the significance of 1923 was and why it had become my stopping-point. Yet, somehow, without intending it, I had produced a book on the formative period of the formative period; it had a beginning, a middle, and an end; it was a book I knew, if the wrong one."&lt;ref name=PrefaceXVII&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Draper turned in the manuscript to Cinton Rossiter, who was irate about the truncation of the narrative but was in great need of a publication to show that the Fund for the Republic project was alive and functioning.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXVII /&gt; The manuscript thus found print without revision as ''The Roots of American Communism'' in 1957 and Rossiter set Draper back to work for two more years to complete the rest of the assigned time period.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXVIII&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

To his own dismay, Draper repeated the stunt, terminating the second volume with the 1929 expulsion of party leader [[Jay Lovestone]] and his co-thinkers.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXVIII /&gt; Again Clinton Rossiter protested and published, with the Viking Press releasing the volume as ''American Communism and Soviet Russia'' in 1960.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXVIII /&gt;

A third volume was planned, for which Draper began assembling research material. Unfortunately, by this time the Fund for the Republic had run out of money and the story of the American Communist Party during the decade of the 1930s was left to be told by another writer at a later date.&lt;ref name=PrefaceXIX&gt;Draper, "Preface" to paperback edition of ''American Communism and Soviet Russia,'' pg. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; After several tries and failures to complete the task, Draper turned his research material over to a young scholar whose work he appreciated, [[Harvey Klehr]] of [[Emory University]].&lt;ref name=PrefaceXIX /&gt; Klehr's book, which made use of Draper's research material but to which Draper did not himself personally contribute,&lt;ref name=PrefaceXIX /&gt; was ultimately published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade.'' New York: Basic Books, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his scholarly funding dried up and his interests shifting, Draper next moved to the hot-button topic of the [[Cuban Revolution]] as a focus for his scholarship. A series of articles, books, and pamphlets ensued, marked by the 1962 tome ''Castro's Revolution: Myths and Realities,'' published by [[Frederick A. Praeger]] publishers.

Draper's work as a historian of the Cuban Revolution brought him to the attention of the [[Hoover Institution|Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace]], an anti-communist [[think tank]] located at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=TimeObit /&gt; Draper accepted a Hoover Institution fellowship and remained there until 1968, at which time he departed, ill at ease with the growing conservatism of the institution.&lt;ref name=TimeObit /&gt; Draper moved across country to accept a similar post at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] located at [[Princeton University]], where he focused his scholarship on the question of race relations.&lt;ref name=TimeObit /&gt;

Draper was a long-time contributor first to the magazine ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and later to the ''[[New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Draper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bfxu61smg2EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Introduction to the Transaction edition"] in ''The Roots of American Communism,'' [[Transaction Publishers]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Draper's later works include ''A Very Thin Line,'' a history of the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], and ''A Struggle for Power,'' a monograph on the economic and political circumstances behind the [[American Revolution]] of 1776.

===Death and legacy===

Theodore Draper died on February 21, 2006 at his home in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=TimeObit /&gt; He was 93 years old at the time of his death.

Draper's papers are housed in two locations. Materials relating to his two published books on American Communism and the Cuban Revolution are held by the [[Hoover Institution Archives]], Stanford University, [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Xiuzhi Zhou, [http://cdn.calisphere.org/data/13030/5f/tf0z09n45f/files/tf0z09n45f.pdf "Preliminary Inventory to the Theodore Draper Papers, 1912-1966,"] Hoover Institution Archives, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 63 boxes of material collected for his unpublished third book on American Communism, plus over 120 reels of [[microfilm]] and other research materials, are to be found at the [[Emory University]] Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library, [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/draper579/ "Theodore Draper research files, 1919-1970,"] Emory University Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vienna Museum''' ({{lang-de|Wien Museum}} or ''Museen der Stadt Wien'') is a group of museums in [[Vienna]] consisting of the museums of the history of the city. In addition to the main building in [[Karlsplatz]] and the [[Hermesvilla]], the group includes numerous specialised museums, musicians' residences and archaeological excavations.

The permanent exhibit of art and the historical collection on the history of Vienna include exhibits dating from the [[Neolithic]] to the mid-20th century. The emphasis is on the 19th century, for example works by [[Gustav Klimt]]. In addition, the Vienna Museum hosts a variety of special exhibitions.

== History ==
Originally known as the Historical Museum of the City of Vienna (''Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien''), its existence dates back to 1887, and until 1959 was located in the [[Rathaus, Vienna|Vienna Town Hall (''Rathaus'')]]. The first plans for a city museum on Karlsplatz date back to the beginning of the 20th century; one of proposed plans were drawn by the renowned ''Jugendstil'' architect [[Otto Wagner]]. However, not least because of two world wars, the building of the museum was postponed for several decades.

In 1953, the City Council of Vienna passed a resolution to honour Austrian president and former mayor [[Theodor Körner (Austrian president)|Theodor Körner]], on the occasion of his 80th birthday by making the museum building a reality. A design contest was organised, in which 13 architects were specifically invited to take part (including [[Clemens Holzmeister]], [[Erich Boltenstern]] and [[Karl Schwanzer]]) but which was open to any other entrants. Designs were evaluated by a jury which was chaired by the architect [[Franz Schuster]] and whose other members were the architects [[Max Fellerer]] and [[Roland Rainer]], the Vienna Director of Building, the Director of City Collections, Franz Glück, the Head of the City Department of Regulations and the Head of the Department of Architecture.

80 contestants took part and submitted a total of 96 designs. The jury awarded [[Oswald Haerdtl]] fourth place, but he was subsequently "off-handedly" contracted to design the building, which was executed in an unassuming contemporary modern style. Haertl was also responsible for the interior design, down to the furnishing of the director's office. The museum opened on 23 April 1959 as the first newly built museum of the [[History of Austria#The Second Republic (since 1945)|Second Republic]], and remained the only such for decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wien.gv.at/rk/historisch/1953/juli.html Juli 1953: Der Wettbewerb für den Museumsneubau], Wien im Rückblick {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wien.gv.at/rk/historisch/1953/november.html November 1953: Museum der Stadt Wien: Die erste Besichtigung der Wettbewerbsentwürfe], Wien im Rückblick {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Historical Museum repeatedly distinguished itself with its exhibitions. In 1985, under director Robert Waissenberger, it presented the ''[[Jugendstil]]'' exhibition ''Traum und Wirklichkeit'' (Dream and Reality) at the [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]] on the opposite side of the square; with more than 600,000 visitors, one of the most successful exhibitions ever held in Vienna.

In 2000, the courtyard was roofed over. In 2003, under the direction of [[Wolfgang Kos]], the museums of the City of Vienna were united under the umbrella name of Vienna Museum and the Historical Museum was renamed Vienna Museum. In early 2006, the foyer was renovated and in addition, new exhibition space was created in what had been a storage area.
[[File:Wien - Museum Karlsplatz, Schauraum.JPG|thumb|One of the exhibition rooms]]
The main building of the museum presents a mix of historical and art exhibits with the intent of offering the visitor a cross section of the development of the city, from its beginnings in the Neolithic through the Roman camp of [[Vindobona]] up to the 20th century. In addition to the permanent exhibits, there are frequent special exhibitions.

A memorandum of understanding and cooperation was signed in January 2000 with the [[Nagoya City Museum]], establishing it as a partner museum.&lt;ref&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nagoya_City_Museum_%284%29.JPG&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hermesvilla ==
[[File:Hietzing (Wien) - Hermesvilla.JPG|thumb|[[Hermesvilla]]]]
Since 1971, exhibitions have been presented in the [[Hermesvilla]], a former imperial residence in the [[Lainzer Tiergarten]] in the west of Vienna which [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] had built for his wife [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Empress Elisabeth]] in 1882&amp;ndash;86. Under former mayor [[Bruno Marek]], the building was restored by the Association of Friends of the Hermesvilla and subsequently taken over by the city. The permanent exhibition is dedicated to the history of the building and the imperial couple, who spent a few days there each year until Elisabeth's death. In addition, special exhibitions are mounted on a wide variety of themes in cultural history.

==Special museums==
===Otto Wagner Pavilion on Karlsplatz===
[[File:Wien - Karlsplatz, Otto-Wagner-Pavillon (3).JPG|thumb]]
Since 2005, a permanent exhibition on the life and work of [[Otto Wagner]] has been on show in this former [[Vienna Stadtbahn]] building.

The building was constructed in 1898 as one of a pair of ''Jugendstil'' pavilions on either side of the square as part of the construction of the Stadtbahn in the 1890s; Otto Wagner was the contract designer of the system. During the planning in the 1960s for the new [[Vienna U-Bahn]] nodal station at [[Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station|Karlsplatz]], the two pavilions were saved from demolition, dismantled, restored, and put back in place in 1977 after completion of the construction work in the square. They no longer serve any transport purpose.

===Otto Wagner ''Hofpavillon'' at Hietzing===
[[File:Hietzing (Wien) - Hofpavillon.JPG|thumb]]
The ''Pavillon des k.u.k. Allerhöchsten Hofes'' (Pavilion of the royal and imperial court) in [[Hietzing]] near [[Schönbrunn Palace]] was built in 1899 to Otto Wagner's design as a special station for the use of the Emperor and members of his court when using the Stadtbahn. It was not included in the original plans for the Stadtbahn, but Wagner began construction on his own initiative and was finally able to win over the Minister for Railways, [[Heinrich von Wittek]]. In contrast to the other Stadtbahn stations, this pavilion with its cupola has [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] elements, which could be interpreted as a sign of respect for the Emperor on the architect's part. It was built at the inbound end of the platform at the [[Hietzing (Vienna U-Bahn)|Hietzing station]], which opened in 1898; originally there were steps linking it to the public platforms.

The Emperor is only known to have used the station on two occasions: in 1899 when he opened the lower Vienna Valley line on the Stadtbahn (between Meidling Hauptstraße and Hauptzollamt) and in April 1902. Today the imperial waiting room and study and other rooms in the building are on permanent display.

===Prater Museum===
The Prater Museum is located in the [[Prater]] park, in the [[Vienna planetarium|planetarium]] building near the [[Wiener Riesenrad|Ferris wheel]]. It presents the history of Vienna's largest amusement park, the [[Wurstelprater]], with exhibits such as an old mechanical fortune-teller and coverage of [[dark ride]]s and [[sideshow]]s. The museum was founded in 1933 by the teacher and local historian [[Hans Pemmer]] in his home and donated in 1964 to the City of Vienna, which built the present museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dasmuseen.net/Wien/BezMus03/page.asp/2633.htm Prof. Hans Pemmer, der unermüdliche Volksbildner] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419082600/http://www.dasmuseen.net/Wien/BezMus03/page.asp/2633.htm |date=2014-04-19 }}, Bezirksmuseum Landstraße, Die Wiener Bezirksmuseen, Museen.net {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Clock Museum===
[[File:Wien - Uhrenmuseum, Portal.JPG|thumb|upright|Entrance to Clock Museum in [[Palais Obizzi]]]]
The Vienna Clock Museum in the [[Palais Obizzi]] in the [[Innere Stadt]], founded in 1917, is one of the most important of its kind on Europe. On the ground floor are displayed the collections of the museum's first and long-time director, [[Rudolf Kaftan]], and of the poet [[Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach]]. During the Second World War, the "House of Ten Thousand Clocks", as it is also known, was closed and attempts were made to disperse the valuable clocks for safety to various castles in [[Lower Austria]], with only partial success. After the war, work began on rebuilding the collection; thanks to funds from the City of Vienna and private donations, it has been possible to add a few additional rarities to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wien.gv.at/rk/historisch/1947/juni.html Juni 1947: Das Haus der zehntausend Uhren], Wien im Rückblick {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion collection library===
The Vienna Museum has a fashion collection in [[Meidling]], adjacent to the [[Vienna School of Fashion]] at [[Schloss Hetzendorf]]. This is not open to the public, but the public may use the attached library, consisting of over 12,000 volumes and numerous periodicals, photographs and approximately 3,000 engravings on the subject of fashion.

==Musicians' residences==
The Vienna Museum includes numerous residences in which notable composers lived, were born and died, which are largely in original condition and intended to afford the visitor insight into the artists' everyday lives. Exhibits include music manuscripts, but also objects they used.

===Mozart residence===
The rooms in the [[Mozarthaus Vienna]] in Domgasse, near [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], are the only one of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s residences in Vienna to have been preserved (and the original furnishings have not been preserved). Mozart lived here from 1784 to 1787, during which time he composed, among other works, his opera ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', for which reason the house is also known today as the Figaro House. The flat has been open to visitors for decades; it was reopened in early 2006 after renovation. The house has several floors of exhibition space including objects such as the desk at which Mozart supposedly composed ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.

===Beethoven residence in Heiligenstadt===
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the summer of 1802 in a house in [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]], which at the time was a suburb of Vienna. There was a [[spa]], where Beethoven attempted to reduce or cure his increasing deafness. During this stay, he worked on compositions including his [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second Symphony]], but also&amp;mdash;in an episode of depression and despair about the state of his hearing&amp;mdash;composed his [[Heiligenstadt Testament]]. According to oral tradition, the house was Herrengasse 6, now Probusgasse 6; this is however disputed, since at the time there were no registration records for the suburbs of Vienna and Beethoven's own letters do not mention the address.

===Eroica House===
The Eroica House is a memorial to Beethoven's stay in [[Oberdöbling]] in the summer of 1803, during which he composed a large part of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|''Eroica'' Symphony]]. However, Beethoven never stayed in the house. Josef Böck-Gnadenau misidentified the building, because he was unaware that the houses were re-numbered in 1804, rather than 1802. In 1872, [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]] had identified the correct house: Hofzeile 15, which no longer exists.

===Pasqualati House===
In 1804&amp;ndash;08 and 1810&amp;ndash;14, Beethoven lived at the house of his patron Johann Baptist Freiherr von Pasqualati on the ''Mölker Bastei'' (Mölk Bastion, a remnant of the old city walls) in the [[Innere Stadt]]. Here he composed, among other works, the [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth Symphonies]], ''[[Für Elise]]'', the ''[[Archduke Trio]]'' and his only opera, ''[[Fidelio]]''. Since Beethoven's actual flat in the north section of the fourth floor has a tenant, the next-door flat is on show as the Beethoven exhibit.

===Haydn House===
[[File:Haydn-Haus.jpg|thumb|Haydn House, around 1840]]
In 1793, [[Joseph Haydn]] acquired the house which is now Haydngasse 19 in [[Mariahilf]], and lived there until his death in 1809. The original address was Kleine Steingasse 71 (changed in 1795 to 73), and it was located in the hamlet of Obere Windmühle, which was part of the outlying town of Windmühle but was almost entirely surrounded by the larger town of Gumpendorf and was part of its [[parish]]. Here Haydn composed, among other works, the oratorios ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]''. In 1862, the street was renamed for its most famous residents, and the house has been a memorial since 1899 and a museum since 1904. In one of the rooms, [[Johannes Brahms]]' composing desk is on display. In 2009, the 200th anniversary year of Haydn's death, the permanent exhibition was recast and enlarged; it emphasises the composer's last years.

===Birthplace of Franz Schubert===
[[File:Alsergrund (Wien) - Schuberthaus (1).JPG|thumb|Schubert birthplace in [[Alsergrund]]]]
[[Franz Schubert]] spent the first four and a half years of his life in this house in Nußdorfer Straße in [[Alsergrund#District sections|Himmelpfortgrund]] in what is now [[Alsergrund]], the 9th district of Vienna. One important exhibit is Schubert's 'trademark' glasses. The house also has on display approximately 50 paintings by [[Adalbert Stifter]], who was better known as an author.

===Schubert's deathplace===
Schubert spent only the last two and a half months of his life in his brother Ferdinand's flat in Kettenbrückengasse in [[Wieden]], where he died in 1828. Exhibits include his last drafts of compositions and a copy of the last letter he wrote by hand, to [[Franz von Schober]].

===Johann Strauss residence===
The flat in Praterstraße in [[Leopoldstadt]] was the residence of [[Johann Strauss the Younger]] in the 1860s. Here he composed among other works the ''[[The Blue Danube|Blue Danube]]'' waltz, whose first notes traditionally inaugurate the New Year for the Viennese.

==Archaeological excavations==
The Vienna Museum includes a number of archaeological sites which document various periods in the history of the city. All are located in the [[Innere Stadt]].

===Michaelerplatz excavations===
[[File:Wien.Hofburg10.jpg|thumb|[[Michaelerplatz]] excavations]]
Archaeological excavations in the [[Michaelerplatz]] between 1989 and 1991 uncovered among other things the settlement of Canabæ associated with the Roman camp at [[Vindobona]]. This will have consisted primarily of the residences of soldiers' wives and children. The excavation site was made permanently accessible to the public in 1991; the design of the presentation is by architect [[Hans Hollein]].  

===Vergilius Chapel===
The [[Vergilius Chapel]] near [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] was built around 1250, but in the 14th century became a crypt for a wealthy family. In 1732 the cathedral graveyard was abandoned and in 1781 the adjacent Chapel of [[Mary Magdalene|St. Mary Magdalene]] burnt down, following which the Vergilius Chapel was filled in and eventually forgotten. It now lies approximately 12 metres under the [[Stephansplatz, Vienna|Stephansplatz]] and was rediscovered in 1973 during the building of the [[Vienna U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]; it is now integrated into the [[Stephansplatz (Vienna U-Bahn)|Stephansplatz station]] and can be reached from there.

===Museum of the Romans===
[[File:Wien - Römermuseum, Untergeschoß.JPG|thumb|Remains of a [[hypocaust]] from a Roman house at Museum of the Romans]]
In the [[Hoher Markt]] north of [[Stephansplatz, Vienna|Stephansplatz]], excavated ruins of houses which served as officers' quarters in [[Vindobona]] are on display, together with exhibits of ceramic ware, gravestones and other objects which illuminate life 2,000 years ago in the Roman camp and attached town. This museum annexe, previously known as the "Roman Ruins", was expanded and reopened in May 2008 as the Museum of the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.orf.at/stories/276416/ "Die Römer kommen nach Wien"], [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] 10 May 2008 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman ruins under fire headquarters===
In the cellar of the fire headquarters in [[Am Hof]] are the remains of a main drainage canal which once carried effluent from the southern section of the Roman camp to the brook which is now the street [[Tiefer Graben]]. Preserved in original condition, they were discovered in the 1950s during excavations for the foundations when the fire headquarters, destroyed by World War II bombing, were being rebuilt. At a depth of almost 3&amp;nbsp;metres, ruins of a wall of the Roman camp, a wall tower, part of a street which ran beside the wall and an approximately 5&amp;nbsp;metre stretch of the canal below the wall were uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wien.gv.at/rk/historisch/1958/juli.html Juli 1958: Ein römischer Kanal unter der Feuerwehrzentrale], Wien im Rückblick {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neidhart frescoes===
The Neidhart [[fresco]]es are in a 14th-century building in [[Tuchlauben]] and are the oldest surviving secular wall paintings in Vienna. The cycle of paintings were executed in 1398 on the walls of a then banqueting room on a commission from the wealthy merchant Michel Menschein. For the most part they show scenes from the life of the [[minnesinger]] [[Neidhart von Reuental]]. They were discovered in 1979 under a layer of plaster when the building was being renovated, and have been on view to the public since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgenkunde.at/veranstaltungen/ausstellungen/neidhart_fresken/neidhart_fresken.htm Neidhart Fresken], Burgenkunde.at {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gershoni was born in [[Rishon LeZion]] in 1943. He began his military service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in 1961, and became an officer in the [[Israeli Combat Engineering Corps|Combat Engineering Corps]]. In November 1969, while a Captain in the Engineering Corps, he was severely injured while trying to dismantle a mine operated from a distance, which exploded, severely injuring him.
